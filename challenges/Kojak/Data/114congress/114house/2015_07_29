The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, predictably, Congress is sidestepping \nthe transportation funding issue for the 34th time with yet another \nshort-term extension, this one until the end of October.\n  No nation has become great building its infrastructure 3 months, 8 \nmonths, 10 months at a time. This is a symbol of the failure of \nCongress and the last two administrations to deal meaningfully with the \nneed to rebuild and renew America.\n  Our country is falling apart as we fall behind. We all can remember \nthe days when the United States had the finest infrastructure in the \nworld. Well, those days have long since passed. By any objective \nmeasure, we are now down about 25th in the world, and we continue to \nfall further.\n  This failure has consequences for Americans every single day. The \naverage damage to a car is over $500 a year in maintenance costs due to \npoor road conditions, more than $125 billion a year to the economy with \ncongestion, being stuck in traffic.\n  Because of poor road conditions, infrastructure failures, and an \ninability to keep pace with growth, there are people being killed and \ninjured every day across America. It doesn't have to be this way.\n  The failure to get a 6-year reauthorization, which we haven't had \nsince 1998, is due to one simple fact: Congress is still trying to pay \nfor 2015 infrastructure with 1993 dollars.\n  The solution is simple. Over three dozen Members of Congress have \ncosponsored legislation to raise the gas tax for the first time in 22 \nyears, legislation that is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nAFL-CIO, local government, transit, environmentalists, contractors, the \nlargest collection of groups supporting any major issue before \nCongress.\n  It is a solution that was advocated by President Ronald Reagan when \nhe led the effort in his administration to raise the gas tax 125 \npercent. It is a solution that has been embraced by six red Republican \nStates already this year.\n  The latest failure to slide into the end of October could actually be \nour salvation. I have personally lobbied President Obama to call for an \nend to this charade. The President believes in infrastructure and every \nyear has offered up an approach from his perspective.\n  I would urge the Congress and all of us to draw one final red line. \nThis October 31 deadline ought to be it. Let Congress stew. Let things \ngrind to a halt if we don't do our job.\n  The gas tax legislation is already written and can be approved if the \nWays and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee would deal \nwith it for a week.\n  It is a simple one-page bill. It is not necessary to tie ourselves in \nknots. And then, if we give a number to the authorizing committee, in a \nmatter of weeks, they can develop that 6-year bill that would make such \na difference.\n  We could meet the President's deadline, have this done once and for \nall, put hundreds of thousands of people to work at family-wage jobs \nall across the country, improving the quality of life, making our \ncommunities more livable, our families safer, healthier, more \neconomically secure, and stop playing with gimmicks that highlight our \ndysfunction.\n  Let's prove to the American public and, more importantly, to us that \nwe can actually function the way things were designed, using a user fee \nthat is perfectly attuned to road needs that have served us well for \nover half a century.\n  So, please, Mr. President, why don't you make it clear that you are \ngoing to call an end to this charade. Give Congress 3 more months to do \nour job. It doesn't need any more.\n  We operate from cliff to crisis. Deadlines are simply an alarm clock \nto get started. Well, this particular alarm clock could start ticking \nnow if you are calling a halt to our continued irresponsibility.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n\n[[Page H5596]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5596-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            IRAN-NORTH KOREA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, a bad deal is a bad deal under a \nRepublican President or a Democratic President. This Iran nuclear deal \nis a bad deal because we have seen this movie before. We know how it \nends.\n  I have repeatedly stated that Iran has been following the North \nKorean playbook on exactly how to extract concessions from the United \nStates and the international community while simultaneously continuing \nto improve its nuclear program, expand its infrastructure, and support \nits illicit activities.\n  Many analysts have made the same observations, including Alan \nDershowitz in a Jerusalem Post article last week.\n  It is not just how the process unfolded and how the international \ncommunity fell for the tricks of the rogue regimes that are so scary.\n  Because, obviously, Iran saw North Korea as having been the victors \nin its battle over its nuclear program; so, naturally, it would want to \nreplicate that.\n  But it is alarming and striking just how similar the rhetoric is \nbetween President Clinton's announcement of a nuclear agreement with \nNorth Korea and President Obama's announcement of a nuclear agreement \nwith Iran.\n  Let's look at the similarities that Mr. Dershowitz noted between \nPresident Clinton's remarks in 1994 and President Obama's from earlier \nthis month. Then, Mr. Speaker, it will be easy to understand why so \nmany of us oppose this nuclear deal.\n  In 1994, President Clinton said that the North Korea agreement will \nmake the U.S., the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer. Earlier this \nmonth President Obama said that this deal will bring about change that \nmakes the U.S. and the world safer and more secure.\n  In 1994, President Clinton assured the world that the North Korea \ndeal ``does not rely on trust. Compliance will be certified by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.''\n  Last week President Obama proclaimed, ``This deal is not built on \ntrust. It is built on verification.''\n  President Clinton predicted--as we now are painfully aware, \ninaccurately--that the North Korea agreement would be ``a crucial step \ntoward drawing North Korea into the global community'' and predicted \nthe end of the rogue regime's isolation.\n  Similarly, last week's statement poses that the Iran deal ``offers an \nopportunity to move in a new direction'' because we have taken a \ndifferent path that ``leads to more integration into the global \neconomy, more engagement with the international community, and the \nability of the Iranian people to prosper and thrive.''\n  And, of course, there was the spurious promise to an ally to assuage \nthem that we didn't just put their national security in jeopardy.\n  First, President Clinton reaffirmed our commitment to protect South \nKorea. Now, President Obama, already knowing that Israel vehemently \nobjects to this deal and feels as though this gives Iran--an \nexistential threat to its existence and a regime that has promised to \nwipe the Jewish state off of the map--the ultimate weapon to achieve \nits goals, promises to ``continue our unprecedented effort to \nstrengthen Israel's security, efforts that go beyond what any American \nadministration has done before.''\n  Not only are these empty words, Mr. Speaker, but they are \ndisingenuous to boot.\n  When the North Korea deal was reached, one of the most significant \nflaws was that it failed to dismantle any of North Korea's nuclear \ninfrastructure.\n  The deal was designed merely to delay the North Korean bomb, not \nprevent it. That is what this nuclear deal with Iran is designed to do.\n  We saw what happened with North Korea, and we can be sure that Iran \nplans to follow suit.\n  The totality of this deal hinges on a bet by the administration and \nthe rest of the P5+1 that the Iranian regime will see the error of its \nways and wants to be part of the global community and forsake its \nsupport for terror and other illicit behavior.\n  That is a dangerous gamble to make with U.S. national security, and \nit is not a gamble that I or any one of us should be willing to take.\n  That is why, Mr. Speaker, we must reject this deal and demand a \nbetter deal or else reimpose the sanctions and use the only thing, the \nonly tactic, that Iran understands--strength--to force it to abandon \nits nuclear ambitions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5596-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5596-H5597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PUERTO RICO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I spoke about Puerto Rico's \ndebt crisis and how there must be a sense of urgency because, without \naction, bondholders will be paid, but teachers, cops, and nurses won't.\n  I want to continue today and make two points. Number one, let's not \nlet bondholders bleed Puerto Rico at a discount. Number two, let's work \ntogether on what unites us, not what divides us.\n  Because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of \nPuerto Rico come together to make a plan and demand that the Congress \nof the United States work with Puerto Rico on Puerto Rico's plan.\n  Without consistent and persistent pressure from Puerto Rico, \nWashington will do nothing, as both the administration and the Congress \nare content to let the bondholders on Wall Street call the tune.\n  We all know Washington should start with H.R. 870, the bankruptcy \nbill. It is simply a bill that will allow Puerto Rico to declare \nbankruptcy and restructure its debt within the U.S. legal system.\n  This would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a \ncourt of law. It is an important step, but will not solve all of Puerto \nRico's problems.\n  What Puerto Rico should do right now is demand to know what Wall \nStreet vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds.\n  We hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on \nthe dollar, yet the bond owners want a full dollar's worth of interest.\n  I say Puerto Rico should pay interest based on the price the \nbillionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount, \njust as a congressman does in this Congress every time we make an \ninvestment.\n  Then Puerto Rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy \nthe debt. I came here to protect people, not the profits of \nbillionaires on Wall Street.\n  Secondly and most importantly, for the time being, we must set aside \npolitics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in \nPuerto Rico.\n  Whether Puerto Rico should be a State, an independent nation, or \nremain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this \nCongress.\n  If everyone leaves Puerto Rico--and they are leaving by 5,000 a \nmonth--it will not matter what kind of government is left behind.\n  Mr. Speaker, nobody should use the current debt crisis as an \nopportunity to score political points for their party.\n  At a time when the people of Puerto Rico must be clear, precise, and \nunified, the status issue divides Puerto Ricans.\n  I read in The New York Times the argument of the Resident \nCommissioner of the Statehood Party that the only solution to Puerto \nRico's problems is to make it a State.\n  Really? That is going to solve the debt crisis? The power crisis? The \npublic employees' pension gap crisis? The Medicare Advantage budget \ncrisis?\n  We should be working together to figure out how Puerto Rico is going \nto pay teachers and honor their pensions, how we will make sure health \ncare is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse. A statehood bill \nis not going to provide housing, create a job, or heal a sick child.\n  When Members of Congress ask me about Puerto Rico, they ask me: Which \nis it? Is it statehood? Do you want a bankruptcy bill? Do you want more \nMedicaid?\n  We have to prioritize. We have to be clear and put aside the status \nissue. Please, we need to work together.\n  I would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action \nin Spanish.\n\n[[Page H5597]]\n\n  (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)\n  Politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing \nWashington to help resolve Puerto Rico's debt crisis.\n  Puerto Rico must have a common plan that has support across all of \nthe parties, and most importantly, across the Island.\n  The Governor must find a way to work with the Resident Commissioner \nand the Resident Commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign \ntool for higher office.\n  Puerto Rico will only be helped by this Congress if and when there is \na consistent and persistent call on Congress by Puerto Ricans to act. \nAnd Puerto Ricans need to specify what they expect Congress to do.\n  The Bankruptcy Bill is only part of it. If we still have the Jones \nAct and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now, we will \nnot advance.\n  The people must tell Wall Street that Puerto Rico is not some store \nto be looted and that the Puerto Rican people will not sit and starve \nas Wall Street counts its profits.\n  If Wall Street is buying bonds at a discount, they should be paid at \na discount.\n  But most importantly, we have to work together for the betterment of \nPuerto Rico. And we cannot let political divisions over statehood \ndivide us.\n  I commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about Puerto \nRico's status and working with other Puerto Ricans in the Congress and \nother leaders in both Parties who will help us. But we must first come \ntogether, begin helping ourselves, and have a clear plan.\n  La politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de \nobligar a Washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de \nPuerto Rico.\n  Puerto Rico debe de tener un plan comun que cuente con el apoyo de \ntodos los partidos y sobre todo, a traves de la Isla.\n  El Gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el \nComisionado Residente y el Comisionado Residente no puede ver esta \ncrisis como una herramienta en sus campanas para un puesto mas alto.\n  El Congreso solo ayudara a Puerto Rico siempre y cuando haya un \nllamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquenos exigiendo que el \nCongreso cumpla. Y los puertorriquenos tienen que indicar lo que \nesperan de parte del Congreso.\n  La Legislacion de Bancarrota es solo una parte. Pero si todavia \ntenemos la Ley Jones y la misma economia y perspectivas economicas que \ntenemos ahora no avanzaremos.\n  El pueblo debe decirle a Wall Street que Puerto Rico no es una tienda \npara ser pirateada y que el pueblo de Puerto Rico no esperara a morir \nde hambre mientras Wall Street cuenta sus ganancias.\n  Si Wall Street esta comprando bonos con descuentos, deben ser pagados \ncon descuentos.\n  Pero sobre todo, tenemos que trabajar juntos por el bien de Puerto \nRico. Y no podemos dejar que las divisiones politicas sobre la \nestadidad nos dividan.\n  Me comprometo como siempre lo he hecho a poner a un lado mis propios \nsentimientos sobre el estatus de Puerto Rico y a trabajar con otros \npuertorriquenos en el Congreso y otros lideres en los dos Partidos que \nesten dispuestos a ayudarnos. Pero primero tenemos que unirnos, empezar \na ayudarnos a nosotros mismos, y tener un plan claro.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Holding) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nfamily business in my home State of North Carolina.\n  When Southern Piping Company opened in 1965, it had two employees and \na loan from the Small Business Administration. The two employees were \nPeggy Williford and her husband, Buren, who was one of the first \nlicensed mechanical contractors in North Carolina--SPC, a classic \nfamily business, with all three of Peggy and Buren's sons--Chris, Mark, \nand Tim--continuing to lead the company.\n  Since 1965, the Willifords and the SPC family have weathered \nrecessions and hard times, and over the years, through good old-\nfashioned hard work, they have grown.\n  Starting with one office in Wilson, SPC has expanded their plumbing, \nheating, and air-conditioning business to four offices statewide, and \ntheir SPC trucks are a familiar sight on the roads across North \nCarolina, but the biggest story is the family they have built through \nSPC, today providing jobs to 450 people.\n  When it came to building the company, Buren Williford always had a \ncommonsense philosophy. He said: ``Successful companies look for like-\nminded people to do business with.''\n  Today, Southern Piping Company is adopting a new name--SPC \nMechanical--to more accurately describe its growth and success. The \nWilliford family still practices the old-fashioned principles of \nintegrity, safety, and giving back to their community, for example, by \noffering young employees scholarships to attend nearby Barton College.\n  This year represents a landmark for the Williford family. They have \nnow been in business for 50 years. It is my pleasure today to recognize \nthe accomplishments of Peggy and Buren Williford.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5597-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5597-H5598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING CONNIE JEAN HUMPHREY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hinojosa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise to recognize my \nlongtime chief of staff, Connie Jean Humphrey, who is retiring after a \nlong and distinguished career on Capitol Hill.\n  It is an honor and a privilege to recognize Connie's many years of \nservice and achievements. She has proven herself as a talented and \ndedicated public servant, who has made innumerable contributions in the \nservice of my constituents residing in Texas' 15th Congressional \nDistrict along the Rio Grande Valley.\n  Connie has compiled a long list of accomplishments throughout her \ncareer and as a senior member of my staff, and she has earned an \nimpeccable reputation on Capitol Hill among her peers and my colleagues \nin the Texas congressional delegation with whom she has worked very \nclosely in support of our mutual objectives for our great State of \nTexas.\n  Connie brought an array of talents and experience as my chief of \nstaff. She has a thorough understanding of Federal policy, particularly \nin the areas of health care, education, transportation, the \nenvironment, and on women's issues.\n  She is fluent in many other policy areas important to my constituents \nin the valley, and she has been an invaluable source of guidance and \ncounsel during my appointments on the House Education and the Workforce \nCommittee, as well as on the Financial Services Committee.\n  Connie approaches her position as the leader of my office with the \ntraining and detail-oriented scrutiny of an attorney, who graduated \nfrom the University of Maryland, and with the policy expertise of a \ncongressional aide who served in staff leadership positions for nearly \nthree decades.\n  She was instrumental in helping me lead the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act of 2010, which is aiding organizations like Workforce \nSolutions, based in McAllen, Texas, and is committed to the success of \nthe employers and workforce of the Rio Grande Valley by matching them \nwith skilled, productive employees and upgrading the skills of their \ncurrent workforce.\n  Connie has been particularly effective in helping me address urgent \nneeds in deep south Texas. Latino students aspiring to attain the dream \nof a college education are that much closer to realizing their hopes, \nthanks to Connie's involvement, resulting in passage of the Higher \nEducation Opportunity Act and the student loan and healthcare \nreconciliation bill of 2010, among the largest investments in higher \neducation since the GI bill, particularly for Latino- and minority-\nserving higher education institutions in our country.\n\n[[Page H5598]]\n\n  This crucial legislation also created an unprecedented healthcare \nsystem that complements the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nof 2010 that Connie also played a major role in helping shepherd \nthrough the Education and the Workforce Committee, and that is now \nproviding millions of Americans with affordable health care who \npreviously had no coverage.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with much more than coincidence that the high \nschool graduation rate in my congressional district has accelerated--\nfrom 55 percent to 85 percent--during Connie's tenure as my chief of \nstaff.\n  This sharp increase has lifted up a generation of young Latinos, who \nare making significant contributions to our communities and regional \neconomy; and it is a direct result of Connie's advocacy and leadership \ncontributing to the passage of each of these four aforementioned bills.\n  These public laws constitute my collection of framed legislation in \nmy congressional office that I was very proud to pass as either \nchairman or ranking member of the Higher Education and Workforce \nTraining Subcommittee with Connie at the helm of my office.\n  I am also indebted to Connie for her tireless efforts in helping me \nfacilitate two new international land bridges designed to stimulate \ncommercial activity, economic growth, and stability to the Rio Grande \nValley.\n  Her intimate knowledge of transportation policy was a key element in \nthe process culminating in the approval of Presidential permits that \npaved the way to open the Donna-Rio Bravo and the Anzalduas \nInternational Bridges.\n  Similarly, Connie was influential in securing $300 million in Federal \ninvestments for floodway levee improvements along the Hidalgo County, \nTexas, and Mexican borders.\n  We still remember the impact of Hurricane Dolly in 2008 that brought \nbetween a foot and 15 inches of rain to the Valley. Hurricane Ike \nfollowed shortly thereafter, with storm surges as high as 20 feet and \ncaused almost $20 billion in damages.\n  My district would have been more highly susceptible to damage and our \nresidents even more imperiled if the levees were breached by a \nhurricane or heavy rains without this assistance. As a result, hundreds \nof millions of dollars' worth of property were spared during the \nlandfall of Hurricane Alex in 2010, when the Rio Grande River crested \nto a record of 59 feet.\n  In the wake of economic crisis, Connie led my team in preparing our \ncommunities to apply for assistance that ultimately received over half \na billion dollars for Hidalgo County alone under the ARRA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am saddened to lose Connie as a trusted and beloved \nmember of my staff, but I am happy for her as she embarks upon a new \nendeavor as the senior vice president of public and community relations \nand special counsel of the Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, where she \nwill continue to serve my constituents and be uniquely positioned to \nhelp the hospital deliver and expand the reach of health care to \nunderserved communities and economically disadvantaged families.\n  I wish to, again, thank Connie Humphrey for all of her hard work, \nsteadfast commitment to the people of south Texas, and for her skillful \nmanagement of my staff and congressional offices.\n  On behalf of the 15th Congressional District of Texas, I congratulate \nConnie for her excellent service and for a job very well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5598-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          25TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday was a \nspecial and historic day. It marked 25 years since the Americans with \nDisabilities Act was signed into law.\n  The ADA has had a profound impact on our country and its citizens. It \nspeaks to the best about our country; toward forming a more perfect \nunion, it aims to provide equal opportunity for those who have a \ndisability.\n  This anniversary, I feel, allows us to reflect on something that \nunites us; that is it is estimated that one in five Americans is living \nwith a disability. Disabilities affect individuals in every \ncongressional district in this country, in every State, in every \nneighborhood. It touches the lives of everyone--race, gender, income. \nNo demographic is exempt from disability.\n  This law provides hope for those who have a disability and offers \npromise that opportunities exist for self-fulfillment.\n  On both a philosophical and practical level, it stands for the \nproposition that providing reasonable accommodations to those with a \ndisability is how a civil society addresses an imbalance borne through \nno fault of the individual.\n  The law and its legislative, regulatory, and judicial progeny enables \nus to address issues such as public transportation, housing, education, \nand social services in a more thoughtful, proactive, effective, and \nhumane way. While there is no doubt that substantial progress has been \nmade, I am not here on the House floor to say that our work is done--\nbecause it isn't.\n  Thanks to the law, about 50 million Americans have been helped, and \nthat doesn't include their families and loved ones who can point to how \nlaws do matter and can make a positive impact.\n  Let's focus on the challenges that we still confront that relate to \naccess and opportunity on holding up the standard of self-sufficiency \nfor individuals with a disability and looking at how public policy can \nbe shaped to help achieve this standard for disabled Americans. The \ncrux is often that time between ending in the classroom and looking for \nemployment opportunity.\n  Just yesterday, I met with Abilities in Motion, a Berks County \norganization in my district that provides outstanding services to \nindividuals and families in Berks County.\n  During our discussion, I heard from individuals and parents who, \nthrough grit and determination, were able--and are able--to navigate \nthe complex maze of programs and services and funding streams to \ncoordinate caregivers, transportation, and employment in the \npostacademic world.\n  Let's focus on streamlining and better integrating these programs and \nfunding streams, and let's focus on encouraging job opportunities for \ndisabled individuals who want to work and build a meaningful career.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Let's also focus on improving transportation options so that \nindividuals who want to work are able to get to work without \ndifficulty.\n  Let's continue to set forth and advance good policy, like the ABLE \nAct from the last Congress, which will encourage individuals and \nfamilies to save tax-free dollars to help finance the costs associated \nwith disabilities.\n  I am grateful for the tireless work of Abilities in Motion and other \norganizations that serve families and individuals in my district, such \nas the National Federation of the Blind, The Arc Alliance, the \nDisability Rights Network, and the Pennsylvania Statewide Independent \nLiving Council. These organizations, their employees, and their \nvolunteers work day in and day out to improve everyday lives.\n  Last, let's also thank the families who sacrifice for their loved \nones who have disabilities, and let's recognize the courage and the \nhard work of those who have disabilities as they endure every day to \nbecome self-sufficient. It really speaks to what is great about this \ncountry.\n  Everyone out there who suffers from a disability and who wakes up \nevery day with optimism and purpose, you are to be commended. You are \nthe American success story.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the past 25 years, the ADA has increased \naccessibility and has empowered millions of Americans with \ndisabilities. It is important to acknowledge the progress, but it is \nalso important to recognize that there are still challenges that we \nshould address from a public policy perspective. We must continue our \nefforts, in a bipartisan manner, to advance policy that keeps us a step \nahead and that meets the needs of disabled Americans today and \ntomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5598-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5598-H5599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RICKETY PATCHWORK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H5599]]\n\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, work on the Nation's bridges, highways, and \ntransit has all but stopped because of 34 patch extensions that keep \neverything--except patchwork--on hold.\n  Today, the House is rushing out of town early, leaving a new 3-month \npatch. This time, though, the Republican House is scrambling out of the \nCapitol, literally, to get away from the Republican Senate, which had \nbeen trying for a 6-year bill. The Republican House's ``my way or the \nhighway'' was addressed to the Republican Senate, and the public be \ndamned--and it worked. The Republican Senate has given up on the \nNation's infrastructure, too. The Republican Senate announced this \nmorning that it will accept the House's 3-month patch. Six months of \ncontrol of the House and Senate by the Republicans has made Congress \neven more dysfunctional.\n  The new House 3-month patch has nothing to do with roads and bridges. \nWho knows what will get done this time? House Republicans see political \ngoals at the end of their 3-month road, when the must-pass highway bill \ncould serve their purposes, such as the usual, if dangerous, dispute \nover an extension of the debt ceiling.\n  Yet, Republican and Democratic States alike keep meeting their \nobligations under the State-Federal partnership. Eighteen States and \nthe District of Columbia have raised their gas user fees, going as high \nas 10-cent increases in Iowa and in Wyoming; but the roads, bridges, \nand transit remain stalled because the Federal partner keeps dropping \nout. More than half of the funds for a nationwide system that connects \nour States with one another comes from the Federal trust fund.\n  During the 34 patch delays, not a lick of work on a final bill has \nbeen done except the Senate's current try at a 6-year bill. There have \nbeen no serious talks here on alternatives to the gas user fee, \nalthough it long ago was swallowed by today's hard-won fuel efficiency \nthat leaves the transit trust fund thirsty for a refill after a year \nand a half or so.\n  Democrats, however, have offered four alternatives to the current \nuser fee, which is the legacy of the Eisenhower years. House \nRepublicans have offered none. Congress has refused to raise the \nFederal user fee since 1992, adding to the woes of the 1950's method we \nuse to pay for our roads.\n  The Republican House runs out of town today to hide from the \nRepublican Senate. As they run home, I can only hope they run into the \narms of their own angry constituents on their own rickety roads. House \nRepublicans can run, but they can't hide from the broken down bridges, \nroads, and transit they will use back home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5599-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEMAND FOR TRANSPARENCY IN THE REGULATORY AND RULEMAKING PROCESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to address a concern \nthat anyone who has ever owned or has run a business truly \nunderstands--the negative effects of unchecked government regulations \non our American economy.\n  No matter how large or small, Federal regulations are being added \neach day into law by the hundreds--and even sometimes by the \nthousands--most of which are not directly approved by Congress.\n  By allowing Washington bureaucrats to continue to stuff the \noverwhelming number of regulations into congressionally passed \nlegislation, we are essentially handing over authority to the Federal \nagencies for them to legislate as they please. It is our job in \nCongress to oversee these regulations as they are being generated in \norder to provide that our constituents are not left behind.\n  During this Congress, we have made great strides in reforming the \nregulations process in order to help the economy grow. A great example \nof that occurred yesterday with the passage of the REINS Act. There \nshould be no question that any regulation that makes an annual impact \nof $100 million on the economy should require congressional approval \nbefore it can become law.\n  As my colleagues are aware, a copy of the day's Federal Register is \ndelivered to each of our offices daily. This book provides a hard copy \nof every new regulation that ranges from environmental protection to \nlabor standards, to health guidelines, to restrictions on financial \ninstitutions.\n  Last year, the Federal Register contained over 77,000 pages, with \n3,554 new regulations. Even though this large number of pages is \nabsurd, it was only the sixth highest page count in the Federal \nRegister's history. As of this morning, the 2015 Federal Register sits \nat over 45,000 pages.\n  It is unthinkable to me that the most important document--the \nConstitution--can fit on 39 pages, in this little book. In comparison, \nthis is the July 13 edition of the Federal Register. It is 627 pages, \nand it is only one of three editions from that day alone.\n  Mr. Speaker, when is enough enough, and when does it become too much?\n  The continual expansion of our government through a vast number of \nregulations causes our economy to become as shaky and unstable as the \nFederal Registers that are stacked up in my office from this year, \nwhich is unacceptable and very concerning.\n  An even larger issue comes from how the general public is made aware \nof these proposed rules and the opportunity to voice one's concerns on \nthe rules. While we are provided with a daily index of rules and new \nregulations through the Federal Register, the American taxpayers, for \nwhom we work, are left in the dark.\n  Since these regulations do not take into account the economic impact \nthat is placed on American businesses and families, each new regulation \ncan lead to lower wages, job losses, and higher prices for goods. In \n2014, Federal regulations cost American families an estimated $1.88 \ntrillion in financial burden, representing, roughly, $15,000 per \nhousehold. This cost is also larger than Canada's economy, is larger \nthan Mexico's economy, and is larger than the economies of Australia, \nRussia, Spain, and South Korea, just to name a few. In fact, the \neconomies of only nine nations in the world are larger than the cost of \nour regulations.\n  Although all sized businesses and industries feel the effects of \ngovernment regulations, it is the small businesses that face greater \nadversity from regulations due to costs attributed to comply. In \naddition to compliance costs, limited comment periods, and a lack of \ninformation pertaining to how they make their opinions heard, business \nowners are usually those who end up being left out in the cold.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in demanding more transparency in the \nregulatory and rulemaking process because it is our duty to our \nconstituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5599-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5599-H5600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GIVING SENIORS A MEDICARE BIRTHDAY PRESENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Grayson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago this week, President Lyndon \nJohnson signed the law that created Medicare and Medicaid--the most \nimportant healthcare programs in our country's history prior to the \nAffordable Care Act. With one stroke of his pen, President Johnson \nguaranteed both poor Americans and older Americans the right to high-\nquality, affordable medical treatment.\n  Thanks to Medicare, for 50 years now, our seniors have received the \nhealth care they have needed to stay healthy and to live full lives; \nbut despite the success, there are gaps in Medicare coverage that need \nto be closed. The most glaring gap is the fact that Medicare does not \nprovide basic medical coverage for seniors' eyes, ears, and teeth. It \nis as though Medicare assumes that seniors don't need to see or to hear \nor to chew.\n  We are not talking about exotic, high-tech treatments. We are talking \nabout no Medicare coverage for eyeglasses, eye exams, hearing aids, \ncavity fillings, and dentures. We are talking about no treatment for \nmedical conditions that lead to blindness, deafness, lost teeth, and \nserious gum disease, which has been strongly linked to heart disease. \nIt is unthinkable that we deny our seniors this elementary level of \ncare.\n\n[[Page H5600]]\n\n  There are 2.7 million seniors in America who are blind. How many of \nthem would be able to see today if they had received simple annual eye \nexams as part of their Medicare coverage?\n  Medicare is a promise that we make to ourselves--the young to the \nold, one generation to the next. The promise is that, after you reach \nyour 65th birthday, your medical needs will be met. To keep that \npromise, our seniors have paid into the system, in some cases for a \nhalf a century, before they receive a single earned benefit. They \ndeserve the best care we can provide for them.\n  This week, to honor the 50th anniversary of this lifesaving program \nwe call Medicare, I am introducing the Seniors Have Eyes, Ears, and \nTeeth Act. This bill will amend title XVIII--the Medicare provision of \nthe Social Security Act--to repeal the arbitrary exclusion of \neyeglasses, eye exams, hearing aids, hearing exams, and dental care \nfrom Medicare coverage. Two short lines in the U.S. Code have barred \nthat coverage for 50 years. I simply delete those lines. I urge my \ncongressional colleagues to enact this quick, easy, and necessary \nreform.\n  Medicare should provide health coverage for every part of your body, \nincluding eyes, ears, and teeth. Over 50 million Americans enjoy \nMedicare coverage. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Medicare, let's \nguarantee to 50 million Americans the health care they need in order to \nlook into the eyes of the ones they love, to see our Fourth of July \nfireworks each year, and to hear it when freedom rings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5600-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1045\n                 EMBRACE TRADE OPPORTUNITIES WITH ASIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Paulsen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this summer Democrats and \nRepublicans came together to pass a trade authorization bill that set \nthe standards for any trade deal that the United States negotiates with \nother countries.\n  It guarantees oversight by Congress, it guarantees transparency for \nthe public, and it guarantees that our negotiators have the opportunity \nto get the best deal for our workers, our farmers, our ranchers, and \nour employers.\n  This week trade negotiators from 12 different countries around the \nPacific Rim are meeting in Hawaii for negotiations with the Trans-\nPacific Partnership. It is a deal that will open doors for American \nbusinesses to sell their products overseas and create jobs right here \nat home.\n  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is this: 95 percent of the \nworld's consumers live outside of the United States; 80 percent of the \nworld's purchasing power is outside of the United States.\n  We need to allow our American companies to compete and to be able to \nsell their products and goods and services or we will fall behind.\n  In addition, these negotiations will allow America to act as a \ncounterweight to the growing influence of China in the region.\n  If the United States doesn't write the rules for the global economy, \nChina will step in and write them, and it won't be to the benefit of \nAmerican workers and businesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, while Congress and the American people should and will \nvet any deal that results from the current Trans-Pacific Partnership \nnegotiations, it is important to understand what a successful agreement \nwill mean here at home.\n  For starters, it means boosting pay and higher wages. That is because \njobs that rely on trade pay 18 percent higher than those jobs that \ndon't. It also means boosting job growth right here in America. That is \nbecause one in five jobs are tied to trade.\n  In Minnesota, Mr. Speaker, 775,000 jobs are currently supported by \ntrade, and new trade with Asia will enhance and support that \nopportunity to build on new success.\n  It also means boosting our country's small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses. In Minnesota, 90 percent of these small businesses are the \ncompanies that export goods and services.\n  Now, that being said, there is still a lot of work that needs to be \ndone by our negotiators to make sure they reach an agreement that is \nbest for the American people. We need cooperation from the other \ncountries that are involved in these negotiations.\n  Canada needs to step up to the plate on tariff and quota issues \ndealing with their dairy and their egg industries. Japan needs to step \nup on agriculture issues.\n  Progress still needs to be made to ensure that American intellectual \nproperty is protected. However, with commitment from our trading \npartners, I am confident that we can overcome these remaining hurdles.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need trade deals where everyone benefits and everyone \nfollows the rules. We live in an interconnected world, and we should be \nembracing opportunities that open more markets for American goods and \nservices.\n  It is time to show the world that America will continue to lead the \nway in the 21st century global economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5600-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5600-H5601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REMEMBERING DIRECTOR ROBERT PARKER OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY POLICE \n                               DEPARTMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wilson) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. \nI am deeply saddened by the death of former Miami-Dade County Police \nDirector Robert Parker. I extend my sincerest sympathies to his family \nat this difficult time.\n  Director Parker was a friend and a true humanitarian. Throughout his \ncareer in law enforcement with the Miami-Dade County Police Department, \nhe was committed to making south Florida a safer place to work, to \nlive, and to visit. He was well respected and celebrated, and he fought \nto create opportunities for men and women of color.\n  As a longtime mentor and leader of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence \nProject, Director Parker worked closely with me to save at-risk \nminority boys and young men.\n  His impact is evident by the thousands of success stories of Role \nModel boys who, under his mentorship, have gone on to college and \nthriving careers. The 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project in south \nFlorida owes Director Parker a huge debt of gratitude.\n  Director Parker testified before Congress on behalf of violence in \nthe Black community. He testified before Congress about the tragic \ndeath of Trayvon Martin. He went on to be featured on CNN, MSNBC, and \nall of our local TV shows.\n  Because of his knowledge, he went on to serve as a consultant for \ncities all over this country. Our boys and our community were so very, \nvery proud of this wonderful role model.\n  Mr. Speaker, Director Parker adored his family, his sweet, sweet \ngrandchildren, his daughter, Kalika, his son, Robert, Jr., his son, \nKyron, and his devoted wife and the love of his life, Veronica.\n  Our great Nation has lost a patriot who lived to embody the \nprinciples of equality, justice, and freedom upon which America is \nfounded. To fully understand our loss, you must first understand the \ntreasure that we all shared in Director Parker.\n  Director Parker showed a bright intellect and caring nature, growing \nup as a child in the rural community of Monticello, Florida.\n  He bravely served in the United States Army. He joined the Miami \nPolice Department in 1976, when it was still known as the Dade County \nPolice Safety Department. He was a bright and eager young officer who \nwanted to make his community safer.\n  Mr. Speaker, Director Parker was an officer's officer. He worked \nhard, and he made great sacrifices for his career through the love and \nsupport of his family.\n  He enjoyed a storied rise up the ladder of police leadership because \nof his determination to solve crimes. He was affectionately called \n``Bobby'' by his friends and colleagues, but he was also nicknamed \n``Marathon Man.''\n  He famously earned that name by giving a foot chase to catch one of \nthe most notorious thieves in Miami-Dade County history.\n  The suspect had consistently eluded capture because he was too crafty \nand fast for most officers, but not too fast for Robert Parker.\n  His determination is what set him apart from others. He did not view \nhis\n\n[[Page H5601]]\n\nresponsibility to his community as an adjective, something that was \nhard or tedious. However, he saw it as a verb. It was something that he \nhad to do.\n  He was never concerned about the spotlight or awards, but his dutiful \nnature and bravery made it almost impossible to deny him recognition.\n  Mr. Speaker, Director Parker's service to south Florida and our \nNation had an underlying theme that permeated everything he did: his \nlove for his community.\n  He understood that the best police officers are not the police who \nwore the badges, but the best police officers were the people who paid \ntheir mortgages, who sent their kids to school, and who worked hard to \nbuild their community.\n  Residents were always quick to ignore the false notion of no \nsnitching and gave Director Parker information that solved crimes.\n  His sense of community and respect eventually led to his promotion to \ndirector of the Miami-Dade Police Department in 2004. His appointment \nwas historic by his being the very first African American to hold that \npost, and he opened the door for many others to follow.\n  Dade County has the largest police force in the southeast United \nStates, leading over 4,700 sworn and civilian employees.\n  As director, he worked to create a more diverse agency and create \nopportunities for minorities and women. He was an exemplary leader and \neven earned the respect of the police union.\n  He retired in 2009 after 33 years. Our mentors look up to him. His \nabsence will create a huge void.\n  Mr. Speaker, America has lost an iconic law enforcement officer. His \nlegacy will live in the hearts of all of us forever. My remarks will be \nentered into the official Congressional Record, and they will then be \npermanently placed in the Library of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5601-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has agreed to without amendment a concurrent resolution \nof the House of the following title:\n\n       H.

The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, responsible use and \nrecycle of coal ash has the ability to reduce waste, provide \nconstruction materials, and keep utility costs low.\n  This past April the EPA released yet another rule aimed at coal by \nmandating new standards for the disposal and storage of coal combustion \nresiduals.\n  As a result of this proposal, the House considered and passed H.R. \n1734, the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2015. \nThis legislation codifies the base standards of EPA's final proposed \nrule, while also giving flexibility to the States to implement.\n  Specifically, H.R. 1734 will allow States to create and enforce their \nown coal ash recycling permit programs. It also sets up enforceable \nState permit programs while utilizing the EPA's minimum requirements \nand will protect 316,000 jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, States also have the option to make their requirements \nmore stringent than the EPA's final rule if they choose. I strongly \nsupport and was happy to vote for H.R. 1734 and the responsible use of \ncoal and coal ash.\n\n\n              Pennsylvania Hemlocks and the Woolly Adelgid\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, recently I visited the \nTionesta Research Natural Area of the Allegheny National Forest. This \nold-growth area is home to many 600-year-old hemlock trees.\n  During this visit, Mr. Speaker, I spoke to forestry officials about \nefforts to fight the woolly adelgid. I even applied a treatment \ndesigned to combat the invasive insect to one of these massive trees.\n  Mr. Speaker, many States are involved in the effort to fight the \nadelgid, which originated in Japan and was first found in the United \nStates in the early 1950s. It can kill a hemlock tree within a few \nyears after it becomes infested.\n  In 2012, I teamed with Federal researchers and those from my alma \nmater, Penn State University, at a forum I hosted to discuss efforts to \nsave our State tree, the Eastern Hemlock.\n  As the chairman of the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee, I am \nproud Pennsylvanians are among those leading the way in fighting this \ndisease and protecting our forests and the economic stimulus that these \nforests provide both through timber and through tourism, making sure \nthat these magnificent trees which have stood for centuries will stand \ntall for future generations.\n\n\n                    Special Needs Trust Fairness Act\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, July 26, we \nmarked the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  The passage of this landmark legislation signified a commitment to \neliminating barriers faced by millions of individuals with differing \nlevels of disability.\n  It required businesses, buildings, transportation, and other services \nto accommodate those living with disabilities and guaranteed equal \nopportunities for workers with disabilities.\n  Mr. Speaker, 25 years later it is apparent that we have made \ntremendous strides in upholding the intent of this vastly important \ncivil rights law.\n  Today countless Americans are empowered to shape their own lives and \nplan their own futures as they experience their daily obstacles \ndecreasing over time. While we have so much to celebrate, there is \nalways more progress to be made.\n  This Congress I introduced the Special Needs Trust Fairness Act with \nthe goal of eliminating a current prohibition on a person with a \ndisability to create his or her own special needs trust.\n  This long overdue legislative fix was recently passed by the Senate \nFinance Committee, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to \nguide this and similar measures through the legislative processes here \nin the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5601-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5601-H5602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, we are on a dangerous \npath. First, my Republican colleagues pulled two critical appropriation \nbills from the floor simply because their party cannot come to an \nagreement on a flag that represents a very dark time in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Second, my colleagues across the aisle, rather than focusing their \nenergy on passing comprehensive immigration reform, passed a poisonous \nanti-immigrant bill in response to an isolated incident in the city of \nSan Francisco, pulling money away from our law enforcement funding for \npublic safety.\n  Then they refuse to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which helps \nensure that Americans' businesses can compete with their global \ncompetitors.\n  And now the House Republicans refuse to come to the table yet again \nto provide a robust, long-term funding bill for our decaying \ninfrastructure system in America.\n\n[[Page H5602]]\n\n  Why do we continue to refuse and cut services that our communities \nneed? The American people need good-paying jobs, safe and modern \ninfrastructure, and efficient transportation in order to provide a \nbetter life for themselves and for their families. We need to end these \nstopgap extensions.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  How do we fix a broken bridge or a broken highway? Two months of \nhighway funding will not do that. In my home State of California, 60 \npercent of our roads are in poor or mediocre condition; and, moreover, \nalmost 30 percent of California's bridges have been recognized by the \nDepartment of Transportation as structurally deficient.\n  Just a little bit over a week ago, California residents experienced \nthe real-life consequences of this statistic when the Interstate 10, \nwhich connects California and Arizona, collapsed, injuring a resident \nand shutting down the highway for several days. This highway is \ncritical to our Southwest economy, which is already suffering from \ndeficiencies because of our water infrastructure and the drought that \nwe have going on.\n  With more than 60,000 bridges throughout the United States in need of \ndrastic repairs, failing to provide Americans with a long-term highway \nbill, we are putting jobs at risk, and we are putting our lives at \nrisk, which is why my fellow House Democrats have come together to \nprovide a 6-year funding bill known as the GROW AMERICA Act. The bill \nwill provide for $178 billion over 6 years, so that States and local \nmunicipalities can address critical infrastructure needs.\n  This commonsense legislation would help pay for the investments by \nending an unfair tax loophole and limiting corporate inversions, \nmeaning that big corporations, when they are renouncing their United \nStates citizenship, they do that in order to avoid paying taxes.\n  Let's use that money for transportation investments here in America. \nInvesting in local public transportation projects not only helps to \nimprove our traffic flow, but it also helps create good jobs.\n  As we look for ways to put our economy back on track, we must be \nmindful of the services that we provide to the American people. We need \nto stop slashing, and we need to start providing. We need to get away \nfrom sequestration and patchwork funding mentality to actually fulfill \nour duty as public servants to the American people.\n  Our families, our roads, and our economy deserve a highway funding \nbill that will invest in America's future, invest in better \ninfrastructure, and invest in bigger paychecks for our hard-working \nfamilies who are trying to make it in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5602-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Posey) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on matters of research and \nscientific integrity.\n  To begin with, I am absolutely, resolutely provaccine. Advancements \nin medical immunization have saved countless lives and greatly \nbenefited public health.\n  That being said, it is troubling to me that, in a recent Senate \nhearing on childhood vaccinations, it was never mentioned that our \ngovernment has paid out over $3 billion through the National Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program for children who have been injured by \nvaccinations.\n  Regardless of the subject matter, parents making decisions about \ntheir children's health deserve to have the best information available \nto them. They should be able to count on Federal agencies to tell them \nthe truth.\n  For these reasons, I bring the following matter to the House floor. \nIn August 2014, Dr. William Thompson, a senior scientist at the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, worked with a whistleblower \nattorney to provide my office with documents related to a 2004 CDC \nstudy that examined the possibility of a relationship between the \nmumps, measles, and rubella vaccine and autism.\n  In a statement released in August 2014, Dr. Thompson stated: ``I \nregret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant \ninformation in our 2004 article published in the Journal of \nPediatrics.''\n  Mr. Speaker, also quoting Dr. Thompson:\n\n       My primary job duties while working in the immunization \n     safety branch from 2000 to 2006 were to lead or colead three \n     major vaccine safety studies. The MADDSP MMR-Autism Cases \n     Control Study was being carried out in response to the \n     Wakefield Lancet study that suggested an association between \n     the MMR vaccine and an autism-like health outcome.\n       There were several major concerns among scientists and \n     consumer advocates outside the CDC in the fall of 2000 \n     regarding the execution of the Verstraeten study.\n       One of the important goals that was determined upfront in \n     the spring of 2001 before any of these studies started was to \n     have all three protocols vetted outside the CDC prior to the \n     start of the analyses so that consumer advocates could not \n     claim that we were presenting analyses that suited our own \n     goals and biases.\n       We hypothesized that if we found statistically significant \n     effects at either 18- or 36-month thresholds, we would \n     conclude that vaccinating children early with MMR vaccine \n     could lead to autism-like characteristics or features.\n       We all met and finalized the study protocol and analysis \n     plan. The goal was to not deviate from the analysis plan to \n     avoid the debacle that occurred with the Verstraeten \n     Thimerosal study published in Pediatrics in 2003.\n       At the September 5 meeting, we discussed in detail how to \n     code race for both the sample and the birth certificate \n     sample. At the bottom of table 7, it also shows that for the \n     nonbirth certificate sample, the adjusted race effect \n     statistical significance was huge.\n       All the authors and I met and decided sometime between \n     August and September 2002 not to report any race effects for \n     the paper. Sometime soon after the meeting, where we decided \n     to exclude reporting any race effects, the coauthors \n     scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the \n     study.\n       The remaining four coauthors all met and brought a big \n     garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went \n     through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we \n     should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.\n       However, because I assumed it was illegal and would violate \n     both FOIA and DOJ requests, I kept hard copies of all \n     documents in my office, and I retained all associated \n     computer files.\n       I believe we intentionally withheld controversial findings \n     from the final draft of the Pediatrics paper.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe it is our duty to ensure that the documents \nDr. Thompson provided are not ignored; therefore, I will provide them \nto Members of Congress and the House committees upon request.\n  Considering the nature of the whistleblower's documents, as well as \nthe involvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is \nwarranted.\n  I ask, Mr. Speaker, I beg, I implore my colleagues on the Committee \non Appropriations to please, please take such action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5602-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5602-H5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE REINS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House passed a measure I \ncosponsored, H.R. 427, known as the REINS Act, to end this \nadministration's disregard for the separation of powers.\n  The bill rightly reasserts Congress' proper role in writing our \nNation's laws by requiring that any regulation written with a \ncumulative impact of over $100 million be reviewed and approved by \nCongress before going into effect, instead of the stifling of \ninnovation that we have seen the effects of.\n  Too often, we have seen this administration attempt to use creative \ninterpretation of the law or aggressive rulemaking that have had a \nmassive negative impact on our State's economy, resulting in higher \nprices, thousands of dollars per cost additionally per family per year, \nlower wages, fewer working hours, or complete loss of job opportunities \naltogether.\n  For example, the proposed waters of the United States regulation \nwould insert the Environmental Protection Agency in local land use \nplanning areas across the Nation.\n  Do we really need the Federal Government telling us how to landscape \nour own backyards? Is that even proper? I think not.\n\n[[Page H5603]]\n\n  Do we really think the Federal Government should be regulating \nmanmade ditches along country roads or fields or dry streambeds and \npuddles which hold water only during and immediately after rainstorms \nor irrigation and drainage ditches which wouldn't even exist if not \ncreated by water districts and the people involved?\n  What a giant leap of grab of power by the Federal Government in \nasserting itself over these private properties via these regulations \nwritten by bureaucrats and not overseen by Congress directly.\n  In my district, Federal bureaucrats are unilaterally deciding, with \nno evidence or science, that small depressions in fields are linked to \ndistant waterways, placing vast areas of land out of production. \nDespite bipartisan congressional opposition, the administration is \nattempting to move forward with this aggressive regulation, waterways \nof the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, the examples of this administration's aggressive and \ncareless decisions, increasing costs, eliminating jobs are almost too \nnumerous to count.\n  In 2014, Federal regulations cost our economy $1.88 trillion in \nhigher prices for food, energy, and goods, averaging about $14,000 per \nU.S. household. This price tag has spiked, thanks to the President \nObama administration, which added nearly 500 new regulations, 184 of \nwhich have combined to raise costs to Americans of about $80 billion. \nThe result is 81 new major regulations per year.\n  Mr. Speaker, unelected bureaucrats shouldn't be imposing their will \non the American people at a cost of billions of dollars each year. This \nis not the way to stop the difficult headwinds our economy faces. \nIndeed, this is causing more economic problems for us to recover from \nin this Nation.\n  It is time for the Senate to join the House and send H.R. 427, the \nREINS Act, and help with our job economy, with the boost we all need--\nthat we have needed for so long during this last 6 years. The REINS Act \nis needed to indeed rein in an out-of-control government.\n  Even the President himself said in his State of the Union Address in \nJanuary 2011:\n\n       To reduce barriers to growth and investment . . . when we \n     find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we \n     need to fix them.\n\n  The REINS Act is that fix. Let's get it done. Let's get the Senate to \nget it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5603-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STORIES IN THE NEWS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great privilege, first of \nall, to speak about the first item of interest to America and to many \nof us as certainly when the President represents the United States of \nAmerica overseas. I had the privilege of traveling with the President \nfor a most dynamic, unique, and historic mission, and that was to Kenya \nand Ethiopia.\n  Let me congratulate him for a stupendous diplomatic success and \ninteraction with a continent that will be the largest populated land \narea in the 21st century. What an amazing experience to be able to \nengage with businesses and see the opportunity for economic empowerment \nand cooperation between the United States and the many nation-states of \nthe continent of Africa.\n  It was exciting to see new, young businesspersons seeking an \nopportunity to work in their countries, but work with the United \nStates, eager to work with U.S. businesses, welcoming U.S. investment, \ncreating jobs in Africa, creating jobs in America--in particular, a \nbroadcasting company that had been there for 50 years creating jobs in \nthe United States, creating jobs in Kenya.\n  Let me indicate what a success this story was. Along with the \nregional security issues, there was a commitment with the African Union \nto stand against Boko Haram and a commitment to establish civility and \npeace in South Sudan by demanding that there be a resolution of this by \nAugust 17--not the President standing alone, but working with the \nAfrican Union, representing the tens upon tens of African nations, it \nwas a resounding success, and I congratulate the President.\n  As I come home and as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary, I \nam reminded of the tragedy of a young woman who had all of her life \nbefore her, and that was Sandra Bland.\n  My commitment still is to offer my appreciation to the law \nenforcement officers across America and, as we all do, respect law and \norder; but in the instance where there is a tragic result, the death of \nthis young woman, 28, with two undergraduate degrees and a master's \ndegree, her death was the result of malfeasance.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  We must walk together in a respectful manner with law enforcement and \ncivilians. We have done it before. We must do it again.\n  I believe that it is crucial for the Department of Justice to take \nover this investigation on a number of aspects, including patting down \nand other practices of law enforcement in Waller County and Hempstead, \nand certainly the question of this young lady's civil rights.\n  I ask that they look seriously, because even though there are alleged \ngood intentions by the local authorities in establishing committees to \nreview this, this is not regular order, this is not a procedure that \nworks. No one understands the decision of a district attorney--unless \nhe yields to an independent prosecutor, which this district attorney in \nWaller County is not--to have a committee of individuals with no \nauthority whatsoever review this matter.\n  People and families are in pain. Certainly, we can do better as law \nenforcement and civilians working together.\n  I also want to recognize that this is the 50th year of the Voting \nRights Act. I join the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer, and Mr. \nClyburn in celebrating and acknowledging this exciting time that opened \nthe doors of voting for everyone. One vote, one person.\n  On August 6, I call upon my community in the 18th Congressional \nDistrict in Houston to have a voting day--registering people to vote in \na nonpartisan manner, bringing them out and celebrating the right to \nvote, when many countries do not have it.\n  Let's make the Voting Rights reauthorization the cause of this \nCongress. Let's have Americans celebrate voting rights.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say this. While I was in Africa, one of \nthe headlines was the killing of Cecil, a beautiful lion. The nations I \nvisited were falling to their knees because they believe in wildlife \npreservation. We enjoy it here in our Nation's zoos. We haven't had \nthat privilege of seeing these wonderful animals--giraffes, lions, \ntigers, and a whole array--in the wild.\n  It was an American who killed this beautiful lion. What a disgrace. \nThat individual is a disgrace. This individual had the responsibility \nfor knowing of his guides and of the procedures of doing this kill for \nsport. He lured the animal out of the park.\n  America must stand with Kenya, Ethiopia, and the other African \nnations in showing its outrage. Sadly, it was a citizen of the United \nStates who was more interested in his personal privilege and pleasure \nthan he was in understanding this iconic lion--the last male species of \nthis kind, with a black mane and a giant of a personality--and helping \nto preserve this species. He couldn't find any other joy than killing \nCecil. I am saddened by this, and America should be saddened as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5603-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5603-H5604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SKIP WELLS, A HERO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Tom Price) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, sometimes the terrorism we \nwitness in this day and age is a world away. Sometimes it occurs very \nclose to home.\n  Two weeks ago, terror visited Chattanooga, Tennessee, and, in so \ndoing, hit home for us in Georgia. One of the five servicemen murdered \non July 16 in Chattanooga grew up in the Sixth District of Georgia. He \ngraduated from Sprayberry High School in 2012. Skip Wells was a \nmarine--a proud marine, a proud American, and a hero.\n  Last week, in Georgia, thousands gathered to honor the life of this \npatriot, Skip Wells, who lost his life in the terrorist attack in \nChattanooga.\n\n[[Page H5604]]\n\nNothing we say will replace the loss, the heartbreak, and the pain of \nhis family and friends, those who knew him best. But we can say how \nmuch heroes enlighten us--and inspire us--and strengthen the faith of \nour Nation and our lives.\n  Skip Wells is a hero. It has been said that ``a hero is someone who \nhas given his life to something bigger than oneself.'' That is \nprecisely what Skip did.\n  His closest friends said that Skip Wells felt called to serve, to \nprotect. When asked why Skip joined the Marines, a friend of Skip's \ntold folks simply that ``Skip just loved his country.'' He knew that \nfreedom isn't free. He knew that liberty requires sacrifice. What an \ninspiration his dedication and his heroism are for all of us.\n  Chesterton said that ``the true soldier fights not because he hates \nwhat is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.'' \nSkip Wells loved his family, his friends, the Marines--oh, how he loved \nthe Marines--and he loved his country.\n  His death in the service of this great Nation places him in the ranks \nof those with the greatest of valor. On behalf of all who represent \nthis Nation, we send our deepest and heartfelt thanks and sympathy to \nSkip's family and friends on their tragic loss. We all--every single \nAmerican--mourn for those who make the ultimate sacrifice for this \ngreat land.\n  The Bible says: ``Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be \ncomforted.'' In its broadest sense, this verse is so very, very true. \nIn the book of John, we read: ``Greater love has no one than this, that \none lay down his life for his friends.''\n  To his mom, Cathy, to his friends and family, you may be very, very \nproud of Skip and his ultimate sacrifice to our country. May God's \ngrace comfort you in this difficult time. Please know that a grateful \nNation loves you and mourns with you.\n  May we never, ever, forget Skip Wells and the great men and women who \nstand in harm's way every single day and protect this, the greatest \nNation on Earth. May God bless us all, and may he continue to bless the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5604-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HURRICANE ANDREW ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart \nto recognize the 24th of August as the 23rd anniversary of Hurricane \nAndrew. On this date in 1992, the category 5 storm made landfall on \nElliott Key, and then Homestead, Florida, killing 26 immediately, with \ndozens more fatalities from injuries stemming from the storm's \naftermath. We continue to mourn this loss of life.\n  The winds of Hurricane Andrew were calculated at 164 miles per hour \nand completely wiped out Homestead Air Force Base. Until Hurricane \nKatrina in 2005, Andrew was the costliest storm in U.S. history, \ntotaling $43.7 billion when adjusted for inflation.\n  As officials assessed the damage, they noticed that much of the \ndestruction was due to substandard construction methods. As a result, \nFlorida now has the strongest building codes in the Nation. \nFurthermore, homes are now required to have storm shutters or impact-\nresistant glass.\n  While we will never be able to fully prevent damage from a serious \nstorm, we can mitigate the damage caused and thus reduce the costs of \nrebuilding our neighborhoods.\n  The National Hurricane Center, located at Florida International \nUniversity in my congressional district, provides important research on \nthe effects these storms have on our coastlines and maintains a \ncontinuous watch on developing weather patterns that could become a \ntropical storm. I was able to tour this center earlier in the year, and \nI commend their efforts.\n  The memory of Andrew forces us to remain cautious and vigilant so our \ncommunities and homes are protected. In the midst of this hurricane \nseason, I strongly encourage all those in the potential paths of these \nstorms to have a plan already in place to secure property and protect \nloved ones. By taking the appropriate preventative measures, we can \nassure that our families and neighborhoods remain safe.\n\n\n                      Key West Terrorist Detained\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my sincere \ngratitude to the brave law enforcement officials who prevented a \nterrorist plot from unfolding in Key West.\n  On July 28, it was announced that a Key West man was arrested and \ncharged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. Key West \nis the southernmost point of not only my congressional district, but \nthe entire United States. Anyone who has visited the Keys knows how \ntruly special this part of our country is, not just for its natural \nbeauty, but for the welcoming and creative people who call the Keys \nhome.\n  A terrorist attack occurring anywhere in the United States is a cause \nfor serious alarm, and I am glad the efforts of one lone wolf were \nthwarted.\n  It is important to recognize the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys Office, the \nSouth Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Key West Police \nDepartment, the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, and other law \nenforcement agencies for working together to neutralize this threat to \nKey West and our country. Because of their efforts, an untold number of \nlives were saved.\n  Unfortunately, this incident reminds us that we continue to be \ntargeted by those who wish to do us harm. We must remain vigilant \nagainst these ongoing threats and ensure our law enforcement agencies \ncontinue to have the necessary resources to execute their critical \nmission.\n\n\n                      Miami Dade College/Job Fair\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank all those who \nattended the job fair in my district office hosted last month for \nemployers and workers in the Kendall area of south Florida. We were \nable to connect over 1,000 of our friends and neighbors who are looking \nfor work with hundreds of businesses, agencies, and nonprofit \norganizations. The feedback was positive from countless participants \nwho said they were able to collect resumes from well-qualified \npotential candidates for job opportunities.\n  One of my main priorities here in Congress is helping those who are \nmost in need, and events like this job fair are an excellent way for \nour communities to come together and find opportunities for people with \nall sorts of different skill sets.\n  I would also like to give special thanks to Miami Dade College for \nhosting this terrific event. They provide excellent opportunities to \nsouth Florida residents who are looking to further their education and \nlearn new skills to enhance their job credentials.\n  I am also very proud to note that Miami Dade College was recently \nnamed a ``great college to work for'' for the seventh consecutive year \nby the Chronicle of Higher Education.\n  South Florida is fortunate to have a strong network of business \nleaders who work closely with educational institutions to help people \nfind work. Every job is an opportunity, and today we celebrate the \nconstituents in my district who have found gainful new employment as a \nresult of the job fair at Miami Dade College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5604-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5604-H5605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING JENNA McGIVNEY, LOC TEACHER INSTITUTE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to cosponsor \nthe Employee Rights Act, introduced by Chairman Tom Price, which \nestablishes protections for American workers--to not join a union; to \nhave a secret ballot; and, if they choose to join a union, to know how \ntheir dues are being spent. This legislation is critical to empowering \nAmerican workers and shielding them from unfair treatment in the \nworkplace.\n  South Carolina is a staunch defender of right-to-work protections, \neven when threatened by the National Labor Relations Board. For years, \nthe NLRB has threatened to destroy jobs, particularly in the Charleston \ncommunity. It has invaded employee privacy and encroached upon their \nrights.\n  I am grateful for Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Tim Scott, Governor \nNikki Haley, and South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson for their \nleadership in protecting our State's right-to-work laws.\n  Right-to-work States like South Carolina have seen firsthand that job \ncreation and economic growth come from expanded freedoms. We need to \nexpand commonsense reforms like those in the Employee Rights Act to \nprotect American workers and create jobs.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5605-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Where barriers exist, so, too, do the opportunities \nto remove them, thanks to the protections and accommodations afforded \nunder the ADA.\n  We have come far since the passage of the ADA, but we still have much \nmore work ahead.

He \nplayed football for Southern University. As well, he was drafted in \nWorld War II, where he saw action with the United States Army in \nNormandy, in northern Africa, and during the Battle of the Bulge.\n  After the war, with his honorable discharge, Edward Thomas became one \nof the first African American police officers in the city of Houston--\nwhen he started, he could not vote without a poll tax--where he worked \nfor 63 years until his retirement on July 23, 2011. He worked for more \nthan six decades, way before the civil rights movement.\n  His work was not without challenges. Because of his work and because \nof his race, Officer Thomas was not allowed to drive a squad car or \narrest White suspects without obtaining permission from his supervisor.\n  At one point in his career, he was disciplined for speaking to a \nWhite meter maid, who asked him to walk with her in order to avoid the \nunwanted attention and advances of nearby construction workers, just \nextending himself and doing his job.\n  I am excited about him having his name on the 26-story headquarters \nbuilding, and I would offer to say that, to this great leader, I will \nbe coming home to present you with a number of resolutions and honor.\n  I know that he wants the Voting Rights Act reauthorized because he \ncouldn't vote then, but now, he stands as the longest serving police \nofficer and one of great service.\n  I salute you, Edward Alfred Thomas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5606-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MILITARY CHAPLAINS\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.

Why on \nEarth would the President make an agreement that includes secret deals \nbetween Iran and the U.N. agency which is doing the inspections that no \nAmerican, including him, will ever see?\n  It is beyond my comprehension.

Yet, today, this House is scheduled to adjourn for the next 5 \nweeks, refusing to bring this urgent public health matter to the House \nfloor, refusing to address gun violence, which is hurting America.\n  I have joined with colleagues from across the aisle to propose a \nbipartisan bill to expand background checks to all commercial gun \nsales--legislation that, if enacted, would have prevented several of \nthe most recent mass shootings.\n  I urge the leadership of this House to spend August thinking about \nthe 30,000 Americans we lose each year to gun violence and to bring \nthis urgent matter to the full House for a vote when we reconvene in \nSeptember.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5608-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN SUPPORT OF THE SOLDIER ACT\n\n  (Mr. NUGENT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. NUGENT.

This is more than a decade later, and the first she is \nhearing about it is in a letter, demanding payment. Moreover, the \nservicemember is expected to track down and find whatever receipts or \ndocuments may be relevant from 11 years ago.\n  This isn't an isolated case. This is happening to veterans across \nthis Nation. Often, these bills are the result of DOD accounting or \nsystem errors. Certainly, if there were an error, whether it be the \nfault of the servicemember or of the DOD, steps should be taken to \nremedy that; but the government should not wait a decade before sending \nthe first letter.\n  I am introducing a bill today that would place a statute of \nlimitations on DOD's authority to initiate the collection process.

Growing U.S. exports mean growing jobs at \nhome.\n  Secondly, we need to come together and pass a long-term \ntransportation bill. According to a recent report, nearly a quarter of \nNebraska's bridges are structurally unsound. Beyond safety, investments \nin infrastructure can create immediate jobs and long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  Lastly, we need to pass a responsible, comprehensive immigration \nreform bill.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in recognition of \nthe upcoming 50th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965.\n  Our Nation took an important step forward 50 years ago when, on \nAugust 6, 1965, President Johnson signed into law this landmark \nlegislation. It was a moment that brave men and women, like our \ncolleague John Lewis, marched for and were willing to die for as they \ndared to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.\n  Unfortunately, 2 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down section 4, \nand preclearance and Federal protections for vulnerable communities \nwent away. When the Supreme Court struck down section 4, it did not say \nthat protections were not needed. Rather, it issued a challenge to us \nhere in this House to come up with a modern day formula. I see that as \na challenge for all of us in this great House--to come up with a modern \nday formula to provide protections for vulnerable communities.\n  On this 50th anniversary of the landmark Voting Rights Act, let us \nanswer this call to action. It is a call worthy of all of our \nattention. On this recess, let us remark about how wonderful it was \nthat we all came together on March 7, 1965, in order to do what was \nright.

For the past five decades, the Voting \nRights Act has broken down barriers that discouraged or outright \nprohibited citizens from voting.\n  The VRA led to a more inclusive electoral system that increasingly \nreflected the diversity of the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, the right to vote is central to who we are as Americans \nand to our democracy.\n  But this cornerstone of American civil rights is unfortunately being \nthreatened today. In too many places across the country, we have seen \nnew measures that create barriers that make it harder to register or \nvote.\n  On this 50th anniversary, we must redouble our commitment to \nstrengthening the Voting Rights Act. We can start by restoring the \nVoting Rights Act to ensure that the rights of all Americans that go to \nthe ballot box and cast a ballot are protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5610-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING ADOLPH KIEFER OF WADSWORTH\n\n  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the ``Father of \nSwimming,'' Adolph Kiefer, from Wadsworth, Illinois.\n  At age 17, Adolph became the 100-meter gold medal winner at the 1936 \nBerlin Olympics. In addition to earning 17 world records, Adolph was \nthe first man in the world to swim the 100-yard backstroke in under a \nminute and invented a flip turn, still used today.\n  In 1947, Adolph founded his own company, inventing the first plastic \nkickboard and the first nylon swimsuit. Yet, he has considered teaching \nothers his greatest success.\n  Upon joining the Navy, Adolph was shocked to learn many of his \ncomrades couldn't swim. He designed a program to teach millions of \nrecruits what he dubbed the victory backstroke.\n  As a youth fitness advocate, he served the Red Cross for 25 years, \ncoordinating the learn-to-swim campaign for Chicago and overseeing \nlessons for thousands of children.\n  Mr. Kiefer just celebrated his 97th birthday and still swims every \nday.\n  I have submitted a letter of support for Mr. Kiefer for the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom. I urge our country to honor a great man \nfrom Illinois' 14th Congressional District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5610-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            UNFINISHED WORK\n\n  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I am upset that the House is heading to \nAugust recess today with so much unfinished work in front of us.\n  We could be working to find a transportation bill that both we and \nthe Senate can agree on, a bill that would begin to fix our broken \nroads, bridges, and highways. My district, the Virgin Islands, has been \nhit by nearly 6 years of substantially reduced Federal highway funding.\n  We could be working on an appropriations bill to fund important work \nfor this country. In my district, the Virgin Islands, the Interior \nAppropriations bill is vitally important.\n  This funding would go toward the children in our schools. Right now \nthe schools are not structurally sound and are decaying. In fact, a new \nschool hasn't been built in my home district on the island of St. Croix \nor St. Thomas in the last two decades.\n  It is shameful to leave town without working on a Voting Rights Act. \nThe ability and ease of access to voting must be expanded, not \nrestricted. It must also be further expanded to include the 4 million \nAmericans who do not have the right to vote for their President simply \nbecause they live in a territory.\n  These men and women love their country, they fight for their country, \nbut they are excluded from the most basic democratic function.\n  We could be working to fix these and a myriad of other things, but, \ninstead, we are leaving with these matters unattended. This is an \nembarrassment to this body and must not happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5610-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5610-H5623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1994, VA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n      2015, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3236, SURFACE \n TRANSPORTATION AND VETERANS HEALTH CARE CHOICE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we are here at the end of the work that we \nhave done before our break home for the August recess, where we will \nhave an opportunity to go back to the American people and talk with \nthem as they are in our homes, our cities, our neighborhoods, our \nschools, our firehouses, and our places of worship; and we will have a \nchance to meet and talk with them about the great work that Republicans \nhave achieved and done up here in Washington, D.C., during this first \nhalf of the year.\n  I am very pleased to know that today, as we are preparing to leave to \ngo back home for our district work session, that we are going to be \npresenting several bills on the floor that are done to try and move \nforward not only thoughts and ideas that we have for the House of \nRepresentatives but, really, to work in the spirit of things with the \nother body, the United States Senate, so that we can make sure that the \nAmerican people, their vision, their needs are before the American \npeople. That is why I am here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, last year, the American people were shocked, once again, \nby the news that dozens of our Nation's veterans were left to die while \nthey waited for medical care in the VA. The VA hospital, which is \nlocated in so many of our communities around this great Nation, has \nsimply not performed well and, in several instances, has had shocking \nresults. That is also why we are here today.\n  In response, Congress passed something called the Choice Act, which \nmakes it easier to remove senior executives at the VA who had \nunderperformed, who have not done their job properly on behalf of not \njust the taxpayers of this country, but on behalf of a grateful Nation \nwho is serving the men and women who have given their very best years \nand lives to this country through their service to the United States \nmilitary.\n  We believe that removing people who cannot make wise choices and \ndecisions at the VA was the right thing to do. We were trying to put \nthe President, his administration, the Secretary, and senior managers \nat the VA not only on notice that we would not tolerate bad behavior, \npoor decisions, and ineffective management, but that we were going to \ndo something about it. By the way, we felt like they were \nunderperforming to a deserving crowd, and that is our veterans.\n  Well, the President agreed with us, too. The bill was signed into \nlaw. We got that done last year, the Choice Act. It was a good decision \nby this body when we faced the times where we recognized in not only a \npublic way, but in an outpouring of support from veterans who said this \nhas to change. The Republican Congress did just that.\n  Our chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs from Florida (Mr. \nMiller) very quickly and clearly went and did an investigation on a \nbipartisan basis, looked at the VA, and made these decisions. That was \nwhat we did a year ago.\n  Since then, only two VA employees have been fired for their role in \nwhat is now known as the waiting list scandal. What is this waiting \nlist scandal? The waiting list scandal is a way by which the VA denied \nveterans an opportunity to come and get the health care that they \nneeded by stringing them out and then deceiving others--including \nthemselves in the VA--about what the waiting times were. They deceived \nnot only these people who were given these long dates; they deceived \nthe management. They also deceived the United States Congress.\n  Well, as happens many times, people find out. Well, we did find out. \nThis meant that the deaths that were covered up, the veterans that were \nneglected, and the statistics that were provided to us and others were \naltered.\n  One year later, the waiting list grows longer and longer and longer \nfor everyone. No doubt, we gave the administration the tools that they \nasked for that they agree with. Only two people have been fired.\n  Mr. Speaker, we were sincere about what we did by giving them the \nauthority and the responsibility. We expected them to clean it up. I \nlook to not only our chairman, Jeff Miller, but we look to the VA also \nto stand up and say they disagreed with that. Not much has happened--\ncertainly not enough.\n  We are back here again. Poor performances and bad actors still \ncontinue to undermine the VA. They continue to undermine not only the \nscheduling, they undermine the service; they undermine the quality that \nshould be available to our veterans. As a result of this, the ability \nthat we think we are providing to our veterans is diminished. The care \nfor our veterans, wounded and sick veterans, continues to lag.\n  Republicans are back at the table. Our young chairman, Jeff Miller, \nhas stayed at the table. He has stayed working on this issue on a \nbipartisan basis with the members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nby knowing what is happening all across this country, learning more \nabout not just the facts of the case, but the stories that come from \nthe veterans themselves, the stories that may come from people who are \ninside the VA. They are important to us learning what is really \nhappening.\n  Because the VA has a long and well-documented history of failing to \nhold employees accountable, we are back here today with another bill. \nThat is right, another bill that we are going to handle on the floor by \nthis Republican House with Democrats on a bipartisan basis, to make it \neasier to remove or demote employees who do not do their job and who \nneed to be out of that organization.\n  We are going to give this organization exactly what they are asking \nfor again. We are going to give the VA and their new Veterans Secretary \nthe ability to clean up their mess. We are trying our best to hold them \naccountable yet, at the same time, expect them to do the right thing.\n  Yesterday, in testimony, we had our chairman say he has confidence in \nthe Secretary; he has confidence that the Secretary can adjust and make \nthese changes, but the law needs to be updated and changed.\n  That is why we are here today, to give the VA the tools that they \nneed--just like when I was a manager in the private sector, I needed \nthe tools to run my organization properly and effectively--the ability \nto move employees that were not doing their job--perhaps it is a bad \nfit--or to get rid of employees or even fire them if they are not only \nnot performing their job, but deceptively trying to harm patients in \nthe process.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill would send a clear message to employees of the \nVA, and we intend to do that today. We are going to send a very clear \nmessage to them that they either perform properly or, if they are \nharming our effort to help our veterans, it is time for them to leave. \nIf they are not up to doing the task very well, this Department will be \ngiven the opportunity, the law, and the leverage to do just that.\n\n  This bill would send another important signal also. If you choose to \ndemonstrate the moral courage necessary to stand up for veterans and to \nblow the whistle on those who are not, we want to make sure that you \nare protected, that you can come forth inside your own organization of \nthe VA to report and root out bad behavior. We must fix this.\n  Mr. Speaker, too many times, the testimony yesterday revealed that \nthese VA facilities in location after location after location around \nthis country are deathtraps for our veterans.\n  These elder gentlemen, veterans who go to seek help, they know it is \na deathtrap; and that is why we need to also address this, for the \nsafety of men and women who have protected this great Nation.\n  Congress needs to make it clear--and we can today--that supervisors \nat the VA cannot retaliate against whistleblowers.\n  If there is somebody in the organization who is willing to tell the \ntruth and come forward, you cannot retaliate against them because they \nare going to tell the truth about the poor service and responsibility \ntoward aiding our veterans. It will not be tolerated.\n  Every Member of this body will have an equal opportunity today to say \nthat is the right thing to do because this is what the Secretary is \nasking for.\n\n[[Page H5612]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to know that, when our \nveterans are treated poorly, this bill would help them; when our VA \nemployees understand that somebody who was going to turn a blind eye \nbefore now, we will no longer do that.\n  We are going to give the VA the tools to root out the problems, to \nmake this better, so that we can honestly look at our men and women and \nsay: Thank you for your service; this grateful Nation does care about \nyou.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for sweeping cultural changes at the VA. It \nis time to remove the bureaucrats who will make excuses, who will hide \nthings, and who will make circumstances dangerous and worse for our \nveterans.\n  It is time to hold senior executives accountable when the VA \nunderperforms, and that is why I am joining the American Legion, the \nVFW, and other veterans associations in supporting H.R. 1994. That is \nwhat the testimony revealed yesterday at the Committee on Rules when we \nheard from not only the chairman of the committee, but others about the \nimportance of this bill.\n  This rule would also provide for debate for H.R. 3236, the Surface \nTransportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015. \nWe have two specific purposes that we are here for: first, for the VA; \nand, second, to make sure that we authorize an extension for the \nFederal surface transportation program through October 29.\n  It is a well-known understanding that our young chairman, Bill \nShuster, of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has been \nworking and working and working. We indicated last year in November \nand, again, in December that we would allow an extension to this date \nfrom last year; and Chairman Shuster said he thought he could have a \ndeal by now.\n  Well, as it turned out, the United States Senate is debating that \nthis week. They are going through a weeklong process to determine what \nthey would like their transportation bill to be like. The bottom line \nis a thousand-page bill that has not yet passed, that we do not know \nthe substance of, and we are not going to agree with sight unseen.\n  Our young chairman, Bill Shuster, has asked that we offer a very \npolite and reasonable option, and that is give us an opportunity to \nreview this. They have done the hard work, the United States Senate. We \nwill do the same, and we will get that done by October 29.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  It would also avoid a shortfall that would keep the VA from closing \nhospitals across this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the substance of what this rule and the \nunderlying legislation is all about.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding \nme the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying \nbills, H.R. 3236, the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care \nChoice Improvement Act, and H.R. 1994, the VA Accountability Act.\n  Yet again, we have a grab bag rule that covers multiple bills on \nwildly different subjects--in this case, transportation and veterans \ncare--in one bill; and yet we have a closed rule that is pushing \nthrough a last-minute deal that kicks the can down the road yet again \non highway reauthorization when there is reason to believe that, if we \nsimply stayed in town and worked another week, we might be able to work \nwith the Senate to get to an end point with regard to a long-term \nreauthorization.\n  The closed rule here limits the discussion of alternatives on the \nissue of transportation funding. Even worse, the bill has two entirely \nunrelated aspects. I have never heard of a crazier name than the \nSurface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act.\n  This is part of the problem of this body over the last several years. \nRepublican leadership has moved towards doing more and more omnibuses \nand minibuses. That means combining disparate bills--transportation, \nveterans--into one bill, which isn't healthy for the accountability of \nthis body among the electorate.\n  If you vote against this bill, for instance, because you don't like \nthe transportation provisions, does that mean you are against veterans? \nIf you don't like the veterans provisions and you vote against this \nbill, does that mean you are against transportation? How easy it would \nbe to simply have two votes on each of these bills so Members on both \nsides of the aisle can vote their conscience and our constituents can \nhold us accountable.\n  Of course, it is necessary to give the VA the authority to transfer \n$3.3 billion for healthcare services. There is strong agreement on both \nsides. We could run the bill through on suspension. We wouldn't even \nneed to open it up for a rule. It would pass with more than a two-\nthirds vote. But there are problematic additions attached to that part \nof the bill. It is also combined with yet another temporary fix for our \nNation's highway system, instead of trying to stay in town another week \nand work on a more permanent fix to help meet the needs of the \ntransportation arteries of our country.\n  As you know, Mr. Speaker, 54 percent of our Nation's major roads and \nbridges are rated poor or mediocre. Forty-five percent of Americans \ndon't have access to public transit. Congestion produced by our \nlegislative failures here wastes valuable time and money and detracts \nfrom the growth of the American economy. It is estimated Americans will \nlose 8.4 billion hours and 4.45 billion gallons of gas over a decade. \nThat means the average consumer is wasting $800 a year and 5 full days \nof their life away from their kids, away from their family, simply \nsitting in traffic. Mr. Speaker, that is unacceptable.\n  My constituents are no strangers to traffic. If you have been to Fort \nCollins, one of the largest cities in my district and home to one of \nour great universities, you will find that on highway 25 my \nconstituents endure gridlocked traffic at rush hour, doubling or \ntripling their commuting times.\n  Expansion of highway 25 and high-speed rail along highway 70 and \nhighway 36 have been given completion dates of decades from now--60 \nyears, in some cases. Try to imagine being told your doctor wants to \nslowly break down blockages in your arteries over a period of 60 years. \nYou won't make it that far.\n  Our communities need to do something about traffic now. Tourism and \ncommerce are the lifeblood of Fort Collins, Boulder, and our mountain \ncommunities like Vail, Frisco, and Breckenridge. For these towns to \nsurvive and thrive, we need to tackle our transportation funding needs \nhead-on.\n  From our other speakers, you will hear a lot about the Export-Import \nBank, the one item that somehow, with this grab bag that includes \nveterans and transportation, there is a strong bipartisan majority for \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. In fact, 67 Senators in the \nRepublican-led Senate voted to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, and \nyet somehow that item didn't make the grab bag.\n  If Congress fails to act, one of the most important items is it will \nresult concretely in the loss of tens of thousands of American jobs and \nmake American companies less competitive for exports at a time when \nglobal competitiveness and the global economy is more important than \never, which was left out of this grab bag of bills.\n  I understand ideological issues with the Export-Import Bank. In a \nperfect world, I would agree with my colleagues who argue we shouldn't \nneed to do this kind of effective subsidy for exporters; but if other \ncountries are doing it and it is permissible under WTO and trade rules, \nwe would truly be idiots to unilaterally disarm and not engage in a \nlegal practice that facilitates the credit of American exporting \nbusinesses. Effectively, it would lead to the exporting of more jobs \noverseas and making American companies less competitive in selling \ntheir products.\n  So, by all means, let's have the discussion around multilateral \nadjustments to the type of credit facilities that countries can engage \nin with exporting countries, but let's not look at unilateral \ndisarmament that makes America less competitive and destroys jobs.\n  You will hear a lot about how simple it would be, my colleagues would \nindicate, to simply get this done before we leave. Isn't it worth \nanother week of our time to save tens of thousands of American jobs?\n\n[[Page H5613]]\n\n  The second part of the rule, H.R. 1994, the VA Accountability Act, \none of the main problems with it is it would create a culture of fear \nthat would imperil the services our veterans need and deserve.\n  The tragedy in the Phoenix VA system is an example. It became known \nbecause of a few courageous whistleblowers. Had this legislation been \nin place, this tragedy could have been swept under the rug for many \nmore years.\n  Without whistleblowers and strong whistleblower protections, the VA \nhospital debacle in my State of Colorado, in Aurora, could have even \nbeen a worse situation, if you can imagine that.\n  This legislation is not just bad for whistleblowers, it is also \nunconstitutional. Supreme Court case law has clearly outlined the due \nprocess that employees have before their jobs are taken away. This bill \nturns its back on due process and allows any VA employee to be fired on \nthe spot for retribution.\n  The limited process provided in this legislation is far below the \nconstitutional requirements, which is why the President has promised to \nveto this bill. All this bill is attempting to do is destroy the \nwhistleblower and professional civil service system and, thus, the \nlivelihood of thousands and the quality of service to our veterans.\n  The appropriate action is to get the VA to do their job through \nappropriate legislation which creates true accountability, which this \nbill fails to achieve, or discuss how we might reform the dollars we \nallocate to the VA to best serve our veterans, however possible.\n  We will debate an alternative today by my colleague, Mr. Takano of \nCalifornia, that would retain due process but allows the VA to \nimmediately fire any employee who poses a health or safety risk to \nveterans. Additionally, it prevents employees from staying on paid \nadministrative leave--even being bounced around the VA--by limiting the \ntime to 2 weeks, a similarity to one of the positive aspects of the \nbill before us today.\n  Mr. Takano's legislation, for example, would have allowed the VA to \nimmediately fire those responsible for the Phoenix scandal and kept in \nplace the whistleblower protections that allowed us to find out about \nthe Phoenix scandal.\n  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I oppose the rule and the underlying \nlegislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I admire the gentleman very much. We work very well together. But I \nthink it is a misstatement to say that this bill would allow people to \nbe fired on the spot at the VA. That is certainly, I don't believe, \ntrue at all. I believe it would have to be with cause, and the VA would \nhave to have a reason.\n  There is nothing in this legislation where we would empower people to \ndo things that would not follow proper Federal law nor established \nrules of procedure for the employee to have the proper amount of \nprotection. But what is stated and understood is, where an employee has \nbeen underperforming, misperforming, or has violated their oath of \noffice, where they have a diligence to people under their care or where \nthey have done intentional deeds and then tried to cover it up, that \nwould be cause, and that is what this is about.\n  This is not about firing someone on the spot. I think it would be a \nmisstatement to try and characterize this important legislation that \nhas been well thought through, as well as worked out with the VA, as \nbeing from that perspective.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will \noffer an amendment to allow the House to vote on reauthorizing the \nExport-Import Bank, as proposed by Mr. Fincher yesterday. It is the \nsame exact language that passed the Senate by a vote of 67-29.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Export-Import Bank allows American businesses to \ncompete in global markets and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), the Democratic whip, to discuss our proposal.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank Mr. Polis from Colorado for yielding.\n  I rise in opposition to this rule. This is our last day in session \nbefore we leave for 5 or 6 weeks. We then will have 13 days before the \nend of the fiscal year. We have a number of things that the American \npublic expects us to do that enjoys almost universal support on this \nfloor, one of which enjoys a significant majority of support on this \nfloor.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me quote the Speaker of this House, John Boehner. \n``Above all else,'' he said as he assumed the Speakership, ``we will \nwelcome the battle of ideas, encourage it, engage in it--openly, \nhonestly, and respectfully.''\n  ``As the Chamber,'' he went on to say, ``closest to the people, the \nHouse works best when it is allowed to work its will.'' He then said, \n``I ask all Members of this body to join me in recognizing this common \ntruth.'' Al Gore, the former Vice-President of the United States, would \nobserve, however, that is an inconvenient truth.\n  It is an inconvenient truth because the chairman of the Financial \nServices Committee, representing the minority of this House, is opposed \nto the Export-Import Bank. He has been opposed to it since we adopted \nit in 2012, with an overwhelming majority of votes from both sides of \nthe aisle--as a matter of fact, a unanimous vote from the Democratic \nside of the aisle and over 140 Members from the Republican side of the \naisle--just 3 years ago.\n  This rule makes in order, as the gentleman noticed, two bills, one of \nwhich I vigorously oppose but won't spend a lot of time on. While the \ngentleman is probably correct that it is not immediate firing, it is a \nsubstantial undermining of the Civil Service Act adopted so that we \nwould not have a patronage, politically ridden system, but a civil \nservice system based on merit.\n  This bill then makes in order an extension of the highway bill, which \ncertainly we ought to do. It is somewhat ironic that we say it is a 3-\nmonth extension. We passed a 5-month extension. I voted for the 5-month \nextension. Everybody ought to know that we fund it for 5 months, of \ncourse. We call it a 3-month extension. I hope that will satisfy \nSenator McConnell so that he can then pass it.\n  We then provide for $3.3 billion so that we will make sure our \nveterans hospitals and medical care stays in operation. Both of those \ncould have been passed on this House floor by unanimous consent.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  We now leave for another month the Export-Import Bank, which is \nresponsible for the creation and retaining of jobs in America.\n  We all talk about jobs in America, but the Speaker has said, again, \nthat the failure to pass this bill is losing jobs right now. And yet my \nRepublican friends, in tipping their hat to the chairman of the \nFinancial Services Committee, say we are not going to consider that, as \nthey did last month in July. I know we haven't gotten out of July yet, \nbut we will go through August, and then we will go through September.\n  Mr. Fincher tells me he thinks that bill will be brought to the floor \nin some form or another in September, but it will have cost us jobs and \ncompetitiveness overseas with the 60 countries that have an export-\nimport bank that are making sure that the purchases of their goods made \nin their countries are cheaper than the goods sold in our country. That \ncosts American jobs.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  We ought to reject this rule, and we ought to do what the Speaker of \nthe House said we ought to do; treat one another with respect, and let \nthe House work its will.\n  There are 240-plus, maybe 250, maybe 260, maybe 270 votes. You only \nneed 218 to pass the Export-Import Bank on this floor.\n  I will yield to anybody who says: No, Mr. Hoyer, you are wrong; it \ndoesn't have the majority vote.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HOYER. I will yield to anybody on this floor who will say: Mr. \nHoyer, you are wrong.\n\n[[Page H5614]]\n\n  Apparently, there is nobody on the floor who is going to suggest that \nthe will of this House, as represented by a majority that would vote on \nthis bill, would not be for extending the Export-Import Bank, saving \nAmerican jobs, making sure that America is competitive in the \ninternational markets.\n  My colleagues, reject this rule. Exercise our responsibility to the \nAmerican people and to American workers, and let's pass the Export-\nImport Bank today before we go home.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank the distinguished gentleman for not only his words \nand the spirit of what he said, but I want him to know that, several \nyears ago, as he approached me as I became chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, I assured the gentleman that I would do my very best, within \nmy ability, and he has done also, as well as his team that also sits at \nthe Rules Committee.\n  I want to thank the distinguished gentleman because part of what our \njob is, yes, to represent our Speaker and the things that are done, but \nalso to make sure the spirit in which we do it is done properly, and I \nappreciate the gentleman. I think his spirit was good today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch), a member of the Oversight and Government Reform \ncommittee and a former member of the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, two of the things a proud and confident and \nresponsible nation will do--no matter how challenging--are, one, to \ninvest in its future and, two, to care for its veterans. This bill \npretends to do both. Actually, it does neither.\n  Yes, it will keep the highway bill on life support for another short-\nterm extension. It used to be 5 months. Now, it is going to be 3 \nmonths.\n  Yes, it will allow the VA to make internal fund transfers to keep our \nhospitals open through September, but once again, in another act of \nserial irresponsibility, Congress is ignoring its duty to do its job of \npassing a long-term transportation bill.\n  It leaves our communities and States in suspension. It recklessly \nadds unnecessary construction costs to our taxpayers and lets potholes \nget deeper and bridges more dangerous. We need a long-term \ntransportation bill--6 years, not 3 months.\n  Regarding the VA, do we meet our obligations to provide for the \nhealth care of our veterans through internal fund transfers? Our \nveterans and our VA need a fully funded budget. It needs funds, not \nfund transfers.\n  Veteran healthcare demand shot up 10 percent, but the budget is only \nup 2.8 percent, shackled by mindless and destructive sequester caps. We \nshould end them.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not written to address problems; it is \ndesigned to deny they exist.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not an example of Congress doing its job; \nit is yet another example of Congress evading its responsibilities.\n  I will vote ``no.''\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from \nColorado, and let me thank my good friend from Texas as well. Let me \nuse a great philosopher's statement of a couple of decades ago: ``Can \nwe all get along?''\n  As I stand here, on the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health \nCare Choice Improvement Act of 2015 that is now with the rule before \nus, it is obvious that we are trying to take a divergent pathway.\n  I was one of the first Members of Congress to go down in front of my \nveterans hospital to stand and to demand quality health care for our \nveterans, to ask that the system be fixed. I take no backseat, along \nwith other Members, to ensuring that our veterans get what they need, \nand stand in line to make sure that they are not defaulted on by the \nAmerican people.\n  H.R. 1994 eliminates the due process rights of whistleblowers who \nhave been key to drawing attention to any manipulation or coverups \ntaking place. They are bringing back to the floor this bill, calling it \nan accountability bill; but, in essence, it is to go after hard-working \nemployees and fire them and eliminating their opportunity to explain or \nto have due process. That is not the American way.\n  This is not a bill that helps veterans. In fact, it takes away \nconsistent, long-working employers who see something and say something, \nand so I am voting ``no'' on the bill and this rule.\n  Then the surface transportation had a wonderful opportunity to do a \n6-year bill, to look for pay-fors that Members could bring together and \nsupport; yet my metro, the Houston metro, will be suffering. Our \nhighways and other surface transportation entities, safety will be \nsuffering. Employees will not be paid.\n  Here we go again with a short-term opportunity. I remember doing a 6-\nyear transportation bill, where I opened up the hike and bike trails of \nmy community in Houston.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 10 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I would offer to say that a highway bill, 6 years, \nor a surface transportation bill for 6 years is a bipartisan American \nway to do things.\n  Why don't we do that for the American people and do it now? Vote \n``no'' on the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security, I rise to \nspeak on H.R. 3236, Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care \nChoice Improvement Act of 2015,'' which reauthorizes federal-aid \nhighway and transit programs for three months--through October 29, \n2015--by transferring $8.1 billion from other federal funds to the \nHighway Trust Fund to cover projected trust fund shortfalls over that \ntime period.\n  The bill also allows the Veterans Affairs Department (VA) to use $3.4 \nbillion provided last year for the Veterans Choice health care program \nto pay for care provided since May 1 to veteran patients by non-VA \nproviders under VA Care in the Community programs.\n  The bill also is intended to give the VA the funding flexibility \nneeded to prevent the possible closure of some VA hospitals in coming \nweeks.\n  Mr. Speaker, instead of this 90-day temporary extension, I would have \nstrongly preferred that we were debating a comprehensive, fair, \nequitable, and long-term transportation reauthorization bill the nation \ndesperately needs. We have had two years to do so.\n  Democrats want such a bill as does the President, but apparently our \nfriends across the aisle do not since they have spent the last two \nyears wasting time on advocating policies wanted by no one except for \nthe right-wing extremists of the Tea Party.\n  But I reluctantly support this emergency but temporary measure \nbecause as the Department of Transportation has reported, if we do not \nact now highway trust fund balances by the beginning of August will \nreach dangerously low levels and result in a reduction of payments to \nstates by an average of 28 percent.\n  Many states have already begun to cancel or delay planned \nconstruction projects, threatening 700,000 thousands of jobs, including \n106,100 jobs in my home state of Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Highway Trust Fund was created in 1956 during the \nEisenhower Administration to help finance construction of the \nInterstate Highway System, which modernized the nation's transportation \ninfrastructure and was instrumental in making the United States the \nworld's dominant economic power for two generations.\n  Our national leaders then understood that investing in our roads and \nbridges strengthened our economy, created millions of good-paying jobs, \nand improved the quality of life for all Americans.\n  It is currently composed of two accounts that fund federal-aid \nhighway and transit projects built by states. Federal funding from the \ntrust fund accounts for a major portion of state transportation \nspending.\n  The Highway Trust Fund is financed by gasoline and diesel taxes, \nwhich until the last decade produced a steady increase in revenues \nsufficient to accommodate increased levels of spending on highway and \ntransit projects.\n  However, those tax rates--18.4 cents/gallon federal tax on gasoline \nand a 24.4 cents/gallon tax on diesel fuel--have remained unchanged \nsince 1993 and were not indexed to inflation so the value of those \nrevenues has eroded over the years, and, combined with the fact that \nvehicles have been getting increasingly better mileage, the revenues \ndeposited into the Highway Trust Fund beginning last decade have not \nkept pace with highway and transit spending from the trust fund.\n  Consequently, since 2008, Congress has periodically had to transfer \nat the 11th hour\n\n[[Page H5615]]\n\ngeneral Treasury revenues into the trust fund to pay for authorized \nhighway and transit spending levels and avoid a funding shortfall.\n  The total amount to date is more than $54 billion.\n  Obviously, this practice is economically inefficient and injects \nuncertainty in the highway construction plans, projects, and schedules \nof state and local transportation agencies, not to mention the anxiety \nit causes to workers and businesses whose economic livelihood is \ndependent on those projects.\n  Mr. Speaker, the last transportation authorized by Congress for 4 \nyears or more, SAFETEA-LU, expired on September 30, 2009, at the end of \nFY 2009.\n  Because Congress and the Administration could not agree to a new \nreauthorization, it was necessary to resort to stop-gap temporary \nextensions on no less than eight occasions spanning a period of 910 \ndays before Congress finally enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in \nthe 21st Century Act'' (MAP-21 Act) on July 6, 2012, which reauthorized \nhighway and transportation programs through Fiscal Year 2014, a little \nmore than two years, or until September 30, 2014.\n  MAP-21 was intended as a short-term measure to give Congress and the \nAdministration breathing room to reach agreement on a long-term \nreauthorization bill.\n  Yet, as Mr. Levin, the Ranking Member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, has often pointed out, since gaining the majority in 2010, \nour Republican colleagues have failed to take any action to sustain the \nHighway Trust Fund over the long-term and shore up vital infrastructure \nprojects and has not held even a single hearing on financing options \nfor the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Instead, House Republicans have wasted the nation's time voting to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act at least 59 times, waging a War on \nWomen, pursuing partisan investigations into Benghazi, the IRS, and the \ntrying to overturn President Obama's executive actions that make our \nimmigration enforcement laws less inhumane.\n  Instead of doing their job, House Republicans big new idea is to \nattack the President for doing his job.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for this Congress, and especially \nthe House majority, to focus on the real problems and challenges facing \nthe American people.\n  And one of the biggest of those challenges is ensuring that America \nhas a transportation policy and the infrastructure needed to compete \nand win in the global economy of the 21st Century.\n  To do that we have to extend the reauthorization of current \ntransportation programs and to authorize the transfer of the funds to \nthe Highway Trust Fund needed to fund authorized construction projects \nand keep 700,000 workers, including 106,100 in Texas on the job.\n  But that is only a start and just a part of our job.\n  The real work that needs to be done in the remaining days of this \nCongress is to reach an agreement on a long-term highway and \ntransportation bill that is fair, equitable, fiscally responsible, \ncreates jobs and leads to sustained economic growth.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\3/4\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking member of the \nFinancial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government \nSponsored Enterprises.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, 64 \nSenators voted to renew the Export-Import Bank's charter, which expired \non June 30. More than 240 Members are on record supporting the Bank, \nand according to The Wall Street Journal, there are many more.\n  As I quote, ``some Republicans estimated that as many as 300 of the \n434 current House Members'' would support a measure similar to the one \nthat passed the Senate; yet despite this overwhelming support, we have \nbeen denied a vote on the House of Representatives to renew the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  Last year, Ex-Im helped underwrite over $27 billion in U.S. exports. \nIt supported thousands of small businesses and about 164,000 jobs \nacross our country. Since 2009, the Bank has supported over 1.3 million \njobs. The Bank does all of this at no cost--no cost--to the American \ntaxpayer. In fact, the Ex-Im Bank sent over $675 million to the \nTreasury last year--actual dollars--to help pay down the deficit.\n  According to a letter sent by CBO just last week, using accounting \nstandards, reauthorizing the Ex-Im would save taxpayers $2.3 billion \nover the next 5 years; yet American companies have been disadvantaged. \nThey have been unilaterally disadvantaged of having the export \nassistance that over 60 different nations are providing their export-\nimport banks.\n  Only 1 of the top 10 exporting countries in the world does not have \nan export credit agency now that can finance export deals--just one--\nand that is the United States of America. That is because this Congress \nfailed to do what every other Congress has done since FDR, and that is \nto reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  It creates jobs, creates money for the Treasury. It helps small \nbusinesses.\n  Vote ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the rule. Let's bring \nit to the floor today for a vote.\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 28, 2015]\n\n          Small Businesses Bear Burden of Ex-Im Bank Shutdown\n\n                (By Nick Timiraos and Kristina Peterson)\n\n       Washington.--Political opponents have managed to shut the \n     U.S. Export-Import Bank for the most of the summer by arguing \n     it rewards politically connected corporate giants.\n       But the bank and its supporters say the burden of the \n     agency's shutdown for now will hit small businesses that lack \n     the resources of industrial titans such as Boeing Co. and \n     General Electric Co.\n       ``Small businesses are the ones that are going to be hurt \n     first and the most,'' said Rep. Denny Heck (D., Wash.), a \n     proponent of reauthorizing the bank's charter.\n       The Ex-Im Bank, a federal agency that finances exports, \n     stopped accepting new loans at the beginning of July after \n     Congress allowed its charter to expire. While a majority of \n     lawmakers in Congress support reauthorizing the 81-year-old \n     agency in some form, conservative Republicans who control key \n     leadership positions have so far prevented a vote in the \n     House of Representatives.\n       Supporters had pinned their hopes on reopening the bank as \n     part of a bill extending highway funding that expires Friday. \n     But House and Senate leaders have had trouble agreeing on \n     that transportation measure before their annual August recess \n     that begins this week, which means they are likely to leave \n     Washington without addressing the Ex-Im Bank.\n       The bank's backers have sought to rally support in recent \n     weeks by highlighting the potential for lost sales at small \n     businesses, a group that is both politically sympathetic and \n     close to lawmakers in almost every congressional district.\n       President Barack Obama has called on Congress to \n     reauthorize the agency, and most of the bank's supporters \n     expect lawmakers to follow suit later this year. On Monday, \n     64 senators voted for an amendment to reopen the bank, and \n     some Republicans estimated that at least 300 of the 434 \n     current House lawmakers would vote similarly, given the \n     chance.\n       ``At some point we'll miss out on a business opportunity \n     that will be of such magnitude that it will catch the \n     attention of the public, and we'll respond,'' said Rep. Frank \n     Lucas (R., Okla.), who supports the bank's reauthorization.\n       Additional opportunities to resuscitate the agency will \n     arrive when Congress passes a spending measure needed to \n     avoid a partial government shutdown by Oct. 1 or if the House \n     and Senate negotiate a long-term highway bill in the fall.\n       Still, some lawmakers said the way in which the bank has \n     missed multiple opportunities to stay open exposes the \n     political challenges ahead. ``I wouldn't hold my breath that \n     it's going to get funded in September,'' said Rep. Matt \n     Salmon, an Arizona Republican who supports the bank.\n       Big businesses say closing the bank for good will leave \n     them at enough of a disadvantage against European and Asian \n     competitors, which benefit from export-credit agencies at \n     home, that they will move production abroad. For now, they \n     say they are getting along fine.\n       ``This is not something that creates near-term financial \n     risk for Boeing,'' said Dennis Muilenburg, the company's \n     chief executive, on a conference call with reporters last \n     week.\n       Indeed, one risk for the bank is that its absence hasn't \n     had any immediate shock. ``The Export-Import Bank expired,'' \n     said Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), one of the bank's loudest \n     critics, at a recent rally on Capitol Hill. ``You notice the \n     sky hasn't fallen?''\n       Critics of the bank say Washington shouldn't be picking \n     winners and losers, and that any hardship for businesses is \n     part of a necessary recalibration.\n       The bank says that view is short-sighted. ``When our \n     charter lapses, you won't read about massive layoffs in the \n     paper. Small businesses don't put out press releases when \n     they lose out on a sale,'' Fred Hochberg, chairman of the Ex-\n     Im Bank who in the 1990s worked closely with entrepreneurs as \n     an official at the Small Business Administration, said before \n     the bank closed last month.\n       Around 90% of loans backed by Ex-Im Bank last year went to \n     small businesses, the highest level in more than a decade. \n     Small businesses represent a much smaller share of loans by \n     dollar volume, around 25%, because Ex-Im backs expensive \n     loans for aircraft and other industrial equipment makers.\n\n[[Page H5616]]\n\n       Some businesses and their workers say that count overlooks \n     firms that don't export directly but feed into supply chains. \n     Yanke Machine Shop Inc. in Boise, Idaho, was one of 22 \n     different U.S. companies that fulfilled an order for 150 \n     pieces of construction equipment worth $37 million for a 2013 \n     engineering project in Cameroon.\n       ``What a lapse does is it kills opportunity. You've got to \n     have opportunity before you have work on the floor,'' said \n     Dirk Christison, who works in customer support for the heavy-\n     steel fabrication company.\n       At risk could be deals like one that Ray Garcia Jr., the \n     principal of an energy consulting firm that arranges \n     investment for infrastructure projects in Latin America, has \n     put together to export American equipment for a $300 million \n     gas-to-liquid plant in Paraguay.\n       He said the project is one of three in South and Central \n     America that is now in limbo. ``We have spent two years \n     developing these projects just to have the rug pulled out \n     from under us for political reasons,'' said Mr. Garcia, a \n     self-described conservative Republican from Houston.\n       Mr. Garcia said that without Ex-Im, the deal would go to a \n     foreign company or large multinational, leaving his U.S. \n     manufacturers without contracts. ``Small businesses that do \n     not have $1 billion in capital to facilitate projects like \n     these do benefit and can compete on a global platform armed \n     with Ex-Im Bank,'' he said.\n       Ex-Im's Bank limbo state stands in contrast to those of a \n     similar agency. When the Small Business Administration last \n     week stopped accepting new loans under its flagship program, \n     which reached its borrowing limit on Thursday, the House and \n     Senate quickly passed an extension.\n       Because existing loans aren't imperiled by the Ex-Im Bank's \n     shutdown, the lapse created a ``soft landing'' for most \n     customers, said Gary Mendell, president of Meridian Finance \n     Group in Santa Monica, Calif., which arranges financing for \n     exporters. ``We've been telling customers to see if you can \n     stand tough until the end of July,'' he said.\n       As the prospect of Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization grows more \n     distant, Mr. Mendell said more firms will run into difficulty \n     as their working-capital loans or credit insurance expires. \n     An overlooked casualty, he added, is that small businesses \n     that have never exported have virtually no financing options \n     right now.\n       ``If the private sector were interested in doing this, they \n     would be doing it by now,'' said Mr. Mendell.\n       Even the bank's critics have taken note of the potential \n     plight of small firms. On the eve of the agency's shutdown \n     last month, Sen. David Vitter (R., La.), expressed alarm that \n     financing for thousands of small businesses might be at stake \n     and said the agency should come up with a way for those \n     companies to secure financing from the SBA.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\3/4\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Heck), a member of the Financial Services Committee and \na leader in the effort to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask the Chamber to \nreject the rule so that we might, indeed, offer an amendment to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank for three reasons.\n  One, it is the will of the United States Congress; two, it does good; \nthree, if we don't do it, great harm will be visited upon the American \neconomy.\n  It has already been, I think, very clearly demonstrated it is the \nwill of this body, both in the Senate and here.\n  I do want to remind you that, for 81 years, 16 times, Democrats and \nRepublicans, no matter how conservative or how liberal, the United \nStates has reauthorized the Export-Import Bank. It does good. That is \nwhy they do it.\n  In fact, I would respectfully suggest that the votes were there in \nRules Committee yesterday to allow this amendment. The good gentleman \nfrom Texas who chairs--and he is a gentleman; he is a good gentleman--\nopened up his comments by saying 9,000 jobs in and around his district \nin the State of Texas, attributable to the Export-Import Bank, they \nhang in the balance.\n  It does good--last year, 164,000 jobs supported by the Export-Import \nBank, $675 million transferred to the Treasury. It reduces the deficit. \nIt creates jobs. Why don't we want more of this? Call me crazy, I \nguess.\n  If we don't do it, harm will come to us. Read this morning's Wall \nStreet Journal. Small businesses already--not prospectively--are \nalready suffering job loss in States throughout this great country.\n  The fact of the matter is not reauthorizing does constitute \nunilateral disarmament. About 3 weeks ago, two academics, one from \nCanada, one from New York, concluded the big winner if we fail to \nreauthorize. It is China. They are rubbing their hands. They are \nrubbing their hands.\n  Listen, this isn't about software or apples or film.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. It is about our manufacturing base. Who says \nwe don't need more good manufacturing jobs? We need more good \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Let me conclude on this note. Ominously, and without drama, hear me, \nfrom my heart to your ears. In the very near future, major \nmanufacturers will announce that they are offshoring certain \nmanufacturing capacity because they have to, to compete in a global \neconomy. The global economy has increased fivefold since 1980.\n  Get in the game, people. Reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Defeat \nthe rule.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his kind \nwords, not only of truth, but also I want to thank him for coming up \nand being with several other Members who sat through hours' worth of \ndebate and discussion.\n  Mr. Heck served honorably well yesterday, and he does again today, \nand I thank him very much.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleague from Texas, we have so \nmany speakers on our side of the aisle--in fact, both sides of the \naisle--folks like Mr. Fincher and others who want to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  If he has additional time, I know that our Members would also \nappreciate the opportunity to talk about it, as our time is running \nshort.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\3/4\\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan \n(Mr. Kildee), a member of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule so that we can bring up, as my \ncolleagues have said, something that ought to be done in a bipartisan \nfashion, with little significant opposition, and that is the \nreauthorization of an entity that helps drive the American economy, put \nAmericans to work, and helps us to compete in an increasingly \ncompetitive global environment, and that is the Export-Import Bank.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  In 2012, Ex-Im was passed with 330 votes in the House, 78 in the \nSenate, 60 percent of Republicans in both bodies supporting the Export-\nImport Bank, joining Democrats in doing so.\n  There is so much partisanship that invades and infects this place. \nBut when it comes to American jobs, supporting American manufacturers, \nputting hard-working Americans to work in jobs that have higher wages, \nwe have great discussions here about the growing inequality in wages.\n  We don't all agree on the solutions. But one solution we ought to \nagree on is the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank because we \nknow export jobs pay higher wages. This ought to be a no-brainer.\n  There are 59,000 jobs in my own State of Michigan as a result of the \nExport-Import Bank and the work that they do. In the last 6 years, \nthere have been $200 billion in exports.\n  We can have big disagreements on how we ought to deal with income \ninequality in this country, but we ought not have any disagreement when \nwe see the Export-Import Bank, which delivers money to the Federal \nTreasury, helps us deal with that problem, puts Americans to work, and \nmakes us more competitive. We ought to do this in a bipartisan fashion, \nand we ought to do it now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I \nappreciate the way he framed this rule debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have sort of a hodgepodge here of items that really \ndeserve careful, sustained attention. There is no reason to lump this \ntogether. These are important items. And, sadly, the way it has been \nstructured shuts down debate.\n\n[[Page H5617]]\n\n  There is no room under this rule for the Ex-Im Bank. I appreciate \nperson after person coming to the floor, acknowledging that there is \nbroad bipartisan interest in the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank and \nno rational reason to reject it. It is going to have serious \nconsequences, as my friend from Washington pointed out.\n  But there is another area that we are discussing here today that \ncould also make a huge difference for our economy because we are \ndodging again our responsibilities to deal with a country that is \nfalling apart as it is falling behind.\n  My friend from Texas was too polite. The reason we don't have a 6-\nyear reauthorization is because the House has not met its \nresponsibility to outline how we pay for it. We are still trying to pay \nfor 2015 infrastructure with 1993 dollars.\n  Now we have got legislation that actually mirrors what Ronald Reagan \ndid in 1982, when he called upon Congress to come back, raise the user \nfee 125 percent, and be able to put hundreds of thousands of Americans \nto work, and maintain our roads and bridges and transit. We are not \ndoing that.\n  We have legislation in Ways and Means that has the broadest support \nof any major piece of legislation in Congress--organized labor, \nbusiness, contractors, truckers, AAA, engineers--all committed to \nraising the user fee. They say: Charge us more so that we are going to \nbe able to thrive.\n  My friend from Colorado pointed out that the American public is \npaying now in congestion, in damage to their cars.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Work next week. Fund the transportation bill. Let the \ncommittee know what parameters they have and be able to revitalize and \nrebuild this country. It is time for us to step up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, our colleagues are making really, really \ngood points about what we need to do.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Bill Shuster, and the Republican \nmajority is committed to doing exactly what they have talked about: \ngetting our work done.\n  In fairness, it has taken the United States Senate until this week, \nand they have a 1,000-page transportation bill that we are not simply \ngoing to say: Let's just agree to that.\n  It is going to come over to us after they have done their work. With \ngreat respect, we are trying to make sure that we are continuing the \nfunding. We are using mechanisms that would be available.\n  The right thing to do is to measure three times and saw once. We are \nnot going to accept, by unanimous consent or another agreement, a \n1,000-page bill.\n  On the Republican side, we read bills before we pass them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Heck), a leader in the bipartisan efforts to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank and a member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I said earlier that the first, \nmost immediate damage as a result of our failure to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank will be visited upon small businesses.\n  It occurs to me that a little bit of color in that regard would serve \nus well, giving the benefit of the doubt to those who are opposing our \nopposition to the rule so that we can reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank.\n  Let me give you the data. The Export-Import Bank has approximately 90 \npercent of its transactions going to small businesses, about 90 \npercent.\n  Most of us tend to think about those as all direct loans, but they \naren't. The fact of the matter is the bulk of them are what we would \ncall accounts receivable insurance.\n  But there are also revolving lines of credit. There are also loan \nguarantees, not actual direct loans. And these, again, are small \nbusinesses.\n  These are businesses like Manhasset Specialty Company in Yakima, \nWashington, which makes music stands and has a global market. Thirty-\nfive percent of its sales are exports, and a good portion of them are \nassisted by the Export-Import Bank.\n  In my district, Pexco in Fife, Washington, makes traffic control \nequipment. They are growing their export business with the assistance \nof the Export-Import Bank. So it is the small businesses that first \nwill feel the damage.\n  But for those of you who say, yes, but the biggest share of the \ndollars go to big businesses, let's go back to Economics 101.\n  A lot of people point to Boeing. Ladies and gentlemen, Boeing does \nnot manufacture airplanes. If that surprises you, please pay attention \nto what I am about to say.\n  Boeing does not manufacture airplanes. They design them. They \nassemble them with the assistance of 15,000 businesses in their supply \nchain, about half of whom are small businesses.\n  In the tiny town of Puyallup, relatively speaking, in my district, \nthere are 17 businesses within the city limits whose principal customer \nis Boeing.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Small businesses will be hurt first. Over the \nlong term, big businesses will be hurt.\n  I did not say earlier lightly. I did not say earlier in hyperbole \nthat we will have major announcements causing grievous damage to the \nmanufacturing base of America. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  We simply must, for the sake of small businesses and for the sake of \nour manufacturing base, reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. It reduces \nthe deficit. It creates jobs.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \nand defeat the previous question so we can bring forward the bipartisan \neffort to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Now, again, I have a great deal of sympathy and respect for my \ncolleagues who believe that these kinds of back-door subsidies have no \nplace in a global trade regime. That is a reasonable and defensible \nviewpoint.\n  The proper avenue to advocate for that is multilaterally. There are a \nlot of ways that companies have and will and governments have and do \ntry to give themselves a nationalistic advantage in international \ntrade.\n  In the competition between Airbus and Boeing alone, books could be \nwritten about the efforts of both sides--whether it is our side through \nmilitary contracts; whether it is their side, Europe--to give back-door \nallowable subsidies that put their own companies at an advantage.\n  If we unilaterally fail to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, we are \nputting American exporters at a disadvantage because the dozens of \nother countries that engage in these allowable kinds of credit \nfacilities will still do so to the detriment of American jobs and \nAmerican businesses.\n  We recently had a debate in these very Chambers about trade promotion \nauthority. Soon there will be discussions about TPP and T-TIP.\n  Where was that discussion around TPA in the instructions to the \nPresident about credit facilities and Export-Import Bank and what would \nand wouldn't be allowable?\n  These kinds of discussions need to be had multilaterally. To \nunilaterally disarm makes no sense.\n  Even if one ideologically believes that we should not be engaging in \nthese efforts, surely what is more important and what trumps that is to \nmake sure that this is not a part of the global trade regime.\n  So long as it is, for America not to engage in this allowable \npractice of credit facilities extended through the Export-Import Bank \nputs American jobs at a disadvantage, will lead to further outsourcing \nof American jobs and hurt American businesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule covers two significant, but wholly unrelated, \nbills.\n\n[[Page H5618]]\n\nWe have heard arguments here in this limited time, this limited debate, \nabout Federal highway funding, about veterans' care and VA workers, \nabout the Export-Import Bank.\n  I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that many viewers are confused as to what we \nare even talking about or how is it even possible that, in 1 hour, we \nare covering the transportation needs of our country, the VA system, \nand a program allowable under trade rules that helps make American \ncompanies more competitive.\n  Unfortunately, rather than continuing our work next week, the \nmajority has put several pieces of disparate legislation into a grab \nbag in a smoky backroom manner that, unfortunately, will continue to \nfail to address the most important transportation concerns or the \nalready expiration of the Export-Import Bank before this body goes home \nfor a month.\n  It is unfortunate that, under this rule, this institution is not even \nallowed to bring forward an amendment we know would pass to reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  It is a shame that veterans' issues have somehow been combined with a \nhighway issue and a minibus that detracts from transparency.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question. Vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to thank not only the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), but \nalso our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle who I thought \nmost generously fought this battle today.\n  The bottom line is that they know and we know, Mr. Speaker, that we \nare addressing two vitally important issues that Congress must step up \nto the plate on.\n  One is a request that comes directly from the VA, for us to fund a \ngap of $3.4 billion that is necessary to fund hospitals of the VA to \nmake sure that they are able to provide services to our veterans. It is \ncritical. To vote against that I think is a mistake.\n  I think to vote for a chance where Republicans are trying to balance \nthe needs through not only the appropriators--Hal Rogers, our chairman, \nJeff Miller, our Veterans Committee chairman, are trying to come \ntogether, Mr. Speaker, to put together the money and the need to run \nthe business based upon a reality discussion with the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs of their need to run the business, to have the money, \nbut also to have the managerial abilities to move their employees that \nare not performing satisfactorily, employees who do have an oath as \nhealthcare providers to do their very best and to be honest about the \nscheduling and the proper procedures necessary to our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  What this rule is about and the underlying legislation is vital--\nvital--to our Nation's veterans. That is why we are here today.\n  Now, secondly, we are here because Republicans want to make sure that \nwe are faithful. We understand that, in each of our congressional \ndistricts, that we are active and involved to try and ensure that the \nroads and bridges and railways and ports and all these activities that \ndeal with infrastructure and transportation are continuing down a \npathway without us getting frustrated, without us throwing up our hands \nand giving up, but actually to work with the existing chairman, who is \ndoing an awesome job, Bill Shuster, to make sure that we are putting \nforth the money--Paul Ryan, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee--\ntrying to find the money necessary, lots of hard work, hours of \ndiscussion, moving towards a correct target.\n  In this process, we have our colleagues on the other side of this \nwall--who are literally there now as they are working in the Rotunda--\nto move legislation; we are allowing them that time because they are \nmoving a transportation bill as we speak, but it is a 1,000-page bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not in favor and I think my colleagues in here are \nnot in favor and Bill Shuster is not, which is really what matters, as \nthe chairman, to say give me a shot at looking at the bill when they \nfinish it.\n  Speaker Boehner is saying let's make sure we deal with the things \nthat must be dealt with before we go on our work time back home for the \nmonth, where we go back home and deal with the American people, because \nwe plan to do this. That is what we are doing.\n  This is not unusual; it is perfectly normal, but I think we are doing \na heck of a job and the right thing to address the issues--veterans, \nstraight up, money, the ability to run their business right, so that we \nknow we have done what we can do; and, secondly, to move \ntransportation.\n  I think every single Member of this body, Democrat and Republican, \nshould support these because they are worthy ideas about moving us \nforward, our country. We can look at the American people straight on \nand say we have addressed two of the issues that were on our plate.\n  I urge adoption of the rule. I know that our colleagues want to get \nmoving today, so I am going to look forward to debate that will follow. \nI urge support of the underlying legislation in the bills.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this rule and support the \ngentleman's motion to defeat the previous question--in order to allow \nfor a vote on the Export-Import Bank reauthorization.\n  Re-authorizing the Export-Import Bank is an economic imperative and \nletting it lapse before Congress goes on Recess is completely \nirresponsible and inexcusable.\n  The bank is an unbridled, market-driven success story which has broad \nbipartisan support in both Houses of this Congress as well as support \nfrom the majority of Americans.\n  The bank supports hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs in this \ncountry. If we fail to act, we will shut off a lifeline for many of our \nsmall businesses and exporters.\n  In my District alone, the Bank has supported thousands of small \nbusiness and manufacturing jobs. These are good jobs in a very high-\nneed area that would not have been possible without the Bank, and which \nnow are in danger.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should let the will of the people work its way and \nallow a vote on the Reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 388 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       Strike section 2 of the resolution and insert:\n       Sec. 2.

It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adopting the resolution, if ordered; and \nsuspending the rules and passing H.R. 1300.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 242, \nnays 180, not voting 11, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 483]\n\n

Mr. Speaker, I am gathered here today with some of my \ncolleagues because we participated in the Washington Kastles Charity \nClassic. We had a wonderful time for charity.\n  I just wanted to mention this. The Washington Kastles, who were \nfounded in 2008 and is the tennis team for the city of Washington, have \nmade more than $1 million in charitable donations.\n  The Charity Classic is an extension of those efforts, with 100 \npercent of the ticket proceeds benefiting Tragedy Assistance Program \nfor Survivors, or TAPS, the DC Public Education Fund, and Food & \nFriends.\n  Fans can choose which organization they support. It is a great cause.\n  We had a tennis match, Stars v. Stripes. I am sorry to report that \nthe Stars defeated the Stripes, having been in the Stripes the last 3 \nyears. They finally won one, but we are very excited for them. It is \nnice to be talking about something other than golf on the House floor.\n  I also wanted to acknowledge one person with us here today, Martina \nHingis, who is in the audience. She is up there in the gallery. She \njust won Wimbledon Doubles Championship, women's and mixed doubles. She \nwon both the women's doubles title and the mixed doubles title. She is \non the Washington Kastles.\n  We just wanted to acknowledge all the folks who played: \nRepresentatives Scott, Dold, Yoder, Bustos and Beatty. Where is Jared \nHuffman with the big serve? He is back there.\n  We had a wonderful time. Senator Flake, Senator Merkley, and the rest \nof the Kastles could not be with us today. They are traveling. But we \njust wanted to thank them all for this wonderful effort. We need more \ntennis.\n  At this time we would like to present this trophy, this cup, from the \nStripes to the Stars, who defeated us.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fortenberry). Without objection, 5-\nminute voting will continue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and add any extraneous material in the Record on H.R. \n1994, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Walorski). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 388 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1994.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1538\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 1994) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the \nremoval or demotion of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nbased on performance or\n\n[[Page H5624]]\n\nmisconduct, and for other purposes, with Mr. Fortenberry in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Takano) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my bill would provide the Secretary of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs with yet another tool to instill accountability, \nmuch-needed accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs, by \nallowing him or her to remove or demote any employee for poor \nperformance or misconduct.\n  The bill also contains language to protect--and let me say that again \nto the Members here on the floor, to protect--whistleblowers by \nstipulating that an employee may not be removed under this new \nauthority if they have an open claim at the Office of Special Counsel \nuntil that claim is closed.\n  Now, to add even more protections for those who blow the whistle at \nVA, my bill would also set up a new process to be used in addition to \nany other process that is currently allowed by law, which would protect \nwhistleblowers from retaliation by removal while they bring issues to \nlight up through their chain of command.\n  My bill also makes changes to the Senior Executive Service \nperformance evaluation system. It also allows the Secretary to recoup a \nportion of an SES employee's retirement benefits if they are convicted \nof a felony related to their work performance and limits paid \nadministrative leave to 14 days within a 1-year timeframe for any VA \nemployee. H.R. 1994, as amended, would also extend to 18 months the \nprobationary period for all new VA employees to ensure a complete \nevaluation before offering permanent status.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, my bill requires that GAO do a study on time \nand space that is spent on union activities. I agree with all of my \ncolleagues that a great majority of VA's employees are hard-working \npublic servants who are dedicated to providing the quality health care \nand benefits that our veterans have earned, and I am sure that the \nmajority of these employees who are dedicated to the mission of the \nDepartment are just as frustrated as most of us are that problem \nemployees continue to be moved to new positions or placed in a corner \nas opposed to removing them from the payroll.\n  We have seen how the presence of poor performers and misconduct \nranging from unethical practices to outright criminal behavior can \nspread like a cancer throughout the workforce. When the Secretary comes \nacross this presence of poor performance or misconduct, as we have seen \ntime and time again across our country, such as Phoenix, Denver, \ncentral Alabama, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, in my home State of \nFlorida, and in many other places across our Nation, it is nearly \nimpossible to remove that cancer in a reasonable amount of time due to \ncurrent civil service rules.\n  This is not just my view. A recent GAO study found that it can take 6 \nmonths to a year, or sometimes significantly longer, Mr. Chairman, to \nfire poor performing government employees. More telling, last month, \nVA's Deputy Secretary Gibson sat before our Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs and admitted that it was too difficult to fire a substandard \nemployee. We should all agree that it defies common sense for it to \ntake many months or even years to fire a poor performing employee at \nVA.\n  We, as Members of Congress, and the American citizens appreciate the \nsacrifices that our veterans have made and always argue that they \ndeserve nothing but the highest quality care and treatment, but in my \nview, bad employees mean bad customer service and an impediment to the \nquality services that our veterans have earned. If we truly want for \nour veterans to have the very best, then the status quo simply is no \nlonger acceptable.\n  I know there are concerns that this bill will hurt the Department's \nability to recruit and retain good employees and hurt employee morale, \nbut I think nothing could be further from the truth. The best way to \nimprove morale is to get rid of the causes of the dysfunction that we \ncurrently see at the VA. Nobody enjoys working for an organization that \nfails to hold poor performance accountable, and the only employees the \nVA should want to recruit are those who want to work in an environment \nwhere they know everyone is respected and can be held accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  Some have also said that this bill is not needed because VA fires \nemployees all the time, but the raw numbers, Mr. Chairman, just don't \ntell that story. Following a year in which we witnessed the biggest \nscandal in VA history, only three--let me repeat, three--employees of a \nworkforce of over 340,000 people have been successfully fired for wait \ntime manipulation. These numbers, or lack thereof, make it clear that \nmore work needs to be done to turn the tide at VA and change the \nculture within the Department.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  That is why this legislation is not punitive but is necessary if we \ntruly want the Secretary to make the changes this Congress, the \nAmerican people, and, most importantly, our veterans expect to see \nmade.\n  I know that the unions oppose this and continue to compare my bill to \ncurrent law in an attempt to illustrate what they think my bill is \nlacking, in their opinion; but comparing my bill to current law ignores \nthe far too often egregious effects of current civil service laws which \nhave contributed to the scandals at VA.\n  Yes, the bill before us today is different from current law, because \nthe current law needs to be changed, and that is what I and many of my \ncolleagues are trying to accomplish with this legislation. Despite our \nattempts to reach a measure of common ground with the unions, they have \nmade it clear from the beginning that pretty much anything but the \nstatus quo will not garner their support.\n  Well, we have proven that the status quo is not working. It is \nfailing the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and it is \nfailing the veterans the VA is supposed to serve. Mr. Chairman, it is \ntime for a change. The Secretary needs the ability to make real \nreforms, and he needs to be able to do it quicker than the current \naverage timeline of 6 to 12 months to remove a single employee.\n  It has also come to my attention that the administration has recently \ncome out saying that they strongly oppose the bill and could \npotentially veto it if it arrives at the President's desk; but this \nremoval authority for all VA employees is modeled after the same \nauthority provided in the Choice Act that was passed by the House and \nthe Senate and signed by the President last summer, the same authority \nthat, at the bill signing almost exactly this time last year, the \nPresident said: ``If you engage in an unethical practice, if you cover \nup a serious problem, you should be fired . . . It shouldn't be that \ndifficult.''\n  Mr. Chair, I am not sure why the President has changed his position \nalmost exactly a year later.\n  The voice of the unions should not be heard over the voice of our \nveterans. We need to continue to push for the same change we pushed for \nlast year. Now is not the time to change our belief in the need for \ngreater accountability within VA.\n  Our veterans still expect us to continue to advocate for them as more \nand more of VA's missteps are brought to light every single day, \nwhether they are on the front page of the paper or not. We cannot \ncontinue to put the needs of employees whose performance or misconduct \nwould not be tolerated in the private sector ahead of our Nation's \nveterans because we are scared of change or because we don't want to \nupset the unions.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not at least try to give the Secretary \nthe tools he or she needs to hold VA employees accountable, then we as \na Congress are just as culpable for any future VA failures as the \nantiquated civil service laws that foster those failures now.\n  There is not a doubt in my mind that all of my colleagues here today \ncare for our Nation's veterans; but today, we can decide to stand with \nour veterans or we can decide to stand with the status quo, which I \nbelieve has failed them and the American public for far too long.\n\n[[Page H5625]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeff Miller,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 1994, the VA \n     Accountability Act of 2015, as amended by the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs. As you know, the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs received an original referral and the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform a secondary referral when the \n     bill was introduced on April 23, 2015. I recognize and \n     appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the \n     House of Representatives in an expeditious manner, and \n     accordingly, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform \n     will forego action on the bill, as amended.\n       The Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1994, \n     as amended, at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction \n     over the subject matter contained in this or similar \n     legislation. Further, I request your support for the \n     appointment of conferees from the Committee on Oversight and \n     Government Reform during any House-Senate conference convened \n     on this or related legislation.\n       Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters \n     on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during \n     floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Chaffetz.\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                Committee on Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chaffetz: In reference to your letter on July \n     27, 2015, I write to confirm our mutual understanding \n     regarding H.R. 1994, as amended, the ``VA Accountability Act \n     of 2015.''\n       I appreciate the house Committee on Oversight and \n     Government Reform's waiver of consideration of provisions \n     under its jurisdiction and its subject matter as specified in \n     your letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only \n     to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1994, as amended, and \n     does not in any way waive or diminish the House Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform's jurisdictional interests \n     over this legislation or similar legislation. I will support \n     a request from the House Committee on Oversight and \n     Government Reform for appointment to any House-Senate \n     conference on H.R. 1994, as amended. Finally, I will also \n     support your request to include a copy of our exchange of \n     letters on this matter in the Congressional Record during \n     floor consideration.\n       Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.\n       With warm personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jeff Miller,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 1994. We are all frustrated that the VA \nis not moving fast enough to hold bad employees accountable, but I do \nnot believe H.R. 1994 would lead to real, long-term accountability at \nthe VA. In fact, I believe it would have the opposite effect by \npossibly shielding poor-performing VA employees from ever being \nremoved.\n  This bill violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent regarding our \nConstitution's promise of due process rights. Our Constitution \nguarantees that we cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property \nwithout due process of law. Our veterans were willing to lay down their \nlives to defend this basic promise.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has determined that our \nConstitution gives Federal employees the right to due process, meaning \nfair notice and a chance to respond, before losing their jobs. As \nlawmakers, we do not have the power to revoke this constitutional \nprinciple of fairness and due process for a select group of people, no \nmatter how outraged we may feel. I believe it is wrong to assume that \nVA employees are guilty until proven innocent.\n  If H.R. 1994 were enacted, I believe courts could very well overturn \nany removals as a violation of those employees' due process rights. \nThey could then reinstate and give backpay to those who were removed. \nBad employees would become permanent fixtures at the VA.\n  We all agree that VA needs to use the current tools it has more \nvigorously to remove poor-performing employees, but we should not throw \nout important constitutional protections to arbitrary actions simply \nbecause some claim it is too difficult to follow the law or be faithful \nto our basic principles of fairness.\n  H.R. 1994 would provide a new tool to VA managers, but perhaps not \nthe tool imagined by its supporters. Bad managers and political \nappointees would have the ability to threaten the livelihoods of honest \nVA workers trying to follow VA regulations and policy, thus reinforcing \nthe culture of fear and reluctance to speak out against poor management \nor malfeasance at the VA. If these employees were fired, they would \nhave very little opportunity to tell their side of the story.\n  H.R. 1994 would make VA the only at-will workplace within the Federal \nGovernment. Veterans desperately need our Nation's top doctors, nurses, \nand counselors to choose to work at the VA, and it is already hard \nenough to recruit them away from the private sector.\n  An article last week in USA Today found that VA has 41,500 unfilled \nmedical jobs, ``forcing vets into costly private care.'' Removing basic \ncivil service protections--and basic fairness--would make VA an even \nless desirable place to work and add to these recruiting woes.\n  Keep in mind that over 30 percent of VA employees are veterans \nthemselves. They deserve better than to find themselves in a workplace \nthat strips them of basic constitutional protections--again, \nprotections that they fought to defend.\n  This bill is nothing more than an attempt to destroy the civil \nservice using the VA as a test case. It would empower the very \nindividuals who have often perpetuated the worst VA scandals--VA \nmanagers--to threaten the livelihood of hard-working, frontline VA \nemployees and silence the voices of the whistleblowers we rely on to \ntell us when something is wrong.\n  For all of our frustration with the VA, the continued existence of a \nnonpartisan civil service is vital if we are to fix the mess at the VA \nand provide our veterans with the benefits and services that we have \npromised them and that they have earned.\n  As the Merit Systems Protection Board has stated in a report from \nMay: ``Due process is available for the whistleblower, the employee who \nbelongs to the `wrong' political party, the reservist whose periods of \nmilitary service are inconvenient to the boss, the scapegoat, and the \nperson who has been misjudged based on faulty information. Due process \nis a constitutional requirement and a small price to pay to ensure the \nAmerican people receive a merit-based civil service rather than a \ncorrupt spoils system.''\n  We should not, under the guise of ``accountability,'' destroy one of \nthe best tools we have to provide the benefits and services we have \npromised our veterans. That tool is a nonpartisan and nonpolitical VA \nworkforce.\n  We need to take steps to protect the vast majority of the high-\nperforming VA workforce from being fired at the whim of capricious or \nretaliatory managers or political appointees, not to make it even \neasier.\n  I believe H.R. 1994 violates our Constitution. The administration has \nissued a veto threat, and if enacted, H.R. 1994 would not stand up in a \ncourt of law. Ultimately, veterans would be harmed the most when courts \noverturn this policy and then reinstate bad employees at the VA.\n  Instead of scapegoating the vast majority of hard-working VA \nemployees, Congress should look for real opportunities to reform our \ncivil service in a manner that is constitutional, while providing \nadequate resources and better policies to provide outcomes at the VA.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, it is amazing that every single \nDemocrat in the Congress last year voted in favor of the very same \nrules and regulations.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), \nfrom the Fifth Congressional District.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1994, and \nI thank Chairman Miller for bringing this critical issue to light.\n  Like the chairman, I am on the side of veterans, and we in this \nNation have a sacred trust to take care of the men and women who have \ndefended our freedom. Without accountability in the VA, we cannot \nproperly care for our\n\n[[Page H5626]]\n\nveterans. While I believe the great majority of VA employees are \ndedicated and hard-working Americans doing the right thing for our \nveterans, there are those in the VA who have not acted in the best \ninterest of our veterans, and these individuals must be terminated.\n  The fact that only three employees were successfully fired due to \nwait time manipulations is a disgrace. The current system is broken. \nPoor and mediocre performance that endangers our veterans should not be \ntolerated.\n  H.R. 1994 will help remove bad actors more easily from the VA system, \nenabling the remaining dedicated employees to better serve our \nveterans. The bill will protect whistleblowers.\n  Accountability in the VA needs to happen now, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 1994.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman has 23 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Just in quick response to my good friend, Chairman Miller, bringing \nup the issue of the SES provision, yes, most of us did vote for the \nChoice Act, the provision that dealt with the SES reform to make it \neasier to fire those employees. That number of employees is a very \nsmall number. It is about 400. We are talking about addressing the \nentire 300,000-strong employees.\n  Let me just say that at the time I wish we had spent more time \nreviewing the constitutionality. I do believe the constitutionality of \nthat action is also in question.\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. TAKANO. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank my good friend for yielding, but I \nwould also say that the Constitution of the United States protects even \na single individual. So to say that it is only a small group should not \nbe anything in this discussion.\n  I would assure you that the President of the United States would have \nhad ample time to be able to go through and review it before he signed \nit into law.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Reclaiming my time, let me just say that I believe the \nConstitution applies to the Senior Executive Service as well as all of \nthe 300,000 employees of the Veterans Administration.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Chairman, as a member of the House Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1994, the so-called VA \nAccountability Act of 2015.\n  We all agree on the importance of accountability for those who care \nfor our Nation's heroes, but this is the wrong way to go about it. We \nare indeed throwing out the baby with the bathwater.\n  My colleagues have outlined a number of reasons to oppose this \nlegislation, including questionable constitutionality, the elimination \nof longstanding and important due process procedures for employees, and \nthe damage it would do to whistleblower protections; but I would like \nto focus on the big picture, on the impact this will have on VA \nemployees, many of whom are veterans themselves, and on our efforts to \nrecruit the best employees possible to serve our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  This legislation takes VA employees, from janitors who clean the \nfacilities and guards who protect the hospital, to the nurses caring \nfor our Nation's heroes and the doctors providing critical care for our \nveterans, and moves them into second-class status.\n  If H.R. 1994 passes, we will create a two-tiered Federal system, with \nVA employees less respected, less rewarded, and less protected than \nothers. The VA already struggles to attract the best and brightest to \nserve our Nation's heroes. If this legislation passes, we will make it \neven harder to recruit and retain the most qualified and best trained \nworkforce at the VA.\n  I know this because, in Las Vegas, we face challenges to fully staff \nour brand-new state-of-the-art hospital, and if the bill passes, we \nwill lose an important recruitment tool, and our veterans will be the \nones who are hurt.\n  Let's not fool ourselves here. This is just another piece of the \nRepublican agenda to demonize public employees and privatize government \nservices. Today, it is the VA. Tomorrow, it will be another agency that \nthey don't like--who knows, the EPA, the TSA, the FAA, the USDA.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. Don't ``Scott \nWalkerize'' the Federal Government.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), vice chairman of the full \ncommittee and my colleague from the Second Congressional District of \nFlorida.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the VA \nAccountability Act. The brave women and men who return from serving our \ncountry should be able to receive timely access to quality care. Our \nveterans have earned our respect and admiration.\n  In general, I believe that most employees at the VA are dedicated to \nour Nation's heroes. However, a culture of mediocrity has permeated the \nVA. Too many employees who perform terribly are not fired.\n  This bill before us today will allow the VA Secretary to fire \nemployees more easily, but the heart of this issue is about the quality \nof care for veterans. If bad actors stay at the VA, that hurts \nveterans.\n  Opponents speak in hypotheticals, but hypotheticals mean nothing in \nthe face of overwhelming evidence. We know about the real negligence \nthat goes on unpunished. This is a disservice to those who have borne \nthe battle.\n  The Washington Post reported on a VA employee who took a veteran \nseeking treatment for drug abuse to a crackhouse in a government \nvehicle and left the veteran there overnight. Sadly, it took over a \nyear to fire that employee. That is inexcusable.\n  According to the VA data given to the committee, only three VA \nemployees have been fired since the Arizona wait time scandal, \nspecifically for data manipulation. That is unreasonable.\n  This bill is needed because our Nation's heroes deserve better. That \nis the bottom line. We must protect our veterans. Support this bill.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to start by saying I am in \nopposition to this accountability bill, but I want to commend the \nchairman and the ranking member and the rest of the members of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. I think you have done a good job--and I \ndon't come up here and say that too often--because you have made it \nbipartisan.\n  Now, what possessed you to bring this bill to the floor and use the \nword ``accountability,'' I am trying to figure that out because we want \naccountability. I am a veteran, and I have fought.\n  I have got a record for 18 years, in the forefront, running point on \nveterans issues, from waiting for so darn long to get an appointment, \nto the latest problems we have had in the VA concerning addressing our \nTBI patients and our post-traumatic stress disorder patients. No one is \nmore disappointed than me in what transpired in the VA last year.\n  As a vet, I was proud to support the bipartisan VA reform legislation \nthat became law in response, but this bill isn't about making the VA \nbetter or ensuring better care and treatment for our veterans.\n  This bill is about trying to score some political points, an \nunderhanded attempt to strip VA employees, and I don't think you really \nwant to do that, but that is the result.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Did you vote for the Veterans Access Choice \nand Accountability Act last year?\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, I did.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. This language is the same language that was in \nthere. It does not take away the rights that you say are being taken \naway. You voted for the same thing last year.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Reclaiming my time, in the context of what we did a \nyear ago and the context of what is now under the guise of \naccountability is very different to me. I read both bills, the one we \nvoted on last year and this bill.\n\n[[Page H5627]]\n\n  There is important workplace protections that do not exist in this \nbill, and that is my position. We cannot start off by blaming unions, \nblaming the VA.\n  We have been through this before. There are some bad actors there. We \nare trying to get rid of them, and I want to get rid of them faster \nthan you want to get rid of them, but I don't want to take down the \nwhole group.\n  We paint with a very wide brush. We have done this with other Federal \nagencies. The reality is that the civil service protections available \nto these employees and all other Federal employees actually protect \nwhistleblowers--that is in the law already--and allow them to come \nforward when they see wrongdoing, without fearing some retaliation.\n  Whistleblowers were how we discovered the problems, Mr. Chairman, in \nthe first place. That is how we found out about what was going on in \nPhoenix and in some other places. Correct me if I am wrong; I think you \nwill agree with me.\n  I agree that poorly performing employees have no place at the VA--or \nany other Federal agency for that matter. We agree on both sides of the \naisle. We can't--as some have said, you guys are in favor of the vets, \nand we are not in favor of the vets.\n  Come on. We are away from that. We did that 15 years ago. That didn't \nwork.\n  I agree that poorly performing employees have no place at the VA--or \nany other Federal agency, not just this one. This demonization of \ngovernment employees that my colleagues are spearheading does not \nencourage productive work and, frankly, is just plain wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. We are not going to \nmake these folks any more accountable by demonizing the work.\n  By the way, just as you can't have community policing without police, \nyou have got to understand, you cannot have service with thousands and \nthousands of positions being vacant because you don't want to spend the \nmoney.\n  That is at one of the cores; it may not be the most fundamental \nreason. That is one of the reasons at least why we can't provide \nservice.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The Committee will rise informally.\n  The Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Walorski) assumed the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5627-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message in writing from the President of the United States was \ncommunicated to the House by Mr. Brian Pate, one of his secretaries.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Chairman, I don't believe I have mentioned \nthe unions one time, but I now think I understand why the disparity in \nthe vote. The senior executive level that we passed the accountability \nfor last year is nonunionized, and the people that we are talking about \ntoday are unionized.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the First District of \nTennessee (Mr. Roe).\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to join my \ncolleagues on the House floor today to speak in support of H.R. 1994, \nthe VA Accountability Act, as amended.\n  I would like to begin by noting that most of the VA's 300,000-plus \nemployees are honest, hard-working folks who get up every day and go to \nwork with the sole intention of helping our veterans, just as they do \nat Mountain Home VA Medical Center in my hometown of Johnson City, \nTennessee.\n  With the scandals at the VA medical centers and reports of \nwhistleblower retribution, it has become evident that there are more \nbad apples than we would like to believe.\n  The VA Accountability Act would provide the flexibility necessary for \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove these bad actors and send a \nmessage about the type of performance that we expect for our veterans.\n  Additionally, this bill would provide frontline employees with \nincreased whistleblower protections from retribution from superiors and \ncolleagues through the office of special counsel.\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and \nInvestigations and as a veteran myself, I understand how crucial it is \nfor whistleblowers to continue coming forward with allegations of \nmismanagement, misconduct, and outright negligence. If whistleblowers \ndon't feel safe stepping forward, we will never, never be able to fix \nthe problems at the VA.\n  I think it is important to note that nothing in this bill compels the \nSecretary to remove anyone. Let me say that again. Nothing in this bill \nrequires the Secretary to remove anyone. It simply gives the Secretary \nthe tools necessary to remove bad employees, which would be a welcomed \nauthority, I would think.\n  Mr. Chairman, we must change the culture at the VA. As the second \nlargest employing Department in the U.S. Government, second only to the \nDepartment of Defense, there are far too many bureaucratic hurdles in \nplace to reasonably and responsibly manage it.\n  Just one thing about spending at the VA, Mr. Chairman, I have been on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee since I have been in Congress, 6\\1/2\\ \nyears. The budget is up 74 percent. We are spending the money. We need \nto spend it more wisely.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I am glad that my colleagues on the other \nside believe that we need to protect whistleblowers. It is precisely \nthe at-will nature, making all of the 200,000 employees of the VA at-\nwill employees, which makes them more vulnerable to the caprices of \nmanagers and makes them less likely to want to come forward as \nwhistleblowers.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nCartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 1994, which seeks \nto transform 300,000 VA personnel to what we call at-will employees, \ncapable of being fired based on anything, including their beliefs and \nnot their merit necessarily. It effectively destroys the civil service \nas it is and as we know it at the VA.\n  Now, some jaded colleagues of mine would look at this bill and say it \nis just a clever attempt to drive a wedge between our Nation's \nveterans--all of whom we ardently support on both sides of the aisle--\nbetween those veterans and the civil servants who serve them at the VA \nand the unions that represent them.\n  This bill strips due process rights away from every nonmanagement VA \nemployee, including over 100,000 veterans. That is the key, is that \nthere are 100,000 veterans themselves affected by this bill; and they \nwill lose rights as a result if this bill passes.\n  Now, H.R. 1994 will have a chilling effect on those willing to speak \nout, and that has been addressed amply heretofore, but I am here to say \nit goes beyond whistleblowers. Whistleblowers in this country have a \nlot of protections.\n  This goes beyond whistleblowers because, remember, a lot of the bad \nactors at the VA that have led to the Phoenix situation and the others \nthat we have seen are management people.\n  Think of it. If we take away the due process rights of employees, not \nonly who would serve as whistleblowers to blow the whistle on bad \nmanagement conduct, but we take away their rights to due process before \nthey lose their jobs; what we are doing to them is that we are \nperpetuating this culture of tacit compliance with bad actor managers \nat VA.\n  For example, if an employee simply doesn't want to go along with an \nimproper and an unethical practice that a manager is asking him or her \nto do, that employee right now can say: No, I am not going to do it.\n  If we pass this bill and they refuse to do it, they can be fired for \nnot doing it. This is not the way to serve our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek), chairman of the Health \nSubcommittee.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 1994, \nlegislation to allow the VA Secretary to fire employees because of poor \nperformance or misconduct. I want to thank Chairman Miller for his \nstrong leadership on this bill.\n  The VA Committee has been relentless in our pursuit of answers and \naccountability for our veterans since the\n\n[[Page H5628]]\n\nwait time scandal first surfaced. And, yet, the VA has only held three \nindividuals responsible for these unacceptable failings.\n  I am the father of a veteran, and I served our returning heroes as a \ndoctor at the Iron Mountain VA hospital for 20 years. I know exactly \nthe quality of our veterans, and they deserve so much better.\n  In northern Michigan, we all know that, if you don't do your job, you \nget fired. It is that simple.\n  The VA needs to remember that it is not there to serve the VA, it is \nthere to serve our veterans. Until we refocus the VA on this \nfundamental and sacred mission, we will continue to have the issues of \nmismanagement and incompetence that have plagued the Department.\n  This bill takes an important step in that direction. I am pleased to \nsupport it. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to address again the fact that most of us did, in fact, \nvote for the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act SES \nprovision.\n  I want to reiterate that the courts--not Congress, not the \nPresident--determine whether a law we pass comports with the \nConstitution.\n  In hindsight, we should have given that SES provision closer \nscrutiny. We might have reacted a bit too hastily to the Phoenix \nscandal. We were all, I think, unified in our outrage.\n  However, that SES provision is now working its way through the court \nsystem and is very well possibly going to be overturned.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from the First District of Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp).\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. I thank the chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to \nspeak in support of our legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, we do know in the last year there has been a lot of \ntalk about accountability at the VA. Unfortunately, though, there has \nnot been enough action or change by the VA under this administration.\n  This bill provides much-needed tools to ensure the VA Secretary has \nthe authority and the responsibility to remove corrupt or incompetent \nemployees.\n  As a Member of Congress, I am simply tired of hearing stories about \nemployees placed on indefinite administrative leave or getting early \nretirement with full benefits for offenses that should get them fired, \nif we really cared about the veterans.\n  Ultimately, here is the purpose of this bill: ending the culture of \nnonaccountability at the VA. My bill, the Whistleblower Testimony \nTravel Act, is also included.\n  It provides much-needed protections for courageous whistleblowers who \ntestify before Congress about the shortfalls of this agency.\n  It might be hard to believe, Mr. Chairman, but, currently, if a VA \nwhistleblower is invited to testify before Congress, they are required \nto use their personal vacation time and personally cover all their own \ntravel expenses.\n  This bill would ensure that brave employees who report to Congress \nand the public on what is broken within the VA can do so on official \ntime and be compensated by the VA for their travel costs.\n  Ultimately, this legislation is about protecting our veterans. It is \nabout making sure our veterans are treated with dignity and respect. It \nis about making certain that our brave veterans have a VA that works \nfor them, not the other way around.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 12 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I just want to state for the record that, \nas of last year, under the current due process regime in effect at the \nVA, 872 permanent employees were removed, 487 more resigned in lieu of \nbeing fired, and 958 probationary employees were terminated.\n  So it is indeed very possible under the current due process regime \nfor employees to be disciplined and dismissed. We need to work more \nclosely with the VA to make sure that we empower managers to utilize \nthe current processes in place.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. I thank the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1994, the so-called \nVA Accountability Act.\n  I am the daughter of a career servicemember and a veteran. I, too, \nwas outraged last year at the findings that wait time records were \nfalsified at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  But I have to tell you--and it has been said on the other side--my \nfather actually received really good care and services in VA, as \nhundreds of thousands of veterans do all across this country, by the \nhundreds of thousands of veteran employees and workers at the VA.\n  I recall that, in my State of Maryland, 10 percent of our population \nare veterans, and we are a small State. We all care about veterans and \nthe care that they receive.\n  Just before adjourning for our August district work period last year, \nCongress passed and I voted for and the President signed into law the \nVeterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act.\n  That law gave the VA Secretary expanded authority to fire or demote \nSenior Executive Service employees, capped the amount of bonuses the VA \ncould pay each year, and it required the VA to establish penalties for \nemployees who knowingly submit false wait time data.\n  Well, enough already. Almost 1 year later House Republicans are not \nonly here skipping town early with a whole bunch of unfinished \nbusiness, but they are spending the last day of the session on an \nideological bill that is aimed to disparage Federal employees.\n  All employees, including Federal employees, must be held to the \nhighest standards for their quality of work and their behavior. There \nare mechanisms that are in place to enforce those standards for all \nFederal employees, including those at the Veterans Affairs.\n  The main provision of the bill would single out nonmanagement VA \nemployees, including over 100,000 veterans in the workforce to be fired \nor demoted without due process.\n  We work really closely with our employees at the Baltimore regional \noffice and the Washington, D.C., Medical Center. These people, many \nveterans themselves, are dedicated. They care deeply about the patients \nthey serve and the mission of the administration.\n  This legislation is nothing more than a last-minute attempt by House \nRepublicans to terminate, demoralize, and unfairly blame Federal \nemployees and shrink the government so it can't do anything for the \nAmerican people.\n\n  I will work with like-minded Members of Congress who want to do the \nright thing and provide the right kind of oversight. But this is not \nthe answer, and it would destroy VA's merit-based civil service system.\n  Let me just say this is not about accountability. It is not about \nwhistleblowers. It is not about improving services for our Nation's \nveterans.\n  This bill is nothing more than union-busting. Let's just call it what \nit is. It is union-busting, and it needs to be stopped.\n  The House Republicans should be ashamed of trying to use VA employees \nand Federal employees for their own political gain.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I would remind the gentlewoman \nthat she voted at the last minute before the August work recess for the \nVeterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act. The same language is in \nthere now. The only difference is it did not cover union employees. \nThis one does.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Sixth District of \nColorado (Mr. Coffman).\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1994, the \nVA Accountability Act.\n  You don't have to look any further than my hometown of Aurora, \nColorado, to see that the VA is in desperate need of fundamental \nreforms.\n  What happens when the VA bursts its budget on a single construction \nproject by over $1 billion? Nobody gets fired. Nobody gets disciplined. \nNobody is at fault.\n  Of course, that is not technically true. The VA was willing to fire \none person involved, a whistleblower attempting to warn VA leaders \nearly on of the growing problems with the project.\n\n[[Page H5629]]\n\n  To make matters worse, the VA didn't just fail to discipline the \npeople in charge of the Aurora project, but they awarded the VA's \nconstruction chief over $600,000 in bonuses and let him retire with a \nfull pension.\n  There is a culture of bureaucratic incompetence and corruption within \nthe VA which is hurting our Nation's veterans and wasting billions of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  The VA Accountability Act is an important step in the right \ndirection, and I urge its full support.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Brown), the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, let me just say, first of all, \nthat I have been on this committee for the entire time I have been in \nCongress, 23 years.\n  What I have always enjoyed about this committee is the bipartisan \nnature of this committee. But let me just tell you this bill, H.R. \n1994, I do not support.\n  The gentleman from Florida, Chairman Miller, has said repeatedly that \nwe voted for this provision in the Choice Act. And the only reason we \ndid it was because these were union people or not union people.\n  I went to every single meeting, every single conference, and this \nprovision that you are talking about--the devil is always in the \ndetails.\n  Maybe we need to make sure we read every bill closely because I was \nnot--yes, the Secretary has the authority to fire people. But we want \nto make sure that they have due process.\n  We are voting to give the VA the additional resources they need to do \naway with the backlog.\n  Would the gentleman from Florida respond to that. Because none of us \nwere voting for H.R. 1994. It was a bad year for Congress, a bad year \nfor the American people.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I would say to the gentlewoman from Florida \nthat, if she would ask a question, I will be more than happy to answer \nher question.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, Chairman Miller has said \nrepeatedly that this provision that you have was in the base bill of \nthe Choice program and that we all knew that we were voting to give the \nSecretary additional authority to fire people.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. That is correct.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. TAKANO. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Yesterday in the committee I heard someone say \nthat the goal is to close all of the VA facilities and privatize it.\n  Now, let me be clear that that is not the goal of the Members on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I would also say that H.R. 4031 \nlast year was a stand-alone bill that dealt specifically with firing \nsenior executive-level individuals, the same language that is in here \nnow for the rest of the VA.\n  The Democrats unanimously supported that language in the Veterans \nAccess, Choice and Accountability Act.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the State of Indiana (Mrs. \nWalorski).\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the VA \nAccountability Act. I also want to thank Chairman Miller for sponsoring \nthis bill and for his work to reform the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  It wasn't long ago that news reports of VA mismanagement made \nheadlines across this country. Reports surfaced of veterans dying due \nto mismanaged wait times and senior executives receiving bonuses \ninstead of receiving punishment for knowingly allowing this negligence \nto occur.\n  Over the past year, the Veterans' Affairs Committee has continued to \nuncover instances of mismanagement or misconduct by VA employees.\n  We discovered the VA often does not hold employees accountable for \ntheir actions. When the VA attempts to take disciplinary action against \nan employee, the process is so complicated and lengthy that such action \nrarely occurs.\n  In May, VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson admitted that it was very \ndifficult to fire bad employees. For too long, taxpayers have been \nfooting the bill to pay poor-performing employees to provide \nsubstandard care to our veterans.\n  Only in government are special protections put in place that protect \nthose who cannot appropriately do their job.\n  However, I also recognize there are individuals in the VA who do a \ngreat job for our veterans, and they should be commended for that.\n  This legislation simply builds on last year's law that gave the VA \nSecretary the authority to remove employees for poor performance or \nmisconduct.\n  The VA Accountability Act of 2015 expands that power further to the \nentire VA workforce, giving the Secretary increased authority to remove \nemployees who are not meeting the standards of service that veterans \ndeserve and taxpayers expect.\n  In addition, the legislation protects whistleblowers and would \nshorten the appeal period and end what many veterans believe is a \nnever-ending process to remove employees who may be damaging the \nDepartment's reputation and, even worse, putting veterans at risk.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  This bill takes those steps to ensure our Nation's servicemen and -\nwomen receive the care they rightfully deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill because our \nveterans deserve nothing but the best.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to point out we keep getting back to this point about \neverybody voted for the SES provision that is only now being extended \nto all employees now, but I want to remind my colleagues that that \nprovision was part of a large, large conference report that included \nthe $10 billion to address the problems we had in Phoenix. There were \n1,500 graduate medical education slots. It was a huge, huge, huge bill.\n  There were a number of people who did have concerns about the \nprovision that affected the SES employees, but given the enormity of \nthe situation we were trying to address, I believe that many folks just \nbelieve that it was the best thing to do to come together on a \nbipartisan basis and pass a bill that addressed the situation in \nPhoenix.\n  I also want to address another issue. H.R. 1994 does not protect \nwhistleblowers to the extent that whistleblowers are protected now \nunder the current regime. In fact, it creates extra hurdles for \nwhistleblowers, and I bring this point up because we would not know \nabout the terrible egregious situation in Phoenix without \nwhistleblowers coming forward.\n  What do I mean by that? This bill does nothing to protect the firing \nof a whistleblower who has not yet filed an official complaint before \nthey even have the opportunity to report danger to patient safety, \nwrongdoing, malfeasance, or discrimination.\n  This bill will encourage bad employees to file for whistleblower \nstatus to prevent themselves from being fired, and these bad employees \nwill overburden the office of special counsel with frivolous \ncomplaints.\n  Now, if you are an at-will employee and you are under threat of \nimmediate dismissal, an immediate threat to your livelihood, that is \neven more of an intimidating situation for that employee not to want to \ncome forward as a whistleblower.\n  Mr. Chairman, I believe that this bill actually worsens the situation \nfor whistleblowers and does not protect them more; it protects them \nless. It gives them extra burdens.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I would say that the statutory definition in chapter 5 of a \nwhistleblower ``means a complaint by an employee of the Department \ndisclosing, or assisting another employee to disclose, a potential \nviolation of any law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, \ngross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific \ndanger to public health and safety.''\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana, Dr. Abraham, an \nable-bodied member of our committee.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for bringing up this \nvery strong bill which, in my opinion, will be lifesaving for some of \nour Nation's heroes.\n\n[[Page H5630]]\n\n  I rise today in support of the VA Accountability Act of 2015. I am a \nproud original cosponsor of the bill, and I believe the legislation is \nvital to rooting out the pervasive bureaucracy that plagues the Federal \nGovernment.\n  As a direct result of this broken system, we have seen instances \nwhere a VA employee actually took a patient to a crackhouse to get a \n``fix.'' It took an entire year for that employee to be fired--an \nentire year.\n  As a direct result of this broken system, we have seen senior \nemployees caught participating in retaliation against whistleblowers, \nonly to remain on the job.\n  As a direct result of this broken system, we have seen employees who \nwere caught manipulating veterans' disability claims.\n  Do you know what happened to those employees? They were promoted. \nThey received bonuses. This is unacceptable on so many levels, and it \nis time for it to stop. We have to make the VA work for the veteran. \nThe current law protects those who have forgotten that they work for \nthe veteran, not the other way around.\n  Even the Veterans Affairs Department's own Deputy Secretary, Sloan \nGibson, as you heard before, recently admitted at a congressional \nhearing that ``it is too hard to fire someone at the VA.'' There is no \nexcuse for those who fail to do their job and then get promoted, none.\n  H.R. 1994 is a giant step forward in ensuring that good employees are \nprotected, ensuring whistleblowers are protected, and, most \nimportantly, that our Nation's heroes are protected.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for the veterans who have to stand \nup for us by supporting the VA Accountability Act of 2015.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), from the Sixth District.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, should the Secretary of \nthe VA be allowed to remove or demote an employee of the Department for \npoor performance or misconduct? That is the question, as I see it.\n  Common sense to me dictates that, if an employee is poorly performing \nor has demonstrated incompetence or dishonesty, as we have seen at VAs \nin Philadelphia and across the country, we need to be able to get rid \nof them--common sense.\n  I hear those who are speaking about due process violations implicit \nor explicit in this legislation, and I simply just don't see it. For \none, there was a law passed last Congress; I wasn't here then, but it \nwas part of a larger, broader bill that brought more money to the VA, \nand with more money, there should be more accountability. I think that \nis common sense.\n  Here is the example: Poorly performing employee, employee who \nmisbehaves, demoted or terminated? Under this bill, that employee, \nwithin 7 days, gets to file an expedited appeal with the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, and then the MSPB would have to make a final decision \nwithin 45 days. If you get fired, if you get demoted, if you think that \nthat was wrong, there is a process that is in place to address that.\n  This comes on the heels of a lot of problems in the VA. We need more \naccountability, and we need more transparency, and we hear that all the \ntime. This bill addresses that.\n  This bill also provides more protections to whistleblowers. It is the \ncourageous whistleblowers, through their tenacity, that have brought a \nlot of the problems forward. This bill seeks to protect them.\n  I want to thank the chairman for his leadership.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I wish to address this issue of the appeals process that takes place \npost facto. The Supreme Court decisions and case law make very clear \nthat Federal employees are entitled to due process on the front end and \nthat this bill clearly does not meet that upfront, front-loaded due \nprocess moment.\n  Clearly, 45 days, the Board that makes these decisions, if they don't \nmake a decision, the decision for the firing stands, so they do not \nhave to make a firm decision, and there is no appeal. There is no \nappeal. That decision is final.\n\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the Secretary of the VA hopefully \nis always appointed by the President with a sense of merit, but I \nremind you that these are political appointees confirmed by the Senate, \nas are the top appointees in any Federal department.\n  You do away with due process rights, you do away with the very \ncornerstone of a merit-based civil service system. You subject it long \nterm to becoming a spoils system to be dismissed, rehired at the whim \nof any incoming administration.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  My bill provides all employees an appeal to the MSPB. Post-\ndepravation is not an issue; and regarding pre-depravation due process, \nmy bill provides the same protections as the Choice Act, which the MSPB \nhas held does not, on its face, violate the due process clause.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. \nRadewagen), a new member of our committee.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Miller for \nintroducing this important legislation that will increase \naccountability in the VA.\n  For too long, our veterans, including the large number I represent in \nAmerican Samoa, have been subjected to improper treatment, long wait \ntimes, and other serious matters that have yet to be addressed.\n  This commonsense legislation, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, \nwill enable the VA to hold those who do not perform their duties \naccountable, which will surely lead to better services for our \nveterans. No longer should our veterans come second to lifelong \nbureaucrats who have gamed the system while our veterans have suffered.\n  I want to be clear that I believe the vast majority of those VA \nemployees who serve our veterans do so honorably and are dedicated to \nmaking sure that those they serve are awarded the services and benefits \nthey have so rightfully earned. However, it is clear that there are \nsome bad apples in the VA, and we must not let them continue to ruin \nthe bunch.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to, once again, thank Chairman Miller for his \nwork on this bill, and I look forward to seeing it signed into law.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask how much \ntime is remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 2\\1/2\\ minutes. The \ngentleman from California has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues that the front-end provisions \nthat were accorded to the SES employees, we stripped them completely of \nthe front-end due process.\n  Only with a regulatory move by the VA itself, instituted a 5-day \nprocedure of due process because they, too, believed that case law \nrequired at least some front end, and that was over the objections of \nmany of my colleagues. That rule was over the objections of many of my \ncolleagues.\n  H.R. 1994 strips away front-end due process for all 348,728 \nemployees, of whom 114,740 are veterans. Before we paint them as \nfaceless bureaucrats, one of every three VA employees is a veteran who \nhas laid their life on the line for our country. I think we need to \ntalk about our VA employees with respect.\n  Even my good friend, the chairman of the VA committee, has said the \nvast majority of the employees are good, hard-working, competent, good-\nintentioned people. They deserve to be treated fairly; they deserve to \nbe treated with respect.\n  Certainly, our frontline employees, our frontline employees, we need \nto protect them from a capricious, politically motivated manager who \nwill fire them at will and intimidate them into not being a \nwhistleblower.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the VA \nAccountability Act.\n  In his recent remarks at the VFW national convention in Pittsburgh,\n\n[[Page H5631]]\n\nBarack Obama discussed the outbreak of Legionnaire's disease at the \nPittsburgh VA that killed six veterans and sickened many more.\n  The Office of the Inspector General concluded that systemic failures \nand mismanagement at the VA were to blame for the outbreak, and the \nPresident stated unequivocally: ``Whenever there are any missteps, \nthere is no excuse.''\n  Mr. Chairman, that is the essence of the VA Accountability Act. With \nthe enactment of this important legislation, there is no longer any \nexcuse for chronic dysfunction at the VA. There is no excuse for the VA \nkeeping bad employees, placing them on indefinite paid leave, or \nrewarding them with lavish bonuses. There is no excuse for the VA \nlooking the other way when there is retaliation against courageous \nwhistleblowers.\n  Simply put, this legislation ensures that there is no excuse for the \nVA failing our veterans and their families anymore.\n  I thank the committee for its hard work on this legislation, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  In closing, there has been a lot said today about a lack of due \nprocess. I do want to remind my colleagues that, in the Cleveland Board \nof Education v. Loudermill of 1985, it basically states that, if post-\ndeprivation due process includes a full hearing, on appeal, the Supreme \nCourt has long held that pre-deprivation due process need only be \nminimal, to only include notice of charges, an explanation of the \nevidence, and an opportunity to present their side of the story.\n  In fact, in the Merit Systems Protection Board ruling, the \nadministrative law judge in the Hellman case basically said he did not \nfind the response period was so short--it was 5 days--as to constitute \non its face a due process violation, i.e., lack of meaningful \nopportunity to respond to the charges.\n  There has been a lot said so far, and I am sure there will be more \nthat will be said on the floor as amendments are brought; but I \nencourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1994, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to \nH.R. 1994, the VA Accountability Act of 2015. While no member of this \nbody will deny that there is a need for fundamental and transparent \nreform at the Department of Veterans Affairs this bill does nothing to \naddress the systematic issues that have plagued the VA.\n  Currently, VA Management has many different routes to hold their \nemployees accountable through existing law. H.R. 1994 would allow the \nVA to immediately fire employees for poor performance, violating a \nworker's right to due process. I'm concerned that the bill would \neffectively make the VA the only ``at-will'' federal agency and this \nwould further deplete the talent and retention of the public servants \nwho serve our veterans.\n  I fully support Mr. Takano's amendment in nature of a substitute \nwhich would allow the VA to immediately suspend without pay any \nemployee who's suspected misconducted threatened health or safety then \nallow the employee to tell their side of the story, preventing cases of \npolitical patronage and an increase in false whistleblower cases.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1994, \nthe so-called ``VA Accountability Act of 2015.'' There is nothing more \nimportant than providing for the men and women who have made so many \nsacrifices for our country. However, today's legislation is a fake \nsolution and provides no real fix to the fundamental problems at the \nVA.\n  This legislation turns hundreds of thousands of VA employees--\nincluding many who served in the armed services and are veteran's \nthemselves--into at-will employees. As a result, this would open the \ndoor for political abuse and witch-hunts, effectively creating a \nmechanism where career federal employees could be removed because of \ntheir views or political affiliation. In addition, turning individuals \ninto at-will employees would likely discourage whistleblowers from \ncoming forward out of fear of being terminated. Moreover, if this \nlegislation passes, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be the \nonly federal agency with at-will employment, making it harder to \nrecruit and retain the best and brightest employees who are needed to \nserve our veterans.\n  I was disappointed that a substitute amendment offered by Congressman \nTakano was not adopted. Rep. Takano's amendment would immediately \nsuspend without pay any employee that is found to put a veteran's \nhealth and safety in jeopardy. However, it also ensures that all \nemployees--included whistleblowers--are granted their constitutional \nright to due process. On the other hand, H.R. 1994 would dismantle \ncivil service protections that have been in place for decades. It would \nstrip away important protections for federal workers and would deny a \nVA employee the opportunity to appeal a decision to the full Merit \nSystems Protection Board.\n  Unfortunately, nothing in this bill addresses the systemic problems \nthat continue to plague the VA health care system. I urge my colleagues \nto oppose this legislation.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren). All time for general debate has \nexpired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute recommended by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, printed \nin the bill. The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute \nshall be considered as read.\n  The text of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute is \nas follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1994\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``VA Accountability Act of \n     2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REMOVAL OR DEMOTION OF EMPLOYEES BASED ON PERFORMANCE \n                   OR MISCONDUCT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 7 of title 38, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 715.

ACCOUNTABILITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO \n                   INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 7 of title 38, United States Code, \n     as amended by section 8, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 727. Accountability of Secretary to Inspector General\n\n       ``(a) Submission of Reports.--(1) At the same time as the \n     Inspector General of the Department submits to the Secretary \n     a covered report, the Inspector General shall submit to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives a copy of such covered report.\n       ``(2) The Inspector General shall include in each covered \n     report submitted under paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) an explanation of any changes to the covered report \n     recommended by the Secretary during the period in which the \n     Inspector General was preparing the covered report; and\n       ``(B) a list of the names of each responsible manager.\n       ``(3) The Inspector General may not make public the names \n     of responsible managers submitted under paragraph (2)(B).\n       ``(b) Performance of Responsible Managers.--(1) The \n     Secretary shall--\n       ``(A) promptly notify each responsible manager of a covered \n     issue by not later than seven days after the date on which \n     the Inspector General submits a covered report to the \n     Secretary;\n       ``(B) direct such manager to resolve such issue; and\n       ``(C) provide such manager with appropriate counseling and \n     a mitigation plan with respect to resolving such issue.\n       ``(2) The Secretary shall ensure that any performance \n     review of a responsible manager includes an evaluation of \n     whether the manager took appropriate actions during the \n     period covered by the review to respond to a covered issue.\n       ``(3) The Secretary may not pay to a responsible manager \n     any bonus or award under chapter 45 or 53 of title 5 or any \n     other bonus or award authorized under such title or this \n     title if a covered issue is unresolved.\n       ``(c) Role of Inspector General.--Any authority of the \n     Inspector General provided under this section is in addition \n     to any responsibility or authority provided to the Inspector \n     General in the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

Accountability of Secretary to Inspector General.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 388, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Benishek) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We have a real opportunity here to inject accountability into the \nVA's culture of mismanagement. The Benishek-Sinema amendment would help \nensure that, when a VA inspector general identifies a problem and \noffers recommendations to fix it, the changes are made, and the job \ngets done.\n  Today, the IG regularly issues reports on problems at the Department, \nand most of the time, the VA agrees with many of the recommendations \nand promises to change. The problem is no manager is actually named as \nbeing responsible for making those changes. When no one is in charge, \nnothing gets done, and there is no one to hold responsible. This \namendment makes key changes that will give the IG's reports teeth, that \nwill bring to the VA the solutions our veterans deserve.\n  It increases transparency, and it allows the public to see the IG's \nreport related to alleged employee misconduct. It requires the release \nof any modifications that the VA has asked the IG to make.\n  It also requires the IG to identify specific managers who are \nresponsible for fixing the problems identified in the reports. Their \nnames will not be released, but this will allow Congress and the VA to \nknow who is responsible for fixing the problem. Those individuals will \nnot be able to receive a bonus or any performance award until the IG \ncertifies that the problem is resolved.\n  Finally, it reduces the burden on a supervisor when it is necessary \nto fire a bad employee. A supervisor cannot effectively manage if his \nhands are tied.\n  This amendment has a history of bipartisan support, passing as a \nstand-alone bill by voice vote in the last Congress. It has also \ngarnered the support of veterans' service organizations, including the \nAmerican Legion, the VFW, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nand the Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n  I thank my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Sinema, for her \nleadership and for joining me on the issue. I am grateful for Chairman \nMiller's support and for that of the entire Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. Chairman Miller has been an incredible voice and advocate \nfor our veterans.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. TAKANO. I thank the gentleman from Michigan, my good friend, for \noffering his amendment. Reluctantly, I rise in opposition to the \namendment offered by the gentleman and Representative Sinema.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require the IG to identify problem \nemployees at the VA, and it would prohibit the VA from giving \nperformance pay to these identified employees.\n  I believe this amendment could compromise the integrity of the VA \ninspector general and the ability of the VA IG to investigate \nwhistleblower complaints and bring to light problems at the VA.\n  The amendment would force the IG to concentrate its efforts on \nidentifying bad managers by name rather than focusing on recommending \nsolutions to problems and conducting thorough and complete \ninvestigations.\n  Requiring the IG to forward anything submitted to the VA would \ninterject Congress into the very manner in which the IG drafts and \nfinalizes reports. This change would call into question the integrity \nof the investigations that Congress relies on to shape policy and to \nfind solutions.\n  Finally, I believe that this amendment is vaguely drafted and that it \nraises more questions than it seeks to answer. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, once again, Members who saw this \ngo through regular order last year through the committee and then pass \nthe full House are now in opposition.\n  I rise in support of Dr. Benishek's amendment. He has been the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Health since the 113th Congress. It is \na position that I offered him based on his dedication to our Nation's \nveterans. Dr. Benishek's amendment to the VA Accountability Act of 2015 \ncontains the text of his bill, the Demanding Accountability for \nVeterans Act.\n  The Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act is a bipartisan piece \nof legislation that is supported by many veterans' service \norganizations. His amendment would require the inspector general to be \ntransparent with Congress about the reports that are written about VA \nfacilities and programs and the changes that are being made to those \nreports at the VA's behest.\n  The amendment would also require the VA to provide the name of the VA \nemployee who is responsible for implementing recommendations issued by \nthe IG, to direct that employee to take action, and to prohibit the VA \nfrom paying a bonus or a performance award to that employee if \nappropriate action is not taken. In the most recent semiannual report \nto Congress, the VA inspector general reported that 1,150 \nrecommendations were left open by the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nThat is not acceptable.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Arizona (Ms. Sinema).\n  Ms. SINEMA. I thank Mr. Takano, Chairman Miller, and Chairman \nBenishek for their efforts to improve the quality of care and services \ndelivered to our veterans.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Benishek-Sinema amendment is a commonsense \namendment that will bring accountability to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. The amendment, based on a bill that Dr. Benishek and I \nintroduced, the Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act, requires the \nVA to address problems identified by the VA Office of Inspector \nGeneral, and it ensures that individual managers are held accountable \nif issues remain unresolved.\n  Our amendment requires that, in each covered VA inspector general \nreport, the Secretary of the VA assign specific managers who will be \nresponsible for fixing specific problems identified within the IG's \nreport. The Secretary must give the responsible managers appropriate \ncounseling and plans of action to resolve each covered issue. Bonuses \ncannot be paid if a covered issue remains unresolved, and how a manager \nresponds to the challenge will be included in that individual's \nperformance evaluation.\n  It is unacceptable that issues raised by the VA inspector general \nover and over, from wait times to medical staffing, remain unresolved \nby the VA. This amendment will hold the VA Secretary and senior \nmanagement accountable for ensuring these warnings are not ignored \nagain.\n  We have a long way to go to change the system and culture of the VA, \nand I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that veterans come first.\n\n  Again, I thank Chairman Miller, Chairman Benishek, and Mr. Takano for \ntheir leadership and for their work on veterans' issues. I especially \nthank\n\n[[Page H5637]]\n\nChairman Benishek for his thoughtful, bipartisan approach to this \namendment.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 2 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from California has 2\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this measure has \nsignificant applicability to the ``right here, right now'' problems \nassociated with the VA. Specifically, I am going to cite the oversight \nefforts involving the Philadelphia VA Regional Office.\n  It has been nearly a year since the Philadelphia VA problems were \nfirst reported. We have an IG report; we have an AIB report; and we \nhave egregious allegations that have been proven true. Yet, as a Member \nof Congress who represents tens of thousands of veterans who rely on \nthe Philadelphia VA for benefits and services, I still don't have \nanswers. I still don't know who is responsible or know of all of the \nspecific misconduct and behaviors or know of the repercussions for the \nemployees who are responsible.\n  Our tools for providing oversight over the VA need updating to \nreflect that there must be transparency when investigating and \ndisciplining bad employees. This amendment and this bill move us in the \nright direction towards accountability and transparency.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Boustany).\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in full support of this \namendment.\n  For far too long, the VA has condoned an apathetic culture that \nencourages its employees to ignore their duties and to cover up serious \nproblems.\n  Last year, the staff of VISN 16, which includes my home State of \nLouisiana, admitted to inappropriately denying hundreds of veterans' \nmedical care claims. When my office asked how many veterans' claims \nwere being inappropriately denied, we were met with excuses and \nobfuscation. That is completely unacceptable.\n  One important provision of this amendment would prevent bonuses and \nperformance awards for VA employees who fail to fix these problems. \nThis provision is similar to an amendment I offered to the VA \nappropriations measure this past April. No small business in Louisiana \nwould survive by allowing employees with such poor success rates to \nearn bonuses. I believe this is one of the most effective ways we can \nforce accountability on this overly bureaucratic agency.\n  I thank Chairman Miller and Chairman Benishek for their efforts in \nthis cause.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and hold the VA \naccountable for their inadequate and unacceptable performance.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Takano\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-234.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to House Resolution 388, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 10 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, in Congress, we can all agree that greater \naccountability is sorely needed within the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. We are all outraged that VA employees whose misconduct has \nharmed veterans have remained in their jobs. Last summer, we were all \nhorrified that the VA medical centers in Phoenix and elsewhere \nmanipulated patient wait times. This spring, in Denver, we were \nfrustrated by the huge cost overruns with no real accountability.\n  I agree with my Republican colleagues that the VA must do a better \njob of using its existing authorities to hold bad employees, such as \nthese, accountable. Unfortunately, this lack of accountability has \novershadowed the excellent work of the vast majority of VA employees--\nover a third of them veterans themselves, whose genuine caring and \ntireless efforts honor veterans' service to our Nation. I believe it is \nwrong to assume VA employees are guilty until proven innocent, and I \nbelieve that H.R. 1994 is the wrong way to achieve greater \naccountability at the VA.\n  This afternoon, I am offering an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to H.R. 1994. The text of my amendment is based on my bill, \nH.R. 2999, the Fair VA Accountability Act. I urge all of my colleagues \nto support it today.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  My substitute would provide real accountability at the VA in a manner \nthat preserves the important due process rights of VA employees and \nprotects our veterans, and my substitute would improve the status quo \nby giving VA an additional accountability mechanism.\n  It would allow VA to immediately fire, without pay, any VA employee \nwhose misconduct presents a clear and present danger to public health \nand safety while providing adequate due process on the back end for \nsuch employees.\n  This standard comes from Supreme Court precedent regarding \nconstitutional due process for Federal employees and mirrors a similar \nDepartment of Defense provision.\n  My substitute would mean that, if a VA employee's behavior threatened \nveterans' health or safety, VA could immediately fire that employee. \nCurrent law only allows VA to ask such an employee to leave work while \nstill receiving pay.\n  My substitute would also cap paid administrative leave at 14 days so \nVA employees would not sit at home and collect a paycheck while \nfighting a disciplinary action.\n  My substitute would shield our bold VA whistleblowers by protecting \nexisting laws and requiring the VA to backpay any whistleblower \nunjustly fired for reporting wrongdoing.\n  In sum, my substitute would provide the VA with the tools it needs to \nremove dangerous employees immediately and protect the health and \nsafety of veterans and others, and my bill does so in a way which \npreserves important concepts of due process for VA employees.\n  These employees live in our communities and States. They are our \nfriends and neighbors and sometimes our family members. Ensuring basic \nAmerican notions of fairness is what my amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute provides and, frankly, what H.R. 1994 does not.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his \namendment in the nature of a substitute, but at this time I have to \noppose it.\n  I appreciate that Mr. Takano does believe that we need to provide \nreal accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs. But as I \nsaid at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical \namendment, this substitute fails to achieve true accountability.\n  I am supportive of section 3 of his amendment, which would limit \nadministrative leave for all employees to 14 days, and I agree with \nthis commonsense policy. But I would note that this limitation language \nis already included in my bill, H.R. 1994.\n  My main concern with the substitute lies within section 2, which \nwould dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my \nbill of removing VA employees.\n  The substitute would only give the Secretary the authority to remove \nan employee if they represent a ``clear and direct threat to public \nhealth or safety,'' which is almost an unobtainable, if not \nimmeasurable, bar to reach.\n  This undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the \nSecretary to remove any employee under this new authority, thereby \nensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service \nrules would continue.\n  Unfortunately, as I said moments ago, maintaining the status quo is \nnot acceptable. I would submit that the standard of a clear and direct \nthreat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees \ninvolved with many of today's ongoing scandals at the VA, including the \ncost overruns of the Denver hospital; the budget shortfall that we are \ngoing to vote to fix later today, a $3 billion budget fix; the \nmanipulation of data at the Philadelphia regional office; the \nallegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the \ntune of $6 billion; the allegations of employees at the Los Angeles \nregional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans' claim \ninformation; and the many other egregious actions that continue to come \nto light at VA almost every single day.\n  Members, these are the very type of employees that our constituents \nand\n\n[[Page H5639]]\n\nour veterans expect to be held accountable, but the standard proposed \nin this substitute would not give the Secretary the authority to \nprovide the accountability we all know that VA desperately needs.\n  I also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in \nthe substitute to actually remove these employees.\n  I believe that, unlike the procedures that I have laid out in my \nbill, which set definitive timelines to remove someone while \nmaintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights, the \nprocedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on \nindefinite suspension for months, if not years, awaiting a hearing for \nthe Secretary's final decision.\n  It has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other \nside that passage of H.R. 1994 would return to a spoils or an at-will \nemployment system. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Let me compare a spoils or an at-will system to the protections \noffered in 1994.\n  First, a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone, \nusually partisan supporters, that they want to reward for their \npolitical support with a Federal job. In contrast, H.R. 1994 has no \neffect on the current hiring process.\n  Second, a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will \nand subject to firing for any or even no reason. Again, that is hardly \nthe case in my bill. H.R. 1994 requires proof in the form of poor \nperformance or misconduct.\n  Additionally, my bill requires the Secretary to report the reasons \nfor any such removals to Congress within 30 days.\n  Third, in a spoils system, a fired employee has no right of appeal. \nIn contrast, under H.R. 1994, fired employees still have due process \nrights, including 45 days to appeal their firing to the Merit Systems \nProtection Board.\n  Fourth, in a spoils system, there is no such thing as paid \nadministrative leave. You are fired, gone with no pay.\n  Under civil service rules, a poor-performing employee can be placed \non administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time, as we have \nseen with several miscreants identified during our investigations.\n  H.R. 1994, on the other hand, would limit the Secretary's authority \nto put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days, at which time \nthe Secretary must bring that person back to Active Duty.\n  Fifth, in a spoils system, there are no protections for \nwhistleblowers. In an at-will system, employees may or may not be \ncovered by whistleblower protection, employee discrimination, et \ncetera, type laws, depending on the type of employer.\n  However, under H.R. 1994, employees are protected by both of these \ntypes of laws, plus the procedures and additional protections created \nunder section 4 of my bill.\n  Employees cannot be removed without OSC approval if an open case \nexists, and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open \ncase under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the \nOffice of Accountability review makes a final determination.\n  So, ultimately, not only does this amendment set a standard for \nremoval that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at \nthe Department, it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a \nfinal approval is complete. This is not fair to veterans, to the \nDepartment, or to the employee in question.\n  To reemphasize, I also have issues with the whistleblower protections \nthat are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this \nsubstitute.\n  The only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment \nsays that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the Merit Systems \nProtection Board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the \nwhistle.\n  Not only does this not provide any protections on the front end, but \nit would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections I have \nincluded in section 4 of my bill.\n  We all know that the Secretary has a tall task to restore trust and \nto rebuild the VA. We have to give him every tool possible to complete \nthat mission. This amendment does not come close to giving him the tool \nthat he needs today.\n  So, once again, I urge Members to support change and stand with \nveterans, not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the \nstatus quo. I urge Members to oppose the Takano substitute.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, my good friend and colleague, Chairman \nMiller of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, has implied that my clear \nand present danger standard in the substitute that I have offered is \ntoo narrow and does not give the Secretary enough tools to dismiss bad \nemployees. I respectfully disagree.\n  Particularly in the case of the Phoenix VA, the hospital's director, \nSharon Helman, clearly posed a threat to the health and safety of \nveterans. Under my substitute, she would have been immediately removed.\n  Similarly, many of the speakers on the other side of the aisle cited \na crackhouse case where a VA employee took a veteran to a crackhouse.\n  Now, my substitute and the clear and present standard, the health and \nsafety standard that we have put forward, would clearly have addressed \nthat employee and would have made that employee immediately \ndismissible.\n  Let me remind you again that VA does have current title 5 procedures \nthat they have been using to remove poor-performing employees.\n  We should encourage the VA to use them better, to use the tools that \nthey have. I remind my colleagues that last year 872 permanent \nemployees were removed, 487 more resigned in lieu of being fired, and \n958 probationary employees were terminated.\n  Now, the fact that the VA wait list scandal emerged out of Phoenix \nwas because we do have protections for whistleblowers. They could be \nstrengthened.\n  Nevertheless, the current civil service protections, the due process \nprotections, afforded those employees the security to move forward and \nto come forward as whistleblowers.\n  Again, my amendment in the form of a substitute fixes the \ndeficiencies of my good friend Chairman Miller's bill.\n  I have said before that I believe his bill puts extra barriers in \nfront of whistleblowers in coming forward. It complicates and makes \nmore cumbersome their ability to come forward.\n  If you are an employee who is under threat of dismissal and \nimmediately losing your livelihood, that is a huge, huge barrier to \nyour coming forward as a whistleblower.\n  That is exactly what his bill would do. It would make everyone in the \nVA an at-will employee.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent), the chairman of the subcommittee that has \njurisdiction over the VA budget.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Miller for his \nleadership on this.\n  I rise to oppose the substitute amendment. But I want to express my \ngratitude to the chairman for the work that he and the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee have done, all the work they have put into this \nlegislation to prevent another VA catastrophe by making sure that the \nChoice Act funds we appropriated last year can be used for related \nveterans' community care expenditures.\n  This bill will ensure that no veterans hospital or care for any \nveteran will be jeopardized due to the VA's continuing mismanagement of \nthe influx of patients that followed last year's passage of the Choice \nAct.\n  Once again, Congress is providing the VA with all the resources they \nrequire to provide timely, quality care to our veterans and their loved \nones.\n  It was only about a month ago that we were informed by the Department \nthat there was a shortfall of the magnitude of almost $3.4 billion, and \nhere we are today remedying this problem.\n  The bill also proposes something that is sorely needed: the \nconsolidation of the myriad programs VA uses to provide care outside \ntheir facilities.\n  Veterans are confused. VA employees are confused. Doctors are \nconfused. Reimbursement rates are not standardized.\n  We need to make sure that the non-VA care program is thriving so that \npatients can get the high-quality care they deserve in their homes, in \ntheir\n\n[[Page H5640]]\n\nhome communities, right where they live.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans \nAffairs and Related Agencies, I will continue to devote time and \nattention to pinpointing the VA's future funding needs and maintaining \nvigilant oversight of their appropriated taxpayer dollars.\n  The VA must develop systems that give us accurate and on-time \ninformation and engage with Congress in a transparent and timely \nmanner. We cannot and should not continue to lurch from one VA funding \ncrisis to another.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  What we have seen is terrible management and a terrible disservice to \nour veterans by the VA in many of these cases; we need to fix it. I \nbelieve the Secretary is a good and honorable man trying to do his \nbest, but the taxpayers deserve better, and our veterans most assuredly \ndo.\n  I urge passage of this bill. I thank the chairman and the leadership \nof the committee.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Brown), the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Let me just be clear. I am just amazed that, on \nthe last day of the session, we are spending the entire afternoon \ndiscussing H.R. 1994--a bill that the Senate will not pick up; and if, \nby some miracle, it passed, the President would veto it--when there are \nso many other things that we could be discussing.\n  How about addressing H.R. 3266, which will give the Secretary the \nauthority to run the VA like a business, which is what we keep saying?\n  I support the substitute amendment. The accountability substitute is \noffered today because it brings real accountability to the VA while \nmaintaining constitutionality due process protection for civil service \nemployees.\n  At the Committee on Veterans' Affairs over the past 2 years, we have \nlearned of widespread mismanagement and--let me emphasize--lack of \ntraining at the VA. The problems that the VA has have gone back for \nmany years, over 30. Maybe if we had adequately funded VA, they would \nhave fewer problems.\n  The majority has introduced H.R. 1994, which attempts to increase \naccountability by allowing VA to immediately fire any employee for \nmisconduct with only limited due process. The substitute increases \naccountability by allowing VA to immediately suspend, without pay, any \nemployee whose misconduct posed a direct threat to veterans' health and \nsafety.\n  Unlike H.R. 1994, the substitute provides sufficient due process \nrights to meet constitutional requirements by providing an accused \nemployee with a fair chance to tell their side of the story.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this substitute and vote against \nH.R. 1994.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. May I inquire how much time is remaining on my \nside?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 1 minute remaining. \nThe gentleman from California has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote \nfor my amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  Mr. Chairman, I respectfully yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is \nbasically gut H.R. 1994, which is an accountability bill that provides \nthe Secretary with a desperately needed tool in order to hold people \naccountable within the Department.\n  I would like to read for the Record the 11 veterans service \norganizations that support the removal authority: American Legion, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nParalyzed Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, Student \nVeterans of America, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Military \nOfficers Association of America, Reserve Officers Association, \nConcerned Veterans for America, and AMVETS.\n  I remind Members that VA has only successfully removed three VA \nemployees for reasons related to the wait time manipulation in the VA \nscandal that was brought to everybody's attention back in April.\n  Here are those that oppose the accountability bill: the American \nFederation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees \nUnion.\n  So, again, on opposition are the unions; on support are the veterans \nservice organizations.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The question is on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now \nrise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois, \nActing Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the \nUnion, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the \nbill (H.R. 1994) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe removal or demotion of employees of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs based on performance or misconduct, and for other purposes, had \ncome to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5640-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5640-H5650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND VETERANS HEALTH CARE CHOICE IMPROVEMENT ACT \n                                OF 2015\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER.

EMERGENCY DESIGNATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--This title, except for section 4007, is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     4(g) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (2 U.S.C. \n     933(g)).\n       (b) Designation in Senate.--In the Senate, this title, \n     except for section 4007, is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 403(a) of S. Con. Res. 13 \n     (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2010.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, \nequally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and \nranking minority members of the Committees on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, Ways and Means, and Veterans' Affairs.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio), the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott), the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. Miller), and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each will \ncontrol 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3236 is a 3-month clean extension to \nthe surface transportation legislation. It is the right thing to do.\n  It gives the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the \nCommittee on Ways and Means the time to work out a long-term solution \nto the surface transportation bill, which we need to pass for the \nhealth of this country.\n  Importantly, it gives the House of Representatives the ability to do \nits constitutional duty to be heard on important legislation that is \nimportant to all 50 States and all 435 congressional districts.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I would direct anyone interested in this \nlegislation to my remarks on the 5-month bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 435 Members of the House to \nsupport H.R. 3236 with a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I just want to echo the comments of the prior chair. We think this is \nthe right solution. This is very similar to the bill we passed earlier. \nWe believe this gives us the time we need to try and put together a \nlong-term highway solution. That is why we are in favor of this.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, here we are with another short-term extension of the \nhighway trust fund. It is silly; it is counterproductive. Anybody who \nknows anything knows this is ridiculous. They say we have got to have \ntime to work out a compromise. How many years do you need time?\n  When I served in the State legislature in my home State of \nWashington, a businessman once told me that businessowners don't care \nwhat the rate is or how long; they just want to know how long they have \nto deal with something.\n  Now, how can businesses do any kind of planning in this country when \nthey get 1-, 2-, and 3-month extensions? This is the 25th time that we \nhave done a short-term extension of the highway trust fund. Put another \nway, this is the 25th time the Congress has shirked its responsibility \nto the taxpayers and businesses to provide reliable transportation \ninfrastructure across this country.\n  Now, as I thought about this debate, I was reminded of a tube of \ntoothpaste that lays in my bathroom. It is about one-third gone. All of \nyou have one of these at home that is laying there.\n  You know what you do; you keep squeezing it one more time. You say: \nCan I get one more brush out of this? Will I get one more? Can I get \none more? That is what we have been doing here. We are squeezing the \ntube one more time. We are going to be back.\n  You save your toothpaste because it is going to be back; it is going \nto be back in November or December. We are going to be right back down \nhere squeezing to get a little bit.\n  Now, my belief is that it is time that we stop this. It is time for a \nlong-term funding bill, and we should have done it this time.\n  Now, in order to make this bill even worse, they wrap in the \ntoothpaste tube of the Veterans Administration. Let's give a little bit \nof money here, a little bit of money there; and we will see if we can \nkind of move it along and then stay out of trouble. We never fix \nanything here.\n  This Congress is the Congress of the half-empty toothpaste tube. I \nwill probably vote with everybody else because you don't want the \nVeterans Administration to be having problems and you don't want the \nhospital construction to stop.\n  We will vote for it, but it is foolish, and it is a statement about \nthe failure of the Republican Party to deal with major issues.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Sam Johnson), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the chairman. I come to the floor \ntoday to talk about our bill, H.R. 2514, the Help Veterans Save for \nHealth Care Act, which is part of the legislation now before us.\n  As a 29-year Air Force veteran and former POW, it is no secret I am a \nproud advocate for America's veterans. They bravely served our country. \nThey deserve the best care when they return home. Unfortunately, the VA \nhas failed to uphold its end of the bargain. We have been working hard \nto fix it.\n  To add insult to injury, the IRS--yes, the IRS--has also let down our \nveterans. Right now, the IRS prohibits veterans from contributing to a \nhealth savings account for a period of time if they choose to get care \nat the VA.\n  These health savings accounts enable Americans to save and pay for \nmedical expenses; yet, here, we have the IRS standing in the way of \nveterans, keeping them from getting the care they want, need, and \ndeserve. That is wrong.\n\n[[Page H5648]]\n\n  Bottom line, veterans shouldn't have to choose between getting care \nat the VA for a service-connected disability or being able to save for \nhealth care, including their families. My bill would allow veterans to \ndo both.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for \ntheir support. I would also like to thank the chairman for working with \nme on this, but most importantly, I want to personally thank each of \nour veterans who faithfully serve to protect this great Nation.\n  Let's get this done.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. I thank the gentleman from Washington \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman. I agree that we are \nsqueezing and squeezing and extending and extending when we know better \nand we know the difference. We know that we could have a meaningful \nsolution to the problem that we face. We know it. We come and we kick \nthe can a little bit, add a little bit more to it.\n  Like him, I am going to vote for it. But I am going to vote for it \nnot because I think it is the best approach; I am going to vote for it \nbecause I want to see construction crews continue to work. I want to \nsee families who are looking for paychecks be able to continue to get \nthem.\n  I am going to vote for it because I want to see roads and bridges and \nhighways repaired. I want to see veterans be able to go to the doctor \nand not wonder whether or not the doctor is going to be there to take \ncare of them.\n  So, yes, I will vote for it; and I will look up and see that we will \nbe back in December voting again, but we do what we have to do. We have \nto keep America working. I will vote for it to keep America working.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's review this week. When I got on the plane from \nSeattle, we were supposed to be here on Friday. By the time I landed at \nDulles Airport, they had already given away Friday. We weren't going to \nhave any votes on Friday. So now the week is 1 day short. They \ncontinued to ineptly manage this place in such a way, Mr. Speaker, that \nthey are now giving away Thursday.\n  Now they want to hurry out of here. They want to get out of here. \nThey don't want the American people to see what they are really doing.\n  If you look at this transportation issue, what is making us \nuncompetitive in the rest of the world is that everywhere else they are \nspending money on infrastructure. People know you have to have roads, \nyou have to have high-speed stuff in the ground that will carry a \nlittle bit of a message here and there. All that wiring, all that stuff \nthat we could be doing, we should be doing. We should be planning. But \nthere isn't any State that can plan with this kind of a highway bill.\n  Now, why aren't we doing the thing today that is right? Well, because \nthe Senate has come up with a great proposal. They have a 6-year \nauthorization, but they come up with 3 years of money. How does a State \nplan with that? We are authorized for 6 years out to whatever that \nwould be, and we are going to wind up only getting money for 3 years. \nHow do we do bond issues in the State when we don't know what the Feds \nare going to do? This kind of planning makes government fail. And it is \nwhat the Republicans want: a Federal Government that fails.\n  Now, there was a guy named Eisenhower. When he became President, he \ncame in and said: You know something? This country needs roads. And he \ncreated the entire system. He was a Republican from Kansas, of all \nplaces, and he understood what the country needed to move forward.\n  People said in the last election what we need to do is elect \nRepublicans. By God, if we get Republicans, we will get what we need in \nthis country. Well, I don't know if they knew what they were voting \nfor, but what they got is a Senate and House that can't come up with a \nhighway bill. They have been here for 8 months. Everybody knows we need \nit. The sources of revenue are not mysteries.\n  Russell Long used to say about taxation: ``Don't tax you, don't tax \nme, tax that fellow behind the tree.''\n  We know there is nobody behind the tree. We are going to have to \nraise some taxes to do what is necessary.\n  Well, there are those guys that have that money overseas. Maybe we \ncan get those guys who have got that overseas money and bring it back \nand fund this. I guess they are behind the tree. But they also live \nhere, so they are not really behind the tree.\n  This argument is going to go on in December or whenever this thing \nends. It doesn't really make any difference. We will come back here, \nand we will get out our toothpaste tube and we will squeeze a little \nbit more out of it just to see if we can brush our teeth one more time. \nThat is what this is about. We have done it on issue after issue here, \nand somebody has to call the Republican Party on this.\n  The American people should understand, they are not serious about \nrunning government for the things that affect ordinary human beings. A \ntransit system in a State is absolutely important. As cities get more \ncrowded and more crowded and there is no parking, if you don't have a \ntransit system that works, you can't have development. Everybody wants \ndevelopment.\n  Where the heck are you going to put the development? Out in the \nbushes? No. You are going to put it in the city where the people live. \nBut if they can't move around and get to the jobs, you have got \nterrible problems. In every city and everybody's district, if you have \ngot a city with over 50,000, you have got problems with traffic, and \nyet we can't get a transportation bill out of here that goes for more \nthan 3 months. Now, that is pathetic.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the gentleman. I \nthink we should pass this bill, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  First of all, I want to thank the chairman for his continued \nbipartisan work on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We all want to do \nwhat is best for the veterans, and the chairman has continued to work \ntoward that goal.\n  On this past Monday, 62 years after the signing of the Korean \nArmistice Agreement, the committee laid a wreath at the Tomb of the \nUnknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery in honor of our fallen military \nmembers. Today, we need more than a ceremony. We should honor our \nveterans now by passing H.R. 3236.\n  I support this legislation because it addresses the $3 million \nshortfall for fiscal year 2015 at the VA and keeps hospitals and \nmedical facilities open for our veterans through the end of the fiscal \nyear. Let me repeat that. It will allow the VA to keep hospitals and \nclinics open for our veterans through the end of this fiscal year.\n  This legislation allows the VA to use $3.348 billion that was \nappropriated for the Choice Program to use for non-VA care, to pay for \nhealth care provided to veterans and family members under the programs \nprovided by non-VA providers from May 1 to October 1, 2015. The VA has \ncompleted more than 56 million appointments between June 1, 2014, and \nMay 31, 2015. That is 2.6 million more than the same time last year.\n  H.R. 3236 allows the VA to access $3 billion from the Choice fund and \n$348 million from other unobligated accounts. Of that amount, $500 \nmillion may be used for pharmaceutical expenses related to the \ntreatment of hepatitis C at the VA. This is a cure that many of our \nveterans need, especially those who served in Vietnam.\n  Three times in this fiscal year, the Secretary has testified before \nthe VA committee, and he has consistently been asking for the authority \nto run the VA like a business.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I want to thank Chairman Miller of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, Ranking Member Brown, and, of\n\n[[Page H5649]]\n\ncourse, Chairman Dent, who chairs the Appropriations MILCON-VA \nSubcommittee, where I serve as ranking member.\n  Today, this body is debating text within the highway bill to address \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs' $3 billion budget shortfall for \nveterans' health care in FY 2015. Without this legislation, the VA \ncould run out of money by September. Costs have exploded by more than \n10 percent in the last year as a result of higher demand, while the \nbudget increased by only 2.8 percent.\n  Additionally, costs for treatments have increased. For example, due \nto the new lifesaving hepatitis C medicine costing as much as $1,000 \nfor a single pill, the VA's $700 million FY 2015 budget for hepatitis C \nhas already been exceeded with more than 2 months left in the fiscal \nyear.\n  This situation is a prime example of how the sequester caps imposed \nby the Budget Control Act and locked in by the Republican budget \nconstrain our ability to deal with issues responsibly and in a timely \nmanner. It is well past time that we come to the table to break the \ncycle of irresponsible funding levels that are shortchanging our \nveterans' health care.\n  While the House-passed FY 2016 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill adds \n$970 million for VA medical care advance appropriations within the FY \n2015 bill, the amount still remains $330 million below the VA request, \nmost likely leading to another budget shortfall in FY 2016. Today's \nbill is only a Band-Aid, a temporary solution, because of budget caps.\n  To be clear, if we continue to ignore the new reality of increased \ndemand and higher costs, delivery of healthcare services to millions of \ncurrently enrolled veterans will be devastated for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. If Congress continues to function under these \nbudgets caps, we will see more gaps in access, utilization, safety, \nand, ultimately, a lower standard of care. Even further, the caps limit \nCongress' options to create jobs, keep our communities safe, research \nlifesaving medical treatments, and give our children a better \neducation.\n  I urge Members to vote for this bill to ensure that veterans continue \nto receive the care which they have earned, but we cannot continue to \ngovern in this fashion. Today, we must take the next step towards a \nmore responsible budgeting process so we can eventually stop lurching \nfrom one crisis to the next. To do so, the budget caps must be directly \naddressed in order to properly invest in veterans' health care as well \nas advance other priorities assisting hard-working Americans.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon \n(Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  It is a little frustrating as we watch these disparate subjects \nlumped together on the floor with truncated debate. I want to speak to \njust one element that we are discussing here today, and that deals with \nthe extension of transportation funding.\n  The passage of this bill will represent the 34th short-term extension \nof the surface transportation bill. What country became great building \nits infrastructure 8 months at a time? 6 months at a time? a year at a \ntime? It is a failure on the part of Congress to be able to understand \nthat you cannot pay for 2015 infrastructure needs with 1993 dollars--\nthe last time we adjusted the user fee, the gas tax that supports the \nhighway trust fund.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  I do see a little tiny glimmer of daylight with the 3-month \nextension. I have personally been urging the President to indicate that \nthis is the last extension that he will sign.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee could pass a funding measure in a \nweek if we would roll up our sleeves. We have legislation there that is \nsupported by the U.S. Chamber, AFL-CIO, by truckers, transit, the AAA, \na wide array of people who say: Step up, raise our user fee, fund the \ntransportation system, and do it right.\n  We used to have the finest infrastructure in the world. Now, we are \nabout 25th in the world and falling further.\n  If the Ways and Means Committee would spend a week listening to the \npeople who build, maintain, operate, and use our infrastructure, we \ncould come to a resolution.\n  Ronald Reagan's approach was to raise the user fee 125 percent in \n1982.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. If we did our job, sending clear signals about \ntransportation funding, the appropriating committee, the T, if they \nknew what they were working with, could come forth with a bill easily \nin 2 months, so we wouldn't have to continue this charade.\n  We could put hundreds of thousands of people to work at family-wage \njobs in every city around the country; we would meet our obligations, \nand we would stop this shameful exercise of abrogating our \nresponsibility to rebuild and renew.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have, sir?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I believe that the Secretary needs that authority. In addition to \nsolving the fiscal crisis, this bill will enable the Secretary to run \nVA more like a business, and that, Mr. Speaker, means a more efficient \nVA and better care for our veterans.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to \nensure that our veterans are taken care of.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, only 2 weeks ago, buried in a letter from the Deputy \nSecretary, the Department of Veterans Affairs made a startling \nannouncement. That announcement was, unless Congress intervened, the VA \nhealthcare system would shut down in August, due to a massive budget \nshortfall that resulted from larger than anticipated demand for non-VA \ncare and increased costs for hepatitis C treatment.\n  A VA healthcare system shutdown would be an unprecedented event in \nthese United States' history. The possibility of a shutdown was never \nmentioned, even once, during a hearing that I called in late June, \nwhere VA first publicly admitted its budget troubles, or during any of \nthe four times that Secretary McDonald testified before Congress this \nyear or anywhere in the quarterly financial plan that VA submitted in \nMarch, showing that VA was operating under budget so far this fiscal \nyear.\n  Once again, this Congress comes to rescue a mismanaged Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today, H.R. 3236 will come to the floor of \nthe House with a critical 3 month extension to the Highway Trust fund \nas well as changes to Department of Veterans Affairs' spending \nauthorities. In particular, it contains changes to the Veterans \nAffairs' Choice Program that I believe are very important for Guam. It \nexpands eligibility for the program and codifies some of the changes \nthat the VA has made since the inception of the program to make it more \naccessible to veterans in rural or isolated communities and reduces \nsome barriers to timely care.\n  Though this bill is a good step towards better care for our veterans, \nthere are many more improvements that I will continue to work for with \nmy colleagues and the VA. There is still a need for greater flexibility \nin the reimbursement rate to health care providers which could be an \nissue on Guam in the near future. Further, there is a need to improve \nthe methods in which our veterans and their records can move back and \nforth between VA and non-VA providers. Additionally, though I would \nhave preferred to see additional appropriations to cover the shortfall \nin the other programs that are covering non-VA provided care for our \nveterans, I have been assured that the movement of funds within the VA \naccounts will not negatively affect the care our veterans are receiving \nthrough the Choice Program and that the transfer is temporary. I will \ncontinue to urge the Obama Administration to provide adequate funding \nfor all VA programs, but particularly the Choice program which has a \nlot of interest and support on Guam. The Choice\n\n[[Page H5650]]\n\nprogram has the ability to, in the long-term, address some of the \nsystemic issues to VA care in isolated areas of the country.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 388, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida.

There is 1 minute remaining.\n\n                              {time}  1737\n\n  So the amendment was rejected.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  Stated against:\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chair, on rollcall No. 487, had I been \npresent, I would have voted ``no.''\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Carter of Georgia, Acting Chair \nof the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. \n1994) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the removal \nor demotion of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs based on \nperformance or misconduct, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to \nHouse Resolution 388, he reported the bill back to the House with an \namendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. TAKANO. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Takano moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1994 to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendments\n       Page 6, beginning on line 19, strike paragraph (1) and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(1) The Secretary may not remove or demote an individual, \n     including veterans who make up nearly one-third of the \n     Department's workforce, under subsection (a) if the \n     individual has filed a whistleblower complaint, as such term \n     is defined in section 731 of this title, or if the individual \n     is seeking corrective action (or on behalf of whom corrective \n     action is sought) from the Office of Special Counsel or the \n     Inspector General based on--\n       ``(A) an alleged threat to the health or safety of the \n     public; or\n       ``(B) an alleged prohibited personnel practice described in \n     section 2302(b) of title 5.''.\n       Page 7, line 3, strike ``In the case'' and insert ``Except \n     as provided in paragraph (1), in the case''.\n\n  Mr. TAKANO (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1994 makes the VA an at-will workplace, \nviolating longstanding Supreme Court precedent regarding constitutional \ndue process rights and threatening to silence the whistleblowers by \ncreating a culture of fear and intimidation at the VA.\n  The Republican bill would allow the VA to immediately fire employees \nfor poor performance, making it easier for bad managers to immediately \nfire\n\n[[Page H5652]]\n\nwhistleblowers who report wrongdoing, while providing hardly any \nopportunity for employees to appeal.\n  My friends, this is wrong.\n  This means doctors, nurses, police officers, and so many others can \nbe fired at will and with insufficient recourse. Hard-working, loyal \nemployees who are doing everything in their power to treat the \nincredible needs of our Nation's veterans--fired at will. Let me remind \nyou that one-third of all VA employees are veterans. That is more than \n100,000 veterans' livelihoods being put at risk.\n  This is wrong.\n  Are there problems with some VA employees? Of course there are. The \nVA has a process to remove these employees. In fact, during the 1-year \nperiod from July 1, 2014, through July 30, 2015, the VA removed 872 \npermanent employees, and an additional 487 employees resigned or \nretired in lieu of being removed. The VA has also terminated 958 \nprobationary employees. For employees accused of harming veterans' \nhealth or safety, the substitute amendment I offered earlier would have \nallowed for their expedited firing.\n  Instead of gutting the due process rights of VA employees, we should \nbe providing a fair and constitutionally sound expedited removal \nprocess, and we should encourage the VA to use the disciplinary tools \nit already has at its disposal.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  We all know the critical role that whistleblowers played in exposing \nthe shocking misconduct at the Phoenix VA, but the Republican bill \nstrips away all current whistleblower protections available to Federal \nemployees under Federal law. That is wrong.\n  Under the Republican bill, any whistleblower who has not filed an \nofficial complaint can be fired before they even have the opportunity \nto report danger to patient safety, wrongdoing, malfeasance, or \ndiscrimination. That is wrong.\n  The Republican whistleblower provisions will encourage bad employees \nto file for whistleblower status to prevent them from being fired. This \nwill overburden the Office of Special Counsel with frivolous \ncomplaints. That is wrong.\n  The Republican bill does the opposite of what it claims to do for \nwhistleblowers. It offers them no protection. In fact, it will let bad \nemployees hide behind whistleblower status to keep from being fired. \nThat is crazy.\n  My final amendment protects the employees who are willing to risk it \nall to expose flaws and abuses in this system.\n  If there is anybody we must protect from being fired at will without \nrecourse or retaliation, it is the brave men and women with the courage \nto stand up and expose the VA's biggest vulnerability.\n  With all due respect, I say to my colleagues anyone who votes against \nmy motion to protect whistleblowers from being fired should themselves \nbe fired.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time..\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the \nmotion to recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Last year, almost this very same time in a bill-signing ceremony, the \nPresident of the United States said this: ``If you engage in an \nunethical practice, if you cover up a serious problem, you should be \nfired, period.'' It should not be that difficult.\n  This is a bad motion to recommit. I urge my Members to vote it down.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-\nminute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and agreeing to the \nSpeaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 184, \nnoes 241, not voting 8, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 488]\n\n                               AYES--184\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Teen Challenge of \nArizona and congratulate them on 50 years of serving our community and \nthose in need.\n  Teen Challenge is a faith-based residential recovery program for \nsubstance abusers. It is often a last resort for those struggling with \ndrug addiction and other problems.\n  Over the last 50 years, Teen Challenge of Arizona has helped an \nestimated 25,000 people through recovery programs. Their success rate \nis an astonishing 80 percent, a testament to their committed and caring \napproach.\n  While I served at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, I was a \nboard member of Teen Challenge of Arizona, and I saw the difference \nthey make\n\n[[Page H5654]]\n\nfirsthand.

Gwendolyn died a few months short of her \neighth birthday, far exceeding the odds that were given to her at \nbirth. In her short life, she had more of an impact and brought more \njoy to others than many ever could in their lifetime.\n  Gwendolyn's life was spent on the same things many young girls do--\nplaying princesses with friends, going to school, and spending time \nwith her sister.\n  She and her family also used their voice to improve the lives of all \nof us.

Mr. Speaker, this last Sunday, my family and I \nattended church at the First Baptist Church of Woodstock in Woodstock, \nGeorgia.\n  It is not the first time we ever attended that church, as we have \nworshipped there before; but it is possibly the most memorable time \nthat I will have attended that church because it was at this service \nthat we were having the funeral of Lance Corporal Squire Wells, who is \nknown to his friends and family as Skip. Skip was the youngest of those \nwho were killed in the terrorist attack in Chattanooga.\n  As we were driving to the church, Mr. Speaker, as we were still miles \naway from the church, along the sides of the road, we began to see \nAmerican citizens, citizens of the 11th Congressional District lining \nthe road, holding American flags and Marine Corps flags. As we \napproached closer to the church, the hundreds of people turned into \nthousands of people.\n  As we arrived at the church, nearly 500 members of the Patriot Guard \nRiders, Marine Corps League, the VFW, and the American Legion were \nstanding, lining the sidewalks of this church, bearing American flags \nto say good-bye and to say thank you to a patriot.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to also say thank you to Skip Wells--Lance \nCorporal Wells. Although, to my knowledge, we never met in person, I \ndidn't know him personally, but I do know the type of person he is \nbecause he was a marine, which told me that he held to the highest \nstandards of decorum and morale and integrity.\n  He was a Christian who served faithfully in the First Baptist Church \nof Woodstock, which tells me he had a heart of charity and love.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you to Skip Wells for laying down \nhis life for my freedom, the freedom of my children, and my \ngranddaughter. I want to say thank you to Ms. Cathy Wells, his mom, for \nraising such a fine person as a single mom raising her only child, who \nhas given his life in defense of this Nation.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the thousands of people from my \ndistrict who came out and honored the life of this American patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5654-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5654-H5655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DON'T LEAVE THE EX-IM BANK IN A ZOMBIELIKE STATE\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

It \nis the wrong thing to do.\n  Sadly, the minority of ideologues in this Chamber that is blocking \nthe renewal of the Ex-Im's charter is absolutely right about one thing. \nIf the U.S. Ex-Im goes under, all the export business and all the jobs \nsupported by it will be just displaced to other companies.\n  What they don't mention in their rants against the Bank is that the \ncompanies that will get this business will be in other countries and \nthe workers who get those good-paying jobs will be overseas because \nthere are some 85 foreign export credit agencies today happy to help \nthe companies in their countries seal the deal.\n  We are leaving thousands of American workers at a real competitive \ndisadvantage by leaving the U.S. Export-Import Bank in a zombielike \nstatus.\n  We should renew it. We should keep these jobs in America.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, it is my \npleasure to yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the \ndistinguished minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  First, let me mention the extraordinary respect I have for the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n  I had the honor of sponsoring the Americans with Disabilities Act in \n1989 and 1990. We passed it in 1990, and it was signed by then-\nPresident George H.W. Bush. It was called the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, Mr. Speaker, but in many ways it should have been \ncalled the Americans with Abilities Act. It should have been called \nthat because its intent was to focus on what people could do, what \npeople would do, what people wanted to do.\n  Mr. Langevin is a perfect example of an extraordinary person with \ngreat ability who has a wheelchair. He has a wheelchair because he has \na mobility impairment that others of us don't have. But as we have seen \nin serving with our colleague Jim Langevin from Rhode Island, he is \nextraordinarily able and he represents his constituency with great \nenergy, with great intellect, and with great integrity. So I am pleased \nto join him in this Special Order.\n  We had introduced a resolution, but it is not the practice of the \nHouse to bring commemorative resolutions to the floor. So we do this \nSpecial Order in addition to what we would have hoped would have been \nthe passage of a resolution, but I understand that is the practice.\n  The Senate did in fact pass a resolution, sponsored by Orrin Hatch, \nPatricia Murray from Washington State, and Lamar Alexander, \ncommemorating 25 years of progress on the inclusion of those with a \nchallenge that others might not have in our society, all that our \nsociety offers and the opportunities that it offers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on numerous occasions over this last week \ncommemorating the ADA, and I have mentioned a number of names. I would \nlike to do that on the floor of this House, because they were people \nwho were absolutely critical. It is not a comprehensive list. It is, \nhowever, a list of people with whom I worked very closely for well over \na year on the passage of the ADA.\n  First, I would like to mention President George H.W. Bush. This issue \nwas not a partisan issue. President Bush was a Republican; I was a \nDemocrat--and still am. I worked with an extraordinary Republican \nMember of the House. His name was Steve Bartlett. He was from Texas. He \nleft the House and became mayor of Dallas. He is now still in \nWashington, working, and we are partners. Every time something happens \nwith respect to the ADA, Steve Bartlett and I work together on it.\n  Dave Capozzi and Tony Coelho. Tony Coelho, a Member of this body, was \na person perceived with the disease of epilepsy, but he is one of the \nmost able people that any of us know. Tony Coelho, along with Lowell \nWeicker, were the original two sponsors of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  Justin Dart. In 1983, Justin Dart visited every State in the Union in \nhis wheelchair, calling attention to State legislatures, Governors, and \nothers of the importance of ensuring the accessibility of places of \nopportunity for those with disabilities. Yoshiko Dart, his wife, was \nwith him every step of the way and was with us as we worked for the \npassage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  And then we have an extraordinary legislator--one of the best \nlegislators that I have served with, Mr. Speaker--Bob Dole, a \nRepublican from Kansas, majority and minority leader of the United \nStates Senate. Mr. Speaker, when he came to the Senate of the United \nStates, his first speech was about including those with disabilities. \nHe observed that he was an involuntary member of those with \ndisabilities as a result of his extraordinary war wounds in Italy in \nWorld War II.\n  We have Chai Feldblum, who is now on the EEOC and a professor at \nGeorgetown Law School. She was counsel to myself and Steve Bartlett as \nwe considered the complex issues and tried to make sure that ADA could \nbe implemented by all in a way that was affordable and reasonable for \nthem.\n  We then have Lex Frieden, who is the executive director of the \nNational Council on Disabilities, who worked so closely with us. Also, \nBoyden Gray, counsel to George Bush, who was a critical ally in this \neffort.\n  Then we have a giant in this effort, Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa, \nwho, after Lowell Weicker left, was the principal sponsor of the ADA \nand fought hard and effectively on its behalf.\n  Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy. Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch were \npartners in so many different things, but on this they were aligned and \nmade this bipartisan effort a very successful one.\n  Also, Arlene Mayerson; Paul Marchand; former Congressman and now \nSenator Ed Markey; Senator John McCain; Congressman Norman Mineta; \nRalph Neas; Katie Neas; Carolyn Osolinik; Becky Ogle; Lee Page; Liz \nSavage; Bobby Silverstein. Like Melissa Schulman who was my chief \nstaffer as we considered the Americans with Disabilities Act, Bobby \nSilverstein was Tom Harkin's chief staffer.\n  Jim Sensenbrenner, our colleague today. Congressman Sensenbrenner was \nso critical, along with his wife, Cheryl Sensenbrenner, who, herself, \nsuffered from a disability and showed such courage in encouraging all \nof us to support the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I mentioned Lowell Weicker. Lowell Weicker was a Senator from \nConnecticut and then Governor of Connecticut; Bob Williams, who was an \nextraordinary individual who worked so hard; John Wodatch; and last, \nbut certainly not least, Patricia Wright.\n  There were literally, Mr. Speaker, thousands of others, many of whom \nwill not be known but who came here to the Congress of the United \nStates, wrote their Members, called them up, and came to town meetings \nand forums on behalf of those with disabilities.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act is now used as a sample and has \nbeen adopted in some 50 countries throughout the world, perhaps more. \nThere is a disabilities rights convention, which is pending. Only three \ncountries in the world have not signed on to that convention. \nUnfortunately, we are one. I would hope that the Senate would do that \nin this Congress. Senator Bob Dole has been an extraordinary proponent \nof that convention.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my friend, James Langevin, who \nhas been a beneficiary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nreasonable accommodations that we ask to be\n\n[[Page H5656]]\n\neffected so that Jim Langevin could get through the door, could get on \nthe elevator, could get into this Chamber. And, Mr. Speaker, there is a \nlift on the rostrum on which you now sit so that James Langevin would \nbe able to preside, if that were in order. In fact, he has been up \nthere and has presided. That is called a reasonable accommodation. And \nbecause of those reasonable accommodations, this Congress, his State, \nand our country have been advantaged.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think when we end our careers, most of us who were \ninvolved in the adoption of the Americans with Disabilities Act will \nlook back on the adoption of it overwhelmingly by this Congress in a \nbipartisan fashion and the signing of that act by President George Bush \nas one of our most important contributions and achievements during our \nservice in the Congress of the United States.\n  I thank Mr. Langevin for his extraordinary example for all those in \nour country to look at the abilities, not the disabilities.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman. Let me express my profound \ngratitude to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the \ndistinguished minority whip, for his kind words, Mr. Speaker, but most \nespecially because of his extraordinary commitment and the work that he \nput in, along with countless others, to actually pass the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and seeing it signed into law.\n  As the gentleman from Maryland stated, Mr. Speaker, that law has had \na profound impact on my life and on countless other lives--and will for \ngenerations to come. I thank the gentleman for his extraordinary work.\n  Let me also thank the extraordinary list of individuals that the \ndistinguished gentleman from Maryland just read off, some of whom I \nhave had the absolute distinct honor and privilege to meet and to thank \npersonally, and many of whom I will never have the privilege of \nactually knowing or meeting personally because many have also passed \non.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  They made an extraordinary difference in the lives of millions of \npeople, as I said, both now and in future generations to come; and it \nis with profound gratitude that I thank them for their work.\n  Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday marked the 25th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, a tremendous milestone for one of the \nmost significant civil rights laws of the 20th century.\n  As a Member of Congress, as co-chair of the Bipartisan Disabilities \nCaucus and someone who has lived with the challenges of a disability, \nboth before and after the ADA's enactment in 1990, I have experienced \nfirsthand the profound changes that this law has affected within our \nsociety.\n  When I was paralyzed at the age of 16, my life changed forever. As I \nlay in my hospital bed, I wondered what life could possibly have in \nstore for me next, but I drew strength and inspiration from other \npeople with disabilities who had accomplished both great things and \nsmall. They taught me that there was life after a disability.\n  I was also incredibly fortunate to have the support of my family and \nmy community, whose generosity and concern ultimately made me want to \ngive back to Rhode Island through a career in public service, but \naccessibility was not yet considered a civil right at that time, and I \nknow many people with disabilities were not as fortunate as I was.\n  So many passionate advocates and champions like Mr. Hoyer fought for \nthe rights and protections enshrined in this law. For all of us, the \nADA has been a profoundly life-altering act that has provided new \nopportunities and fundamentally changed the way society views and \ntreats people with disabilities.\n  The ADA has broken down physical and psychological barriers. It has \nopened up opportunities to education, employment, and technology. It \nhas made public transportation more accommodating, improved voting \naccessibility, and expanded inclusion and justice for millions.\n  At its core, this groundbreaking legislation codified the correct \ncollective ideal that no one should suffer discrimination because of a \ndisability.\n  Mr. Speaker, it was with this same conviction that I was pleased to \nsupport the passage of the ADA Amendments Act in 2008, after a number \nof court decisions diluted the definition of what constituted a \ndisability.\n  When that law was signed into effect, I had the privilege of being \nwith Mr. Hoyer and several of the other champions of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the original enactment, original authors of the ADA, \nincluding Senator Harkin and Cheryl Sensenbrenner.\n  I also had the privilege of meeting President George H.W. Bush and be \nwith his son, President George W. Bush, as President George W. Bush \nsigned that bill into law. It was such an honor for me to be able to \npersonally thank President George H.W. Bush personally for his support \nand leadership in seeing the original ADA signed into law.\n  Now, when the ADA Amendments Act was passed, these rulings, \neffectively, the Court rulings that took place necessitating this act \neffectively limited the ADA's coverage and excluded people with \ndisabling conditions that were not readily visible or apparent, like \nepilepsy, MS, and various developmental disabilities.\n  The ADA Amendments Act reaffirmed the protections of the ADA and \nupheld the ideals of equality and opportunity on which this country was \nfounded. As a result of these efforts, I am proud that future \ngenerations will live in a world that is more inclusive, more \naccessible, and increasingly recognizes the unique talents and \nabilities of individuals with disabilities.\n  As we celebrate our accomplishments, so must we recognize that our \nwork is not finished. Equal employment opportunities and fully \nintegrated community living have not yet been entirely realized.\n  In fact, recent data shows that 31 percent of disabled individuals \nlive below the poverty line, and less than 34 percent are fully \nemployed.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we can do better, and we must. It is more \nimportant than ever that we educate businesses and connect them with \nproper resources to create more employment opportunities. Many people \nwith disabilities have both the desire and the capability to work, as \nwell as exceptional talents to offer.\n  Mr. Speaker, let us not see those talents go to waste. I have often \nsaid, Mr. Speaker, that people with disabilities are still one of this \nNation's greatest untapped resources, and we need to tap into that \ntalent to see our Nation grow even further.\n  Mr. Speaker, their divergent backgrounds, unique experiences and \nwide-ranging talents promote a culture of diversity that doesn't just \nplay a role in the workplace, but also influences the very nature of \nour society. With proper awareness, accommodation, and investment, our \neconomy and society can reap countless rewards.\n  We must also ensure that transportation is available and accessible \nto everyone so that they can get to their jobs, the doctor, or the \ngrocery store.\n  I have often said that it doesn't do anyone any good if they can \nactually apply for a job and get the job, but can't get to the job, so \nthat needs to improve.\n  To help us realize this goal, I have introduced the Transit \nAccessibility Innovation Act, legislation that would create a \ncompetitive grant program to encourage transit systems to make public \ntransportation more accessible and user friendly.\n  Mr. Speaker, accessible public transportation is essential in order \nfor people with disabilities to live independently and with full \ninclusion in their communities. By improving these services, we can \nimprove the quality of life for countless individuals and families.\n  Mr. Speaker, to further promote independence, we must also ensure \nthat family caregivers of people with disabilities have greater access \nto critical services like respite care. Respite care provides temporary \nrelief to family members engaged in the full-time task of caring for \ntheir aging or disabled loved ones with special needs.\n  Mr. Speaker, these caregivers, I have often said, are unsung heroes. \nThese caregivers devote so much of their time, energy, and love to \ntheir families, but in many cases, they can be often unprepared for \nthese new responsibilities, and the challenges that they\n\n[[Page H5657]]\n\nface can be daunting, from employment difficulties, to financial \nchallenges, to depression and family stress.\n  Very often, though, with just a little bit of assistance, they can \ncontinue to be extraordinary caregivers and fulfill all of the other \nchallenges and responsibilities that a family requires.\n  That is why I have introduced and I have championed the Lifespan \nRespite Care Act, Mr. Speaker, with my friend and former Republican \ncolleague, Mike Ferguson from New Jersey.\n  Mr. Speaker, that law, it passed into law in 2006 and has already \nprovided grants to 32 States and the District of Columbia to help set \nup respite care networks for families in need.\n  Mr. Speaker, I continue to push for that program's reauthorization, \nand I included it in the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services \nImprovement Act that I introduced in April to strengthen the support \nservices for family caregivers of injured and disabled veterans. I \nthink this is an important thing that we can do for our veterans.\n\n  We have come far, Mr. Speaker, since the passage of the ADA, but we \nstill have much more work ahead. Disabilities don't discriminate on the \nbasis of party affiliation, income level, or gender; instead, they can \nhappen to anyone at any time. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that they also \nhave the unique ability to unite us in common purpose.\n  As we celebrate the silver anniversary of the ADA together, we must \nuse this as a call to action and to reaffirm our commitment to equal \nopportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency for people with disabilities everywhere.\n  Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by thanking the many champions and the \nadvocates and many unsung heroes who made the ADA possible and saw it \nthrough the legislative process and put it on the desk of President \nGeorge H.W. Bush, who signed it into law and changed the lives of \npeople with disabilities everywhere forever.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5657-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5657-H5659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, August 29 of this year will mark the 10-\nyear anniversary that Hurricane Katrina struck ground, causing massive \ndevastation throughout southeast Louisiana, as well as other parts of \nthe Gulf Coast, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight, we are going to talk about the devastation that \nwas caused by Hurricane Katrina, and of course, it starts with the more \nthan 1,800 lives that were lost, people from Louisiana, Mississippi, \nFlorida, Alabama, and Georgia who all lost their lives through this \ndevastating storm.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are also going to talk about something else, and that \nis the strength and resiliency of the people of the Gulf Coast who \npersevered, who rebuilt. Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk \nabout the recovery of the people of the Gulf Coast from this \ndevastating storm.\n  First, I will yield to my friend from the great State of Alabama, Mr. \nRobert Aderholt.\n  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want to just mention to you that it is \nhard to believe that it has been 10 years ago, in the early morning \nhours of August 29, just a month from today, that Hurricane Katrina \nslammed into the Gulf Coast as a category 3 hurricane.\n  With sustained winds up to 140 miles an hour and a storm surge over 9 \nmeters high in some places, the impact to the gulf region was very \ndevastating.\n  While the economic cost of the storm is very difficult to measure, \nsome estimates have put the damage over $100 billion. Hundreds of \nthousands of refugees scattered across the country. Most importantly, \nno price tag can be assigned to the loss of the nearly 2,000 lives that \nwere lost.\n  In the aftermath of the tragic storm, there were many hearings; there \nwere many inquiries, studies, investigations, reforms, and policy \nchanges that were conducted, and most of those were for good reason.\n  The initial emergency response to Katrina was far less than what \nshould be expected of our Federal, State, and local governments.\n  However, this evening, I do want to thank my colleague for his \nallowing this, putting together this time. As he said, we are not here \nto talk about the failures, so much as we are here to talk about the \nspirit of the people that were affected.\n  It is easy to sit back and to point fingers and to place blame, but \nthis evening, we want to talk about and bring attention to the spirit \nof the people that were affected, both directly and indirectly by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  In the days after the hurricane, when it became clear that thousands \nof people would not be able to return to their homes, work began to \nfind permanent shelter for these individuals.\n  Thousands of refugees from Louisiana were given housing in \nmanufactured housing that was purchased by FEMA and was stationed, \nactually, in my home State of Alabama in the State parks.\n  The outpouring that came the following days of support from the local \ncommunity was, I think, best described as just overwhelming. As soon as \nthe people found out that the refugees were headed into our area, \nsupplies were starting to be gathered together, and drives were started \nimmediately as they were being organized.\n  A member of my own staff organized one of those numerous drives on \nhis own initiative. Thousands of pounds of food, of clothing, and \npersonal hygiene products were collected. They were distributed to the \npeople, and these people that were helped had little more than just the \nclothes on their back.\n  I am also proud that, after this show of support, that many of the \nrefugees decided to make the Fourth District, the district I represent, \ntheir home. In one particular case, a refugee from Louisiana ended up \nworking for Desoto State Park, where she had been housed.\n  Finally, the resilience of Alabamians who lived along the Gulf Coast \nwas also inspiring as well.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Though the Gulf Coast of Alabama was not the hardest hit of the \nregion, the Gulf Coast of Alabama was severely impacted by Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  While there is still some healing that needs to be done, the Gulf \nCoast is not only back in business, but it has returned to life as \nusual and it is thriving.\n  New shipyards are being constructed, new businesses are opening up, \nand tourism has returned to the region. This, I believe, is a testament \nto the spirit of the people of the State of Alabama as well as our \nneighboring States, Mississippi and Louisiana.\n  As we move forward as a country and as a region, I hope that we will \nnot only look to the lessons we have learned from the failures of this \nresponse, but also to the lessons we learned about kindness, the \nlessons of charity, being a good neighbor, and, actually, the spirit of \nthis great Nation.\n  So I want to thank my colleague from Louisiana for putting this time \ntogether to draw attention--again, not to place the blame on the \nindividuals or organizations that we could point blame to this evening, \nbut to the spirit and to the greatness of all those that were involved \nand to the kindness, the charity, and the spirit that arose from that \noccasion.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank you. I appreciate my colleague from Alabama's \n(Mr. Aderholt) comments.\n  Of course, Mr. Speaker, so much of the national attention on \nHurricane Katrina focused on the city of New Orleans.\n  We all remember the pictures, the visuals, of people that were \ndisplaced, of floodwaters that sat, in many cases, for 2 or 3 weeks.\n  But then, of course, we also remember the many things that happened \nalong the way for people who rebuilt, who came back, who persevered.\n  My colleague and friend who represents the city of New Orleans along\n\n[[Page H5658]]\n\nwith me obviously was deeply involved in a lot of those recovery \nefforts.\n  I want to yield now to my colleague from New Orleans (Mr. Richmond).\n  Mr. RICHMOND. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), who \nrepresents the neighboring district from me in part of the metropolitan \narea of New Orleans.\n  Let me just start off by saying something about New Orleans and the \npeople of New Orleans. Now, the people of New Orleans are a very, very \nresilient people, and it started from the beginning of the history of \nNew Orleans up until today.\n  We started off--you can go back to 1788, when there was a fire in New \nOrleans that burned 856 of the 1,100 buildings that made up New \nOrleans. So that was 80 percent of the city burned. Then 6 years later \nanother 212 buildings burned.\n  But the good thing about the people of New Orleans is that we always \npick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and continue to do the work to \nrebuild and make a better life.\n  Then you can go to 1853, when we had a yellow fever outbreak and \nepidemic. In 1853, almost 8,000 people died of yellow fever.\n  And if you look at the time between 1853 and 1905, 41,000 people in \nthe city of New Orleans lost their lives due to yellow fever. But again \nthe city picked itself up, dusted itself off, and worked to make a \nbetter New Orleans.\n  Then fast-forward to 1965. That was the year that Hurricane Betsy \ndevastated the city of New Orleans. That was the first storm to rack up \na cost of $1 billion in damage.\n  And then, of course, I will talk about Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nthat hit New Orleans and devastated the entire Gulf Coast, but \nsignificantly damaged New Orleans.\n  Let me just say for the record, even after we picked ourselves up and \ndusted ourselves off and started to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina, a \nfew years later then comes the BP oil spill.\n  And again the people of New Orleans--we picked ourselves up, dusted \nourselves off, and we started to create a better New Orleans and a \nbetter Louisiana.\n  Now, going back to Hurricane Katrina, which my good friend Steve \nScalise already talked about, the total loss of life in Hurricane \nKatrina was over 1,800 people, and 1,577 of those people were from \nLouisiana.\n  Let me just break down some of the causes of death: 40 percent of the \ndeaths were caused by drowning; 25 percent by injury and trauma; and \nheart conditions caused another 11 percent.\n  If you remember the devastation and destruction on the TVs that \ncovered it, you will understand the anxiety that the people that were \ndown there suffered.\n  Let me take a second before I go into some of the other statistics to \njust say many people always say that Hurricane Katrina was the largest \nnatural disaster in the history of the United States.\n  Well, I appreciate the sentiment. But, factually, that is just not \ncorrect. Hurricane Katrina was the result of a manmade disaster \ncombined with a natural disaster.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers had great notice that the levees that \nprotected New Orleans and the metropolitan area were not sufficient. \nWhen the storm hit, the levees washed away.\n  Then there was something called the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, \nwhich we call MRGO. It was designed by the Corps of Engineers to allow \nship traffic to the great Port of New Orleans all the way up to \nAmerica's heartland. It was designed to be almost 100 yards wide to \nallow ship traffic.\n  By the time Katrina hit, almost 30, 40 years after it was built, it \nwas not 100 yards wide anymore. It was almost a mile wide in its \nlargest sections. And that water coming out of the Gulf of Mexico \ncaused a lot of the devastation.\n  So I wanted to clear up the fact that this was not a natural \ndisaster. It had a large part to do with mankind having their hand in \nit and inadequate building by the Corps of Engineers.\n  Before I finish and yield back to Congressman Scalise, let me also \nsay that, when Katrina hit, although the government response was \nlacking, the American people stood up, recognized the situation, and \nopened their hearts to the people of Louisiana, the people of \nMississippi, and some of the people of Texas.\n  Baton Rouge alone handled 300,000 to 400,000 displaced individuals \nfrom the New Orleans area.\n  Houston, Texas, handled right around 250,000 people in terms of \nbringing them into shelters and other places so that they could be safe \nand have some housing.\n  Now you still have 111,000 people in Houston that are from the \ngreater New Orleans area. I remember traveling to Houston after the \nstorm and going to the shelters and watching the extraordinary work of \nSheila Jackson Lee and Al Green to provide for New Orleans and New \nOrleans-area evacuees.\n  100,000 evacuees in Atlanta, in shelters and in homes, with Hank \nJohnson and the Honorable John Lewis helping. Now Atlanta still is home \nto 70,000.\n  San Antonio, Texas, held almost 35,000 people at the time of the \nstorm, and now they still hold 15,000 to 18,000.\n  Then that brings me to Birmingham which right after the storm housed \n20,000 people, and now they house in between 1,500 to 13,000.\n  So the magnitude of this storm was great.\n  I just want to cover the population decrease. And then the other \nthings with Hurricane Katrina I will cover more in depth with my good \nfriend and colleague from Mississippi, Bennie Thompson, whose district \nwas also impacted.\n  But I will just say the population of New Orleans was 484,000 before \nKatrina. Right after Katrina it was right around 230,000 people. And \nthat is a decrease of almost half of the city's population.\n  So when you look at that damage and you look at the fact that we lost \n134,000 housing units, 70 percent of all occupied housing units of the \ncity, you will understand the magnitude and the depth of the \ndevastation that our district suffered.\n  But once again the people of New Orleans and the people of \nLouisiana--we pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and we start \nbuilding a better New Orleans and a better future.\n  However, we still have many needs. We still have many things that we \nneed to right that didn't go right during the storm.\n  But, as of now, I just wanted to talk about how resilient the people \nof New Orleans were during the storm and the outpouring of love from \nthe rest of the country.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Thank you, Congressman Richmond.\n  Of course, as the gentleman talked about, the devastation and those \n1,833 lives that we lost throughout the Gulf Coast still live with us. \nWe still remember the people who gave their lives, who lost their \nlives, in this devastating storm.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, some of the things that you saw from the people of \nsoutheast Louisiana--I know I saw firsthand the strength, the \nresiliency, of the people back at a time not long after the storm hit \nwhen there were people questioning whether or not the city of New \nOrleans would be rebuilt or should be rebuilt. You saw that \nconversation start around the country.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, that didn't last long before you saw the Nation \ncome together and make a commitment, and you saw the people of New \nOrleans make a commitment that the city would be rebuilt.\n  But I think this is where the story of recovery comes out so bright \nand strong, Mr. Speaker. That is how the people of the Gulf Coast, how \nthe people of New Orleans, responded.\n  People didn't say they were just going to rebuild what was broken. \nYou saw people demanding, demanding, Mr. Speaker, that we rebuild \nbetter, stronger, more efficient. People started demanding that \ngovernment work differently, that government work better.\n  Those levees that failed, Mr. Speaker, caused so much of that \ndevastation. People said: We need to reform the way that levees are \nbuilt. You saw a citizen uprising, in fact, that led to dramatic \nchanges in State law.\n  I was a State representative at the time. We actually changed the \nconstitution of Louisiana to require that people who serve on levee \nboards actually have experience in things like engineering, hydrology.\n  You saw citizen groups like Women of the Storm emerge, where over \n50,000 people signed a petition not long after that demanded that laws \nbe changed, Mr. Speaker, to make those kinds of reforms in levee \nboards.\n\n[[Page H5659]]\n\n  And when you look at the levees that were rebuilt today with the help \nof our colleagues up here in Congress and the work of FEMA and other \nagencies--when you look at those levees, they are dramatically better.\n  The flood protection systems are better in southeast Louisiana. That \ndidn't happen by accident. That happened because the people demanded \nthose kinds of changes.\n  You look at the political reform. As we all know, every State has got \nits problems. But Louisiana had a bad history of political corruption \ngoing back over 100 years.\n  The people of Louisiana demanded a better political system. You \nactually saw citizens picking up the telephone, calling the FBI if they \nsaw an ounce of political corruption.\n  There became a zero tolerance for political corruption in the city of \nNew Orleans and the surrounding regions. People went to jail.\n  But it was because the public said: We demand better. And, \nultimately, that helped lead to the recovery that we see today 10 years \nlater.\n  Just look at the school system, Mr. Speaker. Before Katrina struck, \nNew Orleans had one of the most failed and corrupt public school \nsystems in the country.\n  There were kids that were graduating--we had a high school \nvaledictorian who couldn't pass the State exit exam.\n  After Katrina, again people said: We are going to rebuild, but we are \ngoing to demand a better public school system.\n  And you saw sweeping reforms move through the State legislature, \nsetting up a system of charter schools in the New Orleans area that are \nnow touted as the model for reform for urban education systems.\n  That didn't happen by accident. That happened because the people \ndemanded better from government. We saw government fail at every level, \nFederal, State, and local. It is well documented.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  The story of New Orleans today, 10 years after the storm, is the \nstory of a strong and resilient people who said: We absolutely will \nrebuild, but we are not going to rebuild the same way that it was \nbefore with all of the flaws and problems that existed; we are going to \ndemand better.\n  You can see better today, you can see the recovery. It is not over. \nThere are still some neighborhoods that are working to rebuild, but \nthere are so many neighborhoods that are stronger today, that are more \nthriving today. Young people coming in from other States to be a part \nof this renaissance, to be a part of this recovery.\n  It is an exciting time to be in the New Orleans region today; but \nobviously, as we reflect upon the devastation of Katrina 10 years ago, \nwe know how far we have come and how much it took people pulling \ntogether, working with groups like the Pastors Resource Council, \npastors from all around the country that came together to say that, \nwhile government had its failings, individuals, communities came \ntogether, churches came together, faith-based groups stood up like we \nhave known that they do in so many other disasters to help get food to \npeople, get shelter to people, and help people recover.\n  We, obviously, reflect on and pray for the lives that were lost and \nremember the devastation that was so horrific, but we also celebrate \nthe recovery that is still so evident in the people of Louisiana.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5659-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5659-H5660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) is \nrecognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, nearly 10 years \nago, the scenes flashing across our television screens showed what \nappeared to be a Third World country--literally bodies floating in the \nstreets, people that were homeless, homes washed away--one of the worst \nnatural disasters in America's history.\n  Mr. Speaker, over 1,200 of our brothers, our sisters, our mothers, \nfathers, uncles, aunts, our neighbors, our friends perished in the \ndisaster on August 29, 2005. We lost over 1,200 people, Mr. Speaker.\n  These vulnerabilities were not vulnerabilities that were unknown. As \na matter of fact, Mark Schleifstein with The Times-Picayune published a \nseries known as ``Washing Away'' in 2002, years before Hurricane \nKatrina hit our State and caused all this devastation.\n  That series accurately predicted, the vulnerabilities accurately \npredicted the outcomes of a direct hit by a storm like Hurricane \nKatrina upon our communities. We saw what had happened. Homes, \nbusinesses, monuments, schools, our history, our dreams, our hopes, our \nfuture were all flooded as a result of Hurricane Katrina 10 years ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, this wasn't a Third World country; it was one of \nAmerica's great cities that was underwater. Many people look back at \nHurricane Katrina, and they view the impacts as being parochial, things \nthat impacted Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, not something that \nimpacted the Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. When the \nMississippi River was shut down and all the ports associated with it \nacross the Gulf Coast as a result of the devastating impacts, the \nfarmers in the Midwest had no way of getting their crops out to market. \nThere was no capacity within other transportation mediums to get these \ncrops out; therefore, the farmers in the Midwest suffered as a result \nof Hurricane Katrina's impacts on the Gulf Coast.\n  Mr. Speaker, rail lines, Louisiana is only one of two places in the \nUnited States where we have all six class I rail lines. In many cases, \nthe rail lines and the associated infrastructure was destroyed, \ntherefore, once again, severely impacting America's intermodal \ntransportation system.\n  The economy, one of the places that has these amazing natural \nresources, has an amazing energy industry, petrochemical industry, \nagriculture industry, and many, many others, severely impacted, causing \nimpacts not just again to the regional economy, but to the national \neconomy.\n  Mr. Speaker, one great example of that is gasoline prices. Following \nHurricane Katrina, we watched gasoline prices spike 75 cents a gallon; \nbut let me be clear, not in Louisiana, nationwide--75 cents a gallon is \nthe national average price increase as a result of those 2005 \nhurricanes on the Gulf Coast--75 cents a gallon.\n  As I recall, I believe that translates into $450 million in higher \nconsumer payments per day as a result of the impacts those storms had, \nthe 2005 hurricanes--Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita--had on the \nGulf Coast and had on, really, the Nation.\n  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, the deficit, much of the recovery that was \nfunded by the Federal Government, in fact, the far majority of it, was \nfunded by deficit spending, funded by deficit spending. This wasn't \nspending that was offset; this wasn't reserve dollars that the Federal \nGovernment had sitting there waiting for this unbelievable disaster. \nThis was deficit spending.\n  Our children, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren will be \npaying for decades for this. I want to be clear, Mr. Speaker, this was \npreventable, which I am going to talk about in a minute.\n  Also the impact to the environment, here you see the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, and you see the EPA out there talking about the \nimportance of wetlands and the importance of waters of the United \nStates and writing all of these extraordinary rules to grant themselves \nmore aggressive jurisdiction, larger jurisdiction over our private \nlands; yet as a result of those storms alone in 2005, we lost over 200 \nsquare miles of coastal wetlands in the State of Louisiana alone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to say again, a lot of people looked at this \nand watched it on TV and saw it as being a parochial problem, a problem \nof the Gulf Coast, a problem of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  Mr. Speaker, you could cut and paste that situation; you could paste \nvirtually any other coastal city, any other coastal State in this \nNation, and they potentially could face the same repercussions, the \nsame outcomes as\n\n[[Page H5660]]\n\nwe experienced in 2005 because this Nation continues to have a reactive \npolicy to disasters, and it is something that we have got to change.\n  We could have taken the hundred-plus billion dollars that Congress \nappropriated following the 2005 hurricanes to help recover, to help get \nthese communities back on their feet across the Gulf Coast. We could \nhave taken a fraction of those dollars, and we could have invested it \nproactively and prevented it from happening.\n  Mr. Speaker, any city on our coast could experience the same disaster \nwe saw; and I remind you, just in 2012, we saw Hurricane Sandy cause \nprofound consequences in New York, New Jersey, and other communities on \nthe East Coast. I will say it once again, disasters that were \npreventable, and so this is something that we all need to be paying \nattention to.\n  While in New Orleans, while in south Louisiana and Mississippi and in \nAlabama, there were amazing stories of communities coming together, of \npeople coming together, of resilient families coming together to ensure \nthat while this did knock them down, they were getting back up again, \nand they were going to recover--strong resolve from these communities \nall across the Gulf Coast.\n  Mr. Speaker, one other thing that was truly amazing is watching the \nincredible outpouring of support not just from the Gulf Coast, but from \nall over this Nation and countries around the world, committing to come \nhelp us recover across the Gulf Coast.\n\n  It was an amazing opportunity for people to come together, to put \ndown differences, and to all come together in support of the recovery \nof these communities, the recovery of these families, the recovery of \nthese businesses, the recovery of the hopes and dreams of these \ncommunities across the Gulf Coast.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are going to continue to see this play over and over \nagain. We are going to continue to see these types of disasters over \nand over again until we turn the policies around in the United States, \nuntil we see fundamental changes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to pivot back to the recovery; I want to pivot \nback to New Orleans; I want to pivot back to Plaquemines Parish and St. \nBernard, St. Tammany; I want to pivot back to lower Jefferson Parish. \nThese communities, in many cases, were destroyed.\n  Everything was underwater, everything. I will say it again, the \nhomes, the businesses, the schools, the hopes, the dreams, the future \nunderwater--and 10 years ago, 10 years ago, unbelievable. I think that \nmost people would have told you these communities aren't coming back; \nthey can't come back. They have been so profoundly impacted that they \nsimply can't recover from this, but that is not what happened.\n  As you just heard Mr. Scalise discuss, people came together. We now \nhave an amazing progress, amazing recovery of our schools in south \nLouisiana, amazing recovery in our economy.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, we now have tens of billions of \ndollars in economic development projects on the horizon while, in other \nareas, you are seeing people losing jobs, you are seeing businesses \nclose, you are seeing small businesses shut down and a trend of more \nsmall businesses closing and opening across the Nation; but in \nLouisiana, Mr. Speaker, tens of billions of dollars in new economic \ndevelopment projects on the horizon.\n  As a matter of fact, we have the largest foreign investment in U.S. \nhistory committed to projects in south Louisiana. We are seeing a \nmanufacturing renaissance, and it is happening because our people are \nso resilient because we have come back, because we have come together, \nand because we have plotted a path to the future using the resources \nthat Louisiana is so blessed with, the Louisiana maritime \ntransportation system that we have, and the amazing natural resources \nin regard to the inexpensive, readily available natural gas, oil, \npetrochemical industry, the rail lines, the intermodal transportation \nfacilities.\n  We have been able to accomplish a manufacturing renaissance not in \nMexico, not in Asia, but right here in the United States in south \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to say I pray that there is not \nanother community, that there is not another city, that there is not \nanother State in this Nation that has to experience, that has to go \nthrough the tragedy, the travesty that we experienced in south \nLouisiana, the loss of over 1,200 of our friends, our relatives, and \nour neighbors, to see the type of recovery, to see people come \ntogether.\n  To see us finally help to build a resilient protection system, \nresilient ecosystem to ensure that the next storm isn't going to cause \nthe same devastation to New Orleans as we saw 10 years ago, I pray, Mr. \nSpeaker, that that doesn't have to happen again.\n  The only way we prevent it from happening again is if people learn \nfrom the lessons of Hurricane Katrina, from Hurricane Rita, if they \nactually apply the lessons learned that we so painfully went through in \nsouth Louisiana, in Mississippi, and in Alabama, that we apply those \nlessons around the United States to make our communities more \nresilient; to make our economy more resilient; to make our businesses \nmore resilient; to make our families more resilient; and, Mr. Speaker, \nmost importantly, to ensure that we can all accomplish the American \nDream.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5660-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5660-H5664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nRichmond) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I want to just thank my colleagues from \nLouisiana for also talking about the devastation that we received in \nhurricanes, both Katrina and Rita, which we call the ``sister \nhurricanes'' because they were only separated by a couple of days and \nwhat damage that Hurricane Katrina caused. Just a few days later, \nHurricane Rita came right behind it and exacerbated that damage.\n  Let me just hit on a few of the misperceptions of Katrina. Well, \nactually, since I have had a little time and I want to make sure that \neveryone involved has a chance to have time to speak on this, I yield \nto the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), my good friend, who \nat the time was chair of the Homeland Security Committee, who made sure \nthat some of the deficiencies in FEMA and some of the other places that \ncaused us undue headaches during the rebuilding, that those headaches \nwere relieved a little bit or eased a little bit because of the hard \nwork of Bennie Thompson, whose State also incurred some damage.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I appreciate the gentleman from New \nOrleans for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise for two reasons--one, to talk about what it is to \nbe in the eye of a hurricane and to be without basic necessities for \nover 10 days because of a hurricane and, two, what it is that our \ngovernment should do when those situations occur at the Federal, State, \nand local levels.\n  In my comments, initially, I will talk a little bit about what \nhappened in August of 2005--how, in fact, so many people were impacted \nas well as what we have done as a government, what we didn't do, and \nwhat we should do in going forward.\n  As the gentleman from Louisiana has said, for the most part, both \nHurricanes Rita and Katrina ravaged Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and a little bit of Florida, but I will limit my comments to \nKatrina. In Hurricane Katrina, there were over 1,800 people--from \nFlorida to Texas--who died.\n  In my home State of Mississippi, 238 individuals died. Basically, \nwhat we had after that is over 1.2 million housing units damaged, and \nin my home State, almost 120,000 were completely destroyed. In southern \nMississippi, that meant that over 60 percent of the single family \ndwellings were either destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, and the \nstatistics were worse for rental units. Along the Gulf Coast--the \nbeautiful Gulf Coast where we have the largest manmade beach in the \nUnited States--there were over 1 million people displaced. One month \nafter the storm, 600,000 families were still homeless, and, ultimately, \n114,000 were housed in FEMA trailers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't have to tell you what happened with the FEMA \ntrailers. It was a mess. The government's\n\n[[Page H5661]]\n\nresponse to the temporary housing situation could only be characterized \nas a mess. We fixed it, but during that time, we put people in trailers \nthat had basically been pieced together and shipped to the good people \nof the Gulf Coast. Many of them had Chinese drywall in those trailers \nthat let off formaldehyde, which, ultimately, impacted the health of \neverybody we put in the trailers, ostensibly, for temporary housing. We \ncreated a bigger health problem.\n  Obviously, we passed legislation to address some of it in terms of \nthe health costs and other things. Ultimately, a lawsuit provided some \nrelief to the families. What we have done in correcting that temporary \nhousing situation is to direct FEMA to not just be the response and \nrecovery agency. We want you to also understand that, when people are \nin trouble, not only do you come, but you come with the right resources \nto make sure that you don't create and make life worse for them. After \nour Katrina experience, we have a more nimble operation, and we have \nfar better individuals who are trained so that, when disasters come, we \ncan respond.\n  The problem that I have goes back, Mr. Speaker, to the comments that \na speaker on the other side made.\n  When you are in a disaster, whether it is a hurricane or a flood or a \ntornado, the last thing you want is for somebody to ask, ``Well, who is \ngoing to pay for it?'' These are citizens of the United States of \nAmerica. The only thing we should say is, ``In your darkest hour, in \nyour time of need, your government will not let you down.'' I would \nhope that people understand that we are a great nation because we take \ncare of all of our people, especially when the chips are down and when \nthey have no other place to turn. So I would hope that we would not \ntalk about issues of deficit spending when people are being plucked off \nthe roofs of their homes or when they are being dislocated hundreds of \nmiles from their residences simply because they can't get back into \ntheir neighborhoods.\n  What I also want to talk about is the fact that, since Katrina, we \nhave made sure that first responders can communicate with each other. \nThere were a number of stories about individuals who wanted to help but \nwho couldn't talk to each other. Hopefully, we have started fixing that \ninteroperability issue so that those individuals can communicate with \neach other, whether they are paid firemen, volunteer firepersons, or \nwhether they are law enforcement at the State, county, or local level, \nbecause, when we are involved in any natural disaster that is federally \ndeclared, the constituents who need our help don't want us to get \nbogged down in the territories. They just want the help. Part of the \nhelp is making sure that these individuals can communicate with each \nother.\n  We had nonprofit organizations. The Red Cross, most specifically, was \nseverely criticized because of its response to Katrina. A substantial \nnumber of citizens who were impacted were in low-income, minority \ncommunities, and we started getting responses such as: ``We don't know \nwhat to do in those areas''; ``We are afraid to go in those areas.'' \nYet, if you are part of the national preparedness system, you go and \nhelp; you don't try to qualify that help. Part of that agreement we \nhave with an organization like the Red Cross is that you will do \nbetter, that you will respond when other organizations don't have the \ncapacity.\n  We are continuing to work on the Red Cross' response to natural \ndisasters in this country. Sometimes they do a good job, and sometimes \nthey don't. What we have to do is make sure that, every time they \nrespond, they respond in a manner that is helping someone. Regardless \nof people's socioeconomic statuses in life, they are still American \ncitizens. I look forward to continuing to work on that.\n  The other thing we have to work on, Mr. Speaker, is in making sure \nthat the moneys that are sent to the devastated areas don't get \ndiverted to other areas.\n  In my home State of Mississippi, our Governor at the time diverted \nover $600 million, which was directed to low- and middle-income housing \nproblems, to a port expansion, which had nothing to do with housing, \nbut the flexibility to do it was there. We had a number of people who \nlost everything they had, and they didn't have any means to come back. \nThe moneys that we sent from Washington to attempt to make those \nindividuals whole and to reintroduce them to the communities from which \nthey had been displaced had been sent to the Port of Gulfport. It is a \nworthy project, but you shouldn't have to take moneys to do that which \nwere intended by Congress to go for low- and middle-income housing.\n  As of this date, the requirements for that money still have not met \nthe satisfaction of not only the HUD officials, but also of members of \nthe communities. We should not take moneys in times of emergency and \nfund pet projects. If those projects are worthy to be funded, then \nlet's fund them out of traditional sources and not out of emergency \nsources. I am concerned that we do that.\n  I want to pay a special tribute to the Mississippi Center for \nJustice, which has done a wonderful job in pursuing the expenditure of \nthese funds consistent with the intent of those funds. I want to pay a \nspecial tribute as well to the Mississippi Conference of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People. They have provided \nwitnesses and testimony at hearing after hearing as well as \ndocumentation about the questionable expenditures around Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  As I said in the beginning, as one of those individuals who \nexperienced Katrina firsthand, our government has to step up and help \nthese people in their time of need. What we have done in the last 10 \nyears is to attempt to fix everything that we have identified that \ndidn't work. We have solved our interoperability problem. We have \nprovided training for first responders. We have provided evacuation \nroutes for individuals so that they know how to leave as well as routes \nfor vulnerable populations or whether they are handicapped in some \nform. We have even created opportunities so that pets won't be left \nalone when evacuations occur. All of those things are very important \nbecause it goes to who we are as a people. So how we treat the least of \nthem in their most desperate hours goes to the character of who we are \nas a nation.\n\n  As we mark this 10-year anniversary of Katrina, Mr. Speaker, I want \nus to understand that it is still a work in progress and that it \ndoesn't matter whether you live in a house on a hill or if you live in \na house around the corner that is at a dead end--you are still an \nAmerican citizen. When things like a Hurricane Katrina happen, you \nshould rest assured that your government will be Johnny on the spot.\n  As I step back from my microphone, I want to compliment the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana for leading this Special Order, because we should really \nunderstand how difficult Katrina has been for those individuals who \nwere in the brunt.\n  Let me also take a point of personal privilege to talk about the good \njob that the men and women of the United States Coast Guard did in \nresponse to Katrina. They really did a tremendous job in working and in \nmanaging a lot of the recovery and response to Katrina.\n  In August 2005, nearly ten years ago, Hurricane Katrina made landfall \nin Mississippi and ravaged the Gulf Coast.\n  The storm pummeled everything in its path.\n  Over 1800 people from Florida to Texas died, including 238 from my \nhome State of Mississippi.\n  After what felt like an eternity, the storm died down.\n  We inventoried our losses, and the painfully slow recovery process \nbegan.\n  1.2 million housing units were damaged, and 120,000 were completely \ndestroyed.\n  In Southern Mississippi, more than 60 percent of single-family \ndwellings were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable--and the statistics \nwere worse for rental units.\n  Along the Gulf Coast, over 1 million people were displaced.\n  One month after the storm, About 600,000 families were still \nhomeless, and ultimately 114,000 were housed in FEMA trailers.\n  The recovery process was slow and wrought with mistakes at the \nFederal, State, and local level.\n  At the Federal level, chain-of-command and coordination failures \ncomplicated the quick and efficient delivery of Federal resources, \nundermining both response and recovery efforts.\n  Opportunities to pre-stage important resources were missed.\n  Interoperable emergency communications challenges and lack of \nqualified, well-trained, and well-funded emergency response personnel--\ncapability gaps first identified during\n\n[[Page H5662]]\n\nthe response to the September 11th attacks--persisted.\n  Ineffective and underdeveloped disaster housing and disaster \nprocurement policies dragged out recovery efforts and drove up costs.\n  States appeared to lack capacity to drawdown Federal recovery funds \nquickly or effectively.\n  For example, my home state of Mississippi was awarded $3 billion in \nKatrina related infrastructure grants, but by January 2009, it had only \ndrawn down a little over half of those funds ($1.7 million).\n  FEMA allocated $156 million in hazard mitigation grant funds to \nMississippi, but the State had only drawn down $40 million two-and-a-\nhalf years after the storm struck.\n  My governor at the time diverted $600 million in CDBG funds initially \nintended for the construction of low and middle income housing to a \nport expansion project.\n  Parts of southern Mississippi are still feeling the impact of that \nill-advised decision to this day.\n  In the aftermath of the storm, Congress overhauled the national \nemergency management infrastructure by enacting The Post Katrina \nEmergency Management Reform Act, or PKEMRA.\n  The legislation sought to address preparedness, response and recovery \ngaps identified through oversight activities carried out by this \nCommittee, including:\n  (1) apparent uncertainty regarding who had authority to coordinate \nand direct response and recovery efforts under the National Response \nPlan;\n  (2) ineffective coordination of Federal, state, local, private sector \nresponse and recovery efforts;\n  (3) inadequate Federal coordination of preparedness planning, \nincluding lack of effective evacuation and temporary housing plans to \nmeet the needs of all of those in a community;\n  (4) lack of operable and interoperable communications to support \nresponse and recovery efforts; and,\n  (5) lack of effective emergency alert and warning systems to notify \nthe public of potential threats to health and safety.\n  Nationally, we have made progress on addressing these gaps.\n  For example, we have saved lives by getting people out of danger's \npath with the Integrated Public Alerts and Warnings System.\n  Our planning and exercise programs have improved relationships among \nFederal, State, and local responders to facilitate quicker, more \neffective response and recovery efforts.\n\n  And we have honed the national doctrine on preventing, protecting \nagainst, mitigating the effects of, responding to, and recovering from \nnatural and manmade disasters.\n  But significant challenges with long term recovery efforts remain.\n  For example, the Federal government's failure to have adequate \ndisaster housing plans in place before the storm struck resulted in \nlast-minute scrambling to find long-term recovery housing for the \ndisplaced.\n  We ended up with botched FEMA trailer contracts that cost taxpayers \nmillions of dollars, and ultimately provided Hurricane survivors with \nformaldehyde-laced dwellings.\n  A class action lawsuit from 55,000 Gulf Coast Residents against over \ntwo dozen mobile home manufacturers was finally settled for over $42.5 \nmillion in 2012.\n  Despite this difficult lesson, as we saw in 2012 after Hurricane \nSandy, developing viable disaster housing options for regions across \nthe United States continues to be an elusive goal.\n  Although we have made progress on achieving interoperability, gaps \ncontinue to hinder effective responses.\n  Despite the horrific loss, survivors demonstrated inspiring \nresilience.\n  And the American people proved once again their commitment to helping \nthose affected by disaster by sending resources and flocking affected \nareas to aid recovery.\n  Over the past decade, Gulf Coast residents, with Federal support and \nthe help of volunteers from across the country, have rebuilt much of \nwhat was lost.\n\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the important work of the \nMississippi Conference of the NAACP and the Mississippi Center for \nJustice.\n  Both of those organizations traveled to and opened offices on the \nCoast to offer legal services to the thousands of Gulf Coast area \nresidents who needed an advocate to help make them whole.\n  Notably, they filed a lawsuit on behalf of community groups and \nindividuals against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment resulting in a landmark settlement of $132 million dollars \nfor low-income households in nine Mississippi counties.\n  The Mississippi Center for Justice has continued to spearhead \nnumerous Federal and state policy battles to demand and restore safe \nand affordable housing to Hurricane Katrina's most vulnerable \nsurvivors, including thousands of children.\n  The Hurricane Katrina recovery, in many respects, has become a story \nof American perseverance and generosity--and I am glad we are here to \ncommemorate and honor it this evening.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me inquire as to how much time I have remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). The gentleman has 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, before I get into some of the \nmisconceptions and perceptions that still remain from Katrina, let me \njust finish where the gentleman from Mississippi left off.\n  In its aftermath and the rescue and recovery, one of the shining \nstars during Hurricane Katrina was the United States Coast Guard. They \ndid a phenomenal job, both day and night, in rescuing people with \nhelicopters and boats and everything at their disposal. They didn't \ncare if they were tired, and they didn't care if they were hungry. They \njust did the job that they should have done just like most of our \nservicemen. They were the shining stars.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I mentioned earlier that one of the perceptions that is just \ninaccurate about Katrina was that it was a natural disaster. It is not \njust me who will call it a manmade disaster.\n  In 2009, Judge Duval ruled that the Federal Government was liable for \nthe damage related to MRGO because the canal's original purpose was \nnavigation. That decision was affirmed, and then it was overturned by \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  However, on May 1, 2015, a Federal claims judge, Susan Braden, ruled \nthat the Army Corps of Engineers is liable for damages resulting from \nflooding during Katrina again and that the damage caused in both St. \nBernard Parish, which is not in my district, and the lower Ninth Ward \nof New Orleans, which is in my district, was that the Army Corps of \nEngineers was responsible and liable for the damage caused to their \nhomes because the Coast Guard was responsible for the increased storm \nsurge and flooding during Hurricane Katrina and that the Army Corps \nknew that their failure could have that effect.\n  So Judge Braden has ordered that the Federal Government, more \nspecifically, the Justice Department, enter into settlement \nnegotiations with the attorneys of those residents in both the lower \nNinth Ward and St. Bernard Parish. I would just continue to urge the \nFederal Government to step up to do that because it is the right thing \nto do.\n  Some of the other things that I just want to spend a quick moment in \ncorrecting are that, after the storm, there was violence in the streets \nand people were shooting at the rescue boats. That was just absolutely \nuntrue.\n  As I tout the success of the Coast Guard, I have to now question and \ncriticize the effort of both the Red Cross and our National Guard.\n  In the days after Katrina, there were Red Cross buses on the side of \nthe highway that lined from New Orleans all the way to Baton Rouge \nbecause the buses were scared to go into New Orleans because it was \ndangerous.\n  The Red Cross and the National Guard had 18-wheelers and military \ntrucks full of water that were designated to go into New Orleans, but \nthey were on the side of the interstate opposite the buses because they \nthought it was too dangerous to go into New Orleans.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, I just want to tell you, while the National Guard, \nthe Red Cross, and others were scared to go into New Orleans, I myself, \nwith another council member, Oliver Thomas at the time, was driving a \nminivan into New Orleans filled with water with no security, no \nprotection, and the only thing we encountered were grateful people who \nwere looking for some help, some water, some food, and some direction \nas to how and when this recovery would start.\n  What I don't want is people to look at New Orleans and remember back \nto those days and just believe the misinformation about all of those \nother things.\n  While I am correcting that, let me also touch on why people didn't \nleave. Many people have said people just chose not to leave for various \nreasons, they didn't know better. All of that is absolutely untrue, \nalso.\n  The biggest reason people didn't leave was that the warnings were \nweak\n\n[[Page H5663]]\n\nand they were not enough notice. I remember watching the news and \nwatching the mayor of New Orleans say: Well, I am sending my family to \nDallas. If I were you, I would evacuate.\n  Well, in moments like this, you need stern warnings and you have to \nbe blunt.\n  I was on the conference calls where FEMA and Red Cross said that they \nwere sending 10,000 body bags. We knew this was the real one. It was \nthe time to show leadership and tell people to leave the city in no \nuncertain terms.\n  I remember having a conference call with Governor Blanco in which she \ntalked about all of these things, along with the Red Cross and FEMA.\n  By the time that it was my turn to talk, I said, ``Governor, I \nunderstand that this is the real deal. However, there are 1,500 people \nacross the street from my house playing Little League. They don't get \nthe benefit of hearing what you just said on this conference call.''\n  It was later that day and the next morning that people pushed, but it \nwas only a day out from the storm.\n  And then we never talked about the expenses associated with \nevacuating once or twice in the city, packing your family up, driving \nto another city, paying for a hotel, feeding your family, and then \ncoming back.\n  When that happens over and over again and they were false alarms, if \nyou don't give them the stern warning when you know it is the real one, \nyou know some people won't leave.\n  The last part of it is we came up with a bad idea of using shelters \nthat were in harm's way. We had thousands of people in the Louisiana \nSuperdome that is located in New Orleans. Well, the Superdome was right \nin harm's way.\n  One of the other perceptions--and you actually heard it tonight--was \nthat the new New Orleans has a great school system that has turned \naround education in this urban setting, and the truth of the matter is \nit is a work in progress at best.\n  The State came in and took over most of our schools, all but maybe \nfive or six of them. Out of those 57 schools that they took over, seven \nare B schools, no A schools, 20 are C schools, and 24 are D and F \nschools.\n  We still have some work to do in the area of education. We have made \nsome improvements, but we have kids now that are being bused and \nstaying on the bus almost 2 hours to get to a school in the morning and \n2 hours in the evening. That is not a system that we want.\n  Our good schools don't have attendance zones, and it has become a \nmaze in order to apply and to get into our better schools.\n  Those are things that can be fixed if everybody is willing to come to \nthe table and figure out the best way to do it and not look at everyone \nwho has suggestions or criticisms of the school system as being an \nenemy.\n  Public education: Even if you look at the Brown v. Board of Education \ndecision years ago, 50, 75 years ago, that decision came about because \nthe Justices talked about how an education is important to being a good \ncitizen, thriving, and being a success.\n\n  Because of that, we should spend more time in working to make sure \nthat the New Orleans public school system is a system that educates all \nof the kids.\n  Whether you are Black or White, whether you are poor or rich, whether \nyou live in a great neighborhood or whether you live in a bad \nneighborhood, every kid should have the opportunity to succeed.\n  The other thing that people see a lot now, whether we are hosting a \nSuper Bowl, the Final Four, or the Sugar Bowl, people assume that the \ncity is back because the areas that they cover on TV are the areas that \nare back.\n  If you look at Canal Street, Bourbon Street, and all of those areas, \nthe Superdome, the New Orleans arena, they are back.\n  However, there are still areas that are not back. You still have \nareas where homeowners are still struggling to rebuild.\n  You can look at the lower Ninth Ward. You can look at the upper Ninth \nWard. You can look at Gentilly. You can look at New Orleans East. Those \nareas are still fighting to recover.\n  You can look at some of the complaints from homeowners when the Road \nHome process was set up. They complain that they were fingerprinted and \ntreated like criminals during the application process in the onset of \nasking for government assistance.\n  Remember, we are talking about homeowners, the most responsible \npeople in a community, being fingerprinted and treated like criminals \nduring the application process.\n  Also, the Federal Government prohibited grants exceeding the value of \na property. So Road Home tied its calculation to a home's prestorm \nvalue as opposed to the actual cost of rebuilding.\n  So when you look at the 36,000 grant recipient collection letters for \nalleged overpayments, duplication of insurance proceeds, or failure to \ncomply with the covenants, you see 36,000 people that are being \nunjustly punished by the Federal Government.\n  I would just say that we said it very early on in the process, that \nusing appraised value was going to harm minority communities because an \nappraisal is subjective, depending on where you live. So homes in the \nmore affluent areas of New Orleans appraised a lot higher.\n  I can just tell you, doing electrical work when I was small, doing \nconstruction work, to rebuild a 1,500-square-foot house, whether it is \nin Lakeview or whether it is in the lower Ninth Ward, Sheetrock, \nplywood, screws, and nails are all going to cost the same. Instead of \nusing appraised value, we should have used rebuilding cost. That is \njust not my opinion.\n  I will tell you that the Federal court ruled that the Road Home's \nmethod of calculating grants discriminated against African American \nhomeowners. That was back in 2010.\n  The problem with that ruling was that, in order for the State to stop \nusing prestorm value to calculate Road Home grants, it was only for the \nfuture grants. By that time, a majority of the grants had already been \ngiven out.\n  So I will just tell you that that $62 million in additional grants \nhelped about 1,500 homeowners. Remember, we had over 100,000 properties \nthat were damaged in the storm. So you can see the abundance of people \nthat did not get assistance.\n  Some of the other remaining issues with Road Home was that we still \nhave people who need money to get back into their homes because they \nhave an unmet need.\n  HUD could have done something very simple to figure out where we are \nnow, and that is to figure out what people received from their \ninsurance company, what people received from FEMA, and what people \nreceived from Road Home.\n  You add those up and then you figure out the cost to rebuild. If the \nrebuilding cost exceeds those, that is the unmet need that we need help \nfrom the government because there is money that is still available.\n  I would say we need the Federal Government to actually take some \ntime, investigate, and figure out how we can use the unused money to \nmake people whole that were not made whole in the beginning.\n  Also, let me bring up just one other thing so you can get a full idea \nof the picture of New Orleans. If you just look at rent, in the 9 years \nsince Katrina, the share of people paying 50 percent of their income \nfor rent is now 37 percent.\n  So what you are really saying is that secure housing cost burdens 50 \npercent of household income, and that indicates a serious problem in \nhousing affordability.\n  In 2004, just to give you a reference, the share of severely cost-\nburdened renters in New Orleans was 24 percent. Now it is 37 percent in \nNew Orleans. It is 26 percent nationally.\n  That is a problem and we really need to work on it because, if you \ncan't live in the city, you can't work in the city. This government is \nbetter than that.\n  So the other thing I would just say is that people think we are back \nand we are rebuilt, and that is not the case. The other thing is that \npeople think that we received everything we need to rebuild.\n  I would say that Congress, the government, and the President did a \ngreat job in immediately sending down $14 billion to New Orleans and \nputting it in a fund, which is unheard of in Congress, to take money \nand just put it in a fund and say: Corps of Engineers, as you rebuild \nthe levee, spend this\n\n[[Page H5664]]\n\nmoney, protect New Orleans. They did it, and they did a good job of \ndoing it.\n  We still have outlying areas that need flood control. If you look at \nthe cost of Katrina--and I will give you a few figures--you will see \nthat we still have a gap.\n  You had $150 billion in damages. Most of the Federal spending went \nfor relief, not rebuilding. $120.5 billion in total spending. Emergency \nrelief was 75 billion. Rebuilding funds was 45 billion.\n  So if you look at the Federal funding, private insurance claims, and \ncharitable giving, it still leaves a gap of about $60 billion. When you \ntalk about a gap of $60 billion, I just want you to understand what \nthat means.\n  That means, in every community, every neighborhood, including mine, \nyou will see five houses where people have come back, saved up money, \nand rebuilt using both insurance, savings, retirement, FEMA, government \nmoney. Then you will see a house or two that is not rebuilt at all.\n  Then if you go down to the lower Ninth Ward, you will see one house \nthat is rebuilt. Then you will see six or seven houses that are not \nrebuilt where the grass is just as high as the trees and it looks like \na forest.\n  If you are that one homeowner that took the time to come home and \nrebuild and you have to pass that every night, it is just not a safe \nsituation. We, as a country, can do better than that.\n  So what I would hope is that, as we continue the process of helping \nNew Orleans and Louisiana recover from Katrina, that we look at the \nlessons learned and we find the people who still have unmet needs, we \nfind the people that are still not back in their homes who want to be \nin their homes, and we figure out a way to help them.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  That is what HUD is for. We still have the money, and in fact, \ncitizens and community groups--and I can think of a bunch of them, A \nCommunity Voice, Justice and Beyond--all of those groups have been \nasking Congress and the inspector general to do an audit and an \ninvestigation of how much funds we received, where did they go, what is \nleft, how do we move forward and make sure that everyone who wants to \ncome home has the ability to come home.\n  Now, all of those things and, I think, lessons learned and \nmisperceptions of Katrina, I think we have to take those same things \nand look at Sandy and all other hurricanes.\n  What I wanted to do before we went home for a break and celebrate the \n10th anniversary of Katrina is to let people know that we still have \nneeds; we still have things we have to do to complete the recovery, but \nalso thank Congress for what they did do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5664-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO LEBANON--MESSAGE \n      FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H.

Of the 15 resolutions considered \n     by the Committee, the nine alteration projects will address \n     critical life safety repairs or allow for space \n     consolidations, the two reprogramming prospectuses are fully \n     offset by reductions in other projects, the two construction \n     prospectuses include offsets and reductions in spending from \n     avoided lease costs, and the two lease prospectuses will \n     result in significant reductions in lease costs through the \n     reduction of space. In total, these resolutions represent \n     $327 million in avoided lease costs and offsets.\n       I have enclosed copies of the resolutions adopted by the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on July 23, \n     2015.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n                                                         Chairman.\n       Enclosures.\n\n                          Committee Resolution\n\n\n   ALTERATION--JACOB K.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nWesterman) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about something \nthat is positive that this body has done recently, something that is \ngood for America and something that is good for our environment and \ngood for our citizens. What I am talking about is the passage of the \nResilient Federal Forests Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is good for trees. When we have healthy trees \nand when we have a healthy forest, then we also have better air \nquality; we have better water quality; we have better wildlife habitat; \nwe have less fire danger; we protect private property and public \nproperty, and it is a win-win-win situation for our treasured natural \nresource of our Federal forest. It is a winning situation for America, \nas we are good stewards and we conserve this valuable resource that we \nhave.\n  Now, what this bill does is it allows us to actively manage our \nforests. We have qualified personnel in our Forest Service, people who \nare trained as foresters, people who have the expertise and the \nexperience to manage these forests in a sustainable way; yet our forest \nmanagers' hands have been tied in previous years.\n  They have been working hard with local constituents, local \nstakeholders in these collaborative efforts to come up with forest \nplans, forest management plans, so that they can manage the forests in \na way that is good for the local economy, in a way that is good for the \nwildlife in the forest, in a way that is good for the health of the \nforest; yet these forest management plans have been held up through \nfrivolous lawsuits from outside groups, sometimes as far as a thousand \nmiles away that file a suit against these plans.\n  They hold them up in court, and at the end of the day, the forest is \nnot managed properly. Because of this, we have seen an increasing \namount of forest fires over the past several decades.\n  Because of these increased forest fires, we are destroying our \nvaluable natural resource. Not only are we destroying our resource, we \nare destroying our budget for the Forest Service. Currently, the single \ngreatest cost to the Forest Service is fire suppression, and the next \ncost is litigation, and where the cost should be, in the management and \nhealth of the forest, comes in third.\n  What the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015 would do, it would \ntake the focus off of fire suppression and put that focus on fire \nprevention. These are forestry practices that I have seen carried out \nin my home State of Arkansas.\n  In my district, the Fourth District, I have approximately 2.5 million \nacres of Federal forest inside my district, on the Ouachita National \nForest, on the Ozark National Forest, and also in four different U.S. \nFish and Wildlife service areas.\n  Fortunately, in Arkansas, we have been able to manage these forests \nin a way that is good for the forest. A lot of this was done in an \neffort to protect an endangered species, the red-cockaded woodpecker. \nWhat our Forest Service employees have done is they have gone into the \nforests, they have assessed it, and they determined what would create \nthe best habitat for this endangered species. They found that a habitat \nwith an open understory, one which has large nesting trees for the \nwoodpecker, is great habitat for the woodpecker.\n  They implemented a plan to go in and thin the forest--not clear-cut \nit, but thin it--and then develop a fire regime to keep the underbrush \nout. You might think that thinning the forest and burning the forest \nwould cause a decrease in biodiversity, but our foresters saw something \nquite the opposite. Our forests in Arkansas were much like the ones \nacross the country, many forests out West. They had been cut as much as \na century ago and allowed just to grow back with the only management \nbeing putting the fires out when they start.\n  What happens in a situation like this is forests are dynamic; they \ncontinue to grow until they fill up all the growing space, and then \nthey start competing with one another. When they compete with one \nanother, they get weak; they are subject to insect and disease attack.\n  You get more fuel that falls on to the forest floor, creating a fuel \nload; you get dead and weakened timber, and you get a lightning strike, \nand it burns the whole forest down.\n  When you manage the forest, when you thin it and you use controlled \nburns, you open up the canopy; you open up the forest floor, and you \nsee a flush of fauna, and you see biodiversity increase tremendously.\n  At the same time as the biodiversity and plant life increases, you \nget a flush in wildlife. On these plots in Arkansas, not only did we \nsee an increase in numbers in red-cockaded woodpecker, we saw an \nincrease in the bobwhite quail, in wild turkeys, in deer, in several \nother songbird species.\n  This management scheme is good for the forest; it is good for the \nwildlife; it creates cleaner air; it creates cleaner water. Again, it \nis a win-win situation. By applying these management practices--and \nthey will be different as you go across the country in different \nregions.\n  As we let the local professionals and the local stakeholders manage \nthe forests the way it was intended to be managed, we will create a \nhealthy forest, which is good for all the local communities where these \nforests are located.\n  Another thing that we have done in this bill is we strengthened the \nsecure rural schools provisions. We stipulate that 25 percent of \nfunding has to go into local counties to provide emergency services to \nfund schools. This is critical for these local communities where forest \nactivities around the national forests have greatly decreased over the \npast several decades.\n  We used to cut nearly 12 billion board feet of timber off of the \nforests. Now, we are down to less than 3 billion board feet per year. \nMany of these local economies depended on those forests. As we quit \ncutting timber and the infrastructure to process the timber left, these \ncommunities suffered all across our country where these natural forests \nare located.\n\n  This bill will allow funding to go to these communities, so that they \ncontinue to provide emergency services, so they can continue to provide \nfunds for education and help to grow the communities.\n  Another provision in this bill is it allows the salvaging of timber \nafter a catastrophic event. Now, a clear cut actually mimics a wildfire \nin the forest; so when you have a wildfire that is a stand-replacing \nfire, it causes the damage when the fire occurs.\n  In forestry terms, the land is essentially being clear-cut when the \nfire happens, but you will still have dead standing trees. These trees \nneed to be salvaged. They have value, value that can be extracted and \nused to reforest the land, value that not only creates value in \nreforestation, it also cleans up the land, so you can reforest it and \nprevent future fire dangers.\n  What has happened in the past is the salvage cuts have been held up \nin court again, and you get standing dead timber that, the next time a \nfire comes through, it makes it dangerous for our firefighters to go in \nand fight the fire.\n  What this bill does is it still requires an environmental assessment \nof the area, but it speeds the process in that, and it prevents \ninjunctions from allowing these salvage cuts so that this timber can be \nsalvaged, and the revenue is used to go back into the Forest Service to \nreforest these lands and, again, provide the management practices to \nhave healthy forests.\n  What happens now is we see, after a catastrophic event, we get only 3 \npercent of regeneration or reforestation of the land. This bill \nrequires that, after the catastrophic event, we have to have 75 percent \nreforestation after a period of 5 years.\n  The 5-year timeframe gives foresters time to come in and assess the \nefforts that they put forth and to correct any problems that they have \nhad in restoring these forests.\n  This bill, again, is very critical and very much needed. It has the \nsupport of, I believe, 117 different organizations, from wildlife \ngroups, from environmental groups, many tribes across the country, many \ncounty governments. People recognize the benefits of this bill and the \nbenefits that can come to our country if we enact this legislation.\n\n[[Page H5759]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the bill is held up in the Senate right now, and as \nthe fire season increases out West and we see more and more of our \nnatural treasure and our Federal forests going up in flames, it should \nbecome more imperative for the Senate to take up this bill and pass it \nand for the President to sign it into law.\n  As I have stated in committee hearings when we were pushing this bill \nthrough, the forests don't really pay attention to what we legislate \nhere in Washington, D.C.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  They are dynamic, living organisms. They continue to grow. They \ncontinue to fill up the growing space. They are more reactive to what \nhappens in nature.\n  We need to be proactive in managing these forests--managing them to \nbe healthy, managing them to be more resistant to wildfire and inspects \nand diseases. I call on the Senate and the President to take up this \nlegislation, to pass it, and to move America forward with healthy \nforests.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n\n\n                       Recognizing Makenna Schwab\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have got something I think is very \nimportant and something I think you are going to enjoy.\n  Sometimes we learn about some very remarkable people, individuals \nwho, when we hear about them, make us pause, stop, and think about how \nmuch they inspire and really make a difference.\n  Today, I want to recognize one such person, a young lady of 12 years \nold by the name of Makenna Schwab. She lives in the community of East \nWenatchee, Washington, which happens to be in my legislative district \nin the State of Washington.\n  Makenna was born with something called Larsen syndrome, which is a \nrare connective tissue disorder that causes bone dislocations. This \naffects her airway, spine, and joints. This remarkable young lady has \nalready undergone 14 surgeries in her short life.\n  Four years ago, Makenna and her mother, Melissa, wanted to give \nsomething back to Seattle Children's Hospital, which over the course of \nher life has been their home away from home. She said she wanted to \ngive something back because Seattle Children's has made it so that she \ncan walk and live independently. So she decided to sell lemonade and \ncookies, a perfectly natural thing for a 12-year-old to decide. This \nyoung lady raised more than $6,700 that year for Children's Hospital.\n  The family knew they could do more. They wanted to do more. So the \nnext year, she and her family collected over 650 new toys for the kids \nat the hospital. But even that wasn't enough. The following year, she \nwanted to do even more. So she sold 530 dozen donuts, raising more than \n$7,500 to go towards Seattle Children's Hospital.\n  This year, Mr. Speaker, she set her sights even higher. According to \nSeattle Children's Hospital's Kathryn Bluher, Makenna's goal was to \ngive the kids at the hospital something that was very important, near \nand dear to her heart. She wanted to give them red Radio Flyer wagons.\n  I know you are smiling, Mr. Speaker, but that was an important thing \nbecause, in between her appointments throughout her young life, \ntraveling between her room to the operating room to the playroom, the \nred Radio Flyer wagon was her ride. And she rode in style. She said \nthat those wagons are a really good memory. They were less scary than a \nwheelchair.\n  The support that she got to reach her goal in this year's fundraising \nI think was nothing short of amazing. Makenna collected enough to \npurchase 33 wagons for the hospital. Friends, family, the mayor of the \ncity, Wenatchee High School, a group of local dentists, even assisted \nliving homes helped in the effort. The whole community pitched in. \nActually, the hospital had to tell her that that was enough wagons.\n  She moved on to other things that were on the wish list. By the end \nof the drive, she had those 33 wagons, but she also had 36 DVD players, \n12 headphones, five baby swings, 280 gift cards, 300 new toys, and many \nother things.\n  Makenna and her family have started a tradition that will live on, \nthat has and will continue to make kids' stay at the Seattle Children's \nHospital just a little less scary. As Makenna said, ``I want to give \nkids hope.''\n  Well, in May, and very deservedly so, Makenna received a national \nMake a Difference Day award for her volunteer project on behalf of the \nhospital.\n  As I told you before, sometimes you hear of remarkable people, and I \nam very proud to be able to share McKenna's story with you. I am proud \nto say that she is a fine citizen of my congressional district and my \nState of Washington.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 14 minutes remaining.\n\n\n  Increasing VA Accountability and Expanding Opportunity for Veterans\n\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to talk about some \nother positive things that this body has done here, as we approach the \nAugust break. This has to do with the VA.\n  Since the wait list manipulation scandal was brought to the public's \nattention last year, Americans have become all too familiar with \nincompetence and misconduct at the Federal agency charged with helping \nour veterans.\n  The House Veterans' Affairs Committee has held dozens of hearings; \nthe head of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs resigned under \ncongressional pressure; and Congress has enacted major reform \nlegislation.\n  The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and \nTransparency Act created a 3-year program to allow veterans to seek \ncare from private providers if they live too far from a VA facility or \ncannot otherwise get an appointment within 14 days. It also gave the VA \nSecretary the authority to fire senior executives for poor performance \nand required a top-to-bottom study of the entire Department to be \ncompleted within 1 year of enactment.\n  However, even with this oversight, the Obama administration has \nfailed to correct the problems. We continue to hear about unacceptable \npatient wait times, unanswered benefit inquiries, patient safety \nconcerns, medical malpractice, flagrant mismanagement, infighting, \ncorruption, and years of construction delays that total millions of \ndollars.\n  When government failure is exposed and legislation aimed at restoring \naccountability is enacted, it makes sense that action would be swift \nand immediate: people would be fired; wrongs would begin to be made \nright. Unfortunately, that has not been the case at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. While there are as many as 1,000 employees that could \npotentially face disciplinary actions, the VA has only fired three \npeople for involvement in the scandal.\n  Our veterans have earned our respect, and they shouldn't have to wait \nin line for months or years just to see a doctor. New documents show \nthat one out of every three waiting for care at the VA has already \ndied, and recent reports reveal there are now 50 percent more veterans \non wait lists for a month or longer than last summer.\n  When our brave servicemembers come home, we have to keep our word to \nthem by modernizing our VA system to deliver the best care in the \nworld. In the 114th Congress, House Republicans have passed numerous \npieces of legislation designed to help veterans and increase \naccountability at the VA.\n  In February, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans \nAct was signed into law and provides veterans with access to the mental \nhealthcare resources they need.\n  Last week, the House passed the Veterans Information Modernization \nAct, which would give Congress and the public access to key data \nregarding the delivery of health care, medical services, and nursing \nhome care by the VA healthcare system.\n\n  Many veterans have contacted us expressing their frustration at \nhaving to carry official Department of Defense discharge papers to \nprove their military service, and last week, legislation was signed \ninto law to create an official identification card for veterans.\n  Just this week, we have passed the VA Accountability Act, which would \nprovide the VA Secretary with increased flexibility in removing \nemployees who fail our veterans; the Hire More Heroes Act, which would \nmake it\n\n[[Page H5760]]\n\neasier to hire veterans by exempting those who already have health \ninsurance from being counted as full-time employees under ObamaCare; \nthe Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, which would \nprovide an annual cost-of-living adjustment for veterans receiving \ndisability compensation; and the Ruth Moore Act, which would update \nregulations for veterans seeking financial compensation for mental \nhealth conditions linked to sexual assault while they were serving in \nthe military.\n  The House also had to pass legislation that included provisions to \nallow the VA to transfer funds within its budget to cover an unexpected \n$2.5 billion shortfall in hospital and medical care accounts. Without \nthis fix, the agency said it would start shutting down hospital \noperations in August.\n  It is critically important that we take care of those who have \nsacrificed so much in service to our country. This week, Congress has \ncontinued its efforts to meet our responsibility to America's veterans. \nHowever, we cannot transform the VA alone. It is the President's \nresponsibility to ensure changes are made within the agency and \nemployees are held accountable for their actions.\n  America's veterans deserve a meaningful, decisive plan to right the \nmany wrongs that have been committed. It is past time for the Obama \nadministration to change the culture at the VA and end this agencywide \npattern of misconduct and neglect.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5760-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5760-H5761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REPUBLICANS ARE DELIVERING RESULTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North \nCarolina (Ms. Foxx) for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment my two colleagues who \nhave just spoken on the floor. I compliment Mr. Newhouse from the State \nof Washington for highlighting a very important event in his district \ninvolving a significant constituent of his.\n  I particularly would also like to recognize Mr. Westerman from \nArkansas for getting H.R. 2647 passed, the Resilient Federal Forests \nAct of 2015. It is really a coup for a freshman to get such a \nsignificant bill passed so early in his or her career. It is a major \nbill, a significant bill, and I want to compliment him on bringing his \nexpertise in forestry to the House of Representatives. We need people \nwith all kinds of backgrounds here who can help get things that the \nAmerican people need for us to do on their behalf, and certainly that \nbill is going to do a lot for American people all across this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been said that no one hears about the plane that \nlanded safely. What that very apt adage suggests is that we are often \nunaware of good work being done every day, and it isn't until something \ngoes wrong that people take notice. So, Mr. Speaker, I want to just \nhighlight for a few minutes this evening the great work that this \nCongress has been doing in the past 4\\1/2\\ years, and particularly \nduring the 114th Congress, which began in January.\n  Under the leadership of House Republicans, we have been doing very \ngood work in tackling the difficult issues facing this Nation. We are \nadvancing solutions that build a healthy economy, empowering every \nAmerican to pursue his or her future, to reach his or her full \npotential and achieve a better life. Here, Mr. Speaker, are just a few \nspecifics of what we have been accomplishing.\n  First, the House is more open. That may sound a little strange to \npeople, but it is important that the American people understand that, \nunder the majority leadership of Republicans, we have considered over \n200 more amendments than the average over the last 25 years in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The House is more collaborative. House committees have passed 10.2 \npercent of bills out of committee compared to a 40-year average of only \n6 percent of bills being passed.\n  The House is, overall, more productive. The House passed 193 bills in \nthe first quarter, well above the 40-year average of 127. Of those, 32 \nhave also passed the Senate--more than the 25-year average of 29.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  The House is more effective. Over the last 30 years, only one other \nRepublican-controlled House had more bills enacted in law to this \npoint, and this Congress is above the 40-year average of 29 bills \nenacted with 32.\n  The American people want us to come to Washington, use our time well, \nand work on their behalf to get the things done that they see need to \nbe done. We are working on our main focus, which are jobs and the \neconomy.\n  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow's good-paying jobs will come from the freedom \nto innovate from the bottom up, with organic growth, not from top-down \nbureaucracies in Washington, D.C., looking out for themselves and \nattempting, always, to control the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have passed many bills, as I have said before. One is \nthe Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, H.R. 527, \nwhich was approved by the House by a vote of 260-163 in February of \nthis year. That is a bipartisan vote, Mr. Speaker.\n  We passed the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, \nH.R. 50, by a bipartisan vote of 250-173.\n  We passed the Death Tax Repeal Act, H.R. 1105, by a vote of 240-179; \nthis is often called the death tax; it is sometimes called the estate \ntax, but it hits, Mr. Speaker, not just wealthy people, but average \npeople with huge, unfair taxes.\n  This bill would provide certainty for families and allow small \nbusinesses to focus on growing new jobs and is the smart thing to do \nfor our economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, much of the economic turmoil that has gripped this \nNation is the result of the Federal Government spending beyond its \nmeans. In North Carolina, I hear often from constituents who are \nworried about our ballooning national debt, which threatens economic \nstability and jeopardizes the American dream for our families.\n  Irresponsible spending isn't fair to our kids, who must repay the \ndebt, and it is not good for the economy.\n  Unknown to many Americans, the House Republican majority has cut \nFederal spending 2 years in a row for the first time since the Korean \nwar. We banned earmarks and achieved the most significant spending \nreductions in modern history. We have protected tax cuts for 99 percent \nof individuals and families.\n  We passed a balanced budget conference agreement which balances the \nbudget within 10 years, without raising taxes, and achieves more than \n$5 trillion in savings. It is the first joint 10-year balanced budget \nresolution since 2001.\n  We have passed the Student Success Act, which replaces No Child Left \nBehind, by reducing the Federal footprint in education, restoring local \ncontrol, and empowering parents and education leaders to hold schools \naccountable for effectively teaching students. It stops the Federal \nGovernment from coercing states into adopting Common Core.\n  We expanded and strengthened 529 college savings plans by a vote of \n401-20, a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  We have passed an energy policy, the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval \nAct, the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act. We have passed the \nLNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. We have passed Improving \nCoal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are working on the economy, on bringing down the cost \nof energy, on providing for national security.\n  We have passed the National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 1735, and \nare in conference now with the Senate on this bill.\n  We have passed the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, \nagain, by a very large bipartisan vote, 355-63.\n  We have passed the Protecting Cyber Networks Act by a large \nbipartisan vote of 307-116.\n  We have passed a bill signed into law by the President in June, the \nUSA Freedom Act, which ends the bulk collection of data at the National \nSecurity Agency, prevents government overreach, strengthens protections \nfor Americans' civil liberties, and increases the transparency of \ncertain national security authorities.\n  As my colleague from Arkansas talked about previous to my coming on\n\n[[Page H5761]]\n\nthe floor, we have passed several bills to honor our veterans. They \nhave earned our respect, and they shouldn't have to wait in line for \nmonths or years to see a doctor.\n  When our brave servicemembers come home, we have to keep our word to \nthem by modernizing our VA system to deliver the best care in the \nworld, and we have kept our promises to our veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have focused also on the human side of what needs to \nbe done in our society. We have passed the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. It was signed into law on May 29, 2015. Human \ntrafficking is a major problem in our country, and we are doing all \nthat we can to diminish it and eliminate it.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection \nAct with a bipartisan vote, H.R. 36. We expect that bill to be passed \nin the Senate.\n  We have also passed the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. It was \napproved by the House in January. This bill would permanently free \ntaxpayers from subsidizing abortion or insurance coverage that includes \nabortion. Mr. Speaker, we care very much for the most vulnerable among \nus.\n  We are also doing everything we can through our hearings to hold \nPresident Obama and the executive branch accountable in conjunction \nwith our constitutional duties. We continue to look for ways to improve \nwhat the Department of Veterans Affairs does.\n  We have witnessed the incompetence of the Office of Personnel \nManagement, which allowed its records of Federal employees to be \nhacked.\n  We have held hearings on the Secret Service scandal.\n  We have done everything we can to stop the EPA from imposing its \nclean water rule, which is very tough on our farmers in particular, but \non people all over this country.\n  We have challenged, again, ObamaCare in court with the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives vs. Burwell lawsuit; and we hope for a positive result \nfrom that.\n  We are also continuing our investigations into other scandals of this \nadministration, including the situation in Benghazi. Last fall, House \ninvestigators learned that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \nused a private email server located in her home, rather than an \nofficial email account, as required by administration policy. She also \nfailed to preserve her official emails for government records as \nrequired by the Federal Records Act.\n  Without the diligent work of the Select Committee on Benghazi, this \nhighly questionable email arrangement would have remained secret. \nBecause of a select committee deposition of Sidney Blumenthal, a former \naide to President Bill Clinton, the committee was able to demonstrate \nthat, despite former Secretary Clinton's assertions to the contrary, \nshe did not produce all of her official emails to the State Department.\n  The select committee is deposing senior State Department officials, \nincluding Clinton's closest aides, and will call former Secretary \nClinton as a witness as soon as the State Department produces all of \nthe records owed to the committee.\n  We are continuing our investigation of the IRS and its unlawful \ntargeting of conservatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the people's House, and we Republicans in the \nmajority will continue to do the work of the American people by passing \nappropriate legislation and by holding this administration accountable \nfor what it should be doing and what it has done that is inappropriate.\n  The Republican-led House, Mr. Speaker, in the past 7 months, has \ndelivered real results that would solve many of the challenges that \nface our Nation, but there is still more to do to make the outdated \nmodels in Washington, D.C., more effective, efficient, and accountable.\n  As we go home to our districts for the August recess, not a vacation, \nbut an opportunity for us to be in our districts, to be with our \nconstituents, to hear from our constituents what their concerns are, we \nwill be gathering more ideas for legislation and come back to Congress \nin September with a renewed commitment to do the people's business in \nthe people's House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/house-section/article/H5761-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SENATE BILL AND CONCURRENT RESOLUTION REFERRED\n\n  A bill and a concurrent resolution of the Senate of the following \ntitles were taken from the Speaker's table and, under the rule, \nreferred as follows:\n\n       S. 764.
