Mr. Speaker, today marks tax day, a day \nwhen Americans must file their taxes.\n  The broken Tax Code is nearly 75,000 pages and has excessive \nregulations, destroys jobs, and lacks certainty. The tax bill is too \nhigh for hardworking American families. This year Americans will \ncollectively spend more on taxes than basic necessities like food, \nclothing, and housing combined.\n  New ObamaCare taxes destroy jobs. We must make the Tax Code fair and \nsimple to allow hardworking American families and small businesses to \nkeep more of their hard-earned tax dollars.\n  That is why I am grateful to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 27, Tax \nCode Termination Act, which would retire the old, burdensome Tax Code \nand replace it with a system that provides tax relief for working \nAmericans, protects the rights of taxpayers, eliminates bias against \nsaving, and creates jobs.\n  I will continue to work in Congress toward a commonsense solution \nthat creates a fair and simple Tax Code for American families.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1769-10", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1769-H1770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PARDON RAIF BADAWI\n\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

Today is Raif's 1,425th day in prison. He has been publicly \nflogged 50 times, and his wife and\n\n[[Page H1770]]\n\nchildren, fearful for their safety, have had to abandon their country \nfor Canada.\n  But Raif is not a criminal. He is a champion of freedom of thought \nand expression in a kingdom whose rulers fear both.\n  This week President Obama will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with \nleaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council. When the President sees King \nSalman, he should urge him to pardon Raif and allow him to join his \nwife and three children in Canada.\n  I seek the full support of Congress and the Obama administration in \nurging the Saudi Arabian Government to free Raif and all other \nprisoners of conscience like him, as befits any government with a seat \non the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1770-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING STATE COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER MELANIE LYNCH\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Lynch is assisted in those efforts by the \ntextbook she co-wrote entitled ``Comprehensive Health.''\n  Physical and health education is key to students across the Nation \nreceiving a well-rounded school experience.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor an extraordinary hero from \nTupper Lake in my district.\n  First Lieutenant Elmer Jebo was drafted into the Army in 1940 where \nhe would participate in military campaigns across Italy.\n  On February 21, 1944, during the Anzio invasion, his position was \nattacked by six enemy tanks. For his bravery under siege and his \ncourageous conduct to repel these attacks, he was awarded the Silver \nStar and the Purple Heart by the U.S. Army.\n  Unfortunately, because of significant wounds sustained in combat, \nLieutenant Jebo spent many months recovering at Walter Reed Medical \nCenter and never received his medal. He has since passed.\n  After his family reached out to our office, I am honored that we were \nable to play a small part in preserving the legacy of this north \ncountry hero.\n  This Thursday my office will host his family at a ceremony in \nWashington to present them with Lieutenant Jebo's much-deserved Silver \nStar.\n  Today I am honored to recognize Lieutenant Jebo's heroic service on \nthe House floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1770-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from South Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1638.\n  Mr. Speaker, since construction began in 2006, the Department of \nHomeland Security's consolidated headquarters on St. Elizabeth's \nhistoric Washington, D.C. campus has been riddled with cost overruns \nand construction delays, at times estimated to be more than $1 billion \nover budget and 12 years behind schedule.\n  As the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and \nManagement Efficiency, I conducted rigorous oversight of the project, \nincluding holding a hearing in September 2014. Having visited the site, \nI saw firsthand the immense challenges that lie ahead. While we are \nencouraged by the recently updated DHS St. Elizabeth's plan, we still \nbelieve that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help \nensure accountability and the efficient use of taxpayer dollars, \nespecially considering this project was fully funded through the fiscal \nyear 2016 appropriations, and DHS alone has requested $225 million for \nfiscal year 2017.\n  This bill that we are talking about today, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act, a companion to \nH.R. 1640, which was passed by the House unanimously in June of last \nyear and of which I was a cosponsor, will require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, in coordination with the administrator of General \nServices, to submit a report on the implementation of the updated plan \nfor the headquarters consolidation, including estimated costs and \noccupancy plans of the project. With a project of this magnitude, \nimproved oversight and increased transparency is paramount.\n  Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once said that an educated citizenry is \n``the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.'' Our \nconstituents expect their representatives to hold government \naccountable. S. 1638 does just that.\n  I wish to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their hard work \npassing this bill through the Senate. I urge all Members to join me in \nsupporting this important bipartisan legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of S. 1638, the Department of Homeland Security \nHeadquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, since the 2006 decision to establish the Department of \nHomeland Security's headquarters at the former site of St. Elizabeth's \nHospital in Washington, the project has experienced significant \nshortfalls in cost and schedule performance.\n  The Government Accountability Office reported that between the start \nof construction at St. Elizabeth's in fiscal year 2009 through the \nfiscal year 2014 appropriation, the project received $1.6 billion less \nthan the funding amendments requested over this period. The impact of \nthis funding gap is far-reaching. In fact, GAO has found this gap \nresulted in cost escalations exceeding $1 billion and schedule delays \nexceeding 10 years for the project.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Senate bill we consider today is the companion to \nH.R. 1640, a bill that the House approved by voice vote last June.\n  S. 1638 directs DHS and GSA to provide information to Congress within \n120 days of enactment of this bill to establish that the data has been \ncollected and analyzed to support the current direction for this high-\nprofile investment.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, S. 1638 specifies that the information \nprovided to Congress by DHS and GSA include updated cost and schedule \nestimates for the project.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, S. 1638 directs GAO to report to Congress on \nthe quality and reliability of these estimates, not later than 90 days \nafter they have been submitted to Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, DHS headquarters operations currently are dispersed \naround the national capital region, in facilities that, in many cases, \nare inadequate--as is the case with the Nebraska Avenue Complex.\n  To support the government's effective stewardship of public resources \nand to deliver a headquarters that DHS desperately needs, I would urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  S. 1638 is virtually identical to the House-passed legislation that \nmy subcommittee advanced last year.\n  The bill's provisions acknowledge the need for GSA to be engaged at a \nhigh level, as the construction manager for the Department's \nheadquarters consolidation project, and to help DHS develop realistic \nand achievable outcomes.\n  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that up to 69 percent of \nthe Department's commercial leases in the national capital region are \nslated to expire between fiscal years 2016 and 2020. As such, the \nDepartment will be forced to engage in the expensive process of \nrecompeting and possibly relocating its operation and personnel.\n  It would behoove the Department and the GSA to move more of DHS' \nheadquarters activities to St. Elizabeth's as soon as possible and, \nthus, avoid the costs associated with executing additional leasing in \nthe expensive D.C. market.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do again urge the adoption of S. 1638.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  I, once again, urge my colleagues to support S. 1638.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for her words of support. \nThis is the right thing to do--being good stewards of taxpayer dollars \nand fulfilling our oversight role.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in strong support of S. 1638, the \n``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation \nAccountability Act.''\n  I support this bipartisan legislation because it would move DHS \nforward in accomplishing the important objective of establishing a home \nfor the Department's many components and agencies.\n  Eleven days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, \nPennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge was appointed as the first Director of \nthe Office of Homeland Security in the White House.\n\n[[Page H1772]]\n\n  In November 2002, I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to \ncreate a Department of Homeland Security.\n  On March 1, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security official became \na Cabinet-level department charged with the responsibility of unifying \nnational homeland security efforts.\n  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created through the \nintegration of all or part of 22 different Federal departments and \nagencies into a unified, integrated Department.\n  S. 1638, directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in \ncoordination with the General Services Administration (GSA), to submit \ninformation on the implementation of the enhanced plan for the DHS \nheadquarters consolidation project within the National Capital Region, \napproved by the Office of Management and Budget and included in the \nbudget of the President for FY2016, that includes:\n  a proposed occupancy plan with specific information about which DHS-\nwide operations, component operations, and support offices will be \nlocated at the site, the aggregate number of full time equivalent \nemployees projected to occupy the site, the seat-to-staff ratio at the \nsite, and schedule estimates for migrating operations to the site;\n  a comprehensive assessment of the difference between the current real \nproperty and facilities needed by DHS in the Region to carry out its \nmission and its future needs;\n  an analysis of the difference between the current and needed capital \nassets and facilities of DHS;\n  a current plan for construction of the headquarters consolidation at \nthe St. Elizabeths campus that includes the estimated costs and \nschedule for the current plan and any estimated cost savings associated \nwith reducing the scope of the project and increasing the use of \nexisting capacity developed under the project;\n  An important goal of S. 1638, is an evaluation of the current plan to \ndetermine the leased portfolio of DHS throughout the Region that \nincludes an end-state vision that identifies which DHS-wide operations, \ncomponent operations, and support offices do not migrate to the St. \nElizabeths campus and continue to operate at a property in the leased \nportfolio.\n  The bill will result in real numbers regarding the total compliment \nof full-time equivalent employees who are expected to operate at each \nproperty, component, or office for each year until the consolidation \nproject is completed.\n  S. 1638, identifies the costs and benefits of leasing and \nconstruction alternatives for the remainder of the consolidation \nproject, including a comparison of the long-term cost that would result \nfrom leasing to the cost of consolidating functions on government-owned \nspace and the identification of any cost impacts in terms of premiums \nfor short-term lease extensions or holdovers due to the uncertainty of \nfunding for, or delays in, completing construction required for the \nconsolidation.\n  Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in \n2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning \nfunding support from Congress.\n  As a result, in April 2015, DHS and GSA announced that the \nconstruction sequence and timetable for the headquarters consolidation \nwould be adjusted to reflect reduced funding by Congress.\n  DHS must now re-compete up to 69 percent of its commercial leases in \nthe National Capital Region as they are scheduled to expire between \n2016 and 2020.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the \nsuspension bill, S. 1638, the ``Department of Homeland Security \nHeadquarters Consolidation Accountability Act.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 1638.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1772-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1772-H1773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SIDNEY OSLIN SMITH, JR.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4618.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4618 would designate the Federal building and \nUnited States Courthouse located at 121 Spring Street SE in \nGainesville, Georgia, as the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building \nand United States Courthouse.\n  Following his service in the United States Army during World War II, \nJudge Smith received his law degree and went into the private practice \nof law. In 1965, he was appointed to the Federal bench as a judge for \nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by \nPresident Johnson, and he served until his retirement in 1974.\n  Given his commitment and dedication to our Nation and the law, I \nthink it is fitting to recognize his service by naming this courthouse \nafter him.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for his \nleadership on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I also support H.R. 4618, which designates the United States \nCourthouse in Gainesville, Georgia, as the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. \nFederal Building and United States Courthouse.\n  Judge Smith served as a Federal district court judge in the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia and was a World War II veteran. Judge Smith \ngraduated from Harvard University and the University of Georgia Law \nSchool. After graduating from law school, Judge Smith went into private \npractice, as was noted, and he practiced until 1962, and was later \nelected as a superior court judge in Georgia.\n  In 1965, Mr. Speaker, Judge Smith was appointed as a district court \njudge and was later elevated to chief judge. Judge Smith stepped down \nfrom the Federal bench in 1974, as was noted, and returned to private \npractice as a partner at an Atlanta law firm.\n  In addition to his very long and distinguished career, Judge Smith \nwas an active member of the educational community in Georgia, serving \nas chairman of the Gainesville Board of Education, the chairman of the \nState Board of Regents, and as a trustee of Brenau University for 35 \nyears.\n  Judge Smith was well respected in his community. It is very \nappropriate to name the building in Gainesville, Georgia, the Sidney \nOslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse.\n  I also support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in voting for this important piece of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from \nFlorida for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4618, legislation that I \nintroduced to name the Federal building and\n\n[[Page H1773]]\n\nUnited States Courthouse in Gainesville, Georgia, after Judge Sidney \nOslin Smith, or Sidney Smith as we knew him.\n  Judge Smith passed away, but his influence in my hometown of \nGainesville is still felt. He was born and raised in Gainesville, and \ncommitted to the law and furthering education.\n  Judge Smith dedicated his life to serving the public. He joined the \nArmy during World War II to serve his country. He later went on to have \na distinguished legal career after receiving his law degree from the \nUniversity of Florida. He was in private practice in Gainesville for \nmany years, and served as a superior court judge prior to being \nappointed to the Federal bench by President Lyndon Johnson.\n  Judge Smith's appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia included time as chief judge from 1968 to 1974.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  After leaving the bench, Judge Smith served the community in many \nother ways. He served on the board of Brenau College--now Brenau \nUniversity--and played a pivotal role in helping the school to obtain \nuniversity status and become a doctoral granting institution.\n  Judge Smith's legacy is one that deserves to be honored. As the \njudge's son said, ``serving others was his vocational calling.''\n  The Federal building and courthouse in Gainesville is a symbol of \npublic service and civic duty. Judge Smith dedicated his life to the \nhigh ideals of justice, honor, and family, and naming the courthouse \nafter him will keep his legacy alive for years to come. It will serve \nas a reminder of the judge's commitment to his community, and I believe \nit will help inspire others to public service.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we have just heard from my two friends and colleagues \nhere about this man, Judge Smith, it goes beyond the resume, and it \nstarts to talk, really, about the law degree and the private practice \nand the superior court judge. In fact, my father, who was a Georgia \nState trooper, remembers Judge Smith before he was on the Federal \nbench.\n  I think what is most special for me in doing this and in working with \nmy friends and fellow Senators from Georgia to name this building is \nnot only did he do his service, but then he came back to the community. \nIt was out of a duty that he served on the Federal bench. He then came \nback, once out of Federal practice, and he served in a law firm and \nhelped in our educational community. Brenau University is known \nworldwide as a former women's college, but it has now expanded its \nprogram and reach to, literally, all across the world. It has recently \nexpanded into China and has had an influence there and all over \nGeorgia.\n  It is also that commitment to business and that commitment to his \nhometown. You see, when we name buildings--and I don't take that \nlightly--it should be in honor of someone who touches all aspects, not \njust one's Federal service, not just, maybe, one's private service, but \na combination of the two.\n  When we go into high schools--and, Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues \ndo as well. We speak in high schools and elementary schools all the \ntime--we talk about pride; we talk about public service. Judge Smith is \none of those in my community to whom we can point and say: Here is \nsomeone who served his country, who served his fellow members of \nGeorgia as a member of the bar, but who was also known at home. They \nknew him in the restaurants; they knew him in the town square. He is \nsomeone we can look to and take pride in saying: There is someone who \nidentifies with the very ideals of American life.\n  For that reason, it is really easy for me to say this is something \nthat we do in honor of someone who earned his honor while he was \nliving. He earned it through his hard work, his dedication, and his \ncommitment to his fellow man and to our beloved community in \nGainesville.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to \nrecognize Judge Smith by naming this building in Gainesville the Sidney \nOslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I thank my colleagues for coming to the floor today in support of \nthis legislation. Clearly, we are taking the opportunity--and the House \nhas the opportunity before it--to honor a man who inspired his \ncommunity, who served with honor, and who, quite frankly, was a role \nmodel to so many in the State of Georgia. I would respectfully ask all \nof my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

These \nraces have been run nationally since 1934. Today, they are held \nthroughout the country, and a few are held throughout the world.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank my good friend from Maryland, Representative Hoyer, for \nintroducing this resolution on behalf of the Washington regional \ndelegation.\n  This annual competitive event, Mr. Speaker, encourages boys and \ngirls, ages 9 through 16, to construct and operate their own soap box \nvehicles. The event has become a great tradition in the Washington, \nD.C., metropolitan area over the last 20 years. It provides a terrific \nopportunity for children to appreciate the workmanship that is \nnecessary to build vehicles and to enjoy the thrill of competition.\n  The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the \nArchitect of the Capitol and with the Capitol Police to ensure that the \nappropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event \nremains free to the public.\n  I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nlegislation, because it is critically important for the future of our \nchildren.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank both Mr. Curbelo, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and the ranking member for moving this resolution \nforward. I think this is the 25th year that I have sponsored this \nresolution, and I have had great support throughout. I thank them both.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of this resolution, which \nI sponsor each year on behalf of the Washington metropolitan \ndelegation, to permit the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association \nto hold its annual race on the grounds of the Capitol Building.\n  This is a very special year for the soap box derby as it celebrates \nits 75th anniversary. For three-quarters of a century now, young people \nfrom across the Greater Washington, D.C., area have assembled at the \nCapitol for a fun, educational, and exciting event.\n  First run in 1938, when Norman Rocca sped past 223 of his fellow \nyoung racers on New Hampshire Avenue to capture the first soap box \nderby victory, the race brings together those between ages 8 and 17 to \ncompete in three divisions. Those divisions are Stock, Super Stock, and \nMasters. The winner of each division will qualify to race against the \nregional champions from across the country later this year at the All-\nAmerican Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio. This year's race here in \nWashington will take place on June 18.\n  There is a reason, of course, the soap box derby has been called the \n``greatest amateur racing event in the world.'' It is not only because \nit is a thrill to watch on race day, but because of everything that \nhappens before race day as well. For weeks in advance, the young \ndrivers and their parents--and, yes, sometimes grandparents--gather in \ngarages and basements to build, test, and improve their soap box racers \ntogether. It is a process that brings the generations together and \nteaches valuable lessons about hard work, science and engineering, \nsportsmanship, leadership, and pride of achievement. Many of the skills \nlearned in building these soap box racers are the same ones that help \nstudents succeed in science, technology, engineering, and math--or the \nSTEM subjects as we refer to them--which will prepare them for success \nin college and careers.\n  In addition to bringing families together, the soap box derby brings \nentire communities together with civic groups, police and fire \ndepartments, and service organizations that sponsor participants in \nwhom they see the future leaders of their communities and of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I said before that this is the 75th anniversary of the \nGreater Washington Soap Box Derby. It also marks, as I said, the 25th \nyear that I have had the honor of sponsoring this resolution. I have \ndone so because I am incredibly proud of this tradition and of all of \nthe young people from Maryland's Fifth District who have participated \nyear after year. In fact, I say with some degree of pride that the \nFifth District has been home to many soap box derby champions, \nincluding the winners of 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014, which \nis to say, recently, we have done pretty well, Mr. Speaker. Our racers \neven brought home national championship victories in 2007 and in 2008.\n  I thank all of those who worked to make the Greater Washington Soap \nBox Derby possible. I also thank the cosponsors of this resolution: \nRepresentatives Chris Van Hollen, Gerry Connolly, Don Beyer, John \nDelaney, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Donna Edwards, and Barbara Comstock.\n\n  I hope the House will offer its strong support once again for this \ngreat American pastime and for all of those young people and their \nfamilies who participate.\n  I thank the two gentlemen for their leadership.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I congratulate the gentleman from Maryland on the 25th anniversary of \nhis bringing forward this resolution. The gentleman from Maryland is \nsomeone who respects the traditions of this House and who, through his \nexample, teaches younger and newer Members to also respect the \ntraditions of this House. I am proud to support this resolution today, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The first woman elected to Congress, Representative \n     Jeannette Rankin from Montana, was elected on November 7, \n     1916, almost four years prior to ratification of the 19th \n     Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to \n     vote.\n       (2) Jeannette Rankin was not only a pioneer in national \n     electoral politics, she was also a pioneer as a woman in \n     science, graduating from the University of Montana in 1902 \n     with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology.\n       (3) 100 years after the election of Jeannette Rankin, 108 \n     women serve in the 114th Congress, more than at any other \n     time in our Nation's history. While this improvement is \n     commendable, women hold only 20 percent of the seats in \n     Congress, far below their relative share of the American \n     electorate.\n       (4) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, women \n     make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce. Gains have \n     been made in the science, technology, engineering, and \n     mathematics (STEM) fields over time, but women still comprise \n     only 39 percent of chemists and material scientists, 28 \n     percent of environmental scientists and\n\n[[Page H1775]]\n\n     geoscientists, 16 percent of chemical engineers, and 12 \n     percent of civil engineers.\n       (5) More must be done to encourage women to run for elected \n     office and to enter STEM fields.\n\n     SEC. 3. JEANNETTE RANKIN WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN STEM FIELDS \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       Paragraph (7) of section 1672(d) of the Food, Agriculture, \n     Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5925(d)(7)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(7) Jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields \n     program.--Research and extension grants may be made under \n     this section to increase participation by women and \n     underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of \n     science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, with \n     priority given to eligible institutions that carry out \n     continuing programs funded by the Secretary. Any grant made \n     under this paragraph shall be known and designated as a \n     `Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program \n     Grant'.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. \nDelBene) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4570, the 100 Years of Women \nin Congress Act. This legislation would honor a true pioneer of \nAmerican politics by naming an important agricultural research program \nas the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program.\n  This competitive research grants program is designed to increase \nparticipation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas \nin the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n  I can think of no better person to identify with this important \nprogram than former Representative Rankin, who was the first woman to \nserve in the United States House of Representatives, an achievement \nmade even more significant by the fact that Ms. Rankin was elected to \nCongress several years prior to the ratification of the 19th Amendment \ngranting women the right to vote.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DelBENE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 4570, the 100 Years of \nWomen in Congress Act. This is bipartisan legislation on a topic that \nis critical for our country and personally important to me.\n  This legislation would honor the first woman elected to Congress in \n1916, Jeannette Rankin, by renaming USDA's Women and Minorities in STEM \nFields Program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM \nFields Grant Program.\n  Jeannette Rankin graduated with a degree in biology long before it \nwas common for women to be scientists, and she was elected to Congress \nbefore women had the right to vote. As a fellow Pacific northwesterner, \nshe continues to be an inspiration today.\n  There is no doubt that we need more women, especially more women \nleaders, in STEM fields. The year I graduated from college, women \nreceived 37 percent of the computer sciences degrees. Today it is below \n20 percent.\n  One explanation for this is that, in the early days of PCs, computers \nwere seen as toys and were marketed heavily to boys, not girls. \nEventually, young women considered computer science and showed up on \ncollege campuses and found themselves alone in computer science \nclassrooms dominated by men.\n  Before Congress, I had a long career in the technology sector and \nworked with a lot of developers in the early days of email, so I know \nwhat it is like to be the only woman in the room.\n  Thankfully, I had a strong female role model, my mother, who showed \nmy sisters and me that we could do anything we wanted in our careers.\n  So I know firsthand how important it is that our kids develop the \nskills they need to have bright futures and help make sure the United \nStates remains a leader in technology and innovation. Children, \nespecially young women, need more role models like Jeannette Rankin so \nthey can see themselves in STEM fields.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a \nbrief moment to thank my colleague, Ms. DelBene, for her kind comments \nand for helping to ensure that this great bill is going to make it \nthrough with a very bipartisan majority.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from the great \nState of Montana (Mr. Zinke), my colleague who is one of the most \ncourageous Members of Congress, somebody who served our Nation in our \nU.S. military for many years and deserves our thanks.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the women of Montana to \nadvocate for renaming the Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Grant \nProgram to honor former Montana Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin. Yes, I \ndo hold her seat and, yes, she held the first seat in Montana before \nwomen could vote.\n  I would like to also say that she was a true Montanan. She embodied \nthe pioneer spirit that we know and love. She led the way in so many \ndifferent areas to include:\n  She was one of the first to graduate from the University of Montana \nwith a degree in biology. She voted against both wars because she could \nnot fight. Her spirit blazoned the trails and gave us leadership. She \nwas also a gifted scientific mind and an early pioneer.\n  The grant program is an important tool for young women today to \ncontinue their education in STEM and possibly break new ground, like \nJeannette Rankin, and blaze new trails for young women of tomorrow, \ntoday, and our future.\n  I would like to add that my own staffer, Ms. Jocelyn Galt, is a \nrelative of Jeannette Rankin. She, too, demonstrates the tenacity and \ndetermination that made Jeannette Rankin successful and feared among \nher peers.\n  Renaming this program in Representative Rankin's honor is the right \nthing to do because it a reminder of those who had courage to break \ndown the barriers, had the tenacity to not let go of their dreams, and \nthe courage to be a mentor and an inspiration to us all.\n\n  I am happy to partner with Representative Grace Meng on this \nimportant endeavor. I thank her for her leadership.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng), the sponsor of this legislation.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to be here today to celebrate \nthe 100th anniversary of women serving in Congress. Thank you for \nallowing this legislation to come to the floor.\n  I also thank my friend and colleague, Representative Zinke, for \noffering this legislation with me. His support has been instrumental in \nensuring the consideration of this bill, and I am deeply grateful to \nhim.\n  A hundred years ago this November, the people of Montana elected \nJeannette Rankin to the United States House of Representatives. She was \nthe first woman elected to Congress and was elected before passage of \nthe 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.\n  Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer her entire life. In 1902, she \ngraduated from the University of Montana with a degree in biology.\n  Afterward, she would become active in the women's suffrage movement, \nmoving to New York City and assisting in the founding of the New York \nWoman Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman \nSuffrage Party.\n  She would return to Montana and was elected to office in the \ncongressional election of 1916. Upon winning, she declared: ``I may be \nthe first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the last.''\n  I am happy to say she was right.\n\n[[Page H1776]]\n\n  In recognition of Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin's many \naccomplishments and in celebration of the centennial anniversary of her \nelection to Congress, Representative Zinke and I introduced the 100 \nYears of Women in Congress Act.\n  Because Jeannette Rankin was a woman of science more than 100 years \nbefore our current push to have more women enter STEM fields, we felt \nit appropriate to rename the Department of Agriculture's Women and \nMinorities in STEM Fields Grant Program after her.\n  This program currently supports collaborative research projects at \ninstitutions of higher education, which seek to increase the \nparticipation of women and minorities from rural areas in STEM fields. \nIt will continue to do so into the future, but now it will also \nrecognize the many contributions Jeannette Rankin made to American \nlife.\n  Mr. Speaker, thank you again for allowing this legislation to come to \nthe floor today, and I thank Congressman Zinke for partnering with me \non it.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me and all of us \nhere in support of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it has been 100 years \nsince the first woman was elected to serve in this great institution, \nand now I am blessed to serve with so many great women on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  This is a recognition that is long overdue.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, along with those you have already heard \ntoday, to support this important piece of legislation to give Ms. \nRankin the respect and the honor that she deserves when she walked here \n100 years ago.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4570, \nthe ``100 Years of Women in Congress Act,'' which renames the existing \nWomen and Minorities in STEM Fields Program, or WAMS program, through \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, as the ``Jeannette Rankin Women and \nMinorities in STEM Fields Program.''\n  I commend Congresswoman Meng and Congressman Zinke for introducing \nthis bipartisan legislation which:\n  Highlights the importance and contributions of women Members in \nCongress;\n  Recognizes the importance of the Suffragette Movement in achieving \nopportunities for women;\n  Emphasizes the imperative of promoting education for women in STEM; \nand\n  Affirms our nation's commitment to expanding opportunities for rural \nwomen in my home state of Texas and across the country.\n  This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first woman being \nelected to Congress, Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana.\n  This bill is a fitting way to honor Representative Rankin's legacy, \nand to celebrate the many contributions of the female lawmakers who \nhave succeeded her in this institution.\n  Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer who broke barriers throughout her \nlifetime and whose example continues to inspire women the world over.\n  She graduated from the University of Montana with a biology degree in \n1902.\n  She later became active in the women's suffrage movement, organizing \nthe New York Women's Suffrage Party and working for the National \nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association.\n  In 1916, Representative Rankin became the first woman elected to \nCongress, even before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which \nguaranteed the right to vote to women.\n  For all of her contributions to women's rights, to political \nactivism, and to this institution, it is only fitting to pay tribute to \nher achievements.\n  The USDA WAMS program was created specifically to encourage women and \nminorities from rural areas to participate in research and projects in \nthe sciences.\n  Women and minorities have been and continue to be underrepresented in \nSTEM fields.\n  Although women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. labor force, they \ncomprise only 36 percent of the computing workforce, 24 percent of the \nengineering workforce, and 18 percent of the advanced manufacturing \nworkforce.\n  Indeed, minority representation in STEM fields is even lower, with \nAfrican-American and Latino workers comprising 29 percent of the \ngeneral workforce, but only 15 percent of the computing workforce, 12 \npercent of the engineering workforce, and 6 percent of the advanced \nmanufacturing workforce.\n  The WAMS program is one way that we can address these glaring \ndisparities.\n  WAMS grants are awarded to universities and institutions of higher \nlearning to distribute to eligible applicants, and they prioritize \nprojects and programs of particular relevance to USDA.\n  Recipient institutions have used WAMS grants for worthy endeavors, \nsuch as: establishing a WAMS fellowship program for women and minority \nhigh school students in rural areas; providing mentorship and hands-on, \nservice-based learning to high school students and undergraduates in \nparticular STEM fields; and offering mentoring services to current \nundergraduates to help them successfully complete STEM-based degrees.\n  Because Representative Rankin is a graduate of the sciences from a \nrural area, renaming the WAMS program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and \nMinorities in STEM Fields Program is the perfect way to honor her \nlegacy as a woman of the sciences and the first woman elected to \nCongress, and to encourage the next generation of women and minorities \nfrom rural areas to take up STEM fields.\n  I join my colleagues in support of this important measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4570.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Moran served in the Philippine-American war and was \nawarded the Medal of Honor in 1910 for fearlessly leading a small body \nof troops under severe fire and through waist-deep water in the attack \nagainst the enemy.\n  Captain William Wylie Galt served in World War II and was awarded the \nMedal of Honor in 1945 for gallantry above and beyond the call of duty.\n\n[[Page H1777]]\n\n  Galt manned a machinegun on a tank destroyer at the front of the \nassault force, staying at his post in the vehicle's turret and \ncontinuing to lead his men despite intense hostile fire.\n  He was killed while manning his machinegun and, on February 1, 1945, \nwas posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He was just 24 years old. \nI am proud to have a member of the Galt family on my staff.\n  Captain Galt and Captain Moran are an inspiration to every Montanan \nwho was ever and will ever put on the uniform, myself included.\n  Montana has a strong heritage of military service, with more veterans \nper capita than almost any other state in the Nation, to include our \nIndian nations.\n  Both Captain Moran and Captain Galt received the Medal of Honor, this \nNation's most distinguished honor, for displaying such personal bravery \nthat went well beyond the call of duty.\n  As leaders, they deserve our respect and honor. Memorializing these \ntwo heroes by renaming the Armed Forces Reserve Center will provide a \ndaily reminder to us all of the service and sacrifice these Montanans \nmade to our country.\n  I thank my friends, Senator Steve Daines and Senator Jon Tester, for \nseeing this important bill through the Senate.

Corma II \nPost Office Building.\n  Following his graduation from West Point in 2008, Salvatore Corma \nattained his Ranger badge, serving as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. \nArmy's 82nd Airborne Division stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n  First Lieutenant Corma was deployed to Afghanistan, where he served \nas a platoon leader. On April 29, 2010, First Lieutenant Corma \ntragically lost his life while marking an IED in Zabul, Afghanistan.\n  As his company commander noted when recommending First Lieutenant \nCorma for a valor award, marking IEDs is usually a soldier task, yet \nSalvatore Corma displayed not only his bravery, but also his leadership \nin knowingly putting himself in danger rather than his men. As he once \ntold his mother: ``You have to lead from the front. You can never lead \nfrom the back.''\n  First Lieutenant Corma's selfless leadership should be commended. His \nmilitary awards include the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all should be pleased to pass this bill to honor the \nvaliant actions and steadfast leadership of First Lieutenant Salvatore \nCorma, who put the lives of others before his own.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 3866.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross). This is his \nbill.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Norton for \nyielding. I also thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings \nfor leadership and support for bringing this bill to the floor.\n  I take this opportunity to introduce you to a name that no one in \nthis Chamber had likely ever known, but it is a name and a legacy you \nshould know and you need to know. It is my honor to be the one to share \nit with you. It is one of the reasons why we stand here today enjoying \nthe many freedoms that we sometimes take for granted.\n  The name is Army First Lieutenant Salvatore Corma II of Deptford \nTownship, New Jersey. Sal grew up in south Jersey and even attended \nkarate class with my own children before receiving a nomination to \nattend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n  He graduated from West Point in 2008, and then it was on to Active \nDuty in the United States Army as a First Lieutenant in the Alpha \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade \nCombat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n  Sal only stood 5 foot 6, but his leadership made him a towering \nfigure among his fellow soldiers. It was that very leadership on that \nvery dark day that stands out--far from the safety and security of his \nhome in the south Jersey suburbs--in one of those most volatile places \non the planet, Afghanistan. That day was April 29, 2010.\n  Sal was leading his company when they spotted an IED, an improvised \nexplosive device. Sal ordered his soldiers to back off. As they \nretreated, the IED detonated. It would take the life of Salvatore \nCorma. He was just 24 years old.\n  Sal Corma is credited with saving as many as 17 of his fellow \nsoldiers in that one heroic, selfless act. Many will tell you that Sal \nmade history that day. We know he did, but it happens in ways that you \nwill never know. Because of his heroism, those who survived that day \nwill go on to protect the United States from threats and eliminate \ndangers around the world. Those soldiers will live on and continue to \nprotect us. They continued the fight, carrying in their hearts the \nspirit of Sal Corma. They are all living tributes and a living history \nto his actions.\n\n  Many of those soldiers will come home after service and start the \nAmerican Dream of a family. That is something that was denied Sal. He \nwill never get to marry or have kids, but his actions ensured that \nothers will get that opportunity, all because of his valor. Sal Corma \nII is undeniably an American hero.\n  What better way to pay tribute to his valor than with this \nlegislation I present today, to rename the Deptford, New Jersey, post \noffice as the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma II Post Office \nBuilding.\n  Like all of our Active Duty servicemembers and veterans, Sal deserved \nthis honor in life, not just in death. It is our duty to preserve his \nlegacy to remind our fellow citizens and the world of his bravery. So \nevery person that crosses that threshold in Deptford will see the name. \nIf they don't know it, I hope they will take a moment to read about his \nlife and his legacy and what he did for us as a country.\n  I respectfully ask for your unanimous support in my legislation to \nrename the Deptford post office the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma \nII Post Office Building.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUM.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2928, introduced by \nCongressman French Hill of Arkansas. H.R. 2928 designates the post \noffice located at 201 B Street in Perryville, Arkansas, as the Harold \nGeorge Bennett Post Office.\n  Sergeant Harold George Bennett enlisted in the United States Army in \n1957, and he served heroically in Vietnam. He was taken prisoner in \nthat country, and on June 25, 1965, he became one of the first \nprisoners of war killed in Vietnam. Sergeant Bennett fought \ncourageously, thinking not of himself, but thinking first and foremost \nof his colleagues.\n  I will ask my colleague and the sponsor of this bill, Representative \nFrench Hill, to share the incredible story of Sergeant Bennett; but for \nnow, I urge Members to support this bill to name a post office after \nSergeant Harold George Bennett.\n  Mr. Speaker, hearing his story inspires bravery in all of us, and I \nam hopeful that permanently naming a post office in remembrance of his \nsacrifice will serve to inspire generations to come.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H1779]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration \nof H.R. 2928, a bill to designate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 201 B Street in Perryville, Arkansas, as the \nHarold George Bennett Post Office.\n  Born in Perryville, Arkansas, in 1940, Harold George Bennett followed \nin his father's footsteps by joining the Army. Sergeant Bennett served \nwith the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions and volunteered to serve \nin Vietnam in 1964. During his deployment, Sergeant Bennett acted as \ninfantry adviser to South Vietnam's 33rd Ranger Battalion.\n  On December 29, 1964, Sergeant Bennet's unit was airlifted to Binh \nGia, a village overrun by the Viet Cong. Upon landing, they were met by \nenemy forces and a firefight ensued. A selfless man, Sergeant Bennett \ncalled off two separate helicopter pilots who attempted to rescue him, \nrefusing to put their lives in danger to save his.\n  With his unit overrun by Viet Cong, Sergeant Bennett was captured. He \ndemonstrated courage and tenacity by participating in hunger strikes \nand attempting three times to escape captivity. Tragically, following \nhis third attempt, Sergeant Bennett was executed, becoming the first \nAmerican POW to be put to death during the Vietnam war.\n  Sergeant Bennett was posthumously awarded a Silver Star for his \nheroic actions, in addition to receiving a Prisoner of War Medal, Army \nGood Conduct Medal, and a Purple Heart.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the great \nsacrifices Sergeant Harold George Bennett made for his country, as he \nselflessly and repeatedly put the lives of others before his own. I \nurge the passage of H.R. 2928.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of going \nto the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Vietnam war in Little Rock \nand to see all the hugs and emotion at that event. Truly, it was a \ntumultuous time in our world. It was so good to see the healing that \nthose men and women experienced at that 50th anniversary. I looked at \nthat table set for the POW/MIA ceremony, and, of course, I was thinking \nabout Sergeant Harold George Bennett from Perryville, Arkansas.\n  Sergeant Bennett was born on October 16, 1940, in Thornburg, \nArkansas, a very small town outside the beautiful Ouachita National \nForest. A graduate of Perryville High School, he enlisted in the U.S. \nArmy in 1957. He served as an airborne infantryman with the 82nd and \n101st Airborne Divisions--no finer units. He completed Special Forces \ntraining in 1963. From there, Sergeant Bennett volunteered to go to \nSouth Vietnam as a Special Forces adviser with the Military Assistance \nCommand.\n  On December 29, 1964, his unit was airlifted to a small village after \nit had been overrun by the Viet Cong. Upon landing, Sergeant Bennett's \nunit was confronted by enemy forces. Twice, he refused extraction by \nmilitary helicopters, as he was concerned for the pilots' safety and \nwanted to continue the fight against the enemy. After a furious and \ncourageous battle, Sergeant Bennett was taken prisoner by the Viet \nCong. Like so many of his colleagues, he spent 179 days as a POW and \nattempted to escape three times at great risk. His captors executed him \non June 25, 1965.\n  Only 24 years old, Sergeant Bennett was the first American POW killed \nin Vietnam. And like so many other servicemen who lost their lives \nthere, his remains have never returned home.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The time of the \ngentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman such time as he may \nconsume.\n  Mr. HILL. After four decades, in 2004, Sergeant Bennett was inducted \ninto the Ranger Hall of Fame at Fort Benning. In 2006, his family was \npresented with his Combat Infantryman's Badge, National Defense Service \nMedal, Vietnam Service Medal, Prisoner of War Medal, Army Good Conduct \nMedal, and the Purple Heart. In 2010, Sergeant Bennett's family was \npresented with his Silver Star.\n  Today, we honor Sergeant Bennett's heroism, bravery, and service by \ninstalling a permanent marker of his lasting contribution to his native \nState and to our Nation, both that he loved and served so ably.\n  Duty, honor, and country--his example is one all Americans and \nArkansans can admire, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent of mine who paid the \nultimate sacrifice for our freedom.\n  The bill before us would designate the post office located at 615 6th \nAvenue SE in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the Sgt. 1st Class Terryl L. Pasker \nPost Office Building. This bill pays tribute to the life of Sergeant \nFirst Class Pasker, who was, unfortunately, killed in Afghanistan in \n2011.\n  Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Pasker was born February 26, 1972, in Anamosa, \nIowa, the son of David and Mary Pasker. He joined the Army in 1990, \nafter graduating from Lisbon High School, transitioning to the National \nGuard in 1995.\n  Sergeant Pasker served in Afghanistan in 2004 and 2005, deploying \nagain in 2011 with the 334th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade \nCombat Team, 34th Infantry Division. He served in Panjshir province, \nwhere he was responsible for maintaining electronic equipment and \nmentoring Afghan police and military leaders.\n  Mr. Speaker, on July 9, 2011, Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker \ngave his last full measure of devotion to his country when he was \nkilled at the age of 39 at a checkpoint, only days before the end of \nhis combat tour.\n  He is survived by his wife, Erica; his parents, Mary and David; his \nbrother, Andrew; and his two sisters, Christine and Rebecca. His family \ntold me that he always said he would rather be a sermon than preach \none, a belief that I believe he exemplified throughout his life.\n  Admired by his fellow soldiers, Pasker was known for his humility, \nhis\n\n[[Page H1780]]\n\nsense of humor, and his willingness to selflessly serve others. Away \nfrom service, Terryl was a homebuilder, taught karate, and was active \nin his local church. During his life, he would remind others that \nfreedom is not free.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, as we honor the sacrifice of Sergeant First Class \nPasker, I ask us to also remember the thousands of servicemembers who \nsacrifice their time, their relationships, and even their lives to \nprotect the freedom of this great Nation. I urge Members to support \nthis bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON.

In 1995, he joined the Iowa \nNational Guard, deploying to Afghanistan from 2004 to 2005. Six years \nlater, Sergeant First Class Pasker decided to return for a second \ndeployment with the 34th Infantry Division. During this tour, he \nmentored Afghan police forces and military leadership.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Tragically, Sergeant First Class Pasker was killed at a checkpoint in \nPanjshir province on July 9, 2011, just days before he was to return \nhome from his combat duty. He was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple \nHeart for his sacrifice.\n  Sergeant First Class Pasker is remembered as an active member of his \nchurch, who taught karate and served as a mentor to many in his \ncommunity. A diligent, hardworking carpenter and owner of a contracting \nbusiness, Terryl Pasker had intended to return to his trade and start a \nfamily with his wife, Erica, whom he married in 2006.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize Sergeant First \nClass Terryl Pasker for the bravery, courage, and selflessness that he \nexhibited in his 20 years of honorable military service.

Madam Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to honor the \nlife of Congressman Ray Thornton, who was a pillar in Arkansas politics \nand a stalwart advocate and voice for the improvement of education in \nour great State of Arkansas.\n  Serving six terms in Congress, for over 23 years, Congressman \nThornton served in two different congressional districts, the fourth \nand the second. Ray was committed to the people of Arkansas and \nsupporting Arkansas ideals on the political stage.\n  His distinguished career included service in the United States Navy \nduring the Korean war, leadership as president of both Arkansas State \nUniversity and the University of Arkansas, an 8-year term on the \nArkansas Supreme Court, and appointment as the first chairman of the \nArkansas Lottery.\n  In 2013, Congressman Thornton donated his personal and professional \npapers to the University of Arkansas.\n  Though he will be greatly missed by many throughout our State, his \ncountless contributions and legacy will live on and serve as an example \nof statesmanship and public service for all Arkansans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1782-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE LIFE OF RABBI HERBERT BAUMGUARD\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in remembrance of Rabbi \nHerbert Baumguard, who passed away this past Friday, at the age of 95.\n  Rabbi Baumguard founded Temple Beth Am, which is an important \ninstitution in my congressional district that has brought the south \nFlorida Jewish community together for over 60 years.\n  A native of Norfolk, Virginia, Rabbi Baumguard served as an assistant \nto a chaplain in World War II. He credited that experience with his \nmotivation for becoming a rabbi.\n  One of Rabbi Baumguard's strongest ideals was the continuing \nfriendship and alliance with the State of Israel. The Rabbi was \ncommitted to not only strengthening our ties with our great ally, but \nto seeing that the United States continues to support and defend the \nJewish state, which is an idea that I shared with him.\n  I am so honored and privileged to have had the opportunity to \nrepresent Temple Beth Am and to experience all that Rabbi Baumguard has \ndone to improve south Florida. May his memory be a blessing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1782-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE SERVICE OF CHIEF DELL URBAN\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dell Urban, the chief \nof the North Chicago Fire Department, who is retiring after spending \nmore than 25 years on the force. Ms. Urban is the first female fire \nchief in Lake County, and one of only two female fire chiefs in the \nState of Illinois.\n  As fire chief, Ms. Urban was responsible for saving countless lives \nand did her duty protecting the community of North Chicago. We should \nall aspire to be as brave as the firemen who lay down their lives each \nand every day to ensure our safety.\n  In addition to performing her duties, Ms. Urban has been a mentor and \na friend to many firefighters throughout her time as chief, and she is \nleaving the station far better off than before she was chief.\n  I want to thank Ms. Urban for her service and wish her all the best \nin her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1782-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FIREARMS TRANSFER IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Madam Speaker, the Firearms Transfer Improvement Act, \nwhich I introduced in Congress, would provide a significant boost to \nNew Hampshire gun dealers, nearly all of them small-business owners, as \nwell as the Granite State's tourism industry and larger economy.\n  At its foundation, this bill is meant to protect every American's \nright to bear arms, an essential freedom that is as important as it \never was.\n  My bill would extend the same Federal law that allows interstate long \ngun purchasing to handgun purchases. For instance, a Vermonter could \npurchase a handgun in New Hampshire, where no sales tax exists, and \ntransport it home, as long as he or she follows his or her State's gun \nlaws.\n  This bill would be a boon for States like New Hampshire that, in \naddition to enjoying greater Second Amendment freedom, would also enjoy \ngreater economic freedom. Granite Staters stand to benefit immensely, \nas do sporting enthusiasts around the country.\n  I would like to thank the 18 original cosponsors for their support of \nthis necessary legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1782-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1782-H1787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   POTENTIAL DRAWDOWN OF LAND FORCES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock).

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include supporting material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, tonight I am speaking to gain support for \nH.R. 4534. This is the POSTURE Act. It stops the administration's \ndrawdown of our land forces, the United States Marine Corps and the \nUnited States Army.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, myself and 52 others, 52 cosponsors, \nincluding 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats. I am proud to say that we \nare coming together to make sure that we keep our land forces strong.\n  This is also a bicameral bill. The language of this bill has also \nbeen introduced in the United States Senate.\n  Madam Speaker, the predicate here is a belief in peace through \nstrength, a belief that what we want to do is deter potential \nadversaries; and to do that, we certainly need to restore our \ncapability in our Armed Forces, deterrence really being capability and \nwill.\n  Tonight I am focused in on the POSTURE Act. Of course, Madam Speaker, \nthe coauthors and I, we certainly share deep concern for the entire \njoint force, but today we are particularly focused in on the land \nforces.\n\n[[Page H1783]]\n\n  You will hear, across the evening here, five general points. They \nare:\n  Number one, that the drawdown plan currently from the administration \nis planned to continue into 2018, for several more years here; and at \nthe culmination of that, our land forces will actually be at pre-World \nWar II levels.\n  Given the very volatile, uncertain, ambiguous international \nenvironment that we live in, we believe, the authors, that this is very \nhigh risk; and, really, we want to change that and, essentially, \npreserve 67,000 troops in end strength in the United States Army and \nthe United States Marine Corps. That is number one.\n  The second point is the assumptions that were made, Madam Speaker, \nwhen the administration initially made the decision on the drawdown, we \nbelieve that those assumptions are no longer valid. There has been much \nchange in the world in the last several years, and you will hear some \nof that this evening.\n  The third point, which is very important, is that, with our land \nforces, this is not like a light switch where we can turn it on, turn \nit off, turn it back on. If we end up standing down these 67,000 \ntroops, it could take 3 to 4 years to reconstitute that force level; \nand given the uncertainty we have in this international environment, we \nthink that that is too much risk for us to take on.\n  Madam Speaker, the fourth point, and here I will speak from my \npersonal experience of 29 years in the military, is that this planned \ndrawdown also has consequence for our servicemen and -women. It has, \ncertainly, consequence in terms of the op tempo, the operational tempo, \nof how many deployments they will go on and for how long, the duration \nof those deployments.\n  And also, we know the risk. The enemy's weapon of choice in this war \nis the improvised explosive device, and we know that that has led to \nsignificant challenge with traumatic brain injuries and also post-\ntraumatic stress.\n\n  Certainly, there is wide bipartisan support in this Chamber to care \nfor our servicemen and -women and their families, and that is why these \nbipartisan authors are also very concerned about end strength. That is \npoint 4.\n  The fifth point is this: when we preserve this--because I believe we \nare gaining momentum and, ultimately, I like our chances; we are going \nto get this into law--it is very important that this end strength come \nwith the necessary resources so that we do not hollow out this force.\n  So, Madam Speaker, we are going to have a series of speakers now, my \ncoauthors on the bill. I want to begin with my original coauthor, and \nhe is the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in this Chamber. \nHe is a great American hero, Tim Walz. He is a Democrat from Minnesota.\n  In 1989, he earned the title of Nebraska Citizen Soldier of the Year. \nAfter deployment to Italy with his Guard unit, as part of Operation \nEnduring Freedom, Sergeant Major Walz retired from the Army National \nGuard and resumed teaching as a geography teacher and a football coach \nat Mankato West Senior High School.\n  He is a member of the Armed Services Committee, and he is also a \nmember of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), my \ngood colleague and friend.\n  Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York. It is \na phrase we sometimes throw around in here without a lot of \nauthenticity behind it, but I can tell you, in this case, a gentleman \nwho served this Nation three decades in uniform and has had a \ndistinguished career here in Congress, I am proud to stand with you.\n  I think you heard the gentleman's comments on why we think now is not \nthe right time to draw down this land force, and I say that with both \nof us coming out of that force.\n  The size of the force this Nation needs should not be predicated by a \nplan that is outdated. Since the time this plan was written and put \ninto effect: the rise of ISIS, China has built a new island in the \nSouth China Sea and is landing aircraft on it now, and a belligerent \nRussia.\n  But more than that, we have seen the use of the military force as a \ndeterrent, not just to aggression. We have seen it as a peaceful use, \nwhether it be in Haiti to respond to natural disasters or to respond to \nEbola in West Africa. The best trained, the most efficient and the most \nready force to be able to use our diplomacy and our humanitarian assets \nis this land force.\n  I think for many of us, we were concerned about this, but this is not \nideologically driven. The gentleman and I coauthored a piece of \nlegislation that created the National Commission on the Future of the \nArmy.\n  We said: Let's let the data speak for itself. If the experts can take \nthis in and assess that this force is enough to do what needs to be \ndone according to the strategic plan of this Nation by the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and the best thinkers, then that is the way it should be.\n  But they did not come back with that. They came about some alarming \nthings that they talked about, and one of them, I think it is very \nclear we are heading down the wrong path, stripping it of manpower.\n  There is a belief in this Nation that we can solve all problems, \nespecially security problems, with the use of technology. Our \ntechnological advantage is a huge positive force, but it will not be on \nthe ground with Ebola. It will not be there when we have to have that \ndefending force.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  As everyone in this Chamber knows, 15 years of war puts an incredible \nstress on that. The gentleman used a great analogy.\n  He talked about turning on and off the lights. I use the one that I \nthink a lot of people think: This is like running the car out of gas. \nIf we just need more, we will put more gas in it.\n  That is not true. It is running the car out of oil, which causes all \nkinds of problems. If we do not keep the force where it is at, keep it \ntrained, and keep it ready to go, we will not be able to carry out \nthose missions.\n  I would like to highlight a couple of other things that the \nCommission said about the integration of the National Guard to the \nactive components and the use of the National Guard as an operational \nreserve, not a strategic reserve.\n  Those of us who lived through the years where the National Guard was \nan afterthought and we practiced artillery training with toilet paper \nrolls instead of real charges because we didn't have the capacity to \ntrain, that is the surest way to make sure our force is not ready to \ngo. It is not a good use of taxpayer dollars, and it is simply immoral \nto train America's young warriors without the full capacity of what \nthey need.\n  So I think, for many of us, this is not only a national security \nissue, it is a smart fiscal issue. We have paid dearly with treasure \nand blood to have this force. I can tell you, if the force shrinks too \nmuch--and we have seen this happen--the rotations happen very quickly.\n  All the speakers you are going to hear tonight, Madam Speaker, are \ngoing to tell you about this. It becomes very difficult both from the \npersonal side for them to manage their relationships, but also the \nprofessional side of soldiering. You can't get to the schools you need. \nYou can't develop the wider breadth that you need for all \ncontingencies.\n  We have become very, very good at small missions that the same people \nget rotated into without the ability to look elsewhere. So as we pivot \nto the Pacific, those are new skill sets that need to be incorporated \nin.\n  What the gentleman is asking for is let's just pause in the drawdown, \nlet's keep the force where the Commission and the GAO says it needs to \nbe, let's give the force the ability to rotate out and to do what needs \nto be done to have them get back and ready to get in the fight again in \na way that makes sense. We can do that.\n  Again, I want to be very clear. Those critics who say that we are \nasking to build up the military, we are just asking to stop a drawdown \nthat we think gets dangerously close to putting this Nation in a \npredicament where it cannot carry out the missions that are asked of \nit.\n  We in this Chamber and the American public have a moral \nresponsibility to never put a warrior in that position and never put \nthose commanders in that position.\n  So I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this forward. I want to \nthank him for being willing to champion this forward. We know this is \nabout educating not only our colleagues, but the\n\n[[Page H1784]]\n\nAmerican public. It is about having a debate.\n  I think the gentleman from New York brought up a critical point. \nNumbers without the ability to train, equip, and do what is necessary \nto get them to the highest level of readiness is probably worse than \nnothing, and that is not what we are asking for.\n  I think, again, to highlight the gentleman's commitment to this, he \nis looking at ways to pay for it. He is looking at ways to make it \nwork: repealing sequestration, pursuing waste, eliminating programs at \nthe Pentagon, encouraging and assisting our allies and partners to beef \nup what they need to do to beef up, and ensure the next President has \nthe force capable to not only address current, but future threats. That \nis our responsibility.\n  So I am proud to stand with the gentleman on the POSTURE Act. I think \nit is smart policy. It is predicated on data. It is predicated on \ndecades of personal experience from the gentleman from New York and \nspeakers you are going to hear coming up. It is what the thinkers are \ntelling us.\n  Again, I think it does come back to the gentleman's opening comments. \nThose adversaries who think that this is the time to do something with \nthis Nation need to be sent a strong message that we are as strong as \never, our commitment is as strong as ever, and our force will be as it \nalways has been: the best trained and the best fighting force the world \nhas ever seen. We are just asking to give them the numbers to do their \njob.\n  So, Madam Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at \nthis, to get on board, and to talk with the gentleman, myself, and the \nother cosponsors of this.\n  Let's put that next President in a position to be able to secure this \nNation, to be able to forward project American power in the name of \nhumanitarian or human rights, and continue to give our young warriors \nwhat they need.\n  Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman.\n  Madam Speaker, you just heard, I think, in really compelling terms \nand you saw witness to why it is that we have the finest fighting force \nin the world.\n  What separates us from the rest of the world is our noncommissioned \nofficer corps. This is an incredible collection of professionals that \nprovide advice, analysis, and recommendations. Really, I would put our \nnoncommissioned officer corps up against any other noncommissioned \nofficer corps in the world.\n  I want to say, beyond that, he is a phenomenal Representative here in \nthe U.S. House. I want to thank the gentleman for that tremendous \ntestimony and for his great leadership.\n  I now want to turn to another great warrior, Representative Steve \nRussell. Steve Russell is, Madam Speaker, an Airborne Ranger. He has \nserved in airborne, light, and mechanized infantry assignments. His \ndeployments include deployment to Kosovo, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and \nIraq.\n  Madam Speaker, in 2003, then-Lieutenant Colonel Steve Russell \ncommanded the task force in Iraq that was instrumental in the hunt and \ncapture of Saddam Hussein.\n  He is in his first term. He is already off to an amazing start. He is \na member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I yield to the gentleman from the State of Oklahoma, Mr. Steve \nRussell.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my brother, combat \ninfantryman, warrior, and colleague from New York (Mr. Gibson) for his \nleadership in this effort.\n  Madam Speaker, in 1940, our Nation faced tough decisions. Lawmakers \nin this Chamber debated over our constitutional requirement to defend \nour Republic.\n  Faced with a decade of depression, declining budgets, and enormous \ndomestic needs, President Roosevelt recognized that the Nation was \nwoefully unprepared to defend herself, given the alarming developments \nin Asia and Europe the previous 2 years.\n  Congress acted, and, although assured we could stay out of the war, \nthis body passed the unprecedented Selective Service Act of 1940 to \nincrease our defensive posture.\n  While some would call it prescient or even timely, we were still \nwoefully unprepared for the horrific attacks on our naval, land, and \nair forces in 1941. When the blow fell, we had for the first time a \nsizeable forward-deployed force based in the Philippine Islands in \nDecember 1941.\n  That Allied force of 150,000 soldiers fought bravely for 5 months \nuntil their medical supplies, food, and, finally, ammunition were \nexhausted, prompting the largest surrender of U.S. forces in American \nhistory.\n  Tens of thousands of these Allied soldiers died in brutal captivity, \nall simply because our Nation could not get to them. While we had \nfuture capacity, we had forfeited our defensive posture through cost-\ncutting policies the previous decade and we had exhausted our time.\n  As unprepared as we were in 1940, it could have been even worse had \nthe President and Congress not acted when they did. But here is \nsomething to ponder: our current land forces are actually 30 percent \nsmaller today than they were in 1940 when you compare them to a \npercentage of our per capita population. If we lived today in an \natmosphere of peace, maybe we could take such gambles.\n  Instead, we see Russians reigniting the cold war, Iranians \ndestabilizing the Middle East, North Koreans firing nuclear missiles \nwith the aim to range the United States, and Islamic jihadist death-\ncult extremists committing acts of barbarity akin to the Middle Ages. \nWe also see tensions rising with our trading partner, China, and the \nseeds of potential unrest in the Pacific.\n  What does the President and this Congress intend to do if we do not \nact to prepare for this dangerous world? This year it would cut the \nUnited States Army by 30,000 more soldiers and our Marines by another \n8,000. Instead, our bipartisan answer to these cuts in this Congress is \na resounding no.\n  Whatever savings we might imagine we safeguard, whatever tension we \nmay imagine we could trim, whatever goodwill we deceive ourselves of \nthat would go after, we assuredly would be eroded by an unexpected \nattack on our Nation as she has voluntarily chained herself down into a \nweakened condition.\n  Rather than slacken our posture, we must slacken our chains. We stand \ntogether with much work ahead, but this bipartisan effort is a refusal \nto see our Nation further diminished.\n  As we pass this measure into law, let's do it with the echo of these \nsobering words from novelist, historian, and Nobel Laureate Aleksandr \nSolzhenitsyn, a survivor of torture and tyranny:\n\n       I would like to call upon America to be more careful with \n     its trust and prevent those who because of shortsightedness \n     and still others out of self-interest from falsely using the \n     struggle for peace and for social justice to lead you down a \n     false road. Because they are trying to weaken you. They are \n     trying to disarm your strong and magnificent country in the \n     face of this fearful threat. I call upon you ordinary working \n     men of America. Do not let yourselves become weak.\n\n  Pass the POSTURE Act and prevent some horrific blow from berthing in \nour future.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for his outstanding leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell).\n  What we heard, Madam Speaker, just moments ago here is what I \nmentioned at the outset. We were talking about the changed assumptions \nwhen the administration first made these decisions.\n  Of course, they were working based on the 2012 Defense Strategic \nGuidance, the 2013 Strategic Choices and Management Review, and also \nthe 2014 QDR.\n  Madam Speaker, I think we just heard very persuasive argumentation \nhow just in the last several years so much has changed and the reason \nwhy this Chamber is coming together in a bipartisan way to move forward \non this POSTURE Act.\n  Now, Madam Speaker, I want to turn to Representative Renee Ellmers. \nRenee is not on the Committee on Armed Services, but this lady works \nincredibly hard for our Nation and for our servicemen and -women. She \nstudies all the time. I have had countless discussions with her.\n  She is always wanting to know the details to make sure that the \nservicemen and -women who serve at Fort Bragg get all the resources \nthat they need. She takes their combat readiness so very seriously \nbecause she knows that their lives are on the line there.\n\n[[Page H1785]]\n\n  Fort Bragg could not ask for a stronger advocate. I am very impressed \nand am very thankful for her support in going above and beyond, not \nbeing on the committee and jurisdiction, to be here tonight and, \nreally, to make her voice be heard all throughout this land on why we \nneed to get behind the POSTURE Act.\n  So I will just say last before I turn it over to her that part of \nwhat I know that Representative Ellmers is working on is a very \nimportant supporting element for our land forces, the 440th, which is \nbased out of Fort Bragg and Pope Army Air Base. I know from firsthand \nexperience this is an incredible outfit. We are concerned about some \ndecisions that are being taken here.\n\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers)\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, \nMr. Gibson. I just want to start right off by saying, Madam Speaker, \nthat our colleague, Mr. Gibson, has been a tireless voice for our \nmilitary and certainly has been a resource for me and has always been \nmore than open and honest with me when it comes to decisions that are \nfacing our military and national security.\n  Again, I just want to thank the gentleman for his service and, also, \nfor coming to Washington to serve our country yet again, to be such an \nadvocate for the military, and to be such a support for the rest of us \nwho are trying to help in that capacity as well.\n  I am here tonight to discuss in this Special Order the introduction \nof the POSTURE Act, and I thank the gentleman for this great piece of \nlegislation.\n  The POSTURE Act is an important piece of legislation that will \nprevent further troop reductions and improve military readiness. As the \nRepresentative of Fort Bragg based in North Carolina, I have the unique \nperspective to see how this troop drawdown is directly impacting our \nnational security.\n  It is my top priority to ensure that we restore our military's end \nstrength not only to serve as a deterrent, but also so that our \nmilitary can appropriately and effectively respond to any threat \nrepresented to our country or our allies. The POSTURE Act will ensure \nthat our troops are ready and prepared to defend our Nation at a \nmoment's notice.\n  I would also like to thank Mr. Gibson for his help raising awareness \nabout the serious issues facing Fort Bragg, including the deactivation \nof the 440th Airlift Wing.\n  The 440th Airlift Wing provides unparalleled support to Fort Bragg \nparatroopers, more specifically, the famed 82nd Airborne's Global \nResponse Force, a unit Mr. Gibson knows all too well, as he was the \ncommander of this force just a few years back.\n  Because of the potential deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing, I \nhave been having this very discussion about maintaining military \nreadiness and maintaining sufficient troop levels for the last 2-plus \nyears.\n  This certainly is not the first time I have stepped foot onto the \nHouse floor to rail against the Air Force's ill-conceived decision to \ndeactivate the 440th. In fact, I have stood in this very spot and \nstressed my concerns about the threats their decision poses to the \nreadiness of the Fort Bragg paratroopers.\n  Unfortunately, what I thought was going to happen is indeed taking \nplace as we speak. While the Air Force has promised they would continue \nto provide necessary airlift support for Fort Bragg, the Air Force is \nalready falling well short of this promise.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Fort Bragg aims to complete 10,000 jumps a month to prepare troops \nfor combat, but the Air Force's decision to prematurely hollow out this \nwing has prevented them from meeting this jump goal. Last month, only \n6,100 paratroopers jumped from Air Force planes. In fact, the Air Force \nhas even fallen short on Fort Bragg's 8,000-jump minimum--a number they \nconsider to be their threshold for proficiency.\n  This is yet another consequence and, unfortunately, it is a concrete \nexample of how drawdown can and will affect military readiness and \ntraining. Not only have I met with Fort Bragg leadership, but I have \nalso met with our Nation's top military officials and still, to this \nday, I do not understand why the Air Force insists on making decisions \nbased on zero strategic merit.\n  To make matters worse, deactivation of the 440th is happening at a \ntime when the 18th Airborne Corps was recently called upon to lead the \nfight against the Islamic extremist group ISIS. Members of the 18th \nAirborne Corps are set to deploy this summer. Meanwhile, we are on the \ntrack to have the smallest size Army since the end of World War II.\n  Russia has become increasingly aggressive and China's military \npresence continues to grow in southeast Asia--all the while our \nPresident insists on drawing down our military and cutting its funding. \nThis is not the time to be cutting our military. This is the time to \nstrengthen it.\n  Mr. Gibson's bill ensures that we will have appropriate end strength \nto keep our Nation and our allies safe and secure. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Mr. Gibson and standing by him in this \ncapacity, as I believe that strengthening our military is one of the \nmost important issues facing Congress to date.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I want to thank \nher for her strong voice, and I want to thank her for the attention to \ndetail that she puts into this. This is so critically important. It is \nvery instrumental in the momentum that we have had--your great voice, \nyour staff's hard work, and your hard work.\n  We are going to continue to push forward with this with the POSTURE \nAct, and continue to make sure that the entire installation at Fort \nBragg has the necessary resources to deliver and to get its mission \ndone and to look after and take care of its servicemen and -women, \nthose paratroopers, and also the families.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). \nRepresentative Knight is also a veteran of our Armed Forces. He was \nborn at Edwards Air Force Base in Antelope Valley, California. He \nserved in the United States Army from 1985 to 1987. He was a track \nsystems mechanic in Freiburg, Germany. When his tour ended, he served \nin the United States Army Reserve. His total military service spanned \nfrom 1985 to 1993. He is a member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee. Also, within his district, he has Air Force Plant 42 and the \nEdwards Air Force Base.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for taking a leadership \nrole in making sure that the military has a voice, and that is exactly \nwhat he has done in his tenure here in Congress.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4534. The POSTURE Act is not just something \nthat we are asking for. It is basically the bare necessities. We are \ngetting down to the limits.\n  I can say, just on personal experience, when I enlisted in 1985 as a \nyoung person graduating high school and enlisting into the Army, I \nexpected that we had such a great military and we had all of these \nthings that were going to help me in my endeavors. As I went to \nGermany, my job was if something happened, if the Russians were going \nto come over, we were supposed to guard what was known as the Fulda \nGap. I know that anyone who has ever served in the Army in the '80s \nknows what the Fulda Gap is. It was basically that line where we were \ngoing to stop the Russian Army.\n  Unfortunately, they told us that we were going to be outrun about 11 \nto 1 at that time from the Russian Army. That is not something that an \n18-year-old wants to know, is that the very first assignment that might \nhappen in the cold war is you are going to go to a spot and you are \ngoing to be up against an 11-to-1 army. At that time, we had about \n781,000 active Army folks.\n  If we fast forward to today, we are sending people in rotations every \n12 months or every 18 months. We are sending these people two, three, \nor four different rotations during their 4- or 6-year enlistments, and \nwe have such a smaller active Army. I know that now folks out there \nwill be talking about the total Army structure and the total structure. \nI think that is great that we have the Reserves and National Guard as \npart of the total structure. I believe in that. I think that is \nsomething that absolutely should happen.\n  But if we are just doing apples to apples from 1986 to today, we go \nfrom about 780,000 to less than 500,000. That is getting down to a \npoint where, can\n\n[[Page H1786]]\n\nwe fight on two fronts, can we help, can we do all of the missions that \nthe Army has done for the last 200 years?\n  I would say that we are getting down to that point where if we don't \npass the POSTURE Act, we will go underneath that level and we will not \nbe able to send our warriors into combat and into humanitarian \nsituations with our best effort, with our best foot forward. I would \nsay that this is the absolute--the absolute--end to where we should \ndraw down.\n  Let's look at what we are looking at today. We are not looking at \nsome of the larger countries, but we are also looking at rogue states. \nRussia and China, obviously, are out there and they are, obviously, \ndoing things that we keep our eye on. Their technology has advanced, \ntheir amount of money that they spend on the military has jumped \ndramatically over the last 20 years. Some of the things that they are \nbringing forward are as technologically advanced as we have.\n  I would say that if we went back 20 years, we would never say that. \nWe would say technologically we are ahead every step of the way. Today \nwe can't say that. Today we also have rogue nations and rogue leaders \nout there that want to do things to us and to our allies.\n  So I say at a time where we are drawing down and continuing to draw \ndown, where we have these types of rogue nations, where we have these \ntypes of superpowers out there, and we have these types of groups that \nwant to do bad things to us and to our allies, is this actually the \ntime that we should draw down to an unsafe level?\n  I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for everything that he has done in \nhis tenure here in Congress and what he has done for the United States \nof America because, honestly, he is a true hero. But in this regard, he \nis trying to unite all of Congress behind what he has believed and what \nhe has done for his entire life.\n  I think that Congress should listen, I think that Congress should \nsay, yes, we absolutely have these levels, and we can't go below them. \nIn fact, as we are watching everything that is happening on the news on \na daily basis, we would say that maybe those levels are too low, too. \nSo I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for his leadership.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank him for his \nservice to our Nation, and also thank him for his great work on the \nHouse Armed Services Committee. He is truly making a difference, and \nhis voice here tonight is very compelling and very significant.\n  Madam Speaker, I am now going to recap and move to close. I \nappreciate very much the time in a busy schedule and colleagues here \ntonight. We are here tonight, again, for H.R. 4534, the POSTURE Act, \nwhich stops the Obama administration's drawdown of our land forces--our \nArmy and our Marine Corps.\n  As I mentioned, this is a bipartisan bill--myself and 52 others here \nin this Chamber, including 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats, led so ably \nby Sergeant Major Retired Representative Tim Walz, a Democrat from \nMinnesota.\n  I also want to say that Chairman Turner was not able to be here \ntoday, but he has been instrumental in not only help craft this, but \nactually help build support for it for these past several months.\n  As I mentioned, Madam Speaker, tonight you heard five points why it \nis so important that we put the POSTURE Act into law and that we stop \nthis drawdown.\n  In the first point we gave some historical figures and some context \nof where we are today. We know that at present our land forces are \nabout at the same size that we were on the 11th of September of 2001. \nOf course, during the surge, we saw a ramp-up of our land forces, and \nnow we have seen a resetting of that where we are about at 11th of \nSeptember of 2001 levels.\n  However, the plan now from the administration is to continue that \ndrawdown all the way down to pre-World War II levels. That would be \ndone by 2018. That takes an additional 67,000 troops out of the \nformations.\n  Madam Speaker, we heard, I think, some very significant testimony \ntonight from some of the speakers. We know that we have senior leaders \nin our Armed Forces now that have described this as a very serious \nrisk, very significant risk. And you also heard from Representative \nWalz when he talked about the Commission on the Future of the Army, \nwhich Representative Walz, a humble man, was actually the author for \nthat, the brain for that. We are here today because of his work on that \nscore.\n  The results of that commission, I believe, Madam Speaker, really need \nto be paid attention to. It was here that not only were we able to get \na better understanding of this risk, but also we helped bring together \nall components of the Army--the regular Army, the National Guard, and \nthe Army Reserve. The Commission on the Future of the Army helped.\n  I also want to reinforce how important leadership is--our Chief of \nStaff of the Army, our Secretary of the Army, our Acting Secretary of \nthe Army right now. They have put a major priority on really pulling \ntogether everyone that serves in the Army. The same goes for our \nSecretary of the Navy and for our Commandant of the Marine Corps \nbecause this is truly a team effort all the way across. That commission \nhelped chart the way forward.\n  Madam Speaker, the General Accounting Office, the GAO's report that \ncame out just last week, documented what our research has also shown \nover these several months. That is that there is just too much risk in \ncontinuing this drawdown to pre-World War II levels. That was point \none.\n  In point two, we talked about the assumptions--we heard from all the \nspeakers. Particularly, Mr. Russell focused in on that--how much of the \nworld has changed. We can understand why the administration brought \nforward an argument back initially, but so much has changed since that \ntime. It is clear to all of us that we need to pay attention to that \nand to adopt the POSTURE Act.\n  We also pointed out this evening that this is not like a light \nswitch. It is not something that we can turn on and turn off. If we \ndecide to move forward with the 67,000 troops, taking them out of the \nformations, we know that we are looking at 3 to 4 years just to get \nback to where we are today, Madam Speaker. That would, I think, really \nsignal to our potential adversaries the wrong message.\n  The fourth point is--and we heard from a couple of the speakers--how \nimportant it is that we have the right size formations because that \nimpacts on how often they get sent over into the combat zone and how \nlong they stay. All of this has impacts on families, it has impacts on \ntraumatic brain injury potential, and also posttraumatic stress. That \nis certainly something that this Chamber is absolutely unified in doing \neverything we can to support our servicemen and -women. By enacting the \nPOSTURE Act, we are also supporting our currently serving members and \nour veterans.\n  The last point--and this has been really made very clear to us by all \nthe leadership in both the Army and the Marine Corps--is how important \nit is that by preserving this end strength, it has to come with the \nnecessary resources so that they are manned, equipped, and trained, and \nthat we look towards the modernization of the force and look towards \nthe future.\n  We have heard from the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO. The CBO \ninitially assesses this at $600 million. We understand that there may \nbe a new assessment coming forward shortly. But as was also mentioned \nby Sergeant Major Walz, Representative Walz, our committee is also very \nkeenly going through the budget, a budget of over $600 billion, when \nyou look at the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, the \nOverseas Contingency Fund. We are looking for ways to make sure we do \nthis in the best way possible for the taxpayer.\n  Madam Speaker, I include for the Record a series of letters of \nsupport that we are getting from the Association of the United States \nArmy, the National Guard Association, and the Reserve Officers \nAssociation. We deeply appreciate their support.\n\n                                                Association of the\n\n\n                                           United States Army,\n\n                                Arlington, Virginia, 3 March 2016.\n     Hon. Chris Gibson,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Gibson: On behalf of the members of the \n     Association of the United States Army (AUSA), I write to \n     support your introduction of H.R. 4534, the ``Protecting Our \n     Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-\n\n[[Page H1787]]\n\n     Strength Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act.'' At a time when \n     our Army is confronting growing threats and increasing \n     operational demands, it would be wise to pause the current \n     budget-driven force reductions and allow the next \n     administration time to assess land force capabilities and \n     needs before determining troop levels,\n       Under current plans, the Regular Army is expected to fall \n     to 475,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2016, and then further \n     decrease to 450,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2018. These same \n     plans will also reduce the end strength of our Army National \n     Guard and the Army Reserve. Such a reduction in our landpower \n     capability does not make sense in a time of increased threats \n     and global instability.\n       While the POSTURE Act puts the brakes on budget-driven \n     force reductions, the Army will also face negative \n     consequences if the additional end strength is not funded. \n     During a recent hearing on the Army's Fiscal Year 2017 \n     budget, Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Kinney told the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee that stopping the drop in Army end \n     strength without providing funding to cover the additional \n     costs would undermine readiness and potentially result in a \n     hollow Army.\n       AUSA looks forward to working with you to advance the \n     POSTURE Act, but urges you to consider ways to provide the \n     additional resources to prepare our Army to face a dangerous \n     and Increasingly unstable world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gordon R. Sullivan,\n     General, USA Retired.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     National Guard Association of\n\n\n                                       The United States, Inc.\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Chris Gibson,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       On behalf of the nearly 45,000 members of the National \n     Guard Association of the United States and the approximately \n     450,000 soldiers and airmen of the National Guard, please \n     accept our sincere thanks for your leadership in introducing \n     the Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized \n     End-Strength (POSTURE) Act of 2016 (H.R. 4534), a bill that \n     would stop the drawdown of U.S. Land Forces.\n       NGAUS strongly supports your legislation.\n       The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) \n     recommended a minimally sufficient Total Army of 980,000 \n     soldiers; however, it provided no optimal end-strength level. \n     NGAUS testified before the NCFA that the Total Army was at \n     the risk of becoming dangerously small given the current \n     threat environment.\n       Given the velocity of instability, the demand for U.S. Land \n     Forces will likely only increase for the foreseeable future. \n     U.S. Land Forces must be sized to address these threats \n     without putting undue stress on our soldiers and marines.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure \n     this important legislation becomes law. Thank you, as always, \n     for your continued support for members of the National Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Gus Hargett,\n     Major General (Ret), USA, President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Reserve Officers Association,\n\n                                                     1 March 2016.\n     Hon. Chris Gibson,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Gibson: The Reserve Officers Association \n     (ROA) supports your bill H.R. 4534, ``Protecting Our Security \n     Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength Act of 2016'' or \n     the ``POSTURE Act.'' This bill recognizes the vital \n     contributions of the Reserve Components and the need to \n     ensure they have the right Fiscal Year 2016 end strength \n     authorized.\n       Since 9/11, more than 900,000 Reserve Component members \n     have been activated to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, \n     Operation New Dawn, and other contingencies. Despite \n     increased use of the Guard and Reserve, the Congressional \n     Research Service, identified end strength reductions between \n     FY2001 and FY2015.\n       ``Between FY2001 and FY2015, the largest shifts in \n     authorized end strength have occurred in the Navy Reserve \n     (-31,600 or -35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and \n     Coast Guard Reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). A smaller change \n     occurred in the Air National Guard (-3,022 or -2.8%) and Army \n     Reserve (-3,300 or -1.6%), while the authorized end strength \n     for the Army National Guard (-326 or -0.1%) and the Marine \n     Corps Reserve (-358 or -0.9%) have been largely unchanged \n     during this period, (FY2016 National Defense Authorization \n     Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues, R44120).''\n       As stated in the bill, passing this legislation will ensure \n     Guard and Reserve members are available, ``. . . to deter \n     threats, shape the international security 15 environment, \n     respond to emergent situations and crises, and, if necessary, \n     to fight and win the Nation's war, . . .''\n       ROA has a membership of 50,000, which represents all the \n     uniformed services of the United States who would be \n     favorably affected by your bill. Thank you for your efforts \n     on this issue, and past support to the Military.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jeffrey E. Phillips,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. GIBSON. Lastly, Madam Speaker, the legislative strategy here is \nthat we have been building out support. Our hope is that when the mark \nfor the national security policy bill, which will be unveiled here in \nthe next couple of weeks, that this bill will be included in the \nunderlying bill because we think it is just so critically important \nthat we get this done this year.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to come together with \nmy colleagues to talk about such an important issue for the American \npeople.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1787-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1787-H1793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1945\nCONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS--ROAD TO RUIN: HOUSE REPUBLICANS FAIL ON THE \n                                 BUDGET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nbe given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege, once \nagain, to come to the House floor on behalf of the Congressional Black \nCaucus and join with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, \nRepresentative Joyce Beatty, as we anchor this Congressional Black \nCaucus Special Order--the CBC hour of power--where, for 60 minutes, we \nget an opportunity to talk to the American people about issues of great \nimportance to the African American community, to our democracy, and, \ncertainly, to our country at large.\n  Today, we are here to discuss, tragically, the House GOP's continued \nfailure to demonstrate the ability to govern in a basic fashion--that \nis to pass a budget, which is required by statutory law, as of April \n15. That deadline has come and gone, and we are still waiting for the \nHouse majority to present a budget to this body for our consideration.\n  We were told for years by people, including by the current Speaker of \nthis great House, that the most fundamental tenet of governing is the \npassage of a budget. Yet, even with Republicans in firm control of both \nthe House and the Senate, it seems that this Congress is still unable \nto get its act together. It is a stunning act of legislative abdication \nof basic responsibilities. We are going to explore that tonight, not \njust from a procedural standpoint, but from a standpoint of how this is \nindicative of this majority's unwillingness and inability to do the \nbusiness of the American people.\n  It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to my distinguished \ncolleague, my coanchor, my classmate--the always eloquent and \neffervescent gentlewoman from the great city of Columbus in the great \nState of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentleman.\n  I always look forward to engaging in our Congressional Black Caucus' \nSpecial Order hour and, tonight, for our dialogue, for our debate, on \nthe House Republicans' repeated failure to pass a budget.\n  First, let me say, as your classmate and colleague, being able to be \nthe voice for your constituents and my constituents and America at \nlarge, it is an honor. I think it is so important, when we think about \nhow important the work of this Congress is, for us to take on \nchallenging the House Republicans' road to ruin.\n  Madam Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus is going to \ndiscuss the importance of why we should pass a budget. Not only that, I \nam sure Mr. Jeffries and I will have a dialogue about the value and the \nimportance of having a budget. As Members of Congress and, especially, \nas members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we know specifically that \na budget creates jobs and that it raises the paychecks of hardworking \nAmerican people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and \nresponsible way.\n  Madam Speaker, let me just take a moment to point out that this is \nnot\n\n[[Page H1788]]\n\nthe first time that the Congressional Black Caucus has held a Special \nOrder hour on the subject of the Republicans' inaction. Earlier this \nyear, the Congressional Black Caucus came to this House floor and \nimplored the Republican leadership to do its job--the job America wants \nus to do--and that was to enact commonsense gun control legislation. To \ndate, Madam Speaker, Republicans have continued to fail the American \npeople by putting forth or by bringing forth commonsense gun control \nlegislation. It is still hanging out there, waiting for action.\n  Now, again, here in the House of Representatives, the people's House, \nwe are faced with another instance of Republican failure. Under law, as \nspelled out in title III of the Congressional Budget Act, Congress is \ndirected to complete actions on the concurrent resolution on the budget \nby April 15, as we heard Mr. Jeffries remind us. A concurrent \nresolution on the budget means it is supposed to pass both the Senate \nand the House, again, by April 15. At this date, neither Chamber has \nconsidered a budget resolution for 2017.\n  Madam Speaker, I don't know about your constituents, but in my \ndistrict, Ohio's Third Congressional District, my constituents expect \nCongress to work; so let's take a look at it.\n  What happens when people refuse to do their jobs?\n  If postal workers don't deliver, you don't get your mail. If farmers \ndon't farm, people don't eat. If teachers don't show up, our children \ndon't learn. People all over America take their jobs seriously, and \nthey expect us, as their elected officials, to also do that. It is time \nfor House Republicans to get America off the road to ruin and back on \nthe path to prosperity.\n  When Speaker Ryan took office--this is worth repeating, and \nCongressman Jeffries mentioned this earlier. When Speaker Ryan took \noffice, House Republicans stated that passing a budget was a basic \nfunction of government. However, the statutory deadline of passing a \nbudget resolution by April 15 has come and gone, although House \nRepublicans made passing a budget a top priority for this year. In the \nRepublicans' own words, they can't even accomplish the basic functions \nof government--their job.\n  Madam Speaker, why do we care that we don't have a budget? Let me \ngive you the answer.\n  The importance of setting a budget is that it lays out the blueprint \nfor the appropriations process. It outlines government spending for the \nyear. Without a budget, we have 12 appropriations bills that are \nworking their way through Congress without there being guiding \nprinciples on overall spending. If we cannot as a Congress perform the \nbasic functions of governing, how are we going to tackle the much more \ncomplicated issues, such as income inequality, education quality, \ntuition affordability, tax reform, and so many others?\n\n  Once again, House Republicans have demonstrated the degree to which \nthe sharp division within their Conference is impeding Congress' \nability to work for the American people. Instead of coming together \nwith Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and \ngrow the paychecks of hardworking American families, they have just \ndecided not to pass a budget.\n  This decision was made despite the fact that President Obama \nsubmitted his budget request to Congress back in February. As you may \nremember, Madam Speaker, the Republican majority here in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Republican-controlled Senate took the \nunprecedented step of refusing to receive the OMB Director for a formal \nhearing so as to present the President's budget.\n  Madam Speaker, how did that turn out for us? We all know how it \nturned out. The Republican Conference failed the American people, and \nit set us on a road to ruin by not passing a budget.\n  Mr. Jeffries, I look forward to our continuing this dialogue tonight \nwith other members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank Congresswoman Beatty for a very thorough \npresentation and for pointing out that the Speaker, himself, and the \nRepublican majority have indicated that they should be judged based on \ntheir capacity to complete the basics of their job responsibilities, \nwhich include the passage of a budget resolution. In fact, it was then-\nCongressman Ryan who, in 2012, stated that failing to enact a budget \nhas serious consequences for American families.\n  There are at least three current health crises that we are trying to \ndeal with in America and throughout the world, but Republicans have \nabdicated their responsibility: the Zika virus, the Flint water crisis, \nand the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner \ncities, in suburban America, and all throughout the rural parts of this \ncountry; yet House Republicans have failed not just to put forth a \nbudget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues, but they \nhave chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents \nsuch a stunning departure of what responsible Members of Congress \nshould be doing at this particular point in time.\n  I am thankful that we have been joined by the distinguished \ngentlewoman from the great Lone Star State, who has always been \nthoughtful and eloquent on issues of importance not just to her \ndistrict, which is anchored in Houston, Texas, but through her \nmembership and leadership on the Homeland Security Committee as well as \non the House Judiciary Committee. She has been so thoughtful and \neffective on a great many issues in the context of our safety, of our \nwell-being, of criminal justice reform, of course, and of the \nprotection of civil liberties--all issues that are fundamental to our \ndemocracy in the same way that a budgetary roadmap is fundamental to \nour democracy.\n  Let me yield to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my colleagues for their eloquence but, more \nimportantly, for the Congressional Black Caucus in its taking up the \nmantle of the moral compass of justice.\n  One would argue that justice is tied to our committee, the Judiciary \nCommittee; but as I look at this Congress and as I look at a very small \ndocument called the Constitution, one can anchor the responsibilities \nof this body--of both the House and the Senate--Mr. Jeffries, in the \nBill of Rights. I would like to just, very briefly, take us on a \njourney that indicates that our moral compass is broken because a \nbudget that was supposed to be passed on April 15, by midnight, was \nnot.\n  To the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, let me thank her. She \nwill have her own distinctive story, in her eloquence, about the \nfairness to the territories.\n  I listened, as I came in, to the presentation by the gentlewoman from \nOhio, who knows full well that we need a budget to ensure that there is \nfull employment in America. Then I work extensively with my colleague \non the Judiciary Committee, and we will not pass or fund prison reform \nwithout a budget.\n  I rise today, however, to weave in and out of my comments about the \nmoral compass that is broken to indicate that my district--the 18th \nCongressional District in Houston, Texas, and Harris County--is under a \nterrible emergency disaster. We are underwater. We are again facing an \nenormous rainfall that has been listed as historic and, possibly, as \ncatastrophic.\n  Let me acknowledge my mayor, Mayor Turner, and county judge, Judge \nEmmett, for the work that has been done so far; and let me indicate two \npastors with whom I have just gotten off the phone, Bishop Dixon and \nBishop Bady, who are watching hungry people come to a site, looking for \nfood.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  As I was speaking to the emergency leadership, they are indicating \nthey were evacuating babies from apartments and people were being \ndisplaced.\n  So what does that have to do with where we are today and no budget? \nWell, we know that the President introduced his budget a few months \nago.\n  Because of his responsibility, we know that Homeland Security was \nprovided funding and FEMA was provided funding to deal with emergency \ndeclarations of a disaster.\n  My district now needs it more than they have ever needed it. They \nneed it in terms of providing for those immediate needs of vulnerable \npeople without the resources to have stocked food, medical care, \nclothing, and also those who may be off work now because of the \ndisaster.\n  So we don't have a budget. We are not moving along to ensure that\n\n[[Page H1789]]\n\nFEMA, which has seen a lot of disasters over the last 2 years, has the \nnecessary funding to do their job. That is a broken moral compass.\n  It also reflects the Constitution because we are owed an equal \ntreatment under the law and due process under the Fifth Amendment. \nThere is no due process when I hear that one area is under water and we \nare not able to get help.\n  Let me also say that, as I watch a broken moral system, I also look \nat the predicament that we will be in with the Zika virus.\n  Congressman Jeffries has mentioned the opioid crisis, and we cannot \nforget the water crisis in Flint, but there is also the water crisis \nacross the Nation. There is hard work that is being done by the Members \nin Michigan and Mr. Kildee.\n  They need a budget to be able to fund the crisis or to help repair \nthe crisis, restorative dollars, that a budget does to give a roadmap \nto the appropriators.\n  I also know that we are facing another potential epidemic, if you \nwill, the Zika virus that is taking control of places like Puerto Rico \nand other places in the Caribbean, places that we have not yet fully \ndocumented. I can assure you that the Gulf Coast States of Florida, \nLouisiana, and Texas are in the eye of the storm.\n  The President a couple of months ago dutifully and responsibly \nintroduced to this Congress a request of $1.9 billion--no, I didn't say \ntrillions. I didn't say 5 billion. I said 1.9 billion--so that the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention can do their job.\n  Mr. Jeffries, colleagues, if we are not doing our job, we need those \nwho have the distinctive responsibility for issues of health and \nepidemics in this country to be able to do their job.\n  We have now been told by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention that it is not just in the prestages of pregnancy that the \nZika virus can have a severe impact.\n  It is throughout the pregnancy. We also know that they have just \ndetermined that it will be severe brain damage that will come about.\n  So how irresponsible can it be to not put forward the emergency \nsupplemental of $1.9 billion? I have sent letters to Secretary Burwell. \nI have sent letters to, obviously, the President of the United States \nin supporting his efforts. I have sent letters to our leader, Nancy \nPelosi, who has been a champion on these issues of Zika funding. And I \nhave sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan.\n  Might I speak to the Speaker and certainly ask that a half-baked, if \nI might say, contribution to fighting the Zika virus is not going to \nwork because any taking of monies from other places is going to damage \nthe funding of malaria, tuberculosis, and a universal flu vaccine. Yes, \nit is going to undermine our needed and continued effort of fighting \nEbola.\n  Let me finish by simply saying this: Along with the idea of the Zika \nvirus and other crises, when we hear headlines like this that indicate \nAmericans still don't see a vibrant labor market, then you know what \nelse is needed under this budget? We need a budget to be able to fully \nfund the retraining of Americans.\n  I have introduced legislation that will train middle-age or middle-\nmanagement workers and others and give them a stipend while they are \nbeing retrained for the 21st century jobs. We cannot do that with a \nbudget not passed and an assessment not being made on how we would fund \njob training.\n  Lastly, the Supreme Court heard a case today dealing with the issues \nof executive orders and immigration. I would argue that Texas and the \nother States do not have standing because they are not required to give \ndriver's licenses or anything else, as the President provides a \nprioritization of who should be deported.\n  I will say to you that, over the years, we have said over and over \nagain to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which could have been a \nkey element of a budget revenue to be able to help this country move \nalong.\n  Without a budget and an intelligent discussion about what \ncomprehensive immigration reform would do as an added revenue for this \ncountry, here we are mumbling along while Houston remains under water, \nneeding resources from FEMA, while the Zika virus is in distress with \nno monies and while a number of other important issues are not \naddressed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jeffries for allowing me to spend a moment \nto at least tie in the Bill of Rights that deal with the very core \nvalues of this country.\n  We have let down that basic document that guarantees equal \nprotection, guarantees a certain freedom to be protected, guarantees \nthat Americans have due process, if you will, and certainly guarantees \nthe freedom of expression so that Americans can speak and be heard. \nThey are speaking, but they are not being heard. What a shame that this \nbudget has not been passed.\n  I am grateful to the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me acknowledge \nthe chairman and say: Let us keep our fight going because we have \nreason to provide that kind of comfort to the American people.\n  Madam Speaker, Last week, House Republicans blew past the statutory \ndeadline for Congress to enact a budget--reflecting apparently the \nbelief of the Leadership that their already severe budget proposal was \nnot radical enough to pass through a Republican Majority.\n  The Do-Nothing Republican Congress is back.\n  Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution \nthat will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hard-working American \nfamilies, Republicans have decided not to pass a budget at all.\n  The Republican-led Budget Committee, at the direction of the House \nGOP Leadership, put forward the most devastating `Road to Ruin' budget \nin history, but the Republican majority has rejected the plan as \ninsufficiently severe.\n  Here's what was too weak to satisfy the radical forces that have \nseized control of the Republican Party; a budget that would:\n  1. End the Medicare guarantee for seniors;\n  2. Make $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the \nHouse Budget Committee;\n  3. Devastate investments in good-paying jobs, education, and American \ninfrastructure;\n  4. Repeal the Affordable Care Act and dismantle the affordable health \ncare of 20 million Americans.\n  Republicans have failed to keep their promise to pass a budget but \ntheir goal is still clear: to take us back to the radical trickle-down \nagenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle-\nclass Americans.\n  At the same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the \nthousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the \nthree public health emergencies of the Zika virus, opioid addiction and \nthe Flint Water Crisis:\n  1. As the House Democratic Leadership wrote to Speaker Ryan last \nmonth, these public health crises require swift and decisive \nCongressional action.\n  2. Also last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to \nChairman Hal Rogers (R-KY), requesting an immediate hearing on the \nAdministration's $1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, \npointing out that ``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency \nthat has the potential to affect millions of Americans this summer, \nincluding more than two million pregnant women.''\n  3. But House Republicans have responded with nothing but inaction and \nindifference.\n  Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public \nhealth crises, House Republicans are now wasting a full week \ngrandstanding on the IRS.\n  That's just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the American \npeople have come to expect from the Do-Nothing Republican Congress.\n  As NPR notes:\n  Under Republican leadership, the 114th Congress has been ``short on \nmeaty legislation and short on weeks in session . . . But there seems \nto be plenty of time to think about other things. Last month, one House \nmember introduced a measure that would nationally recognized magic as \nan art form.''\n  Hard-working families deserve a Congress that invests in their \nfuture, protects safety, and creates a level-playing field for them and \ntheir children to succeed.\n  Democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs and \nraises the paychecks of the American people, while reducing the deficit \nin a balanced and responsible way.\n  Today, the Supreme -Court heard oral arguments in its review of the \nPresident's Immigration Executive Actions, which, as a result of \ncongressional Republicans' inaction, address our Nation's broken \nimmigration system and set important priorities in enforcing our \nimmigration laws.\n  The President's executive actions fall well within both the clear \nlegal authority provided by Congress and the Constitution, and the\n\n[[Page H1790]]\n\nwell-established precedents of immigration actions by every Democrat \nand Republican President for the last 50 years.\n  1. Six Republican presidents have used the same clear authority to \nmake our immigration enforcement priorities better fit our values as a \npeople and our needs as a nation;\n  2. Past presidents have routinely acted in the face of Congressional \ninaction;\n  3. Numerous noted legal scholars have found that the President's \nactions are well within his legal authority.\n  The Immigration Executive Actions follow the same constitutional and \nlegal precedent used by every Administration--Republican and \nDemocratic--since President Eisenhower.\n  Just as Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush did before him, \nPresident Obama took executive action to make our immigration system \nbetter meet the needs of our country and better reflect our values as \nAmericans.\n  As former Republican Senator Richard Lugar wrote in the New York \nTimes:\n  ``. . . whether or not you like President Obama's actions, he has \noperated under longstanding provisions of law that give the executive \nbranch discretion in enforcement. This presidential prerogative has \nbeen recognized explicitly by the Supreme Court.''\n  Democrats stand for restoring sense to our utterly broken immigration \nsystem--so that we stop tearing apart families and separating parents \nfrom their children.\n  Last month, House and Senate Democrats filed our own amicus brief \nwith the Supreme Court in support of the President's Immigration \nExecutive Actions.\n  We are confident that the Supreme Court will affirm these vital \nimmigration reforms and allow the President's steps to start fixing our \nimmigration system to move forward.\n  While Republicans stand with Donald Trump's incendiary anti-immigrant \nagenda, Democrats will continue to champion the comprehensive \nimmigration reform our nation needs.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from \nTexas. She raises several important points.\n  One of the things that has struck me during my time here in Congress \nis that, under Republican reign, we have consistently seen government \nby crisis on one issue after the next.\n  From the group of people that spend so much time messaging the point \nto the American people that they believe in fiscal responsibility, \nwhere is the fiscal responsibility in failing to put forth a budget \nconsistent with the law that you supported?\n  The other thing that amazes me--and the gentlewoman from Texas raised \nthe point about the Supreme Court case that was argued earlier today on \nthe immigration executive order issued by the President--I sit on the \nJudiciary Committee along with the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee and we \nhear almost every week about how lawless this President allegedly has \nbeen in terms of his time in office.\n  Now, it is interesting to consistently hear the lectures about how \nlawless this President has allegedly been from people who believe that \nPresident Barack Obama exceeded his authority on January 20, 2009, the \nmoment that he took the oath of office because there are folks who \nstill cannot believe that this man is the President and leader of the \nfree world. So I never buy that lawlessness argument.\n  This is a group now that supports essentially undermining the \nConstitution over in the other house of this Congress. The President \nhas done his job in putting forth the Supreme Court nominee, who is \nclearly qualified not according to Members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus, but according to Orrin Hatch himself, one of the leading \nMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee, amongst others.\n  The lawlessness is not taking place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It \nis taking place right here in the United States Congress under the \nleadership of House and Senate Republicans.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me just finish my point by saying \nthat the reason why the budget is not here is because they could not \nmuster the votes of the majority and they could not muster them even \nthough their budget ended Medicare, it took $6.5 trillion in cuts from \nthe overall budget, it devastated good-paying jobs, education, American \ninfrastructure, and, again, it repealed the Affordable Care Act and \ndismantled the Affordable Care Act for 20 million people.\n  Even with those poison pills to draw in support for some kind of \nbudget that would fit within the law, their responsibility or the \nresponsibility of Congress--they are in the majority--they could not \npass or get on the floor a budget.\n  Clearly, the moral compass is broken. More importantly, it denies \nequal protection under the law, in my interpretation, of millions of \nAmericans depending on this Congress doing its job.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the thoughtful observations \nof the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  I think we want to bring Representative Stacy Plaskett into this \nconversation in terms of the stunning inability to present a budget.\n  As Representative Jackson Lee said, what else is there to do in terms \nof satisfying the extreme elements of your party? Privatize Social \nSecurity and throw older people out of their homes across the country? \nWhat else can you do?\n  We are going to explore some of these draconian cuts that were in a \nbudget that apparently is not extreme enough.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), my \ngood friend and colleague by way of Brooklyn, New York, I point out. We \nare so thankful for her presence here in the Congress. It is my honor \nnow to yield to her.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries and I thank \nthe Congressional Black Caucus for giving us this opportunity to always \nbe the conscience of this Congress.\n  I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless efforts to raise \nawareness on not just the Committee on the Judiciary, but all of the \nwork that he does.\n  This group has come together this evening to talk about the fact that \nonce again the Republicans have created a road to ruin in their budget \nfailure.\n  We talked about the fact that this Republican Congress has blown past \nthe statutory deadline to enact a budget last week, reflecting, \napparently, the belief of the leadership that their already severe \nbudget proposal was not even radical enough to pass through this \nRepublican majority.\n  The gentleman talked about some of the draconian measures that were \nalready in the budget that they had proposed, which seems to have not \nbeen sufficient enough for their caucus.\n  At the direction of the House GOP leadership, the Budget Committee \nput forth one of the most devastating budgets in history and the \nmajority rejected that plan as insufficient, which can only lead us to \nbelieve that it was not even severe enough for them.\n  Some of the things that were in that budget were an end to a Medicare \nguarantee for seniors, makes $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts \never proposed by the House Budget Committee--devastates investments in \ngood-paying jobs, education, and American infrastructure, repeals the \nAffordable Care Act and dismantling the affordable health care of 20 \nmillion Americans.\n  Now, as expressed by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), in \nFebruary, the administration, our President, requested support for \nAmericans through the budget that he submitted to this Congress, which \nprovided support for education, job training support, bolstering our \nobligation to seniors, real tools for growth for the territories in \nPuerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and others by inclusion in the \nAffordable Care Act and expansion of Medicare.\n  But it seems that the Republicans have failed their promise to pass a \nbudget, never mind even listen to or hear the head of OMB on that \nbudget.\n  Their goal is still clear, to take us back to radical, trickle-down \nagenda that shattered our economy in the past and hollowed out the \nwages of middle-class Americans.\n  At that same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the \nthousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the \nthree public health crises the chief spoke of: Zika, the opioid addict \naddictions, and the Flint water crisis. In Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, \nFlorida, and now even Texas, this is a real crisis concerns the Zika \nvirus.\n  Last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to \nChairman Hal Rogers requesting an immediate hearing on the \nadministration's\n\n[[Page H1791]]\n\n1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, pointing out that: \n``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the \npotential to affect millions of Americans this summer, including more \nthan 2 million pregnant women.''\n  What did that committee do? Absolutely nothing. Not even the respect \nof a hearing. They have not responded to anything but just their \ninaction and indifference.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public \nhealth crises, the House Republicans are now wasting a full week \ngrandstanding on the IRS. That is just the kind of hollow, meaningless \nposturing the American people have come to expect from this Congress.\n  Hardworking families deserve a Congress that invests in their future, \nprotects their safety, creates a level playing field for them and their \nchildren to succeed. Democrats will continue to press for a budget that \ncreates jobs, raises the paychecks, creates opportunities for American \npeople while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way.\n  I look forward to hearing, with the rest of my colleagues, their \nthoughts on this budget process and even possibly solutions for us as \nAmerican people to come away with a clear budget that creates growth \nand opportunities for Americans.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Plaskett. She \nraised several important points. She noted that our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle continue to embrace this notion of trickle-down \neconomics, which is sort of the foundation of many of the slash-and-\nburn cuts that are contained in at least a budget document that has \nbeen passed in prior years and the document that was put forth by the \nCommittee on the Budget this year, this belief that if you lower the \ntax rate for millionaires and billionaires, that it will result in some \nresidual benefit to the American people. But there is an irony in the \nembrace even of that term, ``trickle-down economics.''\n  With the leadership of Representative Bobby Scott and others, the CBC \nhas consistently put forth a budget designed to open the floodgates of \nprosperity for working class Americans and middle class folks all \nthroughout this country, but what the Republicans want to do is \ntrickle-down economics. The only thing that you get with that \nphilosophy, you may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down.\n  We are thankful that Representative Scott for so many years has \nconsistently put forth through his leadership a budget from the \nCongressional Black Caucus designed to be both fiscally responsible and \nconsistent with our ideals as a country that looks out for the least of \nthose amongst us.\n  Let me now yield to the distinguished representative from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, Mr. Bobby Scott.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \ngetting the title of our State correct. I thank the gentleman from New \nYork and the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding and organizing \ntonight's Special Order.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives failed to pass a budget by \nthe statutorily mandated date of April 15. This failure is unfortunate \nfor our budget process, but perhaps not unfortunate for the American \npeople because no budget is better than the proposed Republican budget \nthat would have been brought to the floor.\n  Our Nation's budget reflects priorities, but the Republican budget \nonly highlights the wrong priorities. The budget the House Republicans \nwanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to \nstudents, working families, and seniors than their previous proposals.\n  The Republican budget would end the Medicare guarantee for seniors by \nconverting Medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace \nwith medical inflation, shifting billions of dollars in medical costs \nonto our senior citizens.\n  The Republican budget would repeal the Affordable Care Act and would \njeopardize the health insurance for millions of Americans, even though \nthe budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the Affordable Care \nAct to pay for the Affordable Care Act, all of those taxes remain in \nthe budget.\n  The Republican budget includes a total of $6.5 trillion in spending \ncuts, largely unspecified. If this level of cuts were ever made, it \nwould devastate our investments and jobs, education, research, and \nwould essentially eliminate any new transportation projects.\n  On top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and \nuplift hardworking American families, the Republican budget calls for \ntrillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit \nmillionaires and billionaires, and then they claim the tax cuts would \nbe revenue neutral, suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of \ndollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the \nwealthy. But despite this, the Republican budget is not a credible \nplan.\n  Are we really going to dismantle Medicare? Are we really going to cut \nhundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and \ntransportation? Are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in \nnew taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy?\n  I don't think so. But the House leadership couldn't even secure \nenough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their \nconference wanted even deeper, unrealistic spending cuts. Budgeting is \nabout making tough choices, and the only choice the Republicans seem to \nhave made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the \nbudget on the backs of students, workers, seniors, the disabled, and \nvulnerable communities across the Nation while cutting taxes for the \nwealthy.\n  The Congressional Black Caucus knows that is not the right choice. \nThat is why, as we have done for the last 30 years, we have diligently \nprepared our own budget alternative to the Republican budget, which we \nwould have offered as an amendment to the Republican budget if they had \nbrought up their proposal.\n  The CBC budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow \nour economy and ensure that every American family is able to prosper. \nOur budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program, totaling $500 billion \nover 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that \nit reaches virtually every community in America while also investing in \nwhat will guarantee America's long-term economic competitiveness.\n  This jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs, \nschool modernization, jobs for teachers and first responders, immediate \ninvestments in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, assistance \nfor neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis, \njob training programs, and summer jobs.\n\n  Our budget calls for significant and sustained investments--\napproximately $300 billion over the next decade--above the President's \nrequest for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of \nAmericans out of poverty. Some of these proposals include restoration \nof cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, expanding \naccess to affordable housing, increasing access to quality and \naffordable education, increasing funding for job training and Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, adjusting the earned income tax credit and child \ntax credit to inflation, as well as decreasing the age where you can \nbenefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Congressman Jim Clyburn, our budget also \nensures that Federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward \neradicating poverty by targeting Federal spending toward persistent \nareas of poverty through the 10-20-30 formula.\n  Our budget also includes more than $340 billion above the President's \nrequest for education over the next decade. This additional money will \nhelp make college more affordable by increasing the Pell grant, fully \nfunding the President's free community college program, reducing \ninterest rates on student loans, and financing other proposals to \nensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable \ndebt.\n  The CBC budget also provides much-needed funding for families of \nFlint, Michigan, to help address the short-term and long-term cognitive \nand behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels. \nHowever, the\n\n[[Page H1792]]\n\nCongressional Black Caucus appreciates, unfortunately, that Flint is \nnot the only community in America impacted by lead exposure. This is \nwhy our budget includes funds to help not only Flint, but also other \ncommunities across the Nation deal with the effects of lead exposure.\n  Unlike the Republican budget, the CBC budget clearly shows how we pay \nfor these additional investments. Our budget sets a new revenue target \nof $4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue \nbaseline. To demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic, our \nbudget suggests several specific alternatives, totaling $7 trillion, \nthat the House and Senate committees can choose from to reach that \ntarget.\n  We ask for $4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at \nleast $7 trillion to choose from. We do this by specifically talking \nabout closing specific corporate loopholes, treating capital gains and \ndividends as regular income, a reasonable fee for financial \ntransactions, restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years \nago, specific items where you can choose from and, in fact, if we just \ncancel the Bush-era tax cuts, we would have almost $4 trillion in new \nrevenue right there.\n  At the end of the day, our budget realistically reduces the deficit \nby approximately $3.2 trillion over the next decade compared to the \nCongressional Budget Office's March 2016 baseline. The CBC budget \nchooses investments in America's children and workers, protects our \nmost vulnerable communities, and changes the wrong choices offered by \nthe Republican majority.\n  I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate these issues if the \nHouse Republicans are ever able to bring their road-to-ruin budget to a \nfull House vote.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Would the gentleman indulge one question?\n  It was mentioned during that very thorough presentation of what is \ncontained in the CBC budget the 10-20-30 program, and of course 10-20-\n30, an initiative that has been championed by the CBC through the \nleadership of Representative Jim Clyburn, would put forth a formula \nwhere 10 percent of the funding allocation would go to counties where \n20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for \n30 or more years. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is correct. If you look at that, those \ncounties and areas are spread all over the country, and if we are ever \ngoing to eradicate poverty, we have to target it to the high poverty \nareas, and 10-20-30 does exactly that.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentleman. In fact, what \nRepresentative Clyburn has consistently pointed out, which I think is \nimportant in an era where we are trying to find common ground and deal \nwith the problems confronting the American people, if you look at a \nbreakdown of persistently poor counties across the country and overlay \nthat with congressional districts, a majority of those counties are \nactually represented by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  This is something that we believe should be embraced by the Speaker \nand our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as it would benefit, \nby the numbers, the constituents that they represent even more so than \nthose of us within the CBC or on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is exactly true. I thank the gentleman \nvery much for pointing that out.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scott.\n  Let me now ask my colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), \nto just react to some of what we have heard.\n  One of the things that I thought was interesting in the presentation \nrelated to this budget is that if you look at the numbers, they are so \nextreme. I was on the Committee on the Budget during my first 2 years \nin Congress, but these numbers are even more extreme than what I \nremember in the 113th Congress. The budget apparently will cut $157 \nbillion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over a 10-\nyear period.\n  The Republican budget that came out of the committee would cut \nroughly $2 trillion from Medicaid. When I was on the committee, the \nnumber was $700 million. I thought that was out of control, $700 \nmillion. Now we are at $2 trillion over a 10-year period apparently.\n  And then we have got cuts in higher education. The proposal is $185 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  You have to ask the question: Why would anyone propose such draconian \ncuts?\n  The answer is clear. This is not something that is often talked \nabout, but the objective is to create a situation where you can \ndramatically lower the tax rates for the wealthiest amongst us. The top \ntax rate right now is 39.6 percent, but what the budget that has been \nput forth by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would do is \nthat it would create two tax rates, one at 10 and the other at 25 \npercent. So what you will see is a tax cut that goes from 39.6 percent \nto 25 percent.\n  The way that you balance a budget and pay for it is on the backs of \nworking families, the middle class, senior citizens, children, the \ndisabled, the poor, the afflicted, and everybody else who doesn't fall \ninto the category of millionaire or billionaire.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Now, you wonder how it could be possible that anyone could think that \nthey could get away with such a draconian budget. Well, again, the \nargument is trickle-down economics.\n  But what I found fascinating--and maybe you could react to this, \nRepresentative Beatty--is that if you actually look at a side-by-side \ncomparison of the economy 8 years under President Clinton with a side-\nby-side comparison of the economy 8 years under George W. Bush, and \nthen a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under President \nObama, I think it is pretty clear who actually has been the responsible \nfiscal stewards.\n  There were 20.3 million jobs created under the Clinton Presidency. \nAmerica lost 650,000 jobs in 8 years under the Bush Presidency. America \nhas now gained more than 14 million private sector jobs under 8 years \nof the Obama Presidency.\n  What has been demonstrated is that the argument that if you lower tax \nrates, you create economic prosperity, is phony. Because Bill Clinton \nraised the top tax rate to 39.6 percent. It didn't seem to adversely \nimpact the economy. In fact, it was humming between 1992 and 2000. \nGeorge Bush comes to office, lowers the tax rate for high-income \nearners from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. We had the greatest recession \nin the history of modern America; the worst financial crisis since the \nGreat Depression.\n  President Obama comes into office and he raises the top tax rate \nagain from 35 to 39.6, more than 14 million jobs are created, the \nunemployment rate has dropped under his tenure from over 10 percent to \n5 percent, the deficit has been reduced by more than a trillion \ndollars. The stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. Now it is \nup to 18,000. I haven't been in the 401(k) system as long as \nCongressman Scott, who clearly is monitoring the situation. So the \nprosperity numbers have been phenomenal.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for her reaction.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. I think Mr. Jeffries and our other colleagues have said \nit so well, but here is what I am afraid of.\n  I think the Republicans--the GOP--want to take us down to the radical \ntrickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the \nwages of middle class, hardworking Americans.\n  You said it all with that comparison from Clinton to Bush to now \nPresident Obama. And I could add to that long list: some 18 million \npeople with health insurance; women having some of the best healthcare \nopportunities, getting mammograms for those who are under- and \nuninsured. We are able to have college students stay on their parent's \ninsurance.\n  So I think when we look at what is happening, there are billions of \ndollars that they want to do away with in programs. And we can add to \nthat: the $185 billion from Federal college aid for low-income students \nor the $150 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \nor SNAP. Many of my constituents refer to that as their food stamps. \nAnd certainly, but for the Congressional Black Caucus, those members on \nthe Agriculture Committee, those Members in leadership fighting for us \nto restore those dollars, I think it is quite simple.\n\n[[Page H1793]]\n\n  I think what we are hearing tonight from our members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus is that they are trying to take us back in \nhistory. They are trying to take us back to an era of time, and we are \nnot going to let them do that. We have too much at stake. We have \ngained so much.\n  Someone may ask us tonight: Why are we here? Why are we the \nconscience of the Congress, Mr. Speaker? Why are we here tonight \ntalking about the road to ruin and destruction by not having a \ncongressional budget?\n  I think the facts speak for themselves. I think that the American \npublic needs to know that this is not something that just affects the \nCongressional Black Caucus. I want that to be clear. This affects \nAmerica.\n  You mentioned it with Mr. Clyburn's 10-20-30. The fact is more \nindividuals who don't look like members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus will benefit. And that is the difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans. We care about all people.\n  They profess to have hearings on poverty, and then when you look at \nthe results of their own budget and what they are doing to those \nindividuals who live in poverty--chuckle we may, clear our voice, Mr. \nSpeaker, as we may--the facts speak for themselves. They are not \ncreating programs that will help us eliminate poverty. And it is as \nsimple as that.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank you for laying that out. And I think history \ncan be judged by objective observers as it relates to fiscal \nresponsibility. But a few facts that perhaps some in the Chamber may \nhave had amnesia about, but maybe it bears going through.\n  Sequestration and painful budget cuts as it relates to the extreme \nagenda of some here in the Congress have been brought to us in a manner \nthat has cost us both jobs and the ability to experience accelerated \nfinancial growth.\n  We saw in the aftermath of a severe economic shock the approach that \nwas taken by our friends over in Europe of extreme austerity did not \nbear financial fruit. It was the stimulus package that was put forth--\nwith not a single vote from anyone on the other side of the aisle--that \nwas actually the financially responsible approach taken to help deal \nwith the train wreck that President Obama inherited and to get the \neconomy back on track.\n  But, of course, the objective from the very beginning--not my words, \nbut the words of the Senate majority leader on the other side of the \nCapitol--was to make the President a one-term President.\n  I just don't even understand the philosophy of a President who takes \noffice, inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression, and the \nnumber one agenda is to make sure that he is a one-term President. But \nthat was an unsuccessful political endeavor. He gets a second term.\n  The first thing that some of my good friends on the other side of the \naisle decide to do, as we approach the end of the fiscal year in 2013, \nwas to shut down the government for 16 days. It cost us $24 billion in \nlost economic productivity. That is not hyperbole. Those are facts.\n\n  And what was it all for?\n  Because there is this obsession--perhaps clinical in nature--with the \nAffordable Care Act. This is why we voted more than 50 times to destroy \nit, defeat it, delay it, and do everything possible to stop it.\n  What could be possibly wrong with making sure that preexisting \nconditions don't prevent someone here in the greatest country in the \nhistory of the world from being able to get adequate medical care? What \nis wrong with more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans \nactually having health care?\n  Yet, in the budget that apparently is not extreme enough, we would \ntake away the Affordable Care Act.\n  So these are just some of the facts. I wish we had some more time to \nexplore it. That is not hyperbole. Historians will judge this \nPresidency and this Congress. I, of course, am of the belief that many \nwill conclude that this is a Congress that has majored in obstruction, \nminored in dysfunction, and done everything possible to pursue a degree \nin legislative malpractice to the detriment of the American people. And \nI am hopeful that we can just get back on track and try to find common \nground to do the business of the American people, which is why each and \nevery one of us was sent here to the people's House.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Republican \ncontrolled House has once again missed a key deadline when it failed to \npass a budget resolution before April 15. Despite promises to the \ncontrary, House Speaker Paul Ryan has been unable to bring a budget \nresolution to the floor in a timely fashion. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Completing a budget resolution is an important step in the budget \nprocess that will lay out Congress' spending priorities and create a \nunified vision for a more prosperous nation. While Democrats have \nendeavored to work cooperatively with Republicans to pass a \ncomprehensive budget resolution, Speaker Ryan has insisted on pushing a \nbudget that divides our country while further slashing critical \ninvestments aimed at strengthening our economy. The Republican budget \nreflects the needs of only a select few instead of the views and \npriorities of every American and places the burden of deficit reduction \nsquarely on the backs of middle and working class Americans.\n  It is clear that our most vulnerable segments of the population--the \nelderly, minorities, low-income earners, and others--have been most \nimpacted by the Great Recession. Yet this latest Republican budget \nresolution continues to reflect the failed economic worldview that \nwealth will trickle down when we give massive tax breaks to the \nwealthy. Time and time again, history has demonstrated that this is \nsimply untrue.\n  It is unfortunate that the Republican-controlled Congress today is \nsubjecting millions of hard-working families to even greater pressures \nto work longer hours for less pay, while we continue to prop up the \nwealthiest earners and biggest corporations with tax breaks and other \nloopholes. The Republican budget exemplifies these principles and \ndrives the wedge deeper between the wealthy and our most vulnerable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe our nation is on a dangerous path under this \nRepublican leadership. Congress should be working to create jobs and \nincrease pay for hard-working American families, not giving additional \ntax breaks to the wealthy and cutting spending for key social programs \nThe Republicans have long abandoned their commitment to pass a budget \nresolution that reflects the needs of all Americans. Thus, I am \nstrongly urging my colleagues to support fiscally sound and morally \nresponsible budget alternatives that will create a level playing field \nand new opportunities for every American.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The Chair would remind \nMembers that remarks in debate may not engage in personalities toward \nthe President, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would \nbe improper if spoken in the Member's own words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1793-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1793-H1797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RESTORING ARTICLE I CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO CONGRESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nYoho) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on this \nevening's Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, if Congress does not assert its constitutional \nauthority, we risk becoming obsolete in the eyes of an Executive that \nwould prefer to legislate with a phone and a pen as a replacement for \nthis body.\n  Thank you to all my colleagues who join me this evening, and may God \nbless America.\n  Every day, before Members of Congress meet to conduct official \nbusiness, we gather to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the United \nStates of America. We place our right hand over our hearts and promise \nto our colleagues, our constituents, and all Americans that we will \nuphold the rule of law.\n  This very law is the very vehicle that has ensured liberty and \njustice for all even being a possibility: the rule of law. \nUnfortunately, this administration seems intent on operating outside \nthe rule of law. It insists upon circumventing Congress by changing \nlaws and legislating from the Oval Office, not from Capitol Hill.\n  Time and again, the American people have had to bear witness to the \nblatant disrespect this administration has for\n\n[[Page H1794]]\n\nour Constitution. In my heart, I believe this disrespect is on full \ndisplay in the embattled fight Congress and the American people find \nthemselves in today with the executive branch at the Supreme Court.\n  This morning, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the United \nStates v. Texas case, including 25 other States. To some, this case is \nsimply an argument over whether or not you are pro-illegal immigration. \nLet me repeat that. You are pro-illegal immigration or not. To others, \nthis case is about keeping families together. To many, like myself, it \nis about protecting the dignity of our Constitution and the balance of \npowers within the three branches of government.\n  The United States v. Texas is about the rule of law and defending the \nintegrity of our great institution of government. We are a \nconstitutional Republic. And yet, the President's mass deferred action \non deportation of individuals residing within our country illegally \nwould make it seem more like we are living in a dictatorship.\n  The Constitution is clear on the issues of legislation. Article I, \nsection 1 explicitly states: ``All legislative powers herein granted \nshall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist \nof a Senate and a House of Representatives.''\n  Let that sink in for a moment. ``All legislative powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall \nconsist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''\n  Article I, section 8, clause 4: ``to establish a uniform rule of \nnaturalization.'' That is solely the responsibility of this body. Take \nnotice of the absence of any reference to the executive office, \nexecutive branch, or judicial branch.\n  Article II, section 3, however, states that the President ``shall \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' It is referred to as \nthe Take Care Clause. That the laws be faithfully executed, not \nestablished, not rewritten, not selectively enforce portions of law, \nbut to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  That power is still delegated to Congress just as it was over two \ncenturies ago.\n  If the Supreme Court upholds the administrative executive action, I \nfear that our Republic--that is the United States--will die. We will \nsee an end of a Nation that started by fending off tyranny. We will see \nthe end of a Nation which has withstood a civil war, two world wars, \nand countless terrorist attacks.\n  Terrorists hate the United States simply because of the manner \nthrough which we have prospered under the freedoms enshrined in the \nConstitution.\n  Again, the success of our Nation is because we are a land and a \nNation of laws. I urge all of my colleagues in the House and the Senate \nto not falter in their defense of the founding principles upon which \nthis great Nation was built.\n  Interesting, today, at the Supreme Court, I was there to speak on \nthese very topics. Many pro-illegal immigrants were present, and I \nfound it very interesting they were shouting, demonstrating, exercising \nfreedom of speech, freedom of speech and demonstrating in America, \nsimply because we have a Constitution that protects that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat), my \ngood friend and colleague.\n  Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss the case being heard \nbefore the Supreme Court, United States v. Texas, and the President's \nunconstitutional executive actions on immigration and the need for the \nrestoration of the balance of powers between the branches of \ngovernment. This case is the challenge to President Obama's executive \nactions for illegal immigrants, the so-called Deferred Action for \nParents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, otherwise known as \nDAPA, an expansion of the earlier Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals, otherwise known as DACA. The lawsuit was brought by Governors \nand attorneys general from the Texas Supreme Court and 25 other States. \nThat is significant, in and of itself.\n  Under these unconstitutional programs, President Obama claims the \nright to, by executive fiat, make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully \npresent.'' Let me say that again real slow. The President claims, by \nright, by executive fiat, to make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully \npresent'' in the United States and eligible to receive a work permit \nafter an application is reviewed and a fee is paid. This is straight \nout of ``1984.''\n  The language is upside down. The government is handing out work \npermits and making illegal immigrants eligible to work in the United \nStates as well as receive Social Security, unemployment, and disability \nbenefits. But this only hurts American citizens and taxpayers.\n  What has Congress done about this? Not enough.\n  The real issue in this case is not discretion, but whether or not \nthere is any limit at all on Presidential power.\n  The Founders recognized these distinctions, and they made Congress \nthe first branch among equals of the Federal Government and the most \naccountable branch to the American people--and thus, Article I, not II. \nThe Congress is Article I.\n  The Founders created a system of checks and balances to ensure no \nindividual could gain absolute power within the government without a \ncheck, not even George Washington, whom they all loved.\n  Under our Constitution, the Congress is entrusted with ``all \nlegislative powers''--all, including the power ``to establish a uniform \nrule of naturalization.''\n  The Founders drafted the Constitution to clearly state that it is not \nthe President who writes the laws; Congress does. Much of the \nPresident's job is to faithfully execute these laws passed by Congress. \nIn fact, neither any immigration law nor the Constitution empowers the \nExecutive to authorize, let alone facilitate, the violation of the laws \npassed by Congress. The President even acknowledged this 22 times on TV \nbefore using his pen and phone to act alone without Congress.\n  This imbalance of powers is a threat to self-government itself. Our \ninaction, time and again, has expanded the administrative state and \nleft the American people without a voice in Washington. The \nPresidential elections on both sides of the aisle are making this \nabundantly clear.\n  For starters, we can advocate for reforms in four principled areas: \nreclaiming Congress' power of the purse, reforming executive-empowering \nlegislative ``cliffs,'' restoring congressional authority over \nregulations and regulators, and reining in executive discretion.\n  I have sponsored simple legislation to do just that: return power \nback to Congress. I introduced a bill to reform this process with the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, the primary agency \nfor implementing the President's immigration executive order.\n  USCIS funds itself through application fees, which insulates it from \nthe will of the American people as expressed through their \nRepresentatives in Congress. Congress cannot effectively exercise its \npowers through the appropriations process to perform basic oversight \nfunctions and ensure the agency is executing the laws faithfully.\n  My proposal, the Use Spending for Congressional Immigration \nSupervision, USCIS, Act, will make unaccountable agencies like the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services accountable to Congress and, \ntherefore, accountable to the American people. Putting USCIS on \nappropriations ensures that unelected bureaucrats are held accountable \nand provides transparency for how the Federal Government is raising and \nspending your money.\n  Congress needs to reassert its power of the purse by making agency \nbudgets subject to appropriations, but we cannot stop there. There is \nmore Congress has to do to restore Congress' power to hold the \nexecutive branch accountable. The Constitution still gives Congress all \nits powers. It is up to Congress to step up and start using them.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Florida for organizing \nthis Special Order, for his leadership, for his constitutional \nconvictions, and for the opportunity to address you tonight, Mr. \nSpeaker, here on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page H1795]]\n\n  I am listening to this dialogue that is taking place here on the \nfloor, and this thought occurred to me that, several years ago, our \nborders are so open and our borders are so porous, and we have a \nPresident who has refused to enforce the law. In fact, he sends the \nmessage through his executive branch, if you are determined to enforce \nthe law and you are a member of the Border Patrol, you had better find \nanother job. I mean, that came out of the President and his leadership \nteam all the way on down to our Border Patrol agents.\n  I have been down to the border a good number of times, and I have \nwatched as people come across the border in broad daylight, float \nacross there in a raft. They get unloaded, stand there on the grass on \nour side of the river, and wait for the Border Patrol to come down with \na welcome wagon and say: Would you like to apply for asylum?\n  And, by the way, one of them was a pregnant lady, and so I am sure by \nnow she has her asylum, or at least that baby is an American citizen.\n  Our borders are so porous that, in order to illustrate how bad they \nare, we had James O'Keefe, who went down and put on an Osama bin Laden \nmask and walked across the border. Nobody bothered him.\n  There was another individual that thought: I will make a bigger show \nof it. I will hire a mariachi band, and he rode a circus elephant \nacross the Rio Grande River. That is how bad our border is.\n  Now, here is how bad our law and our Constitution are. The mariachi \nband was serenading the Supreme Court today, Mr. Speaker, to try to \nconvince them that we ought to see the Supreme Court rewrite law that \nCongress has written, that has been signed by a previous President, and \nevery President since then has taken the oath to take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed, to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  This constitutional balance that we have has seen a Supreme Court \nrewrite ObamaCare. So now they have the audacity to rewrite the law, \nand they are the ones that are deciding today, with eight Justices, \nsadly--sadly, not 9--as to whether or not the President of the United \nStates can do what the Supreme Court did, in other words, rewrite the \nlaw.\n  The President of the United States, 22 times, as the previous \nspeaker, Mr. Brat, said, told America he doesn't have the \nconstitutional authority to grant the amnesty, the executive amnesty \nthat he did, whether it be DACA or whether it be DAPA. But then, after \nhe deliberated for awhile, he checked his conscience. That didn't \nbother him. We shouldn't be amazed at that, Mr. Speaker. He already \nknew the Constitution. He lectured it to us. But what he checked was \nhis politics, and his question was: Can he get away with it? Is there \nan enforcement capacity that could stop him?\n  Well, he hadn't met yet Judge Hanen in Texas who, if these Justices \nin the Supreme Court deadlock 4-4, the President's executive amnesty, \nat least for DAPA, is going to be stalled for the duration of his \nadministration.\n  And so this prosecutorial discretion argument before the Court today \nthat the Obama administration very well knew was the center of this \ncase--and that prosecutorial discretion can be conferred on an \nindividual basis only. That was the testimony of Janet Napolitano; and \nin the first Morton memo document, there were multiple references to an \nindividual basis only. Her testimony was an individual basis only. But \neven the first document set out four categories, groups of people, whom \nthe law would be waived for, and that is what we are talking about \nhere.\n  Who writes the law? If the President writes the law, how could we \nwrite one that would restrain this President that is out of line? Let's \npreserve our Constitution, and let's look forward to an appointment to \nthe Supreme Court that actually means it when they take their oath as \nwe do ours.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from Iowa for such great remarks and \nyour passion and your leadership. It was great to see you in front of \nthe Supreme Court today speaking passionately about this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from the great State of South \nCarolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for doing this. I \nthink it is such an important issue.\n  I think that, as has been mentioned by a couple of speakers now, what \nis really at play here is a constitutional issue. The Founding Fathers \nwere so emphatically clear that there were to be three different pieces \nof pie. There was to be an executive branch that administered the law, \na legislative branch that created it, and a judicial branch that \ninterpreted it.\n  There is this amazing reservoir of common sense that exists out there \nwith the American public. So what people told me back home is this is \nnot about being against somebody from some other place. This is not \nabout being against Hispanics. This is, in fact, about the rule of law \nand a system that our Founding Fathers gave us more than 200 years ago \nand how we preserve it. And how we preserve it is by actually sticking \nto it. Ultimately, the issue has less to do with immigration than it \ndoes to do with this larger notion of common sense and rule of law.\n  I would also stress the common sense part. I remember back in the \nO.J. Simpson trial, there was this whole notion of, if the glove \ndoesn't fit, you can't acquit. In this case, the glove doesn't fit from \nthe standpoint of common sense.\n  I actually had my staff pull up a couple of numbers this afternoon, \nand I think that they are fascinating, and here is what I mean by that. \nThe numbers don't fit with the scale of every other amnesty that has \nbeen done for more than the last 50 years.\n  Think about this. The amnesties that this President has proposed, in \ntotal, are about 5\\1/2\\ million people. That is more than all of the \ncumulative amnesties for the last 53 years, going back all the way to \nthe time of Eisenhower. In fact, the average amnesty was about 32,000 \npeople in size.\n\n  We have all always been a Nation that has been welcoming; we have \nincluded other people. So if you look back at the El Salvadorans that \nClinton and Bush allowed in, based on civic conflict and real civil war \ndown that way, if you look at the Persian Gulf evacuees, if you look at \nthe--my eyesight is getting so bad, I need to get glasses. If you look \nat the Chinese, after Tiananmen Square, if you were to look at Soviet \nrefugees, if you look at the Ethiopians, the Lithuanians, even going \nback to the war orphans at the time of Eisenhower, there has been a \nremarkable case when amnesties were judged okay by this Congress, okay \nby the American people, okay by the President because of scale, 32,000 \npeople, on average, per amnesty, for 53 years.\n  Again, this President's amnesty dwarfs the total amnesties of all \nPresidents over the last 53 years, and, for that reason, the American \npublic has reacted as it has saying this just doesn't fit.\n  The other thing that I think is interesting, going back to the notion \nof sheer scale and the ways in which this particular amnesty that the \nPresident has proposed is at odds with every other for the last 53 \nyears, is, if you were to add up the cumulative amnesties of this \nPresident, you would be in the top 20 States in the United States of \nAmerica--5.5 million people. That is well above the population of South \nCarolina; it is well above the population of Alabama. Or go down about \nanother 30 States, wherein you would have a de facto new State added \nthat would be more than midway in the graph of all States in this \ncountry. It doesn't fit.\n  A third point that I would make, and I think this is a fascinating \none that my staff pulled, is that if you look at all those amnesties I \nwas just talking about over the last 53 years, they have really fallen \ninto a couple of baskets, the one big amnesty being back in 1986 which, \nultimately, went through this Congress. It was, in fact, as a \nconsequence of the act of Congress and the will of the American public. \nThat was a big one. But the other one was the Adjustment Act of 1966, \nwhich goes back to the plight of the Cuban people and trying to do \nsomething about that.\n  The other one has been a basket of natural disaster, of political \nstrife, of family reunification. That has been a basket. And then there \nhas been a basket for refugees. But never before have we had a basket \nthat was about a political objective as opposed to a reaction\n\n[[Page H1796]]\n\nto an external event. We have had a long list of external events over \n53 years that is at odds with what we see taking place.\n  So not only is this important from the standpoint of the Constitution \nand the rule of law, as has been so eloquently stated thus far, it is \nsomething that doesn't fit common sense from the standpoint of scale.\n  And there is one last point. There is a financial cost to this. The \nCato Institute estimated that you are looking at about $14,000 per \nhousehold. If you multiply that times the number of refugees that the \nPresident is talking about here, you are looking at about $19 billion \nin cost. That is about two-thirds of the dustup we have had over the \nbudget. You are talking about $30 billion. Is the number 1070 or 1040? \nA $30 billion difference. In this case, two-thirds of that total would \nbe taken care of just with this question of amnesty that is before us \ntonight which you, again, have brought, and I very, very much \nappreciate you doing so.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from the great State of South Carolina \nfor those--I mean, those are great numbers that really illustrate the \nsignificance and the large amount of numbers that we are dealing with.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Arizona, Dr. \nPaul Gosar.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) \nfor his leadership on this issue and for organizing this Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken many times right here on the House Floor \nabout upholding the rule of law. Whether it be about a lawless Attorney \nGeneral who tried to cover up a gunrunning operation, or a rogue IRS \nDirector illegally targeting innocent Americans, or a President \nattempting to enact amnesty by executive action, ensuring that the \nFederal Government is held accountable for its lawlessness has been one \nof my top priorities as an elected Representative to the people's \nHouse. And while the concept of equal application of the law may not \nseem like it needs any explanation, I would like to speak to the heart \nof why upholding the rule of law is so fundamental.\n  Our laws seek to incentivize Americans to behave responsibly and to \nimpose consequences when they don't. This is the fundamental contract \nwoven into the fabric of our Republic. It is a concept envisioned by \nour Founding Fathers, not only to protect the individual rights of \nevery man, woman, and child, but also to prohibit executive overreach \nfrom an intrusive Federal Government.\n  Former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis captured these principles \nbest when he stated: ``In a government of laws, existence of the \ngovernment will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law \nscrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. \nFor good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime \nis contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds \ncontempt for the law; it invites every man to become a law unto \nhimself; it invites anarchy.''\n  Sadly, we are witnessing what happens when the Federal Government \nbecomes a lawbreaker and breeds contempt for the law--anarchy. The \nObama administration has created an immigration crisis as a result of \nits failure to enforce Federal immigration laws on the books.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported just last \nweek that 2016 could set another record for the number of unaccompanied \nalien children crossing our southern border, and that from 2011 to \n2014, unaccompanied alien children increased by 1,200 percent. Also \nlast week, 1,000 Cuban aliens stormed the Costa Rica-Panama border \ndemanding to pass so they could continue their journey to enter the \nUnited States illegally.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress clear \njurisdiction on immigration matters, and President Obama's executive \nactions on immigration clearly infringe on that authority. The \nPresident even admitted that fact 22 times previously when he stated he \ndid not have the authority to take the executive actions he ultimately \nended up taking.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Justice Kennedy rightfully pointed out today that DAPA is a \nlegislative act, not an administrative act. Thus, its creation is \nunconstitutional, and the Supreme Court should uphold the lower court's \nruling that halted Obama's illegal actions.\n  What incentive do Americans have to follow the rule of law themselves \nif they have no faith that their government will do the same? How can \nlawmakers ask immigrants seeking to migrate lawfully to our country to \nfollow these rules when this President so blatantly violates those same \nrules?\n  Unfortunately, if we don't take bold action now to hold the President \naccountable for his lawlessness, we risk permanently damaging the \nintegrity of all our laws beyond all repair.\n  The good news is there is a solution. The House must utilize our \npower of the purse to block any and all funding for the President's \nexecutive amnesty orders.\n  I am attempting to do just that and recently spearheaded an \nappropriations rider supported by 35 of my colleagues to block funding \nfor all executive actions on immigration dating back to 2011.\n  Returning to the rule of law begins with the House enforcing its own \nconstitutional power of the purse. We must fundamentally reject the \nPresident's legacy of lawlessness and renew the faith that we all place \nin the rule of law.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague for such wise words of wisdom.\n  At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of \nColorado, Mr. Ken Buck.\n  Mr. BUCK. I thank the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration somehow missed the class in \ncivics about separation of powers, checks and balances, and so many \nother issues from our Constitution. Thankfully, the Supreme Court can \noffer some remedial education when it decides the case United States v. \nTexas.\n  The facts of the case are simple. The President's executive action on \nimmigration is downright illegal. He bypassed Congress, even though the \nConstitution explicitly states that the legislative branch has the \npower to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.\n  This administration uses the excuse of prosecutorial discretion. As a \nprosecutor for 25 years, I can tell you this isn't true. When his \nexecutive order creates a new special class for millions of people in \nthe United States, this isn't a case-by-case use of discretion. It is a \nblanket rulemaking, and it is rulemaking that directly contradicts the \nwishes of Congress.\n  All three branches of government agree that these actions are \nillegal. Courts have already issued an injunction against the rule.\n  Congress submitted a friend-of-the-court brief highlighting its \nproper role, and the President himself knows it would be \nunconstitutional to bypass Congress and create his own immigration \nlaws. He said so many times. For some reason, he still went ahead and \nissued the executive order.\n  Real people feel real consequences when we put the Constitution \nthrough the paper shredder. The President's actions will lead to \ndevastating new costs for States. Our healthcare system, our judicial \nand law enforcement systems, and our education system will all be \nstrained as they try to accommodate the President's unconstitutional \norders.\n  The judicial branch has a chance to stand up to executive overreach \nin this case and reassert congressional power. I hope the Court rules \ncorrectly because the fate of the Republic hangs in the balance.\n  Mr. YOHO. Words spoken so true, and I appreciate that. The \nConstitution and the sovereignty of this Nation is what is at stake \nhere, along with the institution itself.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, Mr. Jody B. Hice from the \nState of Georgia.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I am grateful to my colleague from \nFlorida for yielding this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, today the United States Supreme Court heard oral \narguments on what certainly has every potential of being one of the \nmost important cases of our time. Of course, we are talking about a \ncase involving an unprecedented and inexplicable expansion of powers by \nthe President.\n  We all remember in November 2014 when President Obama, fresh from, I \nmight add, losing midterm elections, announced his executive decision \nto\n\n[[Page H1797]]\n\ngrant amnesty to some 5 million illegal immigrants.\n  Immediately 26 States, my home State of Georgia being one of them, \nquickly moved to challenge this President's decision in the courts.\n  Those States rightly and correctly argued that they were being forced \nby the Federal Government to bear the costly burden of this President's \nabuse of power.\n  So after months of legal wrangling in the lower courts, now we watch \nUnited States v. Texas being considered in the High Court.\n  We watched this being put on in the Supreme Court, and I am hopeful, \nas many of my colleagues, all of us here tonight, that the rulings from \nthe lower courts will stand and that, ultimately, this President's \nexecutive amnesty will be ruled for what it is, a clear violation of \nthe Constitution.\n  That is what we are dealing with tonight, a violation of the \nConstitution, specifically article II, section 3, the faithful \nexecution clause.\n  Many ask: What is that? Basically, that clause requires the President \nto enforce the laws of the land. Is it too much to ask for the \nPresident to enforce the laws of the land as written by Congress and \ninterpreted by the courts?\n  This President has turned that upside down. He has turned our \nConstitution on its head with his own legislative policies from the \nexecutive office and the abuse of executive authority.\n  Many of us here have voted multiple times to oppose many of the \nPresident's unconstitutional actions, and I have cosponsored many bills \ntrying to deal specifically with his planned amnesty program.\n  Going forward, now we have the Supreme Court case before us, and we \nall hope that they will see that what the President has done is a \ndirect, gross violation of our Constitution.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend from Florida, Congressman Yoho, for \nputting together this Special Order.\n  Mr. YOHO. I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia for \nparticipating.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, our institution of law is threatened more \ntoday than ever before. All evil or tyranny needs to succeed or for a \nconstitutional republic to fail is for good men and women to be \ncomplacent and do nothing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1797-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1797-H1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ISSUES OF THE DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends, as led by our \nfriend, Congressman Ted Yoho from Florida, and our friend from Georgia, \nBrother Hice. We heard great comments from Dr. Gosar and our friend, \nSteve King, from Iowa.\n  These are deeply troubling times, and the Supreme Court taking up \nUnited States v. Texas really accentuates that issue. Sometimes it is \nnice to just pause and pay tribute to folks, for example, a beautiful \ncouple here.\n  It is a pastor. His name is Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon and his \nwife, Maria Sabillon. They are with their granddaughter in this \npicture. They are a beautiful couple. You can feel the love emanating \nfrom the picture.\n  Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon was a Baptist minister at Nuevo \nAmanecer Baptist Church of Houston in the Cloverleaf area. He was an \nexcellent carpenter. He owned a home remodeling business, J J & Sons \nRemodeling. His wife, Maria,--you can tell she loves her \ngranddaughter--was a retired home caregiver for children with special \nneeds. They were a beautiful couple.\n  Mr. Sabillon never accepted a salary from the church and instead \nrelied upon his job as a carpenter to feed his family. So it appears \nthat Pastor Sabillon was working and acting in the vein of the Apostles \nPeter and Paul. Particularly Paul didn't want to be a burden to others. \nSo he made tents, sewed, and did whatever he needed to so that he \nwasn't a burden to others.\n  Instead of being a burden to others, Pastor Sabillon and his wife, \nMaria, were a blessing to Texas. They were a blessing to the Houston \narea and to so many whom they helped, the special needs kids that Maria \nhelped with.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  It appears that Jesse, Pastor Sabillon, was doing what Jesus said to \ndo, to be a light to others, to be salt to the world, to administer to \nothers' needs, or as Jesus told Peter, ``If you love me, you will tend \nmy flock.'' Well, Pastor Sabillon did that and, apparently, did that \nvery well.\n  This story, April 15: ``Alexis De Larosa Sosa, 21, is a Mexican \nnational who entered the United States illegally, HCSO''--apparently \nHarris County Sheriff's Office--``public information officer Ryan \nSullivan confirmed in a phone interview with Breitbart Texas.\n  ``His intake''--by this he means, Alexis De Larosa Sosa--``form says: \nU.S. citizen, no; alien status, illegal . . . De Larosa Sosa was wanted \nin connection with a street racing crash where Pastor Jesse Estrada \nSabillon, and his wife, Maria Sabillon, were killed. The couple was \ndriving home Tuesday night after visiting their niece who had just \ngiven birth to a baby when they were struck by the truck.\n  ``The suspect is reported to have fled the scene following the crash \nand did not turn himself in until Friday morning about 10 a.m. local \ntime.\n  ``He was allegedly driving a 2006 Chevy pickup truck and was said to \nbe racing with a dark-colored Dodge Challenger or Charger, the Houston \nChronicle reported on Wednesday. The two vehicles were said to be \nracing along the Sam Houston Tollway feeder road when De Larosa Sosa is \nreported to have run a red light, striking the 2004 BMW 330 driven by \nSabillon. The couple were both pronounced dead at the scene of the \ncrash. De Larosa Sosa is said to have fled the scene on foot. The \ndriver of the Dodge fled the scene in his vehicle.\n  ``Officials with the Harris County Sheriff's Office quickly notified \nthe family of the pastor who expressed relief at the news,'' talking \nabout the apprehension of the suspect.\n  ``De Larosa Sosa is currently processing into the Harris County jail \nand has not yet made a court appearance. He is expected to be charged \nin connection with the two homicides and fleeing the scene of the fatal \naccident.''\n  We know there are some wonderful people who have come into this \ncountry illegally. There have been. But there is no question that \ncriminals have taken advantage of the situation to cross our border, \nsince it has been porous, and to inflict crime on people of the United \nStates. There should be little doubt about that.\n  And then we have this story from the Washington Free Beacon: ``Number \nof Children Illegally Crossing Border Up 1,200 Percent Between 2011 and \n2014.'' Ironically, it just happens to be, as people were finding out \nsouth of our border and in other parts of the world, that if you make \nit into the United States illegally, then you are probably going to \nstay. Odds are 97 percent you will stay.\n  As border patrolmen have told me, drug cartels across our southern \nborder call our Border Patrol, our Homeland Security, the logistics, \nand they laughingly say if they get people illegally into the country, \nthen Homeland Security is the logistics that ships them wherever they \nwant them to go in the country.\n  As I have seen a number of times in the middle of the night as people \nare being processed, and like, for example, the one older lady who was \nasked how much she paid, some would say $6,000, some would say $7,000, \n$5,000, or $8,000.\n  On a number of occasions, a border patrolman has challenged them: \nWhere did you get that kind of money? You don't have that kind of \nmoney.\n  It normally took repeated questioning to elicit an answer: Well, I \npaid $1,800 from family in this place, some people sent $2,000 from the \nUnited States, and I am going to pay the rest by working it off in the \nUnited States.\n  They tell them where they want to go. Amazingly, Homeland Security \nhas shipped people that have come into the country illegally all over \nthe country. We have reports about Mexican drug distribution in all of \nour major cities. When you know that Homeland Security is shipping \npeople that still owe the drug cartels money into different\n\n[[Page H1798]]\n\ncities, it is not hard to figure out how they are getting some of their \nless than happy workers helping them with their drug distribution.\n  This article from Adam Kredo says in this Washington Free Beacon: \n``The number of children apprehended on the U.S. border attempting to \nimmigrate illegally has surged more than 1,200 percent since 2011, and \nthe number of these children crossing the border during 2016 could be \nanother record, according to a newly released government report.\n  ``The number of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) illegally \ncrossing the U.S. border `has increased sharply' since 2011, with a \nsurge of more than 1,200 percent just between 2011 and 2014, according \nto the Congressional Research Service. The agency also disclosed that \nthe flow is increasing significantly in the first 5 months of fiscal \n2016.\n  ``The illegal immigration of these children hit record-breaking \nnumbers in 2014, with U.S. officials apprehending more than 52,000 \nalien children. Nearly 20,000 have been apprehended within the first 5 \nmonths of 2016, setting the stage for another potentially record-\nbreaking year.\n  `` `This unexpected surge of children strained U.S. Government \nresources and created a complex crisis of humanitarian implications,' \nthe report said. `They increased in the first 5 months of FY 2016, \nhowever, and experts warn that significant migration flows will \ncontinue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the \ninternational community address the poor socioeconomic and security \nconditions driving Central Americans to leave their homes.' ''\n  That is interesting, but I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that actually \nthey will continue to surge as long as they are led to believe by the \nadministration, and the evidence continues to indicate, that they will \nbe allowed to stay in America, we will send them where they may claim \nto have relatives or where the drug cartels tell them to request to be \nsent.\n  Just in the last few weeks, spending some days and nights on our \nborder, our southern border, it is heartbreaking what you see because \nthere are people that clearly want a better way of life. They are \nleaving the country of origin because their countries do not enforce \nthe rule of law. There is graft, there is corruption, and the rule of \nlaw, the law is not evenly and fairly supported and enforced across the \nboard. Therefore, the jobs aren't there.\n  There are more opportunities here in the United States. Although we \nhave breakdowns, we do try to enforce the law more evenly than, I would \nsubmit, anywhere in the world, at least until more recently when this \nadministration makes exceptions of millions of people who are assured \nthat they can violate the law with impunity and will be awarded for it.\n  People come from countries where there is no equality under the law \nand they come to this country, as soon as they get here, for those of \nus that were out in front of the Supreme Court today, being shouted \ndown by people who are angry, many of them shouting in Spanish--fine--\nbut we were told that people in their positions were all in the \nshadows.\n  Now, I did see some people lounging around under a few trees, but \nmost of them were not in the shadows. They were, in fact, on the steps \nof the Supreme Court right there in front yelling and screaming and \nshowing disrespect for the U.S. national anthem and yelling, trying to \nprevent freedom of speech.\n  It is just really interesting, seeing posters like ``Jesus was an \nimmigrant.'' Well, sort of, but he never violated the law. He never \nencouraged anyone else to violate the law. In fact, he urged people to \ngo forth and do wrong no more, but that is not the case.\n  The great and really tragic irony of what is taking place is people \ncoming to America illegally demanding that the laws not be properly \nenforced, not be fairly enforced. Sure, there have been millions and \nmillions and millions and millions of Americans who have come through \nour system legally, but we are the millions that did not come legally \nand we demand to have the same treatment as if we did come legally.\n  If we do that, it will not be long before we will be in the same \nshape as the countries these people fled from because there is not \nadequate opportunities. Since there is not adequate room for the \nbillion or so that we have been told may want to come to America around \nthe world, it would be far better to encourage their nations to end \ngraft and corruption, to treat people fairly across the board.\n  Here is an article from the Center for Immigration Studies. It says: \n``The criminal aliens released by ICE in these years, who had already \nbeen convicted of thousands of crimes, are responsible for a \nsignificant crime spree in American communities, including 124 aliens \ncharged with 135 new homicides. Inexplicably, ICE is choosing to \nrelease some criminal aliens multiple times.''\n  These are people that not only came into the country illegally, but \nhave committed crimes multiple times, many of them, while they are \nhere. At least they have certainly been charged with them.\n  ``A total of 121 criminal aliens who were freed by ICE over the 5-\nyear period between 2010 and 2014 were subsequently charged with \nhomicide-related crimes within that time frame. Three more were charged \nin 2015. These 121 accused murderers were associated with 250 different \ncommunities in the United States, with the most clustered in \nCalifornia, New York, and Texas.\n  ``These aliens were charged with a total of 135 homicide-related \ncrimes after release. Two of them had homicide-related convictions even \nbefore they were released. These aliens had 464 criminal convictions \nprior to release by ICE.\n  ``Another three aliens who were released by ICE during that time were \ncharged with homicides during the first 10 months of FY 2015 . . . this \ntally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary \njurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law \nenforcement agencies after ICE declined to take them into custody due \nto Obama administration prioritization policies. This list includes \nonly those aliens that ICE arrested and then released.''\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  ``The names of the criminal aliens were redacted by the Judiciary \nCommittee, but the list presumably includes murderers like Apolinar \nAltamirano, an illegal alien who was arrested by ICE in 2013 following \nhis conviction on local charges involving a burglary and abduction, but \nwho was released on a $10,000 bond and permitted to remain free and \nelect to have deportation proceedings that would take years to \ncomplete. In January 2015, Altamirano shot and killed 21-year-old Grant \nRonnebeck while he was working at a convenience store where Altamirano \nhad come to buy cigarettes.\n  ``ICE has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal \ncriminal aliens were released due to court orders, including the so-\ncalled Zadvydas cases in which the aliens' home countries would not \ntake them back. The rest were released by ICE's choice.''\n  The article also points out: ``In 2014, ICE released a total of \n30,558 criminal aliens from its custody. These aliens had already been \nconvicted of 92,347 crimes before they were released by ICE.\n  ``As of July 25, 2015, a total of 1,895 aliens have been charged with \na crime after being freed by ICE.\n  ``In a separate communication, ICE provided a list of countries that \ncurrently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens: \nAfghanistan, Algeria, Burundi, Cape Verde, China, Cuba, Eritrea, \nGambia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Libya, \nMali, Mauritania, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, and \nZimbabwe.''\n  We have the power to force these countries to either take back their \ncitizens who have come illegally into this country or who are illegally \nin this country--particularly if they have committed crimes in this \ncountry--or have consequences. Instead, this administration chooses to \nprovide benefits to countries like Iran and Afghanistan. For goodness \nsake. Make sure they are running Christians and Jews out of \nAfghanistan, but shouldn't they at least take back their own people?\n  I was told by one of the leaders in Afghanistan--this is a few years \nago--that their budget was around $12 billion a year. They only \nprovided about\n\n[[Page H1799]]\n\n$1.5 billion. All the rest came from other countries, and most of that \nwas from the United States. If they won't take their people back, then \nshut the government down. They will take their people back. This is \nridiculous.\n  Also, an important point was made in this article.\n  ``As of July 25, 2015, only about 3 percent of the 30,558 criminal \naliens freed by ICE in 2014 have been removed . . . ICE reports that \n28,017 still had a pending immigration case as of July 25, 2015,'' but \nsome of them don't show up for their hearings. Many don't. The largest \npercentage do not. They are just given notices to appear.\n  ``Recent National Gang Unit-led operations include--'' and this is \nfrom a different article, from the article: ``ICE Arrests More Than \n1,100 in Operation Targeting Gangs.'' It talks about all of the efforts \nto capture gangs. Let's see. ``Of the 1,133 arrests, 915 were gang \nmembers and associates; 1,001 were charged with criminal offenses; and \n132 were arrested . . .'' It is just more and more numbers of drugs, \nfirearms, currency. Again, about 3 percent, apparently, is all they are \nremoving of those who are committing crimes in the country.\n  Jessica Vaughan, from a year ago, had an article from May 28: ``The \nNon-Deported: ICE Still Releasing Criminal Aliens at a Rapid Pace.''\n  She documents, according to this article: ``The majority of convicted \ncriminal releases occurred because of Obama administration policies \nthat require ICE officers to let the offenders go. In some cases, \njudges will allow aliens to be released after a bond hearing, but the \nconditions are usually set by ICE, and ICE attorneys say that they have \nbeen instructed not to vigorously contest an alien's request for \nrelease,'' which brings us back to the Sabillons. My Christian brother \nand my Christian sister are gone; and we don't enforce our immigration \nlaws as the oath taken by those in this administration require.\n  I want to finish up by mentioning again about my being on the border. \nI was so struck. Texas has utilized and provided massive amounts of \nmoney to try to help us defend our border. The number one area through \nwhich people are coming into the United States moved some years back \nfrom Arizona to the McAllen corridor into Texas. I had occasion to be \non a DPS boat with fantastic DPS officers. They had fantastic equipment \nthat they were able to utilize to spot people who were clearly getting \nready--behind bushes and whatnot--to cross the Rio Grande, from the \nMexico side, into the U.S. It appeared, clearly, that some of them were \njust people who were going to be brought across, and some were carrying \nthings. Maybe they were drugs. We don't really know.\n  After we had spotted these folks when we were cruising down the river \non the DPS boat--and there were a couple of Border Patrol boats that \nwere much smaller, and there were other assets that allowed them to \nfocus once we identified where these people were so that the Federal \nBorder Patrol would know--and after we stayed silent for a while, we \nfinally got a radio message from the Border Patrol that asked us to go \nahead and return back to the dock way on down the river so that they \ncould try to intercept these folks. Fine, because I know, if the \nDepartment of Public Safety sees a raft coming across, they will stop \nthem. They do destroy the raft, which, as I understand, gets the coyote \nin trouble with the drug lord who sent him with the raft with people \nwho had paid money to get them across. So the DPS would do that.\n  They said: Why don't you go ahead. They are waiting for you to leave \nthe area. Then we can interdict. We can catch them red-handed.\n  It turns out that is exactly what they did. We spent massive amounts \nof money and effort in spotting people before they came across the \nriver illegally. Whether it was bringing drugs, whether it was people \ncoming across, we knew where they were. We spotted them, and we \ndirected the Border Patrol to them. I say ``we.'' It is our Department \nof Public Safety people in Texas. We got word: That is exactly what \nthey were waiting for. They came across after you left the area, and \nnow we are in-processing them into the United States.\n\n  We have the power to secure our border, but this administration has \nno will, and that is why unaccompanied children are up 1,200 percent. I \nhave seen tiny, little girls, who couldn't have been more than 3 or 4, \njust in the last trip down, in the days I spent down there. Girls like \nthem say: Oh, I am unaccompanied.\n  I guarantee you they did not cross that river unaccompanied. They did \nnot come 1,000 miles unaccompanied across Mexico. They were \naccompanied. Thank God they were not sold into sex trafficking as so \nmany have been.\n  When we in the United States, as I have been told by African \nfriends--some of whom I have seen in the last month--say we are the \nhope of the world and when we don't follow the law, when we don't \nenforce the law, when we don't enforce our own laws, the world suffers. \nAs Christians in Africa have told me: We know where we go when we die, \nbut our only hope of having a peaceful life is if America stays strong.\n  We haven't done that. Christians are now being persecuted in greater \nnumbers than ever in history. Jews are being persecuted again as if we \nare headed toward a new holocaust.\n  It is time for American leaders who have taken an oath to the United \nStates Constitution and to this country to realize: to whom much is \ngiven, from them much will be required. There is going to be a day of \njudgment on America if we don't rise to the occasion and use what we \nhave been blessed with.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1799-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Ms. Jackson Lee (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account \nof official business in the district.\n  Ms. Maxine Waters of California (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for \ntoday on account of unforeseen circumstances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/house-section/article/H1799-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 284.
