The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I learned that there would be \nno cost-of-living adjustment this year for those living on Social \nSecurity. Not only will Social Security recipients not see a cost-of-\nliving increase this year but, also, disabled veterans.\n  There are over 131,000 veterans on disability in North Carolina who \nwill be suffering this year. Our senior citizens and disabled veterans \nare having a difficult time making ends meet, and it is not fair that \nthe Federal Government continues to waste money with failed policies \nlike Afghanistan. It is disgraceful.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will be raising the debt ceiling of this Nation for \nyears to come because of wasteful spending. This means we will be \nborrowing more money to continue spending more than we take in. Our \nannual Federal deficit is still over $400 billion a year.\n  The American people are sick and tired of our wasteful spending, and \nI know they are frustrated. Once again, our failed policy in \nAfghanistan is a prime example of the waste, fraud, and abuse of the \nAmerican taxpayer dollar, but it continues on and on for years to come.\n  In the recent House-Senate conference bill, Congress included $38 \nbillion for the Overseas Contingency Operation, which is a slush fund \nused to get around sequestration spending caps for the Department of \nDefense.\n  We have already spent over $685 billion in Afghanistan since 2001, \nand according to the Congressional Budget Office, we will be spending \nat least $30 billion a year in Afghanistan for the next 8 years, and \nCongress has never debated the policy of Afghanistan.\n  This slush fund goes to fund our never-ending wars in Iraq, Syria, \nand Afghanistan. We continue to spend money on a fool's errand in the \nMiddle East. Meanwhile, our disabled veterans at home cannot keep up \nwith the rising costs of daily living. President Obama will be keeping \n10,000 troops in Afghanistan through all of next year and at least \n5,000 there after 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, years ago, I reached out to a former commandant of the \nMarine Corps whom I knew, and I asked him to give me his advice on \nAfghanistan. Many times he has given me his best advice, but one that \nhas stuck with me for years is this--and I quote the commandant:\n  ``What do we say to the mother and father . . . the wife . . . of the \nlast marine or soldier killed to support a corrupt government and \ncorrupt leader in a war that cannot be won?''\n  Mr. Speaker, that is Afghanistan. It is a waste.\n  How ridiculous it is that Congress and the administration think we \ncan change history. The history of Afghanistan has shown that no \noutside military force has ever changed it, from Alexander the Great, \nto the British, to the Russians. It is truly the graveyard of empires, \nand I hope we won't have a headstone there, waiting, that will read, \n``Welcome, America, to the graveyard of empires.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this poster beside me is a reminder of the cost of war \nin Afghanistan. There is a little girl holding her mother's hand as \nthey are waiting to follow a caisson down to bury the little girl's \nfather and the wife's husband.\n  Congress, wake up. We are heading for collapse in this country. Let's \nnot continue to spend and waste money, blood, and limbs in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform, \nto please bless the families of our men and women in uniform, and, God, \nplease bless America and please wake up the Congress before it is too \nlate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H6983-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6983-H6984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NURSING HOME ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Walker) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, we have a problem in making sure that all of \nour senior adult population is treated with the utmost respect and \nproper care.\n  HUD's Section 232 Program was intended to provide Federal loan \ninsurance for loans covering the needs of\n\n[[Page H6984]]\n\nnursing homes and other elder-care facilities. However, while HUD \nrequires these applicants to submit their latest quality ratings, which \nis a one-star to five-star rating from the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, or CMS, the quality rating is not a deciding factor.\n  This has allowed nursing homes that provide routinely poor care to \nreceive repeated taxpayer insurance loans. Among others, this is seen \nin the rise in the number and volume of one-star facilities that \nreceived HUD insurance each year from 2009 to 2012 but, also, in \nreports over two decades from GAO's and HUD's inspectors general.\n  Clearly, HUD's steps haven't gone far enough to provide real reform \nto ensure that taxpayer dollars do not go to nursing homes that \nconsistently provide poor care to our seniors and to our needy. We must \nensure that taxpayer support is going to nursing homes that provide \nquality care for their residents, not to facilities that provide \ncontinually deficient care.\n  By linking CMS' quality ratings to loan eligibility, the Nursing Home \nAccountability Act ensures that new federally backed loans go to \nnursing homes with a demonstrated commitment to quality care for their \nresidents.\n  Bottom line, what my bill states is this:\n  Under CMS' Five-Star Quality Rating System, if a nursing home \nreceives a rating of two stars or less for 30 consecutive months, the \nnursing home will then be ineligible for any future section 232 loans.\n  After a nursing home becomes ineligible for future section 232 loans \nunder this Act, it can become eligible once more for future loans if \nthe facility maintains a rating of three stars or more for 30 months.\n  Regarding ratings, all nursing homes receive a blank slate when this \nlaw is enacted, and HUD is allowed to continue to service previously \nissued loans under this law.\n  I would also like to say thanks to our local FOX affiliate for \nresearching the gross mismanagement of Federal funds and bringing a \ngreater awareness of this important matter.\n  Overall, I look forward to opening the national conversation of how \nwe can better focus this program on the quality of care provided to our \nseniors and to the needy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H6984-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the past 2 weeks in South \nCarolina have been inspiring as I learned and saw spontaneous acts of \nthoughtfulness and compassion for flood victims.\n  The thousand-year rain event was a disastrous collision of a weather \nfront from the west meeting a moisture-laden trough from the east \ncaused by Hurricane Joaquin bypassing the State, dumping 11 trillion \ngallons of water, inundating communities with rainfalls up to 26 inches \novernight. The volume was equal to filling the Rose Bowl over 130,000 \ntimes.\n  Governor Nikki Haley and National Guard Adjutant General Bob \nLivingston, backed up by the State Guard, have continued to lead \ndedicated personnel for safety and recovery. Colonel Kevin Shwedo will \nbe the recovery coordinator.\n  Individual acts of heroism arise daily, such as the courage of Frank \nRoddey, Ryan Truluck, Drew Bozard, and Zack Hudson, who were cited by \nThe State for rescuing, by boat, neighbors from their submerged Lake \nKatherine homes. Every church and school has energized volunteers and \nrelief efforts for families.\n  The Salvation Army thanked Mary and J.T. Gandolfo with Rich O'Dell \nfor raising over $141,000 in a WLTX telethon, with Columbia Rotary Club \nmembers receiving the calls.\n  Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson deserves praise for his \ndedicated FEMA personnel and SBA representatives implementing Federal \nassistance.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and the President by his actions \nshould never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H6984-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nNational Forest Products Week.\n  The forestry and wood product manufacturing industry support over \n44,000 jobs in the State of Georgia.\n  Over the past several years, many architects around the world have \ndemonstrated the successful application of next-generation lumber and \nmass-timber technologies. These new technologies are providing a new, \nsustainable solution for building safe, cost effective, and high-\nperforming buildings, most of the time in densely populated cities \naround the world.\n  By making forests sustainable and promoting wood product innovation, \nwe can ensure that the wood product industry will continue to be a \nsignificant employer throughout the United States. I encourage \ncontinued support of forest lands and support for strong wood product \nmarkets so we can keep this industry healthy for future generations.\n  I thank those in the forest product industry for your continued \ncontributions to our local economy, the State of Georgia, and the \nentire Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H6984-8", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6984-H6985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING STUDENTS AT MARVIN WARD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the students and \nfaculty at Marvin Ward Elementary School in Winston-Salem, North \nCarolina.\n  With news of the destructive flooding in South Carolina on their \nminds, this title I school conducted an informal collection of supplies \nfor those impacted by the devastation.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1428 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Mr. Sensenbrenner and Ranking \nMember Conyers for introducing this important bipartisan legislation to \nextend privacy protections and help ensure that the flow of law \nenforcement information between the European Union and the United \nStates continues unimpeded.\n  In recent years, several broad and highly publicized leaks of \nclassified U.S. intelligence information have eroded the global \npublic's trust in the United States Government and our technology \nsector. As a result, both the Federal Government and U.S. businesses \nthat operate overseas are facing growing challenges from proposals to \nlimit the international flow of data.\n  Our allies in Europe, in particular, are concerned that the European \npublic will no longer support law enforcement cooperation with U.S. \nauthorities if we do not enact legislation to restore their public's \ntrust in U.S. privacy protections.\n  Moreover, American businesses across all sectors face negative \ncommercial consequences abroad as a result of the climate that has been \ncreated by the unauthorized disclosure of classified data.\n  H.R. 1428, the Judicial Redress Act, can go a long way toward \nrestoring our allies' faith in U.S. data privacy protections and \nhelping facilitate agreements such as the Data Privacy and Protection \nAgreement that enhance international cooperation.\n  According to the Department of Justice, the Judicial Redress Act is \ncritical to reestablishing a trusting relationship between the European \nUnion and the United States, to ensuring continued strong law \nenforcement cooperation between the United States and Europe, and to \npreserving the ability of American companies to do business \ninternationally.\n  The Judicial Redress Act accomplishes this by granting citizens of \ndesignated foreign countries a limited number of civil remedies against \nthe Federal Government, similar to those already provided U.S. citizens \nand lawful permanent residents under the Privacy Act.\n  This legislation is narrowly tailored in that it only applies with \nrespect to information obtained through international law enforcement \nchannels. Any lawsuit brought pursuant to this bill is subject to the \nsame terms and restrictions that apply to U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents under the Privacy Act.\n  If this legislation is enacted, citizens of designated foreign \ngovernments will be able to sue the United States in Federal District \nCourt with respect to intentional and willful public disclosures of law \nenforcement information by the Federal Government that injure those \ncitizens.\n  Additionally, for information that is not subject to an exemption \nunder the Privacy Act, covered foreign citizens will be able to seek \nredress for failures by the Federal Government to grant access to \nrecords or to amend incorrect records. American citizens are already \nafforded these types of judicial redress rights in many foreign \ncountries.\n  Although these may be limited civil remedies against the United \nStates Government, they will provide European citizens with the core \nbenefits of the Privacy Act and, in doing so, will greatly help to \nrestore the public trust necessary for the continued success of our law \nenforcement cooperation with Europe.\n  The bill will also facilitate adoption of the Data Privacy and \nProtection Agreement and promote a healthy environment for U.S. \ncompanies that do business overseas.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 1428, the \n     Judicial Redress Act of 2015. As you know, the Committee on \n     the Judiciary received an original referral and the Committee \n     on Oversight and Government Reform a secondary referral when \n     the bill was introduced on March 18, 2015. I recognize and \n     appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the \n     House of Representatives in an expeditious manner, and \n     accordingly, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform \n     will forego action on the bill.\n       The Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1428 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation. Further, I \n     request your support for the appointment of conferees from \n     the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any \n     House-Senate conference convened on this or related \n     legislation.\n       Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters \n     on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, as well as in the Congressional \n     Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our \n     understanding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2015.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 1428, the ``Judicial Redress Act of 2015.'' As you \n     noted, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was \n     granted an additional referral on the bill.\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to forego formal \n     action on H.R. 1428 so that it may proceed expeditiously to \n     the House floor. I acknowledge that although you waived \n     formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on the \n     Oversight and Government Reform is in no way waiving its \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those \n     provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X \n     jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment \n     of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate \n     conference involving this legislation.\n       I will include a copy of our letters in the Committee's \n     report on H.R. 1428 and in the Congressional Record during \n     floor consideration of H.R. 1428.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation before us today is good for national \nsecurity, good for privacy, and good for business. It is unquestionably \nthe right thing to do for our Nation's closest allies.\n  Under current law, United States citizens are entitled to access and \nrequest a correction to personal records\n\n[[Page H6987]]\n\nheld by a Federal agency. If the agency denies access or fails to make \na requested change or otherwise violates their privacy rights, then we \nmay seek redress in Federal court.\n  Under current law, these rights are conveyed only to United States \ncitizens and not to the citizens of our closest allies, even though \nmany European countries offer our citizens similar rights overseas, \nprobably somewhat like the Europeans give our folks moneys when they \nrecord a song and play it over there, but we don't. We should have that \nsame reciprocity and fairness.\n  H.R. 1428, the Judicial Redress Act, will extend these core privacy \nprotections to the citizens of certain foreign countries, those \ndesignated by the Attorney General as trusted allies. This small change \nto our laws will afford immediate benefits both at home and abroad.\n  This act will facilitate information-sharing partnerships with law \nenforcement agencies across the globe. We know from experience that \nopen lines of communication with our allies yield intelligence and save \nlives.\n  The act will enable the U.S. and the European Union to complete an \numbrella agreement to govern information sharing across the Atlantic \nfor law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes. This agreement, \nwhich would include significant protections for individual privacy, \nwould not go into effect until we have made these changes.\n  Earlier this year a coalition of companies, trade associations, and \ncivil rights organizations wrote to the leadership of both parties to \noutline the economic cost of ``a significant erosion of global public \ntrust in both the U.S. Government and the U.S. technology sector.'' \nTheir fears appear to have been well founded.\n  Earlier this month, citing concerns about insufficient privacy \nsafeguards in the United States, the European Court of Justice \neffectively suspended the safe harbor agreement that allows companies \nto move digital information across the Atlantic.\n  Although there is far more work to be done to restore the agreement, \nI hope that our allies will take this legislation as a sign of good \nfaith and recognize that a basic right to privacy extends beyond our \nborders and we will work to restore the public trust necessary for the \ncontinued success of U.S. industry overseas.\n  The Judicial Redress Act is supported by the White House, the \nDepartment of Justice, and other Federal law enforcement agencies. It \nhas been endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, Information Technology \nIndustry Council, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and IBM, among others.\n  At base, this bill is a measure of basic fairness. Our friends abroad \nshould have some course of redress with respect to information that \nthey provided to the U.S. Government in the first place.\n  We all benefit when the information we share is accurate. Our \npartners in trade and security should have the ability to seek recourse \nwhen it is not.\n  I thank Representative Sensenbrenner for his leadership on this \nissue, for his leadership on many issues, including sentencing reform, \nfor his extreme knowledge of the world, and for sharing it with me on \noccasion. I thank Mr. Goodlatte for those same talents and \nachievements.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, and the chief sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, strong international relationships \nabroad are critical to the safety and advancement of the United States. \nThat is why I was pleased to introduce the Judicial Redress Act of 2015 \nwith Ranking Member John Conyers and to speak in favor of it today.\n  For many years, the United States and the European Union have worked \ntogether to secure data protection for their citizens under agreements \nknown as safe harbor. Earlier this month, however, the European Court \nof Justice issued a landmark ruling invalidating the agreement because \nof privacy concerns.\n  The European court's ruling illustrates how fragile trust between \nnations can be. It is easily lost and hard to rebuild. Moreover, this \nlack of trust has had huge economic and security consequences for the \nUnited States. Our businesses have struggled against public backlash \nand protectionist policies, and our government has faced increasingly \ndifficult negotiations to share law enforcement and intelligence data.\n  The Judicial Redress Act of 2015 is central to our efforts to rebuild \nstrained relationships with our allies and to ensure privacy and \nsecurity for both American and European Union citizens. The sudden \ntermination of the safe harbor framework strikes a blow to U.S. \nbusinesses by complicating commercial data flows. If we fail to pass \nthe Judicial Redress Act, we risk similar disruption to the sharing of \nlaw enforcement information.\n  In many ways, the Judicial Redress Act is a privacy bill. It is \nbacked and supported by many of our country's top privacy advocates. \nBut make no mistake. The bill is crucial to U.S. law enforcement. At \nthe heart of the Judicial Redress Act is the pressing need for the \ncontinued sharing of law enforcement data across the Atlantic.\n  In our complex digital world, privacy and security are not competing \nvalues. They are weaved together inseparably, and today's policymakers \nmust craft legal frameworks that support both.\n  This bill provides our allies with limited remedies relative to the \ndata they share with the United States, similar to those American \ncitizens enjoy under the Privacy Act. It is a way to support our \nforeign allies and to ensure the continued sharing of law enforcement \ndata.\n\n  Specifically, the bill will give citizens of covered countries the \nability to correct flawed information in their record and access U.S. \ncourts if the U.S. Government unlawfully discloses their personal \ninformation.\n  As United States citizens, we already enjoy similar protections in \nEurope. Granting these rights to our closest allies and their citizens \nwill be a positive step forward in restoring our international \nreputation and rebuilding trust.\n  In fact, our European colleagues have noted that the passage of the \nJudicial Redress Act is critical to negotiating a new agreement, \ncentral to their willingness to continue sharing law enforcement data \nwith the United States and necessary to improving relations between \nnations.\n  If we fail to pass this bill, we will undermine several important \ninternational agreements, further harm our businesses operating in \nEurope, and severely limit sharing of law enforcement information.\n  The Judicial Redress Act currently enjoys broad support and has been \nendorsed by the Department of Justice as well as the Chamber of \nCommerce and numerous U.S. businesses.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives John Conyers, \nRandy Forbes, and Glenn Thompson, for cosponsoring this legislation, as \nwell as Senators Orrin Hatch and Christopher Murphy for their work on \ncompanion legislation in the Senate.\n  The Judicial Redress Act amounts to a small courtesy that will pay \nhuge diplomatic and economic dividends. I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis important bill and my colleagues in the Senate to take it up \nwithout delay.\n  Let's put the President's infamous pen to good use by signing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I will perfunctorily reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Collins), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is important, I think, to \ncome over here and discuss H.R. 1428, the Judicial Redress Act. Echoing \na lot that has been said already, this is a great starting point for, \nreally, a broader conversation about privacy rights and a conversation \nthat is sorely needed.\n  I supported this bill when it passed the Committee on the Judiciary \nunanimously, and I am proud to support it today. The bill extends the \nsame rights afforded to Americans under the 1974 Privacy Act to \ncitizens of certain allied nations. Importantly, only citizens\n\n[[Page H6988]]\n\nof countries who extend similar rights to Americans for redress for \nprivacy violations are eligible.\n  As everyone here is aware, revelations about U.S. surveillance \noperations created serious trust issues, and both the government and \ntech sectors experienced a decline in that global trust. Advances in \ntechnology and innovation have made it possible and necessary for law \nenforcement to exchange information, but it should not be done at the \nexpense of privacy rights.\n  In order to restore global trust and ensure continued competitiveness \nfor our thriving tech industry, we must work to restore consumers' \nfaith that their data is secure in U.S. tech companies and their \nprivacy rights are protected.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  The United States tech industry employed an estimated 6.5 million \npeople in 2014 and made up a large 7.1 percent of the U.S. GDP, which \nis going to do nothing but grow.\n  The free flow of transnational data is critical for the continued \nsuccess of this industry that contributes in such a major way to our \neconomy. We have to show our allies that they can be confident sharing \ndata across the oceans and the various barriers.\n  The Judicial Redress Act is a step toward regaining trust and \nrebuilding cooperation with our allies, ensuring that U.S. businesses \ncan continue to grow and thrive internationally. H.R. 1428 is \nparticularly important because the U.S. and the EU have negotiated the \nData Protection and Privacy Agreement for the last 2 years.\n  During the negotiations over the agreement, the EU Parliament and EU \nCommission made clear that the Safe Harbor Agreement would not be \nfinalized absent U.S. enactment of a law to enable EU citizens to sue \nthe U.S. Government for major privacy violations. With the European \nCourt of Justice Ruling on the Safe Harbor Agreement, it is more \nimportant than ever that we create solutions that work for today's \never-changing tech industry, from the small companies to the household \nnames. It is also critical that we work with our allies to create a \nclear standard for governing the privacy of personal information to \nensure strong and cooperative exchanges between law enforcement.\n  Laws and agreements written before many of today's innovations even \nexisted are due for an update, and this bill is an important first step \nthat I am proud to support. I am thankful that the chairman has brought \nit forward for this body to put its stamp on and send to the Senate so \nthat it will be taken up and then sent to the President so that we will \ncontinue to move forward in the protection of privacy rights for all \nAmericans and our companies.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being part of this bill, and \nthank you for your efforts.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I again reiterate, this bill is a good \nbill. It is a very important bill that will help promote law \nenforcement cooperation around the globe and will help U.S. companies \nthat do business overseas to be able to better obtain the respect and \ntrust of foreign governments and foreign citizens, so I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H6989]]\n\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3493, the Securing the Cities Act of \n2015.\n  In April 2010, the President stated: ``The single biggest threat to \nU.S. security, both short-term, mid-term and long-term, would be the \npossibility of a terrorist organization obtaining a nuclear weapon.''\n  Since that time, the threat to our cities from nuclear terrorism has \nnot abated. The rise of ISIS and the resurgence of al Qaeda have only \nincreased the likelihood that radiological material will fall into the \nhands of those who wish to harm America.\n  Just last week, the Associated Press reported that the FBI foiled an \nattempt by smugglers in Eastern Europe to sell nuclear material to \nMiddle Eastern extremist groups. That report stated that, in the past 5 \nyears, the FBI has disrupted four other attempts by smugglers from the \nformer Soviet Union to sell nuclear materials to criminal \norganizations.\n  These events only reinforce the testimony delivered before the House \nCommittee on Homeland Security last month by Commissioner William \nBratton of the New York City Police Department. In that testimony, the \ncommissioner described the current terrorist threat to Manhattan as the \nhighest it has ever been, and he specifically referenced the danger of \nillicit nuclear material entering the city.\n  Thankfully, since the attacks of September 11, 2001, this Congress, \nsuccessive administrations, and local law enforcement have partnered to \nbuild the capability to guard against this risk.\n  In particular, the Department of Homeland Security initiated the \nSecuring the Cities program within the Domestic Nuclear Detection \nOffice. The Securing the Cities program provided training, equipment, \nand other resources to State and local law enforcement in high-risk \nurban areas to prevent a terrorist group from carrying out an attack \nusing a radiological or nuclear device.\n  The Securing the Cities program began in 2006 as a pilot program in \nthe New York City region, which included Jersey City and Newark. Since \n2007, the New York City region has purchased nearly 14,000 radiation \ndetectors and has trained nearly 20,000 personnel.\n  The pilot program has been so successful, it was expanded to the Los \nAngeles-Long Beach region in fiscal year 2012, the national capital \nregion in fiscal year 2014, and just last week the cities of Houston \nand Chicago were announced as the fiscal year 2015 and 2016 recipients.\n  H.R. 3493 would authorize the Securing the Cities program, which has \nproven its utility as a pilot program. With continued authorization, we \ncan assure that the extraordinary capability built by local law \nenforcement in conjunction with DHS does not become a hollow \ncapability, unable to be effectively used at the critical moment.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues who have helped bring this \nauthorization to the floor, especially Chairman McCaul of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and my good friend Pete King, and also my friend \nfrom Texas Representative Jackson Lee.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand rise in support of H.R. 3493, Securing the Cities Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Securing the Cities program is a grant and technical \nassistance program administered by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. Since its inception \nnearly a decade ago, the Securing the Cities program has provided \nthousands of first responders with the tools they need to detect \nradiological and nuclear threats.\n  Started as a pilot project in 2006 in the New York City, Newark, and \nNew Jersey metropolitan areas, the program has grown to include Los \nAngeles and Long Beach in 2012, and the Washington, D.C., Federal \ndistrict in 2014. This year, the program has identified Houston and \nChicago as high-priority areas for expanding the program.\n  Under the program, the initial grant award is generally used for \nplanning and analysis at a regional level, with subsequent grants going \ntowards equipment, training, and exercises. Importantly, through the \nSecuring the Cities program, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is \nable to channel subject-matter expertise, training coordination, and \ntechnical support to all the identified high-risk metropolitan areas.\n  H.R. 3493, like the bill I introduced that will be next to be \nconsidered, is targeted at bolstering the security of our communities \nfrom the threat of a nuclear attack. As such, Mr. Speaker, I urge \nsupport of H.R. 3493.\n  We have an opportunity today to take action to bolster our defense \nagainst rogue actors and terrorists who would seek to detonate a \nnuclear device on U.S. soil. The disclosure in recent weeks of a \nthwarted plot by Moldovan operatives to provide smuggled nuclear \nmaterials to terrorist organizations with ambition to attack the United \nStates has crystallized the need for action. Today, we can take such \naction. By approving H.R. 3493 and authorizing the Securing the Cities \nprogram, we will be enhancing the Nation's ability to detect and \nprevent a radiological and nuclear attack in cities facing the highest \nrisk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3493, \nthe Securing the Cities Act of 2015.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3493, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H6989-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6989-H6991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         KNOW THE CBRN TERRORISM THREATS TO TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DONOVAN.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3350, the Know the CBRN \nTerrorism Threats to Transportation Act, introduced by the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Higgins).\n  This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security, through the \nOffice of Intelligence and Analysis, to conduct a terrorism threat \nassessment of the transportation of chemical, biological, nuclear, and \nradiological materials across our land borders and within the United \nStates.\n  As a fellow New Yorker, I share Congressman Higgins' security \nconcerns related to the transportation of spent nuclear fuel across the \nCanadian-New York border. It is an appropriate response to have the \nDepartment of Homeland Security conduct a risk assessment related to \nthis initiative.\n  DHS is responsible for assessing potential terror threats against the \nhomeland. Threats related to CBRN materials are one of the most \nserious.\n  Terrorist groups have long had an interest in using CBRN materials. \nIn addition to concerns that terror groups may try to create or \npurchase CBRN materials, there are concerns that terrorists could \nexploit such materials with legitimate commercial uses, including when \nsuch materials are transported from one location to another. It is this \nconcern that the bill seeks to address.\n  The bill also directs that the results of the assessment be shared \nwith relevant Federal, State, and local agencies, including the \nDepartment of Energy and the National Network of Fusion Centers. \nCoordination and information-sharing within the Department, as well as \nbetween the Department and other agencies, is critical for securing the \nhomeland efficiently.\n  This is a commonsense bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3350, the Know the CBRN Terrorism Threats \nto Transportation Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. King of \nNew York; Chairman McCaul; and my ranking member, Mr. Thompson of \nMississippi, for their support of my bill.\n  H.R. 3350, the Know the CBRN Terrorism Threats to Transportation Act, \nwould direct the Department of Homeland Security's Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis to conduct a terrorism threat assessment of \nthe risks associated with transportation of chemical, biological, \nnuclear, and radiological materials.\n  Terrorists and militant groups have expressed an interest in using \nweapons of mass destruction, especially those utilizing chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and nuclear, known as CBRN, agents or \nmaterials.\n  In fact, according to a recent Associated Press investigation, the \nFBI uncovered a plot by rogue Moldavian operatives to sell nuclear \nmaterial to foreign terrorist organizations that have an interest in \ntargeting the United States.\n  Next year the Department of Energy plans to allow the transporting by \ntruck of highly enriched uranium from Canada to South Carolina. As a \ncost-saving measure, the planned shipment would be in liquid form.\n  These trucks are scheduled to enter the United States via the Peace \nBridge in Buffalo, New York. An attack or an accident involving one of \nthese trucks crossing the Peace Bridge could have devastating \nconsequences.\n  The Peace Bridge is the busiest passenger crossing on the northern \nborder and the second busiest cargo port of entry. Closing the bridge \nfor an extended period of time would cause great economic harm to the \nregion and national economies. Further, an attack could contaminate the \nGreat Lakes, which contain 84 percent of North America's surface \nfreshwater, with highly radioactive material.\n  Despite these risks, the Department of Energy approved this route, \nrelying on an analysis of this route that is 20 years old, and did not \nanticipate carrying such high-level waste. In other words, the Federal \nGovernment is about to begin importing highly radioactive material, \nwhich has never been shipped in this manner, using outdated, pre-9/11 \ninformation that does not reflect the threats we face today.\n  To ensure that all relevant Federal agencies, including the \nDepartment of Energy, have the information they need to make decisions \nand develop policies that are informed by the terrorism threat picture, \nmy bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security to share its \nassessment with Federal partners.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 3350, a measure that will \nnot only help ensure the Department of Energy has the information it \nneeds with respect to transporting dangerous material through high-risk \nareas throughout the United States, but that other Federal agencies who \nare faced with similar questions are able to make better informed \ndecisions.\n  Many of the routes used for the transport of CBRN materials were \napproved nearly 20 years ago and, as such, reflect a pre-9/11 mindset \nwith respect to the threat and consequences of terrorism.\n  My bill will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security assesses \nand shares threat information with the Department of Energy and other \nFederal agencies to ensure that they have the information needed to \nreach complicated decisions about transporting dangerous nuclear \nmaterial throughout our communities.\n  Enactment of my legislation will send a message to citizens at risk \nin Buffalo and beyond that we care about keeping them secure and \nensuring that Federal policy is informed by the best information we \nhave on terrorism threats.\n  With that, I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is common sense to require DHS to conduct terrorism \nthreat assessments for the legitimate storage, sale, or transportation \nof CBRN materials.\n  This bill complements the bill the House just considered, H.R. 3493, \nthe Securing the Cities Act of 2015. We need to take all appropriate \nmeasures to safeguard our citizens from nuclear weapons and weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  The Securing the Cities program creates a warning and detection \nsystem around New York City and other high-risk locations. H.R. 3350 \nsupplements this concept by requiring a proactive approach in reviewing \nsecurity concerns related to the transportation of CBRN materials.\n  In closing, I wanted to express appreciation to Congressman Higgins, \nthe ranking member of the Counterterrorism and Intelligence \nSubcommittee, and to the subcommittee chairman, Peter King, for moving \nH.R. 3350.\n  I urge support for the underlying measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3350, the \nKnow the CBRN Terrorism Threats to Transportation Act. The Department \nof Homeland Security and the Under Secretary of Intelligence and \nAnalysis play a critical role in the safety of American families. Their \nwork assessing the transportation of chemical, biological, nuclear, and \nradiological (CBRN) materials is essential for maintaining a high level \nof security for the country. This is why the Know the CBRN Terrorism \nThreats to Transportation Act must be passed.\n  The fact that my home state shares an international border gives me \ninsight and understanding of the issues that border communities face. \nExtremist groups have an array of potential agents and delivery methods \nto choose from for chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear \nattacks. Castor beans, cyanide, sarin and other chemical agents are \nexamples of the spectrum of terrorist CBRN threats. These materials \nneed to be assessed in order to ensure the safety of not only our \nborder communities, but our nation.\n  The Know the CBRN Terrorism Threats to Transportation Act requires a \nthree step process for improving the safety of our borders. First, to \nprepare for the execution of a terrorism threat assessment regarding \nCBNR materials, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis will \nconsult with the Administrator of the Transportation Security \nAdministration and the heads of other federal departments and agencies. \nThis is critical in ensuring that the assessment is conducted with the \nhighest level of expertise. Next, the terrorism threat\n\n[[Page H6991]]\n\nassessment of the transportation of CBNR materials can be conducted. \nFinally, the assessment must be distributed to federal, state, and \nlocal partners so that everyone protecting our borders is informed and \nupdated. At a time when this information should be readily available, \nwe are still waiting to find the best process to address this critical \nissue.\n  I would like to close by saying that I am proud of our chamber for \ntaking this important step to ensure that the data on the \ntransportation of hazardous materials is readily available and \naccessible. I also want to thank my colleagues for understanding the \nimportance of information regarding CBRN threats and the role of this \ninformation in strengthening our security.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, I \nrise today in strong support of H.R. 3572, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Headquarters Reform and Improvement Act of 2015, which I \nintroduced with my colleague from Mississippi, Ranking Member Bennie \nThompson.\n  This important, bipartisan legislation reforms and streamlines DHS \nheadquarters so it can more effectively focus on its core mission of \nbetter protecting national security. At the same time, this bill saves \nmillions in taxpayer dollars and reins in unnecessary bureaucracy.\n  DHS headquarters plays an important role in providing direction and \noversight to the Department's 22 components; yet, over the years, \nDepartment management has become bloated and unwieldy.\n  DHS has established, reorganized, and expanded offices and programs \nwithout the approval of Congress, created new assistant secretary \npositions, and spent billions of dollars on acquisitions that don't \nmeet the needs of our men and women on the frontlines securing the \nhomeland.\n  This bill helps to get DHS management on track by mandating multiple \nefficiency reviews to ensure taxpayer dollars are not wasted but, \ninstead, directly linked to protecting the homeland. It also requires \nDHS to increase\n\n[[Page H7005]]\n\ntransparency with Congress, to hold acquisition programs accountable, \nand to better communicate with industry when making major acquisition \ndecisions.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Oversight and \nManagement Efficiency Subcommittee Chairman Scott Perry and Ranking \nMember Bonnie Watson Coleman for their leadership in conducting much of \nthe oversight and research that informed the bill, especially their \nwork to reform DHS' troubled acquisitions process. I am grateful for \ntheir tremendous efforts.\n  In addition, this bill eliminates unnecessary assistant secretary and \ndirector positions, abolishes unproductive, idle offices, consolidates \noffices to streamline functionality, and prohibits the Department of \nHomeland Security Secretary from creating any new assistant secretary \npositions without prior congressional approval.\n  In short, Mr. Speaker, this bill ensures that the Department of \nHomeland Security is a leaner, less bureaucratic, and more efficient \norganization focused on the mission and getting the job done.\n  While H.R. 3572 addresses waste, fraud, abuse, and a lack of \ntransparency at DHS headquarters, it is just one part of a larger suite \nof legislation that this committee has passed this year dedicated to \nreforming and improving the Department overall.\n  To date, we have passed by voice vote more than 40 bills addressing \nsimilar shortcomings at CBP, TSA, FEMA, Secret Service, NPPD, and S, \njust to name a few.\n  I am very proud of our success in passing specific targeted bills \ndedicated to reining in bureaucracy, saving taxpayer dollars, providing \nmuch-needed congressional guidance, and protecting national security.\n  I am grateful to all the members of this committee and to the staff \non both sides of the aisle whose hard work and bipartisan commitment to \nthe priority of keeping America safe helped to make all of this \nlegislation possible.\n  My committee approved this bill unanimously last month, something you \ndon't hear of every day in this Congress.\n  In conclusion, I urge all Members of the House to join me in \nsupporting this bipartisan bill that will help DHS to operate more \nefficiently and effectively in protecting the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3572, the Department of Homeland Security \nHeadquarters Reform and Improvement Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security was established in \n2003, when 22 agencies were folded together in what was the most \nsubstantial reorganization of Federal agencies since the National \nSecurity Act of 1947.\n  Since that time, the Department of Homeland Security has faced an \never-evolving range of threats and has taken on more missions and \nresponsibilities, most notably with respect to cybersecurity.\n  Even as the Department of Homeland Security has risen to the \noperational demands of the post-9/11 world, departmental integration \nand coordination of key activities--such as policy development, \nacquisitions, and human capital management--have been a challenge.\n  As a result, the comptroller general and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity inspector general have repeatedly found instances where \ndecisionmaking at the component level has resulted in performance \nfailures that have wasted limited Department of Homeland Security \nresources.\n  H.R. 3572 is designed to drive improvements at all levels of the \nDepartment and to codify key departmental management directives that \nwere issued in recent years.\n  Specifically, H.R. 3572 would strengthen the under secretary for \nmanagement; authorize and realign central offices within the Management \nDirectorate; bolster the Office of Policy, including its management of \nDHS overseas personnel; and address the Department's employee morale \nissues.\n  Importantly, H.R. 3572 codifies the Department's acquisition \npolicies, promoting management practices designed to deliver needed \ncapabilities while actively managing risk.\n  This bipartisan measure was introduced by Chairman McCaul on \nSeptember 18, and Ranking Member Thompson was his original cosponsor.\n  The degree to which this bill is a bipartisan product was further \nunderscored by the acceptance of 13 amendments offered by Democratic \nmembers at the full committee markup held on September 30.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3572 is in line with Department of Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Jeh Johnson's Unity of Effort initiative. For \nexample, it streamlines how the Department conducts outreach with \nHomeland Security stakeholders, including businesses and local \ngovernment agencies, and integrates that process with the Department's \npolicymaking.\n  Additionally, in an effort to address chronic morale issues and build \nbridges between Department of Homeland Security components, H.R. 3572 \ndirects the Department to establish a rotational program for its \nworkforce.\n  Finally, the bill elevates the Assistant Secretary for Policy to an \nunder secretary level, a move that successive DHS leaders have sought.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  By doing so, the bill seeks to not only improve departmentwide \npolicymaking, but to also advance the goals of the initiative.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3572.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.\n  I think it is an excellent bipartisan bill. I want to thank Mr. \nHiggins from New York for his presentation here today and support, and \nI want to thank the other side of the aisle for working with me and \ncontinuing to work with me in a bipartisan way to get things done for \nthe country. I think that is how most committees should work; and \ncertainly for one that involves protecting the American people, I think \nit is paramount that we work together, both Republicans and Democrats.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3572.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3572, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7005-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7005-H7007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REQUIRING BUDGET SUBMISSIONS TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST PER \n                        TAXPAYER OF THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 1315) to amend section 1105(a) of title 31, United States \nCode, to require that annual budget submissions of the President to \nCongress provide an estimate of the cost per taxpayer of the deficit, \nand for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n\n[[Page H7006]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Indiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, first, I apologize for my voice today. My son, Hudson, \nand I attended the Patriots-Colts game on Sunday night, and, \nunfortunately, the Colts were not successful by a touchdown, but I lost \nmy voice in the process of rooting them on.\n  I would like to thank Budget Chairman Tom Price and Ranking Member \nVan Hollen for bringing H.R. 1315 to the floor. I rise today in support \nof this small but important measure.\n  H.R. 1315 requires the President's annual budget submission to \nCongress to include the cost per taxpayer of any budget deficit in a \ngiven fiscal year. This bill is based on a simple principle: each \nhardworking American taxpayer deserves to know how much the deficit \ncosts them each year. This requirement would be a powerful reminder to \nthe President and the Congress that our decisions here in Washington \nhave real-world consequences.\n  Since 2010, the national debt has increased by over $5 trillion. That \nis unsustainable, and it is irresponsible. Rather than make some tough \nchoices, we just spend more money we don't have and borrow some more. \nUnfortunately, because of out-of-control spending, we will, once again, \nbe hitting our debt ceiling soon. That means in 2 weeks, we will have \nborrowed the maximum amount of money our country is allowed to borrow \nby law, which now is $18.1 trillion.\n  Now, think about that for a second. We are $18.1 trillion in debt. \nThat is approximately $154,000 per taxpayer. And instead of asking \nourselves, ``How can we stop the borrow-and-spend cycle?'' we are \nasking, ``Should we borrow more money?''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is past time we get our fiscal house in order. I know \nthis bill won't solve our Nation's fiscal problems, and it won't \nprevent the government from spending more money that it doesn't have; \nhowever, making this information the bill requires more easily \naccessible will help us and our constituents better understand the \nreal-world impact of budgets that never balance.\n  It is past time we get our fiscal house in order. I know this bill, \nagain, won't solve our Nation's problems.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 1315, legislation which \nrequires the President's budget to include an estimate of the size of \nthe deficit on a per-taxpayer basis. I don't oppose this legislation--\nindeed, I voted for a previous version of it in the last Congress--but \nI am having a hard time understanding what, if anything, it will \naccomplish.\n  Requiring the President's budget to include a basic calculation will \ndo nothing to produce better policies or outcomes that the American \npeople are demanding. And when I say ``a basic calculation,'' I am \ntalking about a calculation that my 7-year-old nephew, Lucas, could do \nprobably without his smartphone. But I will vote ``yes'' because I \ndon't think this bill will do any harm.\n  I do think it says something about the majority's priorities that \nthis bill is even being considered. We are facing a series of enormous \nand serious budget issues, yet the majority is devoting floor time to \nlegislation that is essentially meaningless.\n  Our government is now operating with funding under a continuing \nresolution that will expire on December 11, and we have failed to \naddress the pending, across-the-board cuts known as sequestration that \nwill drastically reduce funding for education, infrastructure, job \ntraining, and nutrition programs for children and the elderly. Those \nprograms aren't meaningless. Millions of Americans depend on them.\n  On top of all that, unless Congress acts, we will default on the full \nfaith and credit of the United States in less than a month. That would \ncost our economy billions of dollars. We need to be meeting the urgency \nof the situation with urgent action on the House floor to raise the \ndebt ceiling and avert a disastrous default.\n  Additionally, we only have a few weeks left before the Federal \nhighway program runs out of money again, yet it isn't even scheduled \nfor floor debate. We have yet to extend tax provisions that benefit \nmillions of taxpayers, both individuals and small businesses. They \ndeserve certainty, not meaningless legislation like this.\n  These priorities, which are also the priorities of the American \npeople, demand our attention. We should be working on reaching \nagreements to resolve these issues. Instead, we are not just wasting \nour time, we are wasting America's time.\n  Let's face it, this bill has two purposes: first, to create the \nillusion for the American people that Congress is actually being \nproductive; and, second, to suggest, and possibly to scare, millions of \nAmericans into thinking that they will be responsible for a certain \namount of debt--an absurd notion, just as the notion that every \nAmerican bears an equal share of our tax burden.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this bill. Again, I think it is a \npointless exercise, but that is kind of where Congress is in this \nunfortunate era.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I certainly appreciate his \nsupport for the legislation. I would just suggest I don't think this is \nmeaningless at all. I think it is important that we let the American \ntaxpayer understand the true cost of operating our government with \nconstant deficits.\n\n  When you throw around numbers in this town like billion and trillion, \nit is very hard to put them into a scale that the average American can \nunderstand. When you look at a $400-billion deficit that we now have on \nthe books--and somehow brag to ourselves, as if we are somehow serving \nthe American people well--and you divide that by 152 million taxpayers, \nit is over $3,000 we are still adding to the debt. When you look at the \nentire national debt of $18 trillion, it is $150,000 a person. It is \nunsustainable.\n  There are, of course, costs to the economy. No one is suggesting that \na bill collector is going to come to an individual taxpayer's door, \nknock, and ask for $150,000. But it gives us a sense of the scale of \ndebt that we are accumulating--five times, for the individual taxpayer, \nthe average wage in this American society.\n  It is unsustainable, and it ought to be called out. That is why we \nhave this bill. I think there can be honest disagreements about how we \nsolve our fiscal challenges, but no disagreement about the fact that we \nought to be transparent with the American people about what we are \ndoing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from across the \nOhio River. I would say that if we want to do things like show what the \nper-taxpayer impact of our decisions might be, we also might want to \nlook at how much the Federal deficit has been reduced in the last 8 \nyears.\n  In 2009, when President Obama came into office, the Federal deficit \nwas $1.4 trillion. It is now right about just over $400 billion--still \na lot of money. But I did the calculation, and that is almost a $7,000 \nreduction in the deficit per individual taxpayer over the last 8 years. \nSo it can be a positive thing as well.\n  But if we want to add a mathematical calculation to a budget, we \nreally ought to be looking at the one the Republican Party approved in \nMarch. That budget, the Republican House budget, doesn't add up. When I \nsay that, I mean it literally doesn't add up. Here are a couple of \nexamples:\n  Their budget fully repeals ObamaCare but still counts all the revenue \nthat is raised from the law.\n  The House has approved more than $610 billion worth of tax cuts this \nyear, yet none of that lost revenue is accounted for in the Republican \nbudget.\n  There are other tax cuts that are scheduled to expire that we all \nknow will be extended, but, again, the Republican budget reflects none \nof that lost revenue.\n  So, yes, I will support this bill which requires that the President's \nbudget include this one very basic calculation. I just wish my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would apply basic addition \nand subtraction to their own budget and, more importantly, deal with\n\n[[Page H7007]]\n\nthe truly important issues that confront this country in the weeks to \ncome.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MESSER. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Kentucky for \nhis remarks.\n  I believe the most direct path towards a healthier and more secure \neconomy now and in the future is less spending, lower taxes, a balanced \nbudget, and a smaller debt. The first step, though, is more \ntransparency, letting taxpayers know what is happening here. Mr. \nSpeaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1315.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1315.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7007-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7007-H7009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1700\n   SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE TO FREELY ELECT THEIR GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. ROYCE.

The \nfighting has taken over 8,000 Ukrainian lives, and that number is \ngrowing as Russia continues to provide weapons and support to \nseparatists in eastern Ukraine.\n  Last year, along with Ranking Member Eliot Engel and several other \nmembers of the Foreign Affairs Committee--there were eight of us, as I \nrecall, including the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who \nis the author of this resolution before us today--we traveled to \nUkraine to see the situation on the ground. We traveled to Kyiv and we \ntraveled to Dnepropetrovsk in the east, and we spoke with local \nofficials. We spoke with representatives from civil society, women's \ngroups, lawyers' groups, local government, different minority groups, a \nbroad range of individuals--leaders of the Tatar community, leaders of \nthe Jewish community there, and even former supporters of President \nYanukovych, among many, many others.\n  We heard that same message from everyone, namely, that they were \ncommitted to building a peaceful, united Ukraine that is free to \ndetermine its own future, and that they want to do it without outside \ninterference.\n  Now there is a new effort to bring peace to this war-torn region \nunder the so-called Minsk agreements. These specify a number of \nmeasures that must be implemented by all sides, one of which is to hold \nlocal elections by the end of this year. The Ukrainian Government has \nscheduled these for October 25, which is this Sunday.\n  Unfortunately, they cannot be held in the areas controlled by \nRussian-led separatists because intimidation and manipulation make free \nand fair elections impossible in these regions. But they will take \nplace in the rest of the country where independent observers will \nensure that they meet international standards, and this is to be \nwelcomed.\n  Their hoped-for success will be a real-world demonstration that \nUkraine is continuing to implement the democratic reforms that \nUkrainian people are determined to bring peace into their country with.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan resolution and \nreaffirm that America's commitment to Ukraine's independence and to the \nright of the Ukrainian people to determine their own future is strong \nand it is enduring.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n  First of all, I want to thank Mr. Cicilline for drafting this \nresolution. With its passage, we will again be signaling that the \nUnited States stands\n\n[[Page H7008]]\n\nwith the people of Ukraine, that we want them to chart the future for \ntheir own country, and that we reject the aggression and unlawfulness \nof Russia's actions under President Putin.\n  Let me also thank our chairman, Ed Royce. The hallmark of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee is our success in advancing good, bipartisan \nlegislation, and this resolution is a prime example of business as \nusual for our committee. I am very proud of it.\n  Our interest in Ukraine is nothing new. Over the past year, our \ncommittee has focused a great deal on this crisis. We have passed \nlegislation aimed at assisting Ukraine. We want to see a successful \ndemocratic transition, we want Ukraine's territorial integrity to be \nrestored, and we want to deter Russia from further aggression.\n  The cease-fire in Ukraine finally seems to be holding. That is good \nnews, but I still have deep concerns.\n  First of all, while the upcoming elections are important, not all of \nUkraine's citizens will have their voices heard. Only areas under \nKyiv's control will be casting ballots--and Russia has a history of \nsticking its nose in Ukraine's elections. Putin has said that he won't \ninterfere with this vote. But I am not holding my breath, nor should \nanyone else.\n  So we will be looking for some specific benchmarks. For instance, the \nagreement in Minsk requires that elections in Donetsk and Luhansk be \nheld after Russia draws down its forces there. Not just Russian \npersonnel, but all military equipment, all mercenaries, all support for \nproxies must be out of these areas before elections. It is critical \nthat the OSCE mount a full-scale observation mission and be permitted \nto monitor every stage of the process. We will be keeping a close eye \non this as well.\n  Yet, even if Minsk is followed to the letter--a cease-fire, followed \nby elections, followed by restoration of Kyiv's control over its own \neastern border--the international order will remain compromised. This \nagreement does not address Crimea, nor does it hold the force of \ninternational law.\n  And as much as we talk about Minsk, we shouldn't forget prior and far \nmore important agreements, such as the Helsinki Final Act and the \nBudapest Memorandum, which reaffirmed the core principle of the Final \nAct: that the territorial integrity of states is inviolable.\n  Ukraine was part of the former Soviet Union; and when the Soviet \nUnion collapsed, Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons. As part of giving \nthat up, Ukraine was guaranteed its territorial integrity--guaranteed \nby the United States, by Russia, and by others. Certainly they are \nbeing betrayed right now, and we should not stand for it.\n\n  Lastly, we should have no illusions that this agreement will deter \nPresident Putin's aggression. Indeed, as Moscow dials up its \nintervention in the Middle East in Syria, Ukraine is looking more and \nmore like just one element of a much larger scheme by President Putin \nto destabilize countries on Russia's borders. That is what Putin wants \nto do. He wants to keep Ukraine unstable and destabilized.\n  So, with this resolution, we reaffirm our support for Ukraine, we \nexpress our hope that Minsk will keep the peace, and we make clear that \nwe are keeping a watchful eye on Russia and that we are ready to \ncontinue assisting Ukraine to consolidate its democratic gains and \nrestore its territorial integrity.\n  Ukraine wants to be democratic. Ukraine wants to look toward the \nWest. Ukraine does not want to be dominated by Russia. We should give \nthem all the support that they deserve. That is what the United States \ndoes, that is what the United States is all about, and that is what \nthis resolution does. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the author of this \nresolution.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise to support H. Res. 348, supporting free elections in Ukraine.\n  I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their \nstrong support and cosponsorship of this legislation, which I was proud \nto introduce and which affirms Congress' unwavering support for free \nelections in Ukraine. I thank my many colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have signed on as cosponsors and contributed to the final \nlanguage of the bill.\n  Support of the democratic and economic development of Ukraine in the \nface of Russian aggression remains one of the most vital efforts the \nUnited States can undertake to combat Russian belligerence and \ndemonstrates our unwavering commitment to promoting democracy and human \nrights around the world.\n  Next week--next Sunday, in fact--the people of Ukraine will head to \nthe polls to exercise their right to choose their own government. \nHowever, because of the continued defiance of Russian-led separatists, \nnot every region of Ukraine will be able to participate in these \nelections.\n  The illegal and forcible occupation of Crimea and the ongoing Russian \nsupport for separatists in eastern Ukraine are a clear violation of \ninternational law and diplomacy. The Minsk II agreement was a historic \nstep toward potentially ending the violence and unrest in the country, \nand it is now upon the Governments of Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. and \nour European allies as implementing partners to ensure its successful \nexecution. The existing cease-fire is a positive development, but one \nthat must be accompanied by free elections and restoration of Ukraine's \nterritorial integrity.\n  Ukraine has local elections scheduled for most of the country--except \nsome separatist-controlled areas--for this Sunday, October 25. This \nresolution demonstrates this Congress' steadfast commitment to \nsupporting the right of the people of Ukraine to freely elect their \ngovernment and determine their future. It condemns any Russian attempts \nto interfere in Ukraine's elections in any way, including through \nintimidation, violence, or coercion. During Ukraine's last elections, \nthese tactics were used to prevent Ukrainians from voting in certain \nregions. This cannot happen again, and any actions undermining these \nelections must be met with swift and uncertain international \ncondemnation.\n  At this delicate juncture in Ukraine's history, it is essential that \nthe United States and our European allies continue to demonstrate firm \nsupport for Ukrainian territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the right \nof Ukrainian people to participate in free and fair elections. America \nhas a long history of supporting free and fair elections and the right \nof people to decide their own future.\n  This resolution was passed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to support \nits passage today.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York and, \nof course, the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  I rise in support of H. Res. 348. The people of Ukraine have the \nright to hold free and fair elections within the sovereign territory of \ntheir own country. The ruthless tyranny of Russian military aggression \nin Ukraine must end, and we must never agree to a settlement that even \nhints to President Vladimir Putin that the borders of Europe are up for \nsale.\n\n  The resolution notes: the forcible and illegal occupation of Crimea. \nThe United States must make it clear in both our words and our deeds \nthat Crimea is within the sovereign territory of Ukraine, and we will \nnot recognize its forcible and illegal annexation by Russia--ever. This \nresolution is clear on that account, and I thank the author, Mr. \nCicilline, for it.\n  The Senate and House of Representatives recently passed the fiscal \nyear 2016 National Defense Authorization Act conference report. That \ntext included an amendment I authored to prohibit the authorization of \nfunds to be obligated or expended in order to implement any activity \nthat could be construed as recognizing the sovereignty of the Russian \nFederation over Ukraine's Crimea. Crimea is not\n\n[[Page H7009]]\n\nan issue we can allow to fade into the background--ever. As the \nresolution notes in just its second clause, this was Putin's original \nsin in Ukraine.\n  If we are to deter, Mr. Speaker, further Russian separatist and \nrevanchist moves in eastern Ukraine, we must never yield on Crimea.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, once again, I want to voice my strong support for this \nresolution. I again thank Mr. Cicilline for authoring this measure and \nhis leadership, and I thank our chairman once again.\n  Even with a cease-fire in place, the crisis in Ukraine is a major \nthreat to the international order. The United States stands with the \npeople of Ukraine as they try to chart the path forward for their \ncountry and restore their territorial integrity. So long as President \nPutin's aggression continues, we need to stay focused on this serious \nchallenge. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me again thank Eliot Engel, along with \nMr. Cicilline and Mr. Connolly--cosponsors of this resolution with \nmyself and other members of that committee--but mention in particular \nthe decision we made to go as far east in Ukraine as we could. We \ntraveled to the border of Luhansk and Donetsk, actually, because \nDnipropetrovsk was where we flew in. To the south is Donetsk. To the \neast is Luhansk.\n  One of the great advantages of having with us the ranking member--an \nindividual who knows the country well and knows the people well, Mr. \nEliot Engel--is the fact that both of his grandparents on his mother's \nside are from Ukraine and both of his grandparents on his father's side \nare from Ukraine.\n  It is a reminder to us of the long struggle, the long, ardent effort, \nfor independence, for some modicum of freedom, that the people of \nUkraine have struggled for all of these years, a dream that finally \nseemed realized; and now, in the wake of that, you have the occupation \nof the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n  I think it is a reminder to all of us of how we can be surprised on \nthe world stage. The United States, in my opinion, could do more in \nthis particular case to end the aggression. As people told us in \nDnipropetrovsk--and we were there, actually. We had a service in the \nsynagogue where Mr. Engel spoke during Passover. People asked us in \neach of these groups--the city council, the governor, the women's \ngroups, the different civil society groups--they said: We can handle \nthe fact that every skin-headed malcontent that Putin can recruit, that \nhe radicalizes, and he trains--then they send them here, and we capture \nthem, and we hold them in our brig until the end of hostilities--but \nwhat is a real challenge is the Russian armor, that Russian equipment \nout there. We can't match that. We need anti-tank missiles.\n  Now, anti-tank weapons is what they have asked for. Many of us in \nCongress, myself included, have asked that we more forcefully oppose \nRussian aggression by giving those people on those frontlines the \narmaments they need to defend themselves, and the House has gone on \nrecord as taking this position.\n  I think it would be a deterrent against Russian aggression that has \nbrought so much suffering, and my hope is that, as we go forward, we \nconvince the administration as well.\n  The local elections scheduled for this Sunday are a concrete example \nthat Ukrainians are determined to do all that they can to achieve peace \nthroughout the entirety of that country. By overwhelmingly adopting \nthis bipartisan resolution, I believe the House will send a clear \nmessage to the Ukrainian people that the United States remains \ncommitted to their right to have Ukrainians choose their own government \nand choose their own destiny.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for authoring this \nparticular bill, and I urge its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 348 to \nsupport the right of the people of Ukraine to freely elect their \ngovernment and determine their future, which was introduced by my \nfriend, Representative David Cicilline.\n  Citizens everywhere should be afforded the right to freely choose \ntheir leaders--and the people of Ukraine are no different. It is \nimperative that the American people stand with Ukrainians to ensure \nthat the future of their government is determined freely and fairly.\n  Russian troops began an illegal occupation of Crimea following the \nresignation of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in March 2014. In \nspite of economic sanctions, diplomatic efforts and successive \nceasefires, we have tragically seen over 6,500 people killed in eastern \nUkraine since Russia annexed Crimea. Russia's continued violations of \nthe Minsk agreement by ignoring the ceasefire is simply unacceptable. \nTheir actions betray their previous commitments and have derailed good \nfaith efforts to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine. Russia's continued \nmilitary aggression in Ukraine threatens peace and security in the \nregion. Russia's aggression has also hindered the electoral process and \ndisenfranchised voters in the troubled region. I support Ukraine's \nright to determine their own future, protect their territorial \nintegrity and we must do all we can to prevent the slaughter of \ninnocent lives.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the passage of \nH. Res. 348, supporting the right of Ukrainian citizens to freely elect \ntheir officials and determine their future. I would like to emphasize \nthe importance of protecting democracy around the world. In 2015, it is \nessential that we ensure people at home and abroad are able to elect \ntheir government representatives by exercising this basic right.\n  This issue is of particular importance to me as the Congressional \nRepresentative for the 14th District of Michigan, which is home to a \nlarge population of women and minorities who fought hard to gain the \nright to vote. This year marked the 50th anniversary of the Voting \nRights Act, which is of critical importance in protecting every \ncitizen's right to participate in free and fair elections. However, \nfair elections are also vital to democracies across the globe. \nTherefore, we must act appropriately when those rights are infringed \nupon.\n  This resolution demonstrates the federal government's commitment to \nprotect Ukraine's critical elections. Ukraine's next local elections \nare scheduled to take place on October 25, 2015 and are essential for \nthe continuation of legislative and constitutional reform. We cannot \nallow Russia or other outside forces to interfere with Ukraine's \nelections, especially through intimidation, violence, or coercion. By \nsupporting the right of the people of Ukraine to freely elect their \ngovernment and have a say in their future, we are working toward \nensuring all people around the world benefit from these basic yet \nprofoundly critical rights.\n  I am grateful that our chamber is continuing with our legacy of \nsafeguarding democracy. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for supporting America's commitment to defending these \nimportant freedoms around the world.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Chief \nHudak earned his undergraduate and master's degree from the U, having \nmore recently graduated from the FBI's National Law Enforcement \nExecutive Academy.\n  Coral Gables is indeed fortunate to have such a hardworking and \nrelentless civil servant take the lead at its police department.\n  Congratulations, Chief Hudak, on being named the top cop of ``The \nCity Beautiful,'' the city of Coral Gables.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7012-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GALLEGO.

This year, as part of its anniversary celebration, the \nInitiative released the Bright Spots in Hispanic Education, an online \nnational catalog. The catalog features 230 programs, organizations, and \ninitiatives that are supporting and investing in educational attainment \nof Hispanics from cradle to career.\n  Today, I congratulate four Bright Spots in my district that have been \nrecognized for their outstanding commitment and contributions to our \ncommunity: the American Dream Academy, the Bilingual Nursing Fellows \nProgram, the Fowler Head Start Program, and the Victoria Foundation. \nThese programs are leading the way to close the education gap. I look \nforward to continuing to work with them as they find ways to ensure \nevery child, including Latino children, has the tools they need to \nsucceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7012-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7012-H7013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REMEMBERING AITKIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S INVESTIGATOR STEVEN SANDBERG\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

He was a former \nthree-sport athlete at Aitkin High School. He served as a volunteer \nfirefighter for 17 years, and he taught Sunday school at the local \nMethodist church.\n  Mr. Speaker, Steven Sandberg dedicated his life to serving others and \nkeeping people safe.

No, it is to talk about how alike we are and to talk about \nhow wonderful and great our country is.\n  The tapestry of people that come from all over the world come here to \nstart a new life, come here to create opportunities, perhaps not for \nthem, but for the next generation. Together, we have created the \ngreatest country that this world has ever known and has ever seen.\n  From Europe, from the Americas, from Africa, from Australia, from all \nparts of the planet, people come to this country for a better life and \na second chance.\n  I hope and pray that in these Chambers we can live up to the \nresponsibility of holding true to the values of America and holding \ntrue to our responsibilities as a legislative body of this country to \ncreate and pass laws to make sure that everybody can continue to have \nthose opportunities for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7013-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING JUNE SORG\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

June was honored \nrecently with the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania's \nOutstanding Commissioner of the Year Award and with the Special \nPresidential Award. This award recognizes a commissioner who has \ncontributed to the advancement of county government.\n  June has a long career of public service, serving for six terms as \ncounty commissioner, totaling 24 years. In that time, she has been a \nleader in Elk County on issues ranging from human services, workforce \ninvestment, prison issues, infrastructure improvement, recycling, and \nenvironmental issues.\n  Specific accomplishments during June's tenure include consolidation \nof county offices to a centralized location, improvements to the \ncounty's jail, and the construction of Elk County's new emergency \nmanagement center.\n  As you know, Mr. Speaker, county commissioners across the country \ndedicate countless hours toward the improvement of counties and \ncommunities that they serve.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the new members of the \nbipartisan task force to combat the heroin epidemic. We introduced our \nfirst piece of legislation, the Stop Abuse Act, this month.\n  Heroin abuse in the United States has reached unprecedented levels, \nincreasing 63 percent over the last decade. This addictive and \ndangerous drug has torn a path through every community, destroying \nfamilies and ruining lives.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, the number of patients admitted to \nthe State-funded treatment programs reached over 1,500 in 2013, \ndoubling the number from 2004.\n  Nationwide, in 2014, heroin abuse was responsible for nearly 8,200 \ndeaths. In just 10 years, the number of addicts has doubled to over \n500,000.\n  To address this health crisis, we must expand coordination between \nlocal, State, and Federal governments, law enforcement agencies, and \nmedical professionals. We must assemble the best ideas from experts \naround the country, which is why Congresswoman Ann Kuster and I formed \nthe bipartisan task force.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Treasury Department \nconfirmed what we already knew: we have cut the Federal deficit to the \nlowest level since this President took office. At $439 billion, the \ndeficit is about 10 percent lower than in 2014 and is less than one \nthird of what it was in 2009.\n  Yet, earlier this week, the administration was quick to boast about \nannouncing the deficit being down that low when we asked in the past, \n``What is the plan, Mr. President, for balancing the budget ever?'' Not \ntelling me how to do it, but when. We haven't gotten any answer.\n  This has been the result of discipline started by House Republicans \nwith the Budget Control Act and other measures to keep spending in line \nso that we will have a chance some day to have a truly balanced budget.\n  If we had the economy responding and things to help spur the economy, \nwe could reach that goal even faster, perhaps even by 2019. With the \nright discipline, we could balance the budget. Then no longer will we \nhave to have a debate about whether we should be extending the debt \nlimit, which I think is appalling for all of us here, especially for \nthe next generation who are going to have to pay the price on that.\n  So this is indeed good news. We want to get that budget deficit \nnumber to zero as soon as we can and maintain the business of this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7013-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7013-H7014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE AND RICE UNIVERSITY\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nGaramendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority \nleader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, this is chaos week in Washington, and \nthere are a lot of things going on. Most people want to talk about \nBenghazi or--I don't know--maybe the Speaker, the next Speaker or the \nlast Speaker. However, what I would like to talk about today is chaos \nin America's infrastructure system.\n  Early this morning on my way to the airport in Sacramento I was \ndriving up Interstate 5, the highway that connects Mexico and Canada \nand Oregon and Washington and California. I hit a huge pothole and then \nanother pothole. It turns out that the entire right lane was a series \nof potholes for the 9 miles that I traveled to get to the airport. That \nis not unusual, but that is the story of America's infrastructure.\n  Everybody here on the floor wants to talk about how our great Nation \nis the world's most vibrant economy, the place where intellectual \ninfrastructure takes place, but it certainly is not the place where \nphysical infrastructure takes place. We rank 16th among the developed \nnations in the world on our infrastructure.\n  Travel to China. High-speed rail is going every which way. They have \nnew airports. I remember the comment of our Vice President when he flew \ninto LaGuardia in New York City. It wasn't very complimentary.\n  We have a need to build the infrastructure of this Nation because it \nis upon the infrastructure that the economy grows. It is upon the \nhighways that we travel and move the goods and services. It is upon the \ntransit system that more than 45 percent of Americans depend on for \ntheir transportation.\n  We have got problems. I was reminded of Apollo 13 and that very \nfamous quote coming back from space: ``Houston, we've had a problem \nhere.'' Yep. America, we have got problems.\n  That is a picture of the bridge on Interstate 5 in Washington State. \nJust a little bit north of this bridge is the Canadian border. This \nbridge collapsed about 3 years ago. There are 63,500 bridges in America \nthat are deficient, and over the last decade we have seen Americans die \non bridges that have collapsed. We have got a problem.\n  Among other things, given all the chaos here in Washington, we have \ngot a problem with infrastructure. The House of Representatives is \ngoing to take up an infrastructure bill this week in committee. We will \ntalk about that a little later.\n  First I want to go through some of the other problems besides bridges \nand highways. Oh, by the way, it would take $780 billion to bring our \nhighways up to adequate standards. That is a lot of money. Or maybe it \nis not. That is about three-quarters of what we have spent in \nAfghanistan over the last 14 years. I guess we make decisions here \nabout where we spend money.\n  Forty-two percent of our highways are in inadequate condition, and \ncongestion abounds in 42 percent of the urban highways. Yep, we have \ngot problems, but we can solve them. We will see whether the House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure \nis willing to solve the problems this week when we take up the \ninfrastructure bill here in the House of Representatives.\n  I would like to have my colleague from California, Representative \nJanice Hahn, address one of our other problems. It is a problem that \nshe is particularly aware of. She represents the greatest port in \nAmerica, the Port of Los Angeles, and its neighboring port, the Port of \nLong Beach.\n  Representative Hahn.\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good colleague from \nCalifornia, Mr. Garamendi, for devoting this Special Order hour to the \nneeds that we have in this country when it comes to our infrastructure.\n  I am sort of excited because this week, at long last, barely in time \nbefore the highway trust fund runs out of money, we are finally going \nto look at a long-term surface transportation bill to fund some of our \nNation's most critical infrastructure, which you have been talking \nabout.\n  Our Nation's highways, our roads, our bridges, they have been \nneglected far too long. Today we unfortunately have an infrastructure \ncrisis. Not only do the American people rely on these roads to get from \npoint A to point B safely and efficiently, our economy relies on them \nas well.\n  I have been advocating, as you know, for more funding for our freight \nnetwork. That is the series of highways and roads that go from our \nports and our manufacturing hubs and that the vast majority of our \nNation's freight travel on. Our Nation's ports are hard at work, \nbringing in cargo from all over the world and exporting the products of \nAmerican manufacturing to the growing overseas market.\n  Twenty-two million jobs nationwide rely on the efficient movement of \ngoods in and out of our ports. These jobs rely on our Nation's freight \nnetwork. For too long we have failed to invest in this important \ninfrastructure and allowed it to crumble. Too many bridges along the \nfreight network are in disrepair, and too many of our highways are \nunable to handle the modern levels of traffic.\n  Now, many of us deal with the inconvenience of traffic every day, but \nthis same traffic also costs both businesses and consumers money, and \nit threatens our economy's ability to stay competitive in the 21st \ncentury global economy.\n  As the roads on our freight network become more and more unreliable, \nthe cost of transporting these goods increases, and American \nmanufacturers and consumers pay the price. That is why I proposed \nlegislation that would drastically increase the funding of this freight \nnetwork infrastructure.\n  I thought it would be a good idea, and my bill would have used \nexisting customs fees to provide $2 billion every year just to fund \nthis freight network and the infrastructure projects without, by the \nway, raising any taxes. I thought, by investing in our freight network, \nwe could give American businesses and manufacturers a competitive edge \nand spur job creation across the country.\n\n  The highway bill that we are considering this week provides just $750 \nmillion per year in freight funding. That is less than half of what I \nwas hoping for. But it is a start. I hope that we can continue this \nconversation and find ways to invest in our ports and in this freight \nnetwork at the level that our economy needs.\n  I hope that in coming days we can work in a bipartisan way to improve \nthe highway bill and ensure that it passes before the end of this year. \nI would like to see the freight network expanded to include that last \nmile. Those are the roads that connect everything to our ports with \nhighways and with rail. And when we talk about improving our roads, \nthese last mile roads are often forgotten, even when they have the \ngreatest amount of traffic.\n  I hope that we can expand the freight title to include funding for \non-dock rail at our ports. Investing in on-dock rail would actually \nease traffic on our highways by taking a lot of those trucks off the \nroads. That cargo would come off the ships, go right onto the rail and \nthen to the end consumer.\n  This bill is a positive step. It is not perfect. It is not as good as \nI would like\n\n[[Page H7015]]\n\nto have seen, but it is the right step for a long-term plan to invest \nin our Nation's critical infrastructure.\n  I am looking forward to working with you, Mr. Garamendi. Thank you \nfor your leadership on this. Thank you for talking about why Make It In \nAmerica makes sense. But none of that makes sense unless we can finally \ninvest in this infrastructure in this country to, as you said, make \nthis country great and make it work for everyone.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Representative Hahn, your leadership on the port \nissues is well known. You head up the PORTS Caucus here in the House of \nRepresentatives. You are constantly badgering all of us about the \nnecessity of the ports being expanded.\n  We know the Eastern ports are facing the challenge of providing \naccess for the Panamax ships, bigger ships being able to go through the \nPanama Canal. As you have told us so many times, we need to improve the \ninfrastructure on the West Coast for the efficiency so that we can keep \nthose Panamax ships on the West Coast.\n  The freight issue that you talked about so eloquently here is \nabsolutely on. It is the major part of the American transportation \neconomy. We look at roads, we look at railroads, but the notion of \ncombining this into a comprehensive strategy in which we talk about the \nmovement of goods, the freight movement.\n  Your leadership is very, very important. I thank you so very much for \njoining us. I know that you have a tight schedule for the evening, but \nyou broke away to bring us the very, very important message.\n  I want to continue on here really with the ports. The American \nSociety of Civil Engineers does a report card on the American \ninfrastructure. We would fail. We would have to go back to remedial \nclasses if their report card was somehow the way in which we would \njudge the work of the United States Congress because, with regard to \nports, as we just discussed, it is a C, even though progress has been \nmade.\n  To meet the needs of the ports, we are going to have to spend an \nadditional $46 billion over and above what is already programmed. We \nare going to have to spend $748 billion in the future in order to meet \nthe needs of the highways, and that just gets us out of the D rating \nprovided by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n  For transit, it is also a D. As I said earlier, some one-half of \nAmerican households depend upon transit because they don't have a car, \nand 45 percent of the urban passengers cannot get the services that \nthey need from transit.\n  It goes on and on and on. Bridges, a C-plus. As I said earlier, \n63,500 bridges are inadequate. For the rail system, part of what \nCongresswoman Hahn was talking about, the railroads have invested over \n$75 billion of their own money improving their systems, but the \nintermodal programs that are so necessary require that those rails \nconnect to the highways, to the trucking industry, and that hasn't been \ndone. So the rails actually receive a C-plus ranking.\n  We have got work to do here. We have got some very, very serious \nproblems. Let me just put this up because there are solutions available \nto us.\n  If we take a look at the problem, in this case, the global assessment \nof the United States is 16th for transportation infrastructure. The \nsolution? Invest. For every dollar that we invest, the economy grows by \n$3.54. So when you put a dollar in, suddenly you get the economy \nmoving. People go to work.\n  For every billion dollars that we invest in roads and bridges, we are \ngoing to create 21,671 jobs. Those are people that are getting good, \nhigh-quality, high-paying, middle-income jobs. Guess what. They are \ngoing to pay taxes. So you invest a dollar and you get back $3.54 of \neconomic activity. And you get tax growth, not new taxes, but new \npeople paying taxes.\n  That is what we want. We want people to go to work. We want jobs in \nAmerica. We find that, if we invest in infrastructure, we have got the \nopportunity to create jobs, to increase the tax base, and grow the \neconomy.\n  Now, on the negative side, underinvesting in infrastructure costs \nAmerica over 900,000 jobs, including 97,000 jobs in manufacturing. \nThese things go together. We have fortunately had over the years a buy-\nAmerica requirement in the infrastructure financing for highways and \nbridges and the rest and for transit, that your tax dollars, my tax \ndollars, all of our tax dollars, are required to be used to buy \nAmerican-made goods, equipment, services, buses, and the like.\n  Unfortunately, it is only 50 percent. So a transit agency can take \nyour tax money and spend 50 percent of that tax money on buying a bus \nor a train from China, and the other 50 percent presumably would have \nto be spent on American-made services and goods.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Not good enough. I think it ought to be 99 percent. Why not use our \ntax money to buy American?\n  So these are the opportunities and the problems that we have \navailable to us, and that is the large outsourcing that I just talked \nabout.\n  And the solution? Make It In America. I have talked about that for 5 \nyears here on the floor. Build the American economy with Make It In \nAmerica laws and regulations. Use our tax money to buy American-made \ngoods and equipment.\n  Here is what it means. Let me give you a couple of examples of the \ngood news and the bad news. Here is why Make It In America strategies \nare important.\n  The bad news is California, my home State, where we had to rebuild \nthe San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, spanning from Oakland to the \npeninsula, San Francisco. It fell down during the '89 earthquake, and \nthen we decided we had to rebuild it.\n  Well, you know, it takes a long time to figure out how to build it \nand what it is going to look like. It took forever. However, it was a \nmultibillion-dollar project; and someone decided that it would be \ncheaper to buy Chinese steel than American steel, so they contracted \nwith a Chinese steel company. The result was 3,000 jobs in China, a \nbrand-new steel mill to manufacture the most high-quality steel. And \nwhat the Chinese sent to America was deficient. The welds were \ninsufficient. There were problems in the quality of the steel.\n  The result was, at least part of that problem was, some $3.5 billion \noverrun. That is the bad news. California really screwed up. We say, \n``Make it in America.''\n  Guess what happened on the other side of the continent? New York \nneeded to rebuild a new bridge, the New York Tappan Zee Bridge. It was \nmade with United States manufactured steel; total cost, $3.9 billion, \n7,728 American jobs because they undertook a buy America requirement, \nand they bought it in America; on time, under budget. The Tappan Zee \nBridge, good; the San Francisco Bay Bridge, bad.\n  Make it in America, buy American, that ought to be our policy.\n  I want to move on to where we are this week. On October 29, the \nUnited States Congress will engage in its favorite game: kicking the \ncan down the road.\n  We will take up a transportation and infrastructure bill in the House \nof Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee this \nweek. Good for us. Several months late, not in time for next week's \ndeadline. So we will kick the can down the road. We will give ourselves \nanother couple of months to ponder how we can address the needs of \nAmerica's infrastructure.\n  I want to suggest to you there is a way we can do it. I put this \nchart up to challenge all of us. This chart displays the opportunity as \nwell as the potential for the missed opportunity.\n  There are three new infrastructure pieces of legislation that are \nfloating around the United States Capitol. But before we go to those \nthree, I want to call your attention to where we are today.\n  Highway funding, this is today's highway funding. We are spending \nsomewhere around $264 billion on highways, $64.2 billion on transit. \nThe entire amount over a 6-year period of time--this is 6 years--is \n$319 billion. This does not include the rail system.\n  So $319 billion is what we are spending today over a 6-year period of \ntime. I have already said how inadequate that is. I won't go back \nthrough that again.\n  Now, the administration proposed but, frankly, never pushed, never \nput any weight behind it and, I think,\n\n[[Page H7016]]\n\ncopped out on what is, in my view, a very, very good bill, a \ncomprehensive bill that included rail transit--again, not included \nhere. It was a bill that had $449 billion, not including the rail, over \na 6-year period, compared to the $319 billion that we are spending \ntoday. That amounts to, what, $120 billion a year more--actually, $130 \nbillion a year more.\n  That is good. That is what we need. I misquoted that. It is $130 \nbillion over 6 years. That is the kind of money that we need to build \nthe infrastructure.\n  Highways, $317 billion, over 6 years, compared to where we are today, \n$246 billion. Significant increase, enough to fix the potholes on I-5. \nTransit, $114.6 billion over 6 years, compared to today, $64 billion \nover 6 years. The entire sum, $449 billion, compared to $319 billion \nover 6 years.\n  That is the kind of progress that we can and must make if we want to \nmove from 16th among the world's economies, developed economies, to get \nback up into the top five. That is what we need to do.\n  Now, once again, this does not include the rail transit. If you add \nthe rail transit in, these numbers are a little bigger. That is the \nkind of effort.\n  The United States Senate, what did they decide to do in their bill \ncalled the Senate DRIVE Act? $276 billion compared to $246 billion over \n6 years; $74.9 billion for transit, compared to $64 billion. That is \ngood. That is $10 billion. Better, but not enough. We actually need \nover $114 billion or $115 billion.\n  The entire sum on the Senate side, not including rail, is $361 \nbillion compared to $319 billion. Better, but not enough. Not \nsufficient to build the infrastructure that this economy and this \nsociety need to move out of 16th place back into the top tier of five.\n  Now, where is the House of Representatives?\n  This week, we are going to take up a bill that is less than the \nSenate bill and just a little, teeny, tiny bit better than what we are \ndoing today. So if you are happy with what we are doing today, you will \nlove the House bill. But if you don't want potholes, if you want to \ndeal with congestion, if you want to deal with ports and freight, if \nyou want to move from a D to a B or an A, you don't do it with the \nHouse bill.\n  I understand, this is a starting point. This is the beginning of \nnegotiations. But why in the world would you begin negotiations at the \nbottom when you need to get to the top? It beats me. I don't get it.\n  We have got to build the American infrastructure. It is how we move \nour economy. It is how we move people back to work in good, middle-\nclass jobs. It is how your tax money should be spent.\n\n  And how can we raise the revenue for this?\n  Well, we don't need to increase the gasoline or the diesel tax. Keep \nit the same, no increase. People can argue that it should or should not \nbe increased, but you don't need to.\n  This proposal, the GROW AMERICA Act, the additional $100-plus billion \ndollars over 6 years to build our infrastructure, is fully paid for by \nkeeping the gasoline and the diesel tax at the level it is today and \ngoing after the hidden profits of the United States corporations that \nhave skipped out on their responsibility to this country.\n  They are hiding their profits overseas. We need to go after those \nprofits and say: You owe it to America; bring that money back and pay \nyour just taxes. That is how this is paid for, fully paid for.\n  How much? About $120 billion over 6 years, enough to get the job \ndone.\n  American corporations won't be allowed to run away from their \nresponsibility to their country. They will pay their fair share, here \nin America. No more tax dodges overseas, folks.\n  So, where are we? The question for the Congress of the United States \nis: Are we going to go with what we have today, just a little bit more, \njust keeping up with inflation? Is that good enough for America to be \nnumber one? No, it is not.\n  Can we do better without burdening the truckers, without burdening \nthe commuters? We can, if we are willing to step up to the American \ncorporations, the big and the powerful, and say: Pay your fair share.\n  Oh, by the way, their fair share is 14 percent, which is less than \none-half of the corporate tax rate.\n  We will see what happens. The House of Representatives, the men and \nwomen that you have elected, are going to make some decisions. We will \nmake a decision about Speaker eventually. That will get taken care of \neventually. We will make some decisions about a few other things. But \nthe infrastructure issue of this Nation is fundamental to economic \ngrowth.\n  I hope we make the right decision. I hope we make the decision to \ngrow this economy, to make it in America, spend your tax dollars here \nat home, and give you the roads, the transit system, the ports, the \nfreight movement, the airports that you need and America needs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7016-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7016-H7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING AMERICA'S PHARMACISTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to \nbe here this evening. It is a good time to be back here on the floor \ntonight, especially after coming back from a week, I am always very \npleased to go see home, be a part of folks who get outside this \nbeltway, get outside where they get up in morning, they go to work, \nthey do the things that families do and communities do, and they do so \nwith a sense of purpose and work.\n  I think tonight we are going to bring to light, during our time \ntogether, we are going to talk about some of the great folks, our \nAmerican pharmacists and the battle that they carry on every day. They \nare true champions on the front lines of health care.\n  Tonight we are going to be joined by several people. My good \ncolleague from Georgia, Buddy Carter, is going to be here. Dave \nLoebsack from Iowa is going to be here as well. We will have many \npeople come in and out.\n  Over the next 60 minutes, I hope the words that we speak will \nencourage and inspire those who care for our constituents in their time \nof need.\n  Back in 1925, the first celebration of National Pharmaceutical Week \nwas held October 11-17. In 2004, American Pharmacists Month was \nlaunched to bring greater awareness to the expanding role of \npharmacists in the healthcare system and recognize their unwavering \ncommitment to patient care.\n  On October 1, we celebrated Pharmacist Appreciation Day and \nparticipated in the third annual tweet-a-thon. This year, there were \n7,214 tweets from 1,285 tweeters, and I wanted to share some of my \nfavorite ones at this time.\n  They say:\n\n       Can you give me a flu shot through the drive-through?\n       We do more than count pills. We ensure medication safety \n     for our patients in a variety of settings. We save lives.\n       We filled insulin for a patient after she was refused by \n     the big box pharmacies.\n       What does Batman have in common with your pharmacist? They \n     save lives.\n       I wanted to be a pharmacist because in my small town, \n     doctors rotated in and out, but the pharmacist knew my \n     community.\n\n  Every year, the American Pharmacists Association Academy of Student \nPharmacists creates a national theme to encourage and advocate for the \nprofession of pharmacy, and this year the theme is: Live your ``why.'' \nWe are going to come back to that a lot tonight, Live your ``why.''\n  It is incredible to read the outpouring of stories from student \npharmacists around the country.\n  Hannah Holbrook is a pharmacy student at ULM, one of the most active \nand committed student pharmacist chapters in the Nation. She told a \nlocal paper: ``Even as students, we can be leaders and have impact on \npatients.''\n  I believe the next generation of pharmacists is going to do truly \nremarkable things that could radically transform patient care, but it \nwon't happen unless Congress acts. We must act to level the playing \nfield so independent and community pharmacists can not only compete, \nall they are asking for is a chance, and we need to make sure that we \nstep up and do that.\n  Tonight, like I said, we are going to share from many as we go \ntonight, but I want to start off with Representative Blum, who has come \ndown to speak\n\n[[Page H7017]]\n\nwith us. He has got to run off on some other events, but we wanted to \nget you here tonight. We are glad that you are here to speak on this \nimportant issue for your community and others.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum).\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of pharmacies across \nthe country, especially the independent community pharmacies who \noperate in a tough business climate to serve rural areas and provide \npatients with convenient, affordable, and personal care.\n  In my home State of Iowa, 72 of our 99 counties are considered \nmedically underserved; and of these, 27 are served by only one \npharmacy. Many of these areas are rural, and a large number of citizens \nin these sparsely populated areas rely on their community pharmacy for \naccess to lifesaving drugs and treatments.\n  Unfortunately, the implementation of Federal policy to address the \nrising costs of drugs has left independent community pharmacists at a \ndisadvantage. Often unable to cover the costs of maintaining and \nmanaging a storefront, community pharmacies are closing their doors at \nan alarming rate. This leaves many Americans without access to the \ntimely, efficient, and personal patient services they provide.\n  To that end, I am most happy to cosponsor H.R. 592, to ensure that \npharmacists are recognized as providers under Medicare part B so that \nmy constituents can have access to local healthcare services instead of \ntraveling long distances to seek out care.\n  Additionally, I am also proud to work with the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Collins) as well as my colleagues across the aisle, such as \nCongressman Dave Loebsack from the Second District of Iowa, to lower \nthe cost of drugs and promote fair competition and choice, which will \nultimately benefit patients.\n  I will continue to work to pass legislation, such as H.R. 244, to \nincrease the transparency of drug payment rates under Medicare part D \nand TRICARE, while ensuring a fair, competitive market for generic \ndrugs.\n  Finally, I wish to highlight the work of Hartig Drug Stores, the \nsecond-oldest family-owned independent drugstore company in America, \nwhich has locations throughout my district, including my hometown of \nDubuque, Iowa. Hartig's pharmacies operate in three States, employing \n437 people.\n  I believe we should be enacting policies that allow these kinds of \nlocal pharmacies to thrive instead of shut down. My hope is that \nthrough the continued hard work of their dedicated employees and the \nimplementation of better policies at the Federal level, these family \nbusinesses will continue to serve patients in and around my district \nfor many years to come.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Blum.\n  I think what you have recognized are the struggles that are going on \nright now. And what I have found--I was speaking with a Member tonight \nfrom one of our Midwestern districts. It was on the floor as we were \nvoting earlier. I started explaining what was going on in our \nindependent pharmacies. This Member did not know. They had not had a \nchance to interact. They didn't know what was going on and the changes \nthat were going on. So you being here tonight helps highlight that.\n  I think as we educate Members, this is just an inequity that is in \nour healthcare system that needs to be fixed.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum) being here.\n  There are many things that are talked about in our time up here. Many \ntimes, we talk about not being able to work together. This is an issue \nthat draws us together.\n  Mr. Loebsack and I have worked through two Congresses now on this \nissue. We are going to work on more together. It is my honor to yield \nto the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack) to expound on this because we \nhave been working on this for a while, and it is good to have you here \ntonight.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Thank you, Mr. Collins. It is great to be here. I know \nthat you folks have a lot of things going on on your side of the aisle, \nand it is a testament to your commitment to this issue that you have \ngotten a number of your colleagues here tonight to speak to this issue, \nto speak to the importance of independent and community pharmacists.\n  It is really, really important for America that we talk about this. \nAnd as Mr. Collins said--and Mr. Carter, I appreciate your invitation \nas well--it is really important that we speak to how important these \nfolks are for our communities, for health care, for their patients.\n  Mr. Blum, thank you for being here tonight as well.\n  Mr. Blum represents the district that borders me to the north, and he \nmentioned the Hartig pharmacy. They have a pharmacy in Iowa City, and I \ntook a little bit of time out of my schedule a couple years ago to \nvisit there and to hear the problems that they have when it comes to \nall kinds of issues.\n  This month, of course, is American Pharmacists Month. It is a month \nduring which we recognize the important role that pharmacies play in \nour communities. Pharmacists are, in fact, frontline healthcare \nproviders, and they are counselors for many patients who consistently \ndepend on their training and expertise to stay informed, to stay \nhealthy, and to stay out of the hospital. They also play an incredibly \nimportant role in strengthening the economies of the areas they serve, \nparticularly in rural counties like so many of those that I represent \nof the 24 counties I have.\n  It is also crucial that these pharmacies have a level playing field, \nas was already mentioned by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum), when \ntrying to run a successful business in a challenging and complex \nenvironment. Like most small-business owners, community pharmacists \nface many challenges to compete and negotiate on a day-to-day basis \nwith large entities on their business transactions.\n  I have personally visited, as I have said, many of these pharmacies \nin my district, the Second District. I have learned firsthand how they \noften struggle to compete.\n  One problem I have heard, for example, from many pharmacists is that \nthe reimbursement system--and I am sure we are going to hear more from \nfolks about that tonight--for generic drugs is largely unregulated; \nand it is, in fact, a mystery to many folks. Generic prescription drugs \naccount for the vast majority of drugs dispensed, so it is critical for \npharmacists' bottom line that their reimbursement is transparent.\n\n  However, pharmacists are reimbursed for generics via the maximum \nallowable cost, or MAC, lists created by pharmacy benefits managers, \nPBMs--the drug plan middleman, something we have heard so much about. \nBut the methodology used to create these lists is not disclosed. It is \na secret. It shouldn't be a secret. It should be open. We need to have \ntransparency on this front. Also, the lists aren't updated on a regular \nbasis, resulting in pharmacists often being reimbursed below what it \ncosts them to actually acquire the drugs. That makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  So to address the problem, I partnered with the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Collins) to introduce H.R. 244, the MAC Transparency Act. \nWe have a lot of folks onboard on this. It is a bipartisan bill at a \ntime when, as Mr. Collins said, there is not a lot of bipartisanship in \nthis body at the moment.\n  Basically, what this bill would do is it would ensure that Federal \nhealth plan reimbursements to pharmacies keep pace with generic drug \nprices, which can skyrocket overnight, as we know.\n  I am not going to go into great detail at the moment. We have got \ntime to talk about this a little bit more. There are other things we \ncan talk about tonight. But I just wanted to say a few things at the \noutset and to just thank you again, Mr. Collins and Mr. Carter, for \nsetting this particular time aside so we can really educate our \ncolleagues, as much as anything, about the problems facing independent \ncommunity pharmacists.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I thank my colleague. I do appreciate that.\n  And that is the issue here: education. People can look in on this. \nThey can hear what we are talking about. They can see this education \npart of it.\n  This is found in every district. It is almost like veterans. There is \nno Member of Congress that doesn't have veterans' issues, because they \ncome from\n\n[[Page H7018]]\n\nevery area. Every one of our districts has independent pharmacists. And \nas one told me just the other day, he said, if the condition doesn't \nchange, they will be gone in a year and a half.\n  I have had, even in my area, county governments who believe that they \ncan cut their healthcare costs by going and taking the pharmacies and \nputting them with a PBM and centralizing it for county employees. They \nsaid that they would save X amount of dollars. And when I called my \ncounty commissioner and asked him about this, I said: You save this \namount of money. But, I said: If you realize, if you take county \nemployees out of the system, government operating this--and this is \nsomeone on my side of the aisle. I told him: You take government and \nput this in control, you are going to put pharmacies out of business. \nAnd I said: How much do you save when they have to lay off employees? \nThey shutter their businesses, and you lose sales tax, property tax, \nand the peripheral income that comes with that.\n  We have got to address it, and that is why we are here tonight. This \neducational process is important.\n  When you come up through the legislative ranks--whether it is here in \nCongress or the State house, where I started, you meet folks who you \nlearn to have a great deal of respect for, especially from the places \nthat they have come and what they have done in the past.\n  Buddy Carter, the Congressman from the southeast coastline of \nGeorgia, is one of those who actually is a pharmacist.\n  I think one of the things I want to emphasize tonight is--and some \npeople might be saying: Why are you bashing pharmacists? We are not \nbashing pharmacists. Pharmacists are great. I love them. No matter \nwhere they work, it is the system that they are trapped in that is \nbroken, that is hurting the individuals who need that care.\n  So tonight we are going to have a great perspective from one in the \nprofession who understands this firsthand, from owning those \npharmacies, but also dispensing and taking care of patients.\n  With that, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Thank you, Representative Collins, and thank \nyou for hosting this tonight. This is certainly a very important \nsubject. It is very important to me, personally, yes, but it is more \nimportant to our healthcare system.\n  Mr. Speaker, for over 2,000 years, the practice of pharmacies has \nexisted to help people with their ailments. Today, the most common \npharmacy position is that of the community pharmacist. Community \npharmacists are the front lines of medication, instructing and \ncounseling on the proper use and adverse effects of medically \nprescribed drugs.\n  However, over the past decade, there have been several issues that \nhave threatened the role of community pharmacists. Being a community \npharmacist myself, I know these issues all too well. I believe that \nthere are three main issues that we can address in Congress that will \nallow the community pharmacists to continue to fill the invaluable role \nof counseling Americans on the proper use and dangers of prescription \nmedications.\n  First of all, MAC pricing transparency.\n  When I became a Member of the United States Congress and I got \ninvolved in government, I jokingly said that if I could learn 10 \npercent of all the acronyms in the Federal Government, I think I would \nhave been a success. Then I got to thinking about it, and I feel a \nlittle silly now because there are a lot of acronyms in pharmacy as \nwell. One of those is MAC, M-A-C, maximum allowable cost. Another is \nPBM, pharmacy benefits manager.\n  Now let's talk about MAC pricing transparency. This is a bill that is \nbeing offered, and this is a situation that needs to be taken care of. \nIt needs to be addressed. It is perhaps one of the most pressing--if \nnot the most pressing--issues facing community pharmacists right now.\n  MAC is a price list. The maximum allowable cost is a price list that \nlists the upper limit or the maximum amount that an insurance plan will \npay for a generic drug. In other words, if you have a generic drug and \nit is on that MAC list, they are going to tell you what the maximum \nallowable cost is. That maximum allowable cost may be $10. Now, if you \ncan buy it for $9, more power to you; but if you have to buy it for \n$11, you are only going to get paid $10. That is why they call it the \nmaximum allowable cost.\n\n  Each insurance plan sets the maximum allowable cost for the plan. \nSome States require them to follow a certain policy, if you will, a \ncertain procedure when they set those plans, those prices. Most States \ndon't. In a lot of States that don't, the insurance companies can set \nit wherever they want to, whatever they want to set it at. They may \nchoose a drug that is only available in a certain area for a certain \nprice.\n  For instance, if I am in southeast Georgia, I may not be able to get \nthat drug at that price that they set it at because they used the price \nthat it is available in the northeast and is not available to us in the \nsoutheast. That is why we have got to have transparency. That is why we \nhave got to have maximum allowable cost transparency.\n  PBMs are supposed to ensure that the cost of the drugs do not rise to \nunaffordable price levels, which is supposed to allow continued access \nto medications to Americans and maintain low costs for employers who \nprovide coverage for those employees, and that is very important. They \nare supposed to set those prices so that their plan's recipients, the \nones that are covered, are able to get those medications.\n  Therein lies a couple of problems. One is what I just explained, that \nit is not always available at the price that they set. A second is that \nsometimes the price goes up. We know that the price of generics have \nbeen going up significantly and rapidly. When that happens, sometimes \nthe insurance companies, the PBMs, are slow to raise their MAC prices, \nwhich means that if I have got a MAC price of $10 and, overnight, the \nprice of that drug went up to $20, until the insurance company raises \nthe MAC price, I am still going to get paid $10 even though it is \ncosting me $20. That cannot be sustainable for community pharmacists.\n  Community pharmacy is somewhat different from other healthcare \nproviders in that we have a product. We actually have a product that we \nhave to pay for. We have that product.\n  Now, granted, doctors' offices have injectables they have to pay for \nand so and so, and we understand that. But in community pharmacy, we \nactually have that product on our shelf, and we have got to pay for it, \nregardless of how much we get paid for it. The wholesaler doesn't say: \nWell, how much did you get paid for it? That is how much we are going \nto charge you.\n  We wish it worked that way, but it doesn't work that way.\n  The way it works is they have got a set price. If it is $20 and I am \nonly getting paid $10 for it, I am losing that $10.\n  Now, some of you may think: Well, you can make up that $10, can't \nyou, and charge the patient? No. You can't do that.\n  If they have got a copay, that copay is $5, that is what they pay. I \ncan't charge them $15 to make up for that difference. That is not \nallowed. That is one of the things that is leading to the detriment of \nthe community pharmacy.\n  But perhaps an even more important point there is what happens with \nthe patient. Because, keep in mind, ultimately what we are talking \nabout here, when we are talking about keeping community pharmacies \nopen, when we are talking about making certain that this provider is \navailable, we are talking about the patients.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  We are talking about the patient and patient care. If I am not able \nto pay for that medication because I am not getting reimbursed enough, \nthat patient is not going to get the medication, and that is going to \nlead to even more medical costs. That is why this is so vitally \nimportant. In the end, what it comes to is patient care.\n  What is the problem? What is the problem with PBMs, with the pharmacy \nbenefits managers? First of all, there is no transparency. There is no \ntransparency in the contracts with the PBMs. For example, several years \nago Meridian Health Systems, a nonprofit that owns and operates six \nhospitals in southern New Jersey, hired a PBM to help reduce their \nsurging medication\n\n[[Page H7019]]\n\ncosts for its 12,000 employees and their families.\n  This PBM projected it would slice at least $763,000 from Meridian's \n$12 million in annual medication spending. Just 3 months into the \ncontract Meridian was on pace to balloon by $1.3 million. This PBM \ninsisted that it was actually saving Meridian money. It was not.\n  After some investigation by Meridian, Meridian discovered that this \nPBM was making huge gross profits ranging from $5 per prescription to \nmultiple times that amount. In one example, Meridian was charged $92.53 \non a generic bottle of antibiotics while the PBM only paid $26.91 to \nget the prescription filled. That is a profit spread of $65.62.\n  Therein lies the problem in what is referred to as the spread, the \ndifference between what the PBM actually charged the company and the \ndifference in what they actually paid for. That is the spread that the \nPBMs work on.\n  The amount that PBMs charge the small businesses, the customer, or \nthe government under part D of Medicare can be significantly more than \nwhat it actually costs for them to fill the prescription. As I \nmentioned, PBMs don't always update their price list in a reasonable \namount of time. This hurts pharmacies, and more than that, again, it \nhurts patients.\n  There has been evidence to suggest that some PBMs wait until 4 to 6 \nmonths to update that reimbursement rates after a drug price rises. \nThere has been evidence of that.\n  I have experienced that while I was still working. Ten months ago, \nbefore I entered Congress, before I became a Member of Congress, when I \nwas still running my drugstore, I experienced this. I experienced where \na product would go up in cost, yet the PBM would not adjust their \nprice, their cost, their MAC.\n  We would have months, literally months, where we were getting paid \nless than what we were having to pay for the drug. Obviously, that is \nnot sustainable. That business model doesn't work for anyone regardless \nof who it is.\n  This leaves pharmacists getting reimbursed for drug prices that could \nbe extremely out of date. Any small business in the country can't \nsustain operability when they don't know how much it costs to provide \nthe customer with their service. You are basically asking a business \nowner to operate with no understanding of revenue. No one in the \ncountry can operate a business like this.\n  We need as much transparency as possible to make sure that PBMs are \ndoing what they were created to do. My colleague from Georgia (Mr. \nCollins) has introduced H.R. 244, the MAC Transparency Act, which would \nprovide much-needed transparency to the operations of PBMs and provide \npharmacies, businesses, and Americans a better understanding of their \ninsurance coverage and the true drug costs. This is a very important \npiece of legislation.\n  Another issue that is very important and extremely important to \npharmacists is provider status. Now, Mr. Speaker, I graduated from \npharmacy school in 1980. I have what is known as a bachelor of pharmacy \ndegree. Back then it was a 5-year degree. The pharmacists that are \ngraduating now are graduating with a doctor of pharmacy degree, a 4-\nyear professional degree that usually comes after a bachelor's degree.\n  In most cases, they have at least 6 and, in most cases, 8 years of \neducation. Their clinical expertise is so impressive right now. The \npractice of pharmacy has changed so much during the years that I have \nbeen practicing. I have seen it go from where we did nothing more than \nfill prescriptions to where now the pharmacist is a vital member of the \nhealthcare team.\n  Mr. Collins mentioned a little while ago about someone asking if they \ncould get a flu shot in a drive-through. We have actually seen that \ndone sometimes. But the point that I want to make is pharmacists now \nare actually administering vaccines.\n  How does that help us? How does that help Americans? How does that \nhelp our healthcare system? Obviously, our vaccination rate improves. \nKeep in mind, in south Georgia, where I represent, rural health care is \na concern. We quite often say that, in Georgia, there are two Georgias. \nThere is north Georgia and the Atlanta metro area and then there is the \nrest of Georgia.\n  Access to health care is very important in south Georgia, \nparticularly in the rural area of south Georgia, where you find that \npharmacists are some of the most accessible healthcare professionals \nout there. If it were not for our pharmacists, many of these patients \nwould not get those vaccinations, and that is very important. It is \nvery important that we have provider status for pharmacists.\n  The U.S. healthcare system has come into an era of integrated care \ndelivery systems that provide all-encompassing care to Americans. This \nnew structure of care will provide Americans with the type of care that \nallows constant collaboration with all sectors of health care to \nprovide the highest level of care.\n  As all of us know, the majority of Americans that rely on healthcare \nprofessionals are the elderly. However, under part B of Medicare, \npharmacists are excluded from the list of providers under Medicare part \nB.\n  This is something that is going to have to change. Regardless of how \nyou might feel about the Affordable Care Act, regardless of how you \nmight feel about what is our state of health care here in America now, \none thing is for certain. We are going to have to utilize all \ndisciplines in health care to improve our system. We are going to have \nto utilize pharmacists. We are going to have to utilize nurses and \nphysician's assistants. We are going to have to make use of all of \nthose.\n\n  Now, to my physician friends, make no mistake about it. Doctors \nremain the quarterback. They remain the captains of the team. We have \nto have them. They are essential. But these services that have been \nprovided in the old model where doctors did everything and the other \nhealthcare professionals didn't participate has got to change in order \nfor health care to sustain here in America.\n  We have got to utilize these. My wife is a physical therapist. The \nphysical therapists who are graduating now, again, are so clinically \noriented and they can do so much more. We find that in all different \naspects in allied health care.\n  That is something that we have to do. That is why it is vitally \nimportant that we have provider status for pharmacists, physicians, \nphysician's assistants, certified nurse practitioners, qualified \npsychologists, clinical social workers, certified nurse midwives, and \ncertified registered nurse anesthetists.\n  All of those are reimbursable and covered under Medicare part B, but \npharmacists are not. Pharmacists need to be included in that. These \nprofessionals make up a healthcare team that provides an integrated \nhealthcare plan for the treatment of a patient. However, I have never \nexperienced a patient that required this level of care without being \nprescribed medications. It is a vital part of it.\n  If we don't get the medications to them, the whole process fails. Why \ndoes the patient go to the doctor and spend all this time being \ndiagnosed and this doctor use all of his expertise in diagnosing this \npatient if they are not going to get the medications? It is a vital \npart.\n  We refer to it as a three-legged stool where you have got the \nphysician, you have got the pharmacist, and you have got the patient. \nAll of them have to work together to make the system work.\n  If we really want to provide a fully integrated healthcare system, \npharmacists' services should be included under Medicare. This is why my \nfriend from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) has introduced H.R. 592, the \nPharmacy in Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act. This \nlegislation would include pharmacists under the list of providers under \nMedicare part B and provide a true integrated healthcare team for \nMedicare patients.\n  Finally, the third thing that we need to do and that Congress can \ndo--some health plans, particularly Medicare prescription plans, have \nselected certain pharmacies to be the plan's preferred provider. We \nmust have any willing provider, pharmacy legislation, rather than allow \ninsurance plans to pick and choose a preferred pharmacy.\n  Now, this is something I have, unfortunately, a lot of experience \nwith. I have been practicing for over 34 years\n\n[[Page H7020]]\n\nnow. Let me tell you, I have had patients who have been with me that \nlong. They are a part of my family.\n  I have provided services to them. They have come to my store. I have \nprovided generations of services to them, to their parents, to their \ngrandparents, and now to them and to their children. Yet, they at the \nfirst of the year come to me, some of them in tears, and tell me, ``I \nhave got to change pharmacies. I don't want to. But my insurance plan \nis telling me that this is the only pharmacy I can use.''\n  Sometimes the PBMs will mask it by saying, ``Well, that is not true. \nThey can use you. They can go ahead and pay for the medications and \nsubmit us the receipts and we will see if we can reimburse them or they \ncan go to our preferred pharmacy and pay the $5 copay.'' That is not a \nchoice. That is not a choice at all.\n  Other plans will tell you, ``Okay. You can use this pharmacy outside \nof our preferred network if you want to. The copay is going to be $45. \nBut if you use our preferred pharmacy, the copay is going be to $5.''\n  Well, let me tell you, if you have 10 prescriptions, as a lot of \nelderly patients do, are you going to pay $450 as opposed to $50? That \nis not a choice. That is not something that is going to lead patients \nto stay with their pharmacy.\n  They are going to have to change, and they don't want to do that. Mr. \nSpeaker, having a choice makes a difference. These relationships that \npatients have with their healthcare providers are very, very important.\n  So my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Griffith) has offered legislation \nto remedy this problem. The Ensuring Seniors Access to Local Pharmacies \nAct of 2015 would allow Medicare enrollees to keep their longtime \npharmacist if that pharmacist agrees to the terms and conditions of the \nMedicare prescription drug plan.\n  In providing this reform, we will be able to provide a free market \nsystem for prescription drug plans that will lower cost while also \nproviding comfort to Americans. This is win-win.\n  Now, before you say, ``Oh, Buddy, all you are saying is that you want \nto force people to have to do this,'' no, not at all. I am a free \nmarket guy. You will not meet more of a free market person than me. All \nwe are asking to do is to have the ability to compete. That is all we \nare asking to do, to participate in the free market.\n  If the insurance company--if the PBM, sets the reimbursement, if I \nsee, okay, this is the reimbursement they are going to pay me, if I am \nwilling to accept that reimbursement, I should be able to participate. \nThat is all we are saying.\n  Give us the opportunity, if we are a willing provider, to \nparticipate. Select Networks are hurting us. But, more importantly--\nmore importantly--they are hurting the patients.\n  Why is that? Because now the patient, instead of going to my pharmacy \nwhere it is convenient, where they have been going for 34 years, where \ntheir parents went, where their grandparents went, are having to go and \ntravel long distances, particularly in south Georgia, to get to the \npharmacy that is a Select pharmacy, the Select provider. A lot of times \nthey just do without. Then what happens? Then all of a sudden medical \ncosts rise, and we don't see adherence. That is a problem.\n\n  So those three things, Mr. Speaker, are three things that are very \nimportant to community pharmacies.\n  I want to thank again my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for \nbringing this up and let you know that I have been honored to serve as \na pharmacist. I think it is a noble profession.\n  But, most importantly, I want to make sure you understand this is \nabout the patients. If community pharmacies don't survive, this is \ngoing to mean that health care in this country suffers.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from \nGeorgia and his passionate defense of what we are doing here tonight.\n  Earlier this month many of my colleagues and I sent a letter to CMS \nin support of proposed guidance to ensure part D plan cosponsors \nconsistently report pharmacy price concessions. That letter was led by \nfellow Georgian and a good champion of pharmacists, Austin Scott, and \nit is my pleasure to yield some time to him now.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Collins and Mr. Loebsack. \nI appreciate your being here. This is certainly a bipartisan issue and \ngets to the heart of some of the challenges in health care in our \ncountry right now. I certainly rise today in support of our Nation's \ncommunity pharmacists and our pharmacies which play a critical role in \nour healthcare system.\n  Many of these independent businesses operate in underserved areas \nlike the ones that I represent in rural Georgia, 24 counties. In areas \nwhere a doctor may be many miles away, local pharmacists deliver flu \nshots, give advice on over-the-counter drugs, and help with late-night \ndrugstore runs for sick kids.\n  Many people see their pharmacists much more often than their doctor, \nand there is a very personal relationship between these community \npharmacists, patients, and the physician. They are community pillars, \nand they contribute greatly to the economies. It is crucial that these \npharmacies have a level playing field when trying to run a successful \nbusiness in a challenging and complex environment.\n  As you know, Mr. Collins, I was an insurance broker for many years. I \nthought I might tell a very personal story about one of my clients who, \nshortly after their contract was issued, the gentleman's child got sick \nand they needed a prescription filled. So they went to the local big \nbox pharmacist or pharmacy, and they wouldn't fill it for them.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Even when I, as the agent, could provide evidence that the person was \ninsured without the card, they simply would not fill the gentleman's \nprescription. The local community pharmacist was the one that filled \nthe script.\n  Now, the irony of it and what we are talking about here and where the \nreal problem comes in is that, when the person got their insurance card \nbecause of the PBMs, they could no longer use that community pharmacist \nthat was the only one that would provide the service that they needed \nwhen they actually needed it.\n  So it is extremely important that, when we have these business \nmodels, we keep those local community pharmacists where they are able \nto run a successful business and stay in business.\n  During the August district work period, I stopped by another \ndrugstore, a small drug store in Quitman that had been there many, many \nyears. Generations of people have continued to rely on them for their \nservices.\n  While I was there, I watched one of our senior citizens, a lovely \nlady, come in. The owner called her by name. They caught up on family \nand friends and what was going on in life, and she had some questions \nabout the medications.\n  And let me tell you that pharmacist knew the answer to every single \none. He knew her history with those medications and was able to answer \nthose questions that she asked. She left there with a smile on her face \nknowing that she knew what she needed to take, when she needed to take \nit, and what she needed to take it with.\n  As I stopped at these local community pharmacies like the ones I \nvisited in August, I continued to hear concerns from them about what is \nhappening in the pricing structure and that, if the price on a drug \ngoes up, the insurance company has the ability and takes several months \nto change the rate when the price goes up. But if the price comes down, \nas happens in free market sometimes, they immediately reduce the price \nthat they reimburse to the pharmacist.\n  There should be no excuse for the difference in the timeframe in \nwhich the reimbursement occurs. If it can be done when the price is \nchanging to the downside, it can certainly be done in the same time \nlimit when the price is changing to the upside.\n  A lot of things we have seen lately in pharmacy. We saw where a \nventure capitalist purchased a drug and raised the price of that drug \nseveral thousandfold overnight. That has been happening, and local \ncommunity pharmacists have expressed concerns with this issue for many \nyears.\n  It has happened with nitroglycerine tablets, for example, that has \nbeen around for decades and decades. They\n\n[[Page H7021]]\n\nhave gone from 8 cents apiece to $8 apiece. Digoxin for a heart \ncondition, doxycycline, the same thing has happened with these drugs.\n  How is this happening? And who is going to help us fix this if not \nfor the ability to get the information from their local community \npharmacist?\n  They are the ones that care the most, and they are the ones that are \nwilling to help resolve the challenges with the higher drug costs in \nthis country.\n  So one would ask: How is it that, in many cases, our local \npharmacists are kept from being able to participate in the networks? \nWell, in many cases, the networks that are blocking out the local \ncommunity pharmacists are actually owned by the big box pharmacies.\n  If you want to talk about a conflict of interest, that is about as \nconflicted as it gets when your big box pharmacists own the network \nthat actually can determine who you can get your drugs from and they \nbox out their own competition.\n  Quite honestly, I think it would be a wonderful issue for the Federal \nTrade Commission to get involved in and to bring competition back into \nthat area.\n  One of the things that I think would help is H.R. 793, the Ensuring \nSeniors Access to Local Pharmacies Act of 2015. I want to thank my \ncolleagues that are here that are also cosponsors for it.\n  This bill allows community pharmacies that are located in medically \nunderserved areas or areas that have health professional shortages the \nability to participate in Medicare part D in the preferred pharmacy \nnetworks so long as they are willing to accept the contract terms and \nconditions that other in-network providers operate under.\n  This is reasonable. This is patient choice. This keeps the small \nbusiness owner out there. Let me ask you to make no mistake about it. \nThis is big business versus small business.\n  One of the other things that I want to talk about is MAC, the maximum \nallowable cost. Pharmacists are often reimbursed for generics by this \nMAC list. You have heard Buddy Carter talk about this earlier. He \ncertainly knows more about it than I do. This list is created by the \nPBMs, but nobody knows how they create this list.\n  As patients, we have a right to determine how the costs are derived \nfor the drugs that we are going to take. And understand this. It is not \na manufacturer's cost. It is not a manufacturer's cost. It is a maximum \nallowable cost. When the lists are updated, certainly it should be done \nin a timely manner.\n  I am happy to have cosponsored H.R. 244, and I certainly hope to see \nthat bipartisan bill pass.\n  With that, Mr. Collins, thank you for taking the lead on this issue.\n  Our local community pharmacists are extremely important to our \nhealthcare system. There is a way to create a scenario under which the \npatients have more choice and that requires keeping that local \ncommunity pharmacist in business.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Well, Mr. Scott, I don't disagree with you. I \nthank you for being here. You have been a great champion to this cause \nas well.\n  I think the interesting thing here--I want to repeat--basically, what \nwe are going back to is some simple fixes. We are not asking for one to \nbe preferred over another one.\n  I think exactly what the PBMs actually want is they want to prefer \nand they want to run you into their network and control you.\n  And, by the way, most people don't realize that a lot of our \ncommunity pharmacists have to buy from PBM, who operate other big box \nstores, who, in turn, then audit them and can fine them if they don't \nfollow the plan exactly.\n\n  These are the kind of crazy things that just obviously----\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Can I repeat one thing you just said \nright there?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. They get to audit their competitors. \nNow, in what other scenario in the world could you say it is a free \nmarket when your competitor, who is the big box multi-billion-dollar \noperation, gets to audit their small business competitor?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. It is baffling. That is why H.R. 244 simply \nsays you have 7 days to update the list, number one. Number two, it \nsays that patients will not be forced by PBMs to use a PBM-owned \npharmacy, an obvious conflict of interest.\n  And according to Medicare data, PBM on mail order pharmacies may \ncharge plans more, as much as 83 percent more, to fill prescriptions \nthan community pharmacies.\n  Mr. Loebsack, you have been with us on this from day one. Tell me \nsome more about what you are hearing out there.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Oh, my gosh. First of all, I want to thank Mr. Carter. \nIt is testimonials like his that I have been hearing for the last 10 \nyears, since I have been in Congress, since I first went to an \nindependent community pharmacist, and you spoke with such great \npassion.\n  You are not alone, as you know. Every single person like you in my \ndistrict can tell me the same things that you have told me. That is why \nI am on these bills. That is why I am talking tonight about these \nissues.\n  I don't have the firsthand experience that you have as a pharmacist. \nThe closest I ever got to a pharmacy, other than picking up my \nprescription drugs, before I got into Congress was when I was 16 and 17 \nyears old. I was a delivery boy for Greenville Pharmacy in Sioux City, \nIowa, which, by the way, still exists, since 1969. Actually, longer ago \nthan that it was established. But I would deliver prescription drugs to \nfolks, especially to the elderly who couldn't get out of their home, \nwho couldn't get to the pharmacy.\n  That is what this is about, as you said. It is about making sure \nultimately. And as a Member of Congress, my job is to make sure that \nfolks have access to affordable quality health care.\n  And that is where pharmacists play such an important role, whether it \nis with medication therapy management or just simply consulting on an \ninformal basis with someone who comes in and has a lot of different \nprescriptions and is confused by what to take and when to take them.\n  You folks really do such a wonderful job. And if we lost that \nservice, as you said, because of unfair business practices, because of \nbeing squeezed by the big guys--and it doesn't make any sense at all \nfor that to happen--then patients would suffer in the end.\n  That is why I support both of these pieces of legislation, two of \nthese that have been mentioned already. 244, which Mr. Collins just \nmentioned again, to make sure that everyone understands what it is \nabout, it is a measure that will increase transparency of generic drug \npayment rates in Medicare part D and the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits program, which serves a lot of folks, as we know, millions of \nfolks, and in the TRICARE pharmacy program by requiring those PBMs, \none, to provide pricing updates at least once every 7 days. That \ndoesn't seem like a lot to ask, to me, and I am sure it doesn't seem \nlike a lot to ask for you; number two, disclose the sources used to \nupdate that MAC list and to notify pharmacies of any changes in \nindividual drug prices before these prices can be used as a basis of \nreimbursement. This is complete common sense. That is why there are \nRepublicans and Democrats alike on this bill, and I hope we can move \nthis bill forward.\n  In Iowa, the State legislature did pass something not quite this \ncomprehensive, but something similar to this, because in Iowa folks \nunderstand what these PBMs are doing and what those independent \ncommunity pharmacists are up against.\n  And the second piece of legislation, H.R. 592 that was already \nreferenced, again, a bipartisan piece of legislation, has got 218 \ncosponsors. If memory serves me, that is exactly the number we need, if \neverybody votes, to pass a piece of legislation in this body. We could \nget it done. If we brought it to the floor, we could get it done.\n  Maybe we ought to do a discharge petition. Sorry. I don't mean to \ncreate too many anxieties there with you folks. But, nonetheless, we \nhave got to get this thing done. It is about making sure that our \npharmacists are able to continue to deliver the kind of quality health \ncare.\n  Look, whatever we decide at the Federal level when it comes to \nutilizing pharmacists to their full potential, this legislation does \nstipulate that nothing\n\n[[Page H7022]]\n\nwill override State scope of practice laws as well.\n  Because I know that a lot of folks in other professions have concerns \nabout that, that pharmacists are going to go too far. Well, they are \nnot going to. If States have laws in place about scope of practice, \nthis legislation will not override that.\n  But it is about making sure, as Mr. Carter said and as Mr. Collins \nwould agree and others who have been so active on these issues would \nagree--it is about making sure that folks get the quality care that \nthey need.\n  If we close down these pharmacies in these rural areas--95 percent of \nthe folks in Iowa are within 5 miles of an independent community \npharmacist--if they close down those pharmacies, those folks in my \ndistrict who depend upon those pharmacies and those pharmacists are \ngoing to suffer. That is unacceptable to me.\n  Thanks again for giving me the time to speak on this.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Loebsack, you hit it right. There are so \nmany times we get to talking policy and big picture up here. The bottom \nline is what we do up here--and when I was in the State legislature, \nyou could see it because you were a little bit closer--States are \nstarting to pick up this mantle, as you just said, in Iowa and other \nStates. But it goes back to that feeling of what I call security.\n\n  Now, as I said just a few minutes ago, the pharmacist is not the \nissue. The pharmacist is someone who helps in the curing process. They \nare part of that.\n  I don't want to ever have anyone who happened to watch this to say, \n``Why are you bashing pharmacists?'' We are not bashing pharmacists. \nWhat we are taking shots at and what we are trying to find solutions \nfor is an abusive practice that has been set up in the name of saving \nmoney at the expense of the patient. That is unacceptable.\n  It is time we have a hearing up here on those kind of abuses. I call \nfor that. I call for the bills to be brought to the floor. Let's do \nthose kind of things. We have got 26 cosponsors and growing daily on \nH.R. 244. They are understanding the issue.\n  As we go into this thing, one of the things that I talked about \nearlier and I said I was going to come back to was: Live your ``why.'' \nYou know, think about this. I want everybody to have a choice. If you \nlike going to the big box and getting your bananas, your shotgun \nshells, and your aspirin at the same place, go for it. That is great. I \nlove it.\n  But if you want to go to there and then go by and see your pharmacist \nwho opened up, hung a shingle, so to speak, had that American Dream, he \nsells other things--and in my pharmacy I can get a scoop of ice cream \nand I sit there and talk and I see people and see life. That is what it \nis about. It is not about forcing us in.\n  That is one of the problems that on our side we have had about health \ncare in general. The government, that is not the place. This is an area \nwhere we have got our thumb sort of on the scale, and we have got to \nstop that. I think this is what does that, and your help has been \ntremendous in that regard.\n  Congressman Carter, one of the things we see in Georgia and I know we \nhave seen it in Iowa--in short, you have a story--I have got stories I \nam going to probably share a little bit later--just where this is has \naffected a patient.\n  Several of my pharmacists talk about how they have had customers that \nhave been coming to them for years and then get a disease that they \ncan't keep the medicine because it is too expensive. Do you have some \nexamples like that where this kind of legislation would help?\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Well, there is no question about it. As I said \nearlier, I am a free market guy. All I want to do is compete, and I \nwant to compete on a level playing field. Let me compete.\n  You know, when I first entered pharmacy before PBMs became so vogue \nand became such a big part of this, it was pretty easy in the sense of \nbeing in business in pharmacy because all you had to do was be nice to \nthe people.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  I mean, it was about customer service. It was about taking care of \nthe patient, and that is what we are talking about--taking care of the \npatient.\n  I told you earlier I have had generations of families who trade with \nme--grandparents, parents.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I want to jump in right here on this, and if \nyou have a story, we will talk about it.\n  My own family member had an issue, and we were discussing medication. \nI knew the doctor--I could call--but my first call was to my pharmacist \nbecause I said I knew I could get him; I knew he would answer; and at \nthe time--and what was amazing was--my parents didn't buy their drugs \nfrom him, but, yet, he picked up the phone, and he heard my complaint.\n  Is that sort of what you see and what you have seen as well?\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Oh, there is no question about it. In fact, I \nhave experienced it.\n  Look, I have been a community pharmacist, as I said earlier, for 34 \nyears. I have been in business for myself for almost 28 years now. I \nlive near where my pharmacy is. I live less than 5 miles away from it. \nI am a member of that community. I was the mayor of that community for \n9 years. For 9 years, I was mayor. I served in the State legislature. I \nrepresent them now in Congress, and I have gotten calls in the middle \nof the night.\n  What is interesting and what has been very rewarding for me \nprofessionally is when I ran for office and when I would be knocking on \ndoors, and I would introduce myself. ``I know you. I know you. You \nhelped my mother when she was under hospice care. You got up and went \nto the store and met me there one night and got her medication.'' Now, \nlet me tell you that that makes you feel good.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. It does. Again, when you get into this, it is \nabout people.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. It is.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Politics and drug stores and people. This is \nabout politics. This is about people. It is those people. It is people. \nIt is policy.\n  What kinds of things have you heard, Mr. Loebsack?\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. I just want to say one thing.\n  Pharmacists are among the most respected folks in all of America, and \nthere is a reason for that.\n  Now, Mr. Carter, I realize you went from being a pharmacist to being \na Congressman.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. We do question that.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. We might question your judgment about that kind of a \ntransition, and you are finding out about that; but, nonetheless, every \nsingle time I go to a pharmacist, it is the same thing--they care. They \ncare about their patients.\n  Again, I have so many stories, but it would take forever for me to \nrecount all the stories of all of the pharmacies I have gone to in my \ncongressional district over the last 9 years. I have 24 counties. I \nhave a lot of local pharmacies, as you might imagine, and those \npharmacists are among the most respected folks in the community. They \nare right up there with the clergymen; so that tells you something \nabout them and about their profession and about how folks look up to \nthem and about how folks depend upon them.\n  As you just said, they are the folks who get called when they are \nworried about their prescriptions. They are the folks who can be \nreached the most easily. Other professionals can be reached, but \npharmacists are right there at the ready, and that is very important.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. It is.\n  If you are following and tracking, we can talk bills, and we can talk \nregulations, and those are great things; but the bottom line is what is \nbest in the health care arena from the whole perspective.\n  You did a great job, Representative Carter, about talking about the \ndoctor and all the different agencies coming in together.\n  I will never forget, when growing up, the story, for me, of, when you \ngot to the pharmacist, you were getting better. One, I had gotten \nthrough the doctor's office--I had gotten my shot, or I had gotten \nwhatever--but I had gotten to the pharmacist's. Just give me some \nmedicine. Let me go home. Back then, there was some tasting bad stuff--\nI don't know where that came from--but I remember going in, and they \nwould take time, and they would care.\n\n[[Page H7023]]\n\n  Still, in my district and in many of your districts, you can go in \nand look at the community pharmacist who was on the square. A lot of \nthem had lunch counters. A lot of them had other things. They sold \ncards and trinkets. What is amazing to me today is I do not want to see \nthrough consolidation and corporate work a system that has a \nfingerprint on the scale, where government has basically allowed this \nto happen--to start taking away the centerpieces of American squares. \nWhen you start taking away the centerpieces of squares and of lots and \nof communities, both big and small--when you start doing that--then we \nare part of the problem. It is time we started educating everybody we \ncan.\n  Do you see that?\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I do see that.\n  I want to mention just two things.\n  First of all, as an American taxpayer, you can imagine my being in \nbusiness and having what we call ``taxation without participation.'' \nHere we have Medicare part D plans that are paid for and supplemented \nthrough the government, which I pay taxes to, but my business is not \nallowed to participate. I am being taxed. I am paying my taxes and am \ndoing what I am supposed to do. It is being used for a plan that \nexcludes my business. How fair is that? I am not asking for anything \nspecial. All I am asking for is an even playing field.\n  Another thing that I want to mention is that I have intentionally not \nmentioned the names of PBMs. There are some good PBMs, and it is not \nthe company that I have the problem with as much as it is the process \nand the model. I mean, that is very important to understand--we are \ntalking about the model here--but I will tell you this. There have been \nnumerous instances where companies think they are going to be saving \nmoney, and the PBMs have misled them into thinking they are going to \nsave money. Let me tell you that these are some of the most profitable \nbusinesses around.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. May I jump in right here?\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Sure.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. You may have heard this.\n  I agree with you in that there are some great PBMs out there that do \nwork. We are not just saying PBMs in general.\n  The other thing that bothers me is--and I have heard this from my \npharmacist, and you, I know, have experienced this, and we have talked \nabout it, and Mr. Loebsack has as well--my pharmacists, my community \npharmacists, are scared to say something. They are scared to talk about \nwhat is actually going on because they are scared their contracts will \nget canceled. They are scared that they will get another audit.\n  I am sorry. I am not a pharmacist. You can't audit me, and I am going \nto stand here and talk about it for the pharmacists because they can't. \nThat is wrong. Anybody who wants to say that that is right, I do not \nunderstand that; but when you have got pharmacists who are just honest, \nhardworking people who are trying to run independent businesses and \nwhen they are scared to talk about their vendors to work a workable \nplan, what are we doing here? This should be easy.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. It doesn't serve any of us. It certainly doesn't serve \nany of us in the end, because those folks are the ones who are serving \nus, and if they are suppressed--if their voices cannot be heard--that \nstifles competition. It goes back to the market. It stifles \ncompetition, and that is not good for any of us in the end.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. When things change and when they say that we \ncan't give input because we are scared, that is just a problem.\n  We are coming up on our time of closing.\n  Any last comments, Mr. Loebsack?\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Yes.\n  Thank you, Mr. Collins. Thanks again for inviting me and Mr. Carter. \nI really do appreciate this.\n  As always, Mr. Carter, I have learned something tonight from a \npharmacist--I always do--and I really appreciate your comments.\n  I just want to touch upon sort of the issue of the city square. That \nis so important for so many of our rural districts, as you folks know \nall too well. It is kind of hard to explain that to our more urban \ncolleagues, but we have to do the best that we can. A pharmacy is so \nabsolutely critical for the economy of a small community. Yes, it is \nabsolutely critical and necessary to serve the population in the area, \nbut it is important for the economy as well.\n  We have a pharmacy--Mahaska Drug in Oskaloosa, Iowa. It is off the \nsquare a little bit, but it is such an important institution in its own \nright. Every Christmas, they have wonderful decorations, and they have \nthings to sell for Christmas. I mean, people come to depend upon them \nto do the kinds of things they have done in providing not just the \npharmacy services but other things as well. If they were to go under as \na pharmacy, I am not at all sure that they would survive, and that \ncommunity would suffer as a result. Folks' choices would be lessened. \nTheir tradition would be hurt. It would be a disaster in many ways for \nso many of our local communities if those pharmacies were to close \ndown.\n  I, for one, am with you. I am not willing to accept that. I am going \nto fight as hard as I possibly can with you, and we are going to do it \ntogether, holding hands across the aisle, which, as you know, doesn't \nget done a lot around here; but when we can come together, I think it \nis important for us to do that. So thanks again for organizing this \ntonight. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Carter, would you like to add just a \ncouple of things?\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I will very quickly.\n  First of all, again, I want to thank you, Representative Collins and \nmy colleagues--all of you--for participating in this. This has been a \ngreat exercise.\n  Among my proudest possessions are the plaques that the baseball teams \ngive you every year whenever you sponsor a team, and I have got a wall \nthat is just filled with them. Patients come in all the time. ``There I \nam. I played ball. That was the team I was on,'' and they point toward \nit. It was the Carter's Pharmacy team.\n  I want to ask you: How many PBMs have you seen sponsoring Little \nLeague Baseball teams? I mean, seriously.\n  Folks, we are talking about something that is essential to our \ncommunities, and this is a dire situation. I am telling you. If this is \nnot fixed soon, you are going to see a whole profession of community \npharmacies going by the wayside. This is a matter of survival here.\n  Again, we are not asking for a government handout. All we are asking \nfor is to be able to compete. It is to be able to compete in a fair \nmarket, in a free market, on a level playing field. Ultimately, the \nloser here is going to be the patient. If we allow this to happen and \ncommunity pharmacies go away, the ones who are going to suffer are \ngoing to be the patients.\n  Thank you again for this. I can't tell you how proud I am of my \nprofession, a profession that I chose years ago when I was in high \nschool and when I was a delivery driver. After I realized I was not \ngoing to be the athlete that I wanted to be, I decided it was time to \nget serious and decide on a profession. I did, and I could not be any \nprouder than the profession I chose of professional pharmacy. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I thank all of my colleagues for coming here \ntonight.\n  I am going to go back to where we started: Live your ``why.'' Live \nyour ``why.'' That is all we are asking. Our independent pharmacists \nand our community pharmacists are just simply saying: Let us have an \neven playing field. We will play with the big boys. We don't care. Just \nlet us have our ``why.'' When we do that, our benefits come to our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7023-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Hudson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nfamily reasons.\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through October 23 \non account of medical procedure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/house-section/article/H7023-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7023-H7024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
