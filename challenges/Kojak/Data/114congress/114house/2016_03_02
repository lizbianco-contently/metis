During his time as \ncoach, Mike won 8 Central Suburban League Conference championships, 13 \nIHSA Regional championships, and 7 State place winners.\n  Coach Baeb has also been a leader, a friend, and a mentor to many \nstudents over the past 30 years, all of whom are better off having been \nunder his leadership, and that includes myself.\n  I offer my sincere thanks to Coach Baeb for his friendship and for \nhis leadership. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1087-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1087-H1088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DIVERSITY ON NETWORK TELEVISION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, when we got our first color TV, it was a \nbig deal in my family. We were working class, Puerto Rican, and not \nused to such luxury; so when we got a color TV, we had really arrived \nin America.\n  Every Sunday night, my sister and I would watch ``The Wonderful World \nof Disney'' that always started with the same announcement: ``The \nfollowing program is brought to you in living color on NBC.'' Then you \nwould hear the NBC chimes.\n  Well, that was a long time ago. Now you turn on NBC, and the furthest \nthing from your mind is color. What is going on at NBC? Last week Wake \nForest University professor and MSNBC television host Melissa Harris-\nPerry was abruptly pulled from the airwaves without even a chance to \nsay good-bye.\n  NBC said they wanted a show that was more about politics, but I have \nto say, when I watched her show, Melissa Harris-Perry was talking about \npolitics in a unique way, like few others on the airwaves. She brought \ndiverse voices to the table to talk directly and unapologetically about \nthe politics of race in America, a major theme among candidates and a \ncritical conversation to include on the airwaves.\n  I am sad to see her go, just like Alex Wagner before her, but I am \neven sadder because I don't think these are isolated cases.\n  Anchorman Jose Diaz-Balart is another voice that seems to be \ndisappearing from English language airwaves. You remember Jose. He is \nthe Telemundo anchorman NBC would bring out to ask a question--only one \nquestion--about immigration during the Republican Presidential debates \nin 2012.\n  You may have met his brother Lincoln. He used to sit over there, and \nhis other brother Mario still does. Jose had a 2-hour show on MSNBC and \ndid a very good job, but Jose is a lot harder to find these days. They \ncut him back, and now it seems that they are cutting him out.\n  For example, MSNBC announced that they were sending a team of \nreporters to Florida to report on the primary next Tuesday, but not \nJose, one of the most respected and recognized journalists in America, \nwho happens to be from Miami and a Florida political dynasty. \nApparently he is not the right guy to report on politics in Florida.\n  Let's not forget the great NBC racism flip-flop last year when NBC \nsevered its ties to Donald Trump because of his racist remarks about \nLatinos, only to have him host their flagship comedy show ``Saturday \nNight Live'' a few months later.\n  That was right about the same time last fall when NBC's executives \nmet with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and NBC News \nPresident Deborah Turness told us, ``We love the Hispanic community,'' \nas she updated us on strides they were making\n\n[[Page H1088]]\n\non diversity in hiring. She made it very clear that she had our \ncommunity's interests at heart when she said, ``Yo hablo Espanol'' in \nher beautiful British accent.\n  Most of the news coverage of this meeting was about when she used the \nterm ``illegals'' to describe immigrants, which, in case you need a \nreminder, is not a good idea when you are meeting with members of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus.\n  Well, forgive me for not noticing just how much progress NBC was \nmaking on diversity when some of the most visible people of color at \nNBC, like Alex Wagner, Melissa Harris-Perry, and Jose Diaz-Balart, are \ndisappearing.\n  But let's be clear: this is not about quotas, window dressing, or \nchecking the diversity box. Journalists of color bring a different \ntexture and a different perspective on what issues matter and what \nshould be discussed and debated on television.\n  The reality is that our Nation has become more diverse, and our \ntelevision and our news media and our political institutions, including \nthe Democratic and Republican Parties, have not kept up.\n  When NBC has a bad year when it comes to race, or when the Oscars \nhave a couple of bad years when it comes to people of color, these are \nmoments to talk about and confront the emotions and ideas we all have--\nwe all have--about race and ethnicity.\n  It is a good time to think about what the phrase ``e pluribus unum'' \nreally means in America today. This is a discussion we should all be \nhaving all of the time here in this body, on news programs, and in \nentertainment. It is a discussion I hope every family is having at \ntheir dinner table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1088-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TAMMY BATEMAN'S STORY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, every West Virginian knows \nabout the consequences of the war on coal. We see it everywhere we go: \nmines are closing; school districts are laying off employees; county \ncommissions are forced to lay off deputy sheriffs; retailers are going \nout of business; mom-and-pop stores are struggling, barely able to hang \non.\n  A pink slip doesn't mean just a loss of a job. It means a loss of a \nway of life; it means hard choices; and for some it means having to \nleave West Virginia entirely to find work elsewhere. The war on coal is \nkilling West Virginia jobs.\n  Tammy Bateman and her family had to make a difficult decision. It \nchanged the life of every member of her family, in particular that of \nher daughter. Tammy is a West Virginia coal voice. This is her family.\n  Here is what Tammy wrote to me:\n  ``My husband worked for Cecil Walker Machinery for over 20 years at \nthe Logan branch in West Virginia. We have lived here for all of our \nlives.\n  ``Due to the declining coal industry, we had to move to another State \nand move our daughter from the school that she loves.\n  ``We have a lot of friends and family that have either had to pack up \nand move away also and some that have stayed and have been laid off and \nare suffering.\n  ``This is all due to Obama's war on coal. You see, when coal is \naffected, so are small businesses, schools, and much more, especially \npeople's livelihoods.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the people of my district want to work. They want a \npaycheck to provide for their families. They want a better future for \ntheir children.\n  Thanks to the war on coal, thanks to the EPA's regulations putting \ncoal mines out of business, West Virginians are suffering. This \nadministration needs to put West Virginians back to work, not put West \nVirginians out of work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1088-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today a bipartisan group of several \ndozen Members from both sides of the aisle led by Adam Kinzinger and me \nwere going to be sending a letter to Secretary Kerry, and I am pleased \nto say we don't have to send it.\n  The origin of the request dealt with our military operations in the \nMiddle East, the brave Iraqi and Afghan men and women who provided \nsensitive and trusted services to United States military personnel. For \nover a decade, I have been working to try and protect them.\n  These Iraqis and Afghans who worked with Americans, whether as \ndrivers or interpreters, were shoulder to shoulder with our troops, \noften in dangerous circumstances. In some instances, we have heard how \ntheir services literally made the difference as to whether our soldiers \nlived or died.\n  Now, thousands of our allies who helped us, face kidnapping, torture, \nand murder as a direct result of their assistance provided to the \nUnited States because members of the Taliban and the self-proclaimed \nIslamic State and other hostile elements on the ground see these \nindividuals' service as an act of betrayal--and they have long \nmemories.\n  To reward their faithful service and to fulfill our moral obligation, \nI have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with \nSenators, starting with Senator McCain and the late Senator Kennedy in \n2007, to create a special immigrant visa program. Known as the SIV \nprogram, enables the safe relocation of these Afghans and Iraqis to the \nUnited States.\n  Since 2007, our bipartisan team in Congress, including a number of \nMembers who have recently joined us who served in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand know these circumstances firsthand, has been working to reform and \nrevise the program, sometimes fighting just to keep it alive.\n  In November of last year, the National Defense Authorization Act \nextended and expanded the Afghan SIV program to ensure the continued \nprotection of these souls. However, the final version of the bill also \nlengthened the period of service from 1 to 2 years required for \nindividuals ``submitting a petition after September 30, 2015.''\n  The State Department's initial announcement on the interpretation of \nthe law would have made more than 3,000 of our Afghan allies who had \nalready begun the cumbersome application process start over to \ndemonstrate the 2 years of qualifying employment. That is why \nRepresentative Kinzinger and I prepared this bipartisan letter to call \non the State Department to revisit the interpretation.\n  Thankfully, after review and consideration of the concerns from \nMembers of Congress, the State Department agreed to apply the 2-year \nrequirement only to new applicants. This is welcome news.\n  Every hour that is delayed to relocate these vital partners to \nsafety, puts their lives at risk and lives of their families. I am glad \nwe have put this behind us perhaps, but we cannot keep operating in \nthis inefficient manner while our allies and their families face \nconsistent threats.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  They deserve better. And we can do better.\n  It is shameful that we cannot better serve those who have put their \nlives on the line to help us. It seems that there is always another \nroadblock that occurs.\n  This should be a bipartisan issue that Members of Congress and the \nadministration can work together on to save lives. It is not just \nsaving the lives of the people who helped us.\n  It ensures the safety of our troops and other American personnel \ncurrently serving in harm's way. It will ensure the success of our \nfuture missions. No one in their right mind will cooperate with \nAmerican forces under dire circumstances if we abandon them after their \nvital assistance.\n  I applaud the State Department's reinterpretation of this work \nrequirement and look forward to working with my colleagues on the SIV \nprogram improvements this year. I hope we can do a better job to meet \nour responsibility to these souls who risked so much to help Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1088-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1088-H1089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REFORMING OUR MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance) for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H1089]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of reforming \nour Nation's broken mental health care system.\n  Too often we are reminded that the country's mental health care \nsystem is not working nearly as well as should be the case. Many \nAmericans hide behind the curtain of shame and insecurity while many \nothers lack access, assistance, or even information on how they may \nreceive treatment.\n  It is a vicious cycle, where the vulnerable who need the most care \nare instead left out of society, unemployable, and, in some cases, a \ndanger to themselves and others.\n  Recent data suggests that fewer than one-third of Americans with \ndiagnosable mental illness actually get treatment. Experts also \nestimate that more than half of those who suffer from severe mental \ndisorders do not receive treatment in any given year.\n  At least 25 percent of returning troops from Iraq and Afghanistan \nwill experience some type of mental health condition. We owe our \nservicemen and -women and veterans this effort to get them the care \nthey need and deserve.\n  I am proud to partner with Democratic Congresswoman Doris Matsui of \nCalifornia, with whom I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee, in \nrecently introducing a bill to significantly expand access and \nstrengthen community mental health and behavioral health services \nacross the country.\n  The Expand Excellence in Mental Health Care Act aims to expand mental \nhealth care planning grants in two dozen States, including New Jersey, \nthrough an initiative based on our 2014 Excellence in Mental Health Act \nthat was signed into law by President Obama in 2014.\n  This measure is directly tackling one of the most significant mental \nhealth care challenges: access. The Expand Excellence in Mental Health \nAct will enable more States to experiment with the tools and practices \nto fix this broken system.\n  By expanding the law to include more States, we encourage greater \ncollaboration and testing to find out what solutions work, how best to \ncare for those who need treatment, and what we can do to keep the \npeople of the United States safe.\n  The Excellence in Mental Health Care Act is one of the most \nsignificant works Congress has already passed into law on mental health \ncare. We should expand it and keep the momentum going.\n  I am also proud to be working with Republican Congressman Tim Murphy \nof Pennsylvania on this issue. Dr. Murphy, who has a Ph.D. in \npsychology, has been using his expertise to lead a serious discussion \nin the House Energy and Commerce Committee on this critical issue.\n  His Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, which I am proud to \ncosponsor, takes a clinical approach to supporting families and \nindividuals undergoing sudden or long-term mental health crises. The \nbill views those who need care through the mental health lens, not just \nthrough the criminal justice system.\n  Our work on these bills is part of a larger conversation on improving \nmental health care in this country. These bills will help struggling \nfamilies who seek the best care for their loved ones. It will help \nthose who fear stigma to get the care they need and will give our \nservicemen and -women and veterans the care they deserve.\n  I urge support for these measures, and I welcome all good ideas to \nthe table for reforming our mental health care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1089-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING GEORGE ZANDER'S LEGACY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Ruiz) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the life of \na magnificent human being, remarkable leader, and close personal \nfriend, Mr. George Zander of Palm Springs, California.\n  Many in our community knew George as a strident advocate for \nequality. George was a gentle man with a burning passion to make our \nNation a more perfect Union, particularly for our LGBT brothers and \nsisters.\n  In my years working in the Coachella Valley, I, like so many others \nin our community, knew George as a colleague, adviser, and, above all, \na dear friend.\n  George left this world on December 10, 2015. Nonetheless, his vision, \npassion, and vigorous strength to fight for a more just Coachella \nValley, a more just Nation, and, ultimately, a more just world, are \nwhat remain.\n  George's legacy is one of social justice. For over three decades, he \nwas actively engaged in the communities that make up the desert of the \nCoachella Valley. He was a leader among us and steadfastly guided our \ncommunity toward a more inclusive and welcoming place.\n  So today I would like to take a moment to memorialize the life of \nGeorge Zander, whose legacy will live on for future generations, not \njust in the Coachella Valley, but in the history of our Nation.\n  As a young man, George heeded President Kennedy's call to service and \njoined the Peace Corps, where it became clear that he was a natural \nleader.\n  His leadership and advocacy for the LGBT community spanned decades \nand began in a time where it was far less politically or socially \nacceptable to do so, but that didn't stop him.\n  In Seattle, Washington, George was a member of the first openly gay \nand lesbian association, called the Dorian Group. This vanguard \norganization advocated for the advancement of the rights of LGBT \nindividuals at a difficult time in our Nation's history.\n  It took great courage, but George was never one to shy away from \ntaking a stand. George had a passion for public service and a sincere \nfaith that our representative government plays a role in improving \nlives.\n  He worked alongside his good friend, Seattle's mayor Ed Murray, was \nchair of the King County Democratic Party, and worked for the 1996 \nClinton-Gore campaign. Later, moving to San Francisco, he worked side \nby side with Cleve Jones, another prominent LGBT rights activist.\n  From Washington to San Francisco, to our beautiful desert in the \nCoachella Valley, George made an enormous impact. After moving to the \nValley, he worked in the office of the great Senator Boxer.\n  He was a member of the Palm Springs Police Advisory Board, the Palm \nSprings Police Department LGBT Outreach Committee, and vice chair of \nthe Warm Sands Neighborhood Organization.\n  George was a contributor for the LGBT publication, The Bottom Line, \ncofounded the Desert-Stonewall Democrats, and later became the Palm \nSprings field officer manager for Equality California.\n  George played a key role in advocating for laws that protect the LGBT \ncommunity locally and statewide, working tirelessly to defeat \nproposition 8. He also collaborated with other local LGBT groups, such \nas the Palm Springs Human Rights Campaign, the LGBT Center, Desert AIDS \nProject, and Trans Palm Springs.\n  Mr. Speaker, George was a true leader who was the victim of a hate \ncrime weeks before his death. I condemn these acts. There should be no \nspace for these types of actions toward any human being, regardless of \nrace, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\n  For more than three decades, George spearheaded efforts advocating \nfor human rights and equality for all in my district and across the \nNation.\n  George was not only an extraordinary leader, activist, friend, and \nhusband, but, overall, a gentle, loving, and caring human being.\n  In honor of George Zander, let us pay our respects and never forget \nhis legacy. Let us continue fighting for a more just and tolerant \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1089-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1089-H1090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE NEED TO STAND UP AGAINST ASSAD AND RUSSIAN WAR CRIMES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, last week a U.N. panel released \na deeply troubling report on the grave and horrific atrocities taking \nplace across Syria. The report was mandated by the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission to investigate and record all violations of international \nlaw since March 2011.\n\n[[Page H1090]]\n\n  The report outlines in painstaking detail the mass human rights \nabuses that innocent civilians must endure from both the Russian-backed \nSyrian offensive and terrorist groups like ISIS.\n  Hospitals are deliberately targeted--33 in Aleppo alone--resulting in \nmass civilian casualties. In blatant disregard of core human rights \nlaw, starvation has systematically been used as a weapon of war.\n  Over 450,000 people are currently trapped in besieged towns and \nvillages in Syria, and thousands are at risk of starving to death.\n  Schools and playgrounds and other public spaces are routinely shelled \nto inflict the maximum amount of terror on innocent civilians. The \nreport tells of attacks on a girls school in Duma, where 19 civilians \nwere killed. Even though there were no military objectives, government \nforces attacked the school twice, the second attack taking place during \nfirst aid evacuation efforts.\n  Last month Secretary Kerry helped negotiate a temporary, 2-week \ncease-fire with Russia that was supposed to end the fighting and allow \nfor the delivery of aid to besieged towns.\n  Unfortunately, like the deal we struck with Russia on Assad's use of \nchemical weapons, this cease-fire merely locks in the gains achieved by \nthe Assad regime and gives Russia outsized influence in shaping the \nfuture of the Middle East. Regardless, the terms of the agreement were \nalmost immediately violated.\n  Any hope of a sustained peace was dashed this week with the almost-\nimmediate and predictable breach of the cease-fire agreement.\n  On Sunday, the Syrian opposition released a letter documenting \nviolations of the cease-fire agreement by the Assad regime, Russia, and \nIranian-backed militia, which I will include in the Record.\n\n                                                February 28, 2016.\n     H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon,\n     Secretary-General,\n     United Nations, New York.\n       Excellency Secretary-General: I regret to inform you that \n     hostilities committed by Russian, Iranian, the Syrian regime, \n     and foreign militias and mercenaries allied to them have \n     continued against the Syrian people despite the truce taking \n     effect on the 27th February 2016.\n       Right from the onset of the truce, a large number of \n     violations have been committed by the regime and its allies \n     in several parts of Syria. The regime has continued to target \n     populated areas using helicopter raids to deploy explosive \n     barrels, resulting in a large number of fatalities and \n     causing significant injuries, most of whom were innocent \n     women and children. There were seven recorded incidents of \n     such breach. Furthermore, there have been twenty-four \n     recorded breaches involving artillery shelling and five \n     incidents recording offensive ground operations. Recorded \n     breaches of the truce were registered in twenty-six different \n     areas held by the moderate opposition.\n       Moreover, today, Sunday 28th February, Russian fighter jets \n     launched twenty-six air strikes against territory held by \n     opposition groups which have announced and entered into the \n     truce. Disturbingly significant is the fact that cluster \n     bombs as well as thermobaric weapons were deployed, adding to \n     the number of innocent civilian fatalities and horrifying \n     injuries.\n       In light of repeated breaches by the regime and its allies \n     since the commencement of the truce, the growing number of \n     fatalities, which currently stands at twenty-nine documented \n     deaths, in addition to the dozens who have been injured as \n     indiscriminate targeting of populated areas continues, we \n     wish to clarify the following:\n       It is most unfortunate that the Russian Ministry of Defense \n     presented an erroneous map riddled with false military \n     information (http://youtu.be/MaYvdEidSzsSent) and attributed \n     this map to the United Nations for calculated political and \n     military purposes, as purported areas of political influence \n     and distribution of forces on Syrian territory. The sole \n     purpose of that exercise was to exclude certain areas from \n     the truce and to continue their systematic bombardment and \n     forced displacement. Given the serious consequences of these \n     violations on the Syrian people and on the unity and \n     territorial integrity of Syria, we urge that you take the \n     necessary measures to respond and counter false Russian \n     allegations and put a stop to such practices.\n       We call on the United Nations and the Friends of Syria \n     Group to be mandated to specify the territory covered by the \n     truce to prevent hostilities in the designated inclusion \n     zones, such a task must be assumed by an impartial and \n     transparent party. We also note that the absence of clear \n     separation lines will result in the targeting of civilian \n     populated areas by the regime and its allies, and henceforth \n     constitute yet another flagrant violation of Security Council \n     resolutions jeopardizing the truce.\n       Although the Syrian opposition groups have demonstrated \n     maximum levels of self-restrain and have thus far continued \n     to adhere to their obligations to the truce, it seems likely \n     that the regime and its allies' persistent crimes against the \n     Syrian people will inevitably undermine international efforts \n     for the continuation of the truce.\n       We have agreed to the temporary truce as a response to \n     sincere international efforts aiming to ease the suffering of \n     the Syrian people and to assist in the implementation of the \n     humanitarian provisions of UNSCR 2254, in particular: \n     articles 12, 13 and 14. Failure to achieve any significant \n     progress in this regard will leave us no option but to \n     examine alternative measures to ensure the protection of the \n     Syrian people and bring an end to the crimes committed \n     against them. It is therefore of critical importance for the \n     Security Council to stand firm and unwavering in its resolve.\n       The persistent violations of the regime and the forces \n     allied to it will undermine Security Council efforts for a \n     political process, including the most recent, UNSCR 2268. It \n     is abhorrent to pursue a political process through which the \n     suffering of the Syrian people is used as a means to achieve \n     political and military gains; under such circumstances, \n     negotiations will be unfeasible.\n       Excellency Secretary-General, the gravity of the situation, \n     and the consequent clear and direct threat to peace and \n     security at a regional and international level, require the \n     United Nations to intervene immediately, to stop the crimes \n     committed against the Syrian people and to preserve the unity \n     and integrity of Syria.\n           Yours respectfully,\n\n                                               Dr. Riad Hijab,\n\n                                     Coordinator General, The High\n                                           Negotiations Committee.\n\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. These violations discussed in this letter are \ncomprised of barrel and cluster bomb attacks and a number of ground \nincursions against opposition groups who had entered into the truce.\n  In the first 2 days alone, there were more than 29 documented deaths, \nmostly of women and children, and dozens of injuries. This is during \nthe alleged cease-fire.\n  Some believe that this far-off conflict isn't affecting communities \nacross America. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say they are wrong.\n  I routinely meet with Syrian Americans in Indiana who share stories \nof the devastation their loved ones are experiencing back in their \nhomeland. Listening to them recount the struggles of their families \nreminds me that, if we are to adhere to our values as a Nation, we must \ndefend the vulnerable and expand basic human liberty.\n  Standing idly by as bombs rain down on hospitals or as Assad uses \nstarvation as a method of warfare is an abdication of what we stand for \nas a Nation, but that is exactly what we have done.\n  This President's insistence on diminishing American power abroad has \nempowered Putin to step into the leadership vacuum, has bolstered Assad \nin Syria, and has prolonged the conflict.\n  We must not succumb to difficulty. We must take a stand and start \nmeaningfully engaging our allies and strengthen the moderate Syrian \nforces, like the Kurds on the ground, to fight to replace the Assad \nregime.\n  Both my constituents and the Nation's top military advisers know that \ndoing so is the only way to bring any long-term stability to Syria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1090-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1090-H1091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                  SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY'S ACCESS TO WATER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about one of the most \nimportant issues facing the San Joaquin Valley, and that is the access \nto water.\n  California has received well-above-average rainfall during the months \nof December and January. But for the past several weeks, we have seen \ndry conditions, once again, come back.\n  For the last several weeks I have tried to speak on behalf of the \nneed to make changes so that we can urge the Federal agencies to pump \nwater at maximum levels that are allowed under the biological opinions, \nso that we could bring more water to the San Joaquin Valley and the \nfarms located south of the delta.\n  It is welcome news that they are pumping at more robust levels, and \nit is my hope that we will continue to pump at maximum levels when \nallowable, especially because these El Nino conditions that we have had \nin December and January are now fading, sadly.\n\n[[Page H1091]]\n\n  With the possibility of California's rainy and snow seasons coming to \nan end, and with much less precipitation than we had hoped for, we must \ntake advantage of every drop of precious water that is in the system.\n  We need a comprehensive plan to fix California's broken water system \nthat provides short-term operational flexibility and, at the same time, \nincreases the State's long-term drought resiliency that will provide \nreal water reliability and actually recovers species that have been \nlisted in the Sacramento, San Joaquin Delta.\n  It is time to address these issues that are impacting these species \nin the delta and implement a plan to recover them so that we can stop \noperating the water system primarily with the blunt tools of the \nEndangered Species Act that clearly aren't working. They are not \nworking because the species are not recovering.\n  Studies have indicated that on some rivers feeding into the delta, \nover 98 percent of the juvenile salmon are eaten by invasive species \nlike the striped bass that aren't even native to California.\n  Despite this knowledge and the clear protections provided listed \nspecies by the Endangered Species Act, the administration has \nestablished a goal to double the amount of striped bass in California.\n  It should not be the policy of the United States to increase the \npopulations of invasive species that prey on native salmon in \nCalifornia. I don't get it. This makes absolutely no sense and needs to \nbe corrected.\n  We should be implementing a predator control program which, I might \nadd, is supported by the Salmon Fisheries Institute. As a matter of \nfact, they have got over 31 programs on predator control that they \nwould like to implement. They can't implement one of them.\n  We should be focusing on trying to make a difference, and that is why \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of Representative Jeff Denham's \nlegislation, the Save Our Salmon Act.\n  The Save Our Salmon Act, by Congressman Denham, would eliminate the \npolicy of doubling striped bass populations in the delta, a policy \nwhich has very serious negative impacts to our native salmon species \nand causes tremendous harm to the farm communities in the San Joaquin \nValley.\n  We have to determine if California is going to operate with a broken \nsystem or if Congress, the administration, and the State can come \ntogether with Federal and State legislation to provide meaningful \nsolutions to fix our broken water system for the future, for the 21st \ncentury.\n  Will we allow communities to dry up and blow away, as some of my \ncolleagues, I believe, sometimes infer?\n  Or will we come together and craft a solution that can improve \nconditions for everyone across the State, while focusing on drought \nrecovery for those who have been most affected in areas that I \nrepresent?\n  I am talking about farm workers. I am talking about farmers. I am \ntalking about farm communities that put food every night on America's \ndinner table. I will continue to believe that we still can come \ntogether if we focus on achievable solutions.\n  After years of moving more and more water through the delta in an \nattempt to halt species decline, we haven't actually recovered any of \nthese species. It is high time, I believe, to try something new.\n  I remain committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to craft solutions that increase California's drought resiliency \nand provide water to the communities who have been most impacted by the \nrecent drought because, after all, this is about security. It is about \njob security, it is about economic security, it is about the future \nsecurity of our valley and the State of California.\n  We must fix California's broken water system for the short term and \nthe long term. Time is of the essence, and every day of delay only \nresults in losses of these vital water supplies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1091-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILLER-RAFFAELE VFW POST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the Natural Resources \nCommittee, I requested and demanded that the Interior Department \nexplain its involvement in creating what appears to be a shell \ncorporation, which it calls a non-Federal entity, which would work to \nremove dams on the Klamath River in northern California and southern \nOregon, this without any authorization from Congress.\n  Interior officials refused to answer in committee whether they will \nbe subject to the Freedom of Information Act or even explain why \nstakeholders are required at these meetings to sign nondisclosure \nagreements before learning how they will be affected by the actions at \nthese secret meetings.\n  They don't like having them called secret meetings. They have other \neuphemisms, such as a private conversation, what have you. They are \neven organizing bylaws for an incoming board at these meetings.\n  Mr. Speaker, the very idea that Federal and State government \nemployees are involved in a project designed explicitly to avoid open \ngovernment,\n\n[[Page H1092]]\n\nopen government laws, and public disclosure should give us all pause, \nespecially since tax dollars are being used to pay for the salaries of \nthose folks involved, their travel, the meeting spaces, et cetera. They \nare not doing this pro bono.\n  While this is billed as a California-Oregon project, the Interior \nSecretary's signature is on a pact to create this entity that suggests \nthat the administration is, again, trying to end run Congress to \nachieve a political goal.\n  I will continue working to get answers on this Klamath issue on the \nremoval of the dams and the effect it will have on the Klamath Basin \nwater users.\n  But in the meantime, the administration needs to end its focus on dam \nremoval and work towards a solution that doesn't ignore the water \nsupply issues that affect so much of the West, affect many thousands in \nnorthern California, and especially those directly in the line of fire \nin the Klamath Basin that have been clamoring for so long for a long-\nterm solution to keep the waters flowing to their farms.\n  At a time of extreme drought in California and the Western States, \nand even more burdens such as the electricity renewable mandate that is \ngoing to affect California to 50 percent of required renewables, the \nconcept of removing hydroelectric dams that also make a little water \nstorage and have some positive effects on river temperature is absurd.\n  Why is the priority something that is going to hurt the people of the \nregion, hurt their goals?\n  Instead, we should be pursuing water storage in California and \nputting this issue aside.\n  On top of that insult to injury is that it is being done in secret, \nwithout congressional approval, without the chance for all the \nstakeholders that really have an affect in the area to be involved.\n  This is the wrongheaded way to do things. It is offensive to me, it \nis offensive to my constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1092-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Let's honor Boris in this \nway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1093-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GUN MYTH\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, today I want to bring attention to \nanother myth about gun violence: the suggestion that more guns are the \nkey to reducing gun violence.\n  On December 4, just days after San Bernardino, Senator Ted Cruz said, \n``You stop bad guys by using our guns.''\n  We hear similar comments from gun advocates and allies all the time, \nbut the facts tell a much different story. Not one of the 62 mass \nshootings from 1982 to 2012 was stopped by an armed citizen.\n  A 1998 study in the Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection, and \nCritical Care found that a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to \nbe used against a friend or family member than used in self-defense.\n  A 2003 study found women in homes with a gun were 2.7 times more \nlikely to be murdered. A 2013 study found, for each percentage point \nincrease in a State's gun ownership rate, firearm homicide rates \nincreased by 0.9 percent.\n  Facts are stubborn things. But the facts are clear. More guns will \nnot end our country's epidemic of gun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1093-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING CARL NORDSTROM ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  (Ms. JENKINS of Kansas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas.

Mr. Speaker, this morning I stood in \nfront of the Supreme Court with hundreds of passionate voices rallying \nto defend our right to choice.\n  Before the Court today is one of the most significant abortion cases \nto be heard in years. For over 40 years now, Roe v. Wade has been the \nlaw of the land, recognizing a woman's right to a safe abortion when \nshe needs it and where she needs it.\n  But State laws, like the Texas law in question, chip away at that \nright so that women must drive hundreds of miles and face serious \ndelays before exercising their right to choice.\n  What is worse is that preventing women from accessing safe medical \ncare has led to a sharp increase in self-induced abortions. We cannot \naccept putting women at risk by returning to the horrors of the back \nalley that harmed so many.\n  Today I call on the Supreme Court to keep women safe and recognize \nthat our constitutional rights should not depend on our ZIP Code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1093-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1093-H1094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BLEEDING DISORDERS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. BENISHEK asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today wearing my red tie because \nthis March marks the first national Bleeding Disorders Awareness Month.\n  Bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia or Von Willebrand disease, are \ncurrently estimated to affect more than 3 million people nationwide.\n  These disorders are frequently underdiagnosed, and many victims of \nthese disorders often struggle to get proper medical care. As a doctor \nwho treated patients in northern Michigan, I have firsthand experience \nwith patients tackling these difficulties.\n  While the medical community has made great strides over the years in \nimproving the quality of care available for those impacted by bleeding \ndisorders, we can do more.\n  I met recently with constituents in my district who are impacted by \nbleeding disorders, and they shared with me the great work being done \nin northern Michigan by Munson Healthcare's Bleeding Disorder Center to \nprovide better care for patients throughout northern Michigan.\n  I hope that my colleagues and I can all join together with the \nmedical research community to build on these\n\n[[Page H1094]]\n\ngains and find commonsense and bipartisan ways to develop new treatment \noptions for those suffering from bleeding disorders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1094-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Mr. Speaker, after graduating from Maui High in 1944 as \nclass president and valedictorian, and attempting college with dreams \nof becoming a doctor, Patsy Mink had over a dozen medical schools slam \nthe door shut simply because she was a woman.\n  Rather than quit, she took action. She went to law school, becoming \nthe first Japanese American female attorney in Hawaii, and was elected \nas the first Asian American woman ever to Congress in 1965.\n  Through her 12 terms in the House of Representatives serving Hawaii's \nSecond District, which I am honored to represent today, she was a true \nchampion for equal rights and opportunity.\n  In 1972, her landmark bill, Title IX, was signed into law, \nlegislation that has since allowed young women all across the country \nthe very same opportunities to jump high, run fast, hit hard, and go \nthe extra mile, the same as their male counterparts.\n  As we kick off Women's History Month, let us recognize and celebrate \nPatsy Mink and the countless other women throughout our Nation's \nhistory who have blazed trails before us and broken down barriers for a \nbetter future for our next generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1094-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SHOOTING IN CENTRAL KANSAS\n\n  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, yet another city, this time \nin central Kansas, was added to the list of communities across the \ncountry affected by gun violence.\n  Three lives were taken, 14 injured, and many others changed forever. \nSadly, many of us know all too well the pain that comes from acts of \nviolence caused by the trigger of a gun.\n  Ninety minutes before this shooter opened fire, he was served with a \nrestraining order in response to a domestic violence report. Often \nthese protection orders serve as the first notification to an abuser \nthat the relationship is ending and, as in this case, that can lead to \nmore violence.\n  That is why I offered the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking \nVictims Act, a bill that would prevent individuals subject to judicial \nprotection orders from temporarily purchasing or possessing a firearm.\n  The hours right after an abuser is first served with a restraining \norder are the most volatile and dangerous, and it is only responsible \nto remove firearms from this situation temporarily.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this commonsense \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1094-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TEXAS HAS NO CHOICE\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, this morning I \njoined hundreds of women on the steps of the Supreme Court to protest \nthe Texas law that is under consideration by the Court today.\n  The Texas law has already shut down over half of the abortion clinics \nin the State of Texas, and if the law is upheld today, it will \neffectively end the constitutional right of women in Texas to obtain a \nlegal abortion.\n  If that happens, the extreme Texas law will likely be used as a \nblueprint by anti-choice extremists across this country.\n  Now, they claim that this law's restrictive provisions are necessary \nto protect a woman's health. But doctors across this Nation will tell \nyou that that is a lie. The harsh restrictions were designed with the \nsingle purpose of closing and blocking access to choice.\n  I proudly joined over 162 of my colleagues on an amicus brief urging \nthe Court to strike down this law.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 632 provides for a rule to \nconsider a commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation that will \naddress waste, fraud, and abuse within the Medicaid program.\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the \nmajority and the minority of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The \nCommittee on Rules made in order four amendments that were submitted to \nthe committee, three Democratic amendments and one bipartisan offering.\n  Finally, the rule affords the minority the customary motion to \nrecommit, a final opportunity to amend the legislation should the \nminority choose to exercise that option.\n  H.R. 3716, the Ensuring Access to Quality Medicaid Providers Act, \ncombines two bipartisan bills that were unanimously reported out of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee: H.R. 3716, the Ensuring Terminated \nProviders Are Removed from Medicaid and CHIP Act that was introduced by \nDr. Larry Bucshon, a member of the committee; and H.R. 3821, the \nMedicaid DOC Act authored by Representative Chris Collins, also on the \ncommittee.\n  Not only is this bill bipartisan, it has received support of the \nadministration, and it is an important illustration of the work we are \ndoing in the House right now to improve health care for all Americans.\n  The Medicaid program continues to suffer from fraud, waste, and \nabuse. These issues cause direct harm to the beneficiaries and waste \nbillions of taxpayer dollars.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries frequently end up in the emergency room, not \nbecause they need emergency care, but because they cannot find a \nphysician participating in their Medicaid program. This is an \ninefficient and ineffective way to access health care.\n  H.R. 3716 is commonsense legislation that resolves both of these \nproblems and improves beneficiary access to quality providers. Not only \nis this bill good for patients, it is fiscally responsible.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this package would \nreduce Federal outlays by $15 million over the budget window because \nthe Medicaid program would no longer be paying providers who had been \nterminated for reasons of fraud, integrity, or quality.\n  Although the Congressional Budget Office does not estimate State-\nspecific savings, this bill would also save State Medicaid programs \nfrom several million dollars over the same timeframe.\n  The Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human \nServices has previously found that 12 percent of terminated providers \nwere participating in a State Medicaid program as of January 1, 2012, \nafter the same provider was terminated for reasons of integrity or \nquality from another State Medicaid program.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  The base bill, H.R. 3716, will ensure that we put an end to this \nproblem.\n  State Medicaid and State CHIP programs will be required to report \nterminated providers to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \nwithin 21 business days. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \nwill then be required to include that data and Medicare provider \nterminations in its Termination Notification database within 21 \nbusiness days. In addition, State Medicaid and State CHIP managed care \ncontracts will be required to include a provision that providers \nterminated for reasons of integrity or quality from Medicare, Medicaid, \nor SCHIP be terminated from participation in their provider networks. \nWhere Medicaid or CHIP payments are made to providers for services \nperformed more than 60 days after the provider's termination, those \nStates will be required to pay back the Federal portion of the Medicaid \nmatch of those payments.\n  The bill will also ensure that State Medicaid agencies have a current \nand complete list of providers serving Medicaid patients by requiring \nproviders to enroll with the State agency. To streamline reporting \nrequirements and eliminate duplication, the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services will be required to develop uniform terminology for \nterminations related to fraud, integrity, or quality.\n  These simple reforms will ensure that we stop paying millions of \nFederal taxpayer dollars for fraudulent and wasteful care and that \nbeneficiaries are not receiving care from providers who have failed to \nadhere to basic standards of quality or integrity.\n  The second key issue this bill tackles is one of access to care. \nBeneficiaries in the Medicaid program have historically struggled to \nfind a physician who will accept Medicaid and can provide treatment. \nH.R. 3716 includes H.R. 3812, introduced by Representative Chris \nCollins of New York, to empower beneficiaries with better information \nthat will arm them with the information that they need to access care \nwithout first going to an emergency room.\n  While Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans have a \ndefined network of providers, about half of States use delivery systems \nother than risk-based managed care, and those served under a fee-for-\nservice or primary care case management program\n\n[[Page H1096]]\n\ninclude some of the most vulnerable Medicaid enrollees, such as the \nelderly and disabled children. Unfortunately, these enrollees may have \nlimited assistance in identifying physicians who participate in the \nMedicaid program.\n  Specifically, the policy would require State Medicaid programs to \npublish an electronic directory of physicians who have billed Medicaid \nin the prior year--an indication that the physician has or likely still \naccepts Medicaid patients. That directory would include the physician's \nname, specialty, address, telephone number, and, where relevant, \ninformation on whether the physician is accepting new patients and \nlinguistic capabilities.\n  Medicaid is estimated to cover 83 million people this year, and it is \ngrowing. H.R. 3716 makes two targeted but important reforms to \nstrengthen the integrity of the Medicaid program and to improve access \nto quality care. This legislation is another example of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee's record of success on bipartisan reform to improve \nthe state of health care in America. I encourage my colleagues to vote \nfor this package.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for H.R. 3716, Ensuring \nRemoval of Terminated Providers from Medicaid and CHIP Act. Among other \nthings, this bill requires State Medicaid and CHIP programs to report \nproviders terminated for reasons of fraud, integrity, or quality to CMS \nwithin 21 business days.\n  The requirements in this legislation are straightforward and have \nachieved broad bipartisan support. I find myself strangely in the \nposition of agreeing with all of what my colleague from Texas had to \nsay. I listened to him intently. So it only leaves the question: Why is \nthis bill being presented here today instead of under the suspension \ncalendar?\n  Rather than taking the time to debate a rule for a bill that could be \npassed without the need for a special rule, would it not be a better \nuse of this body's valuable legislative time to debate and pass a \nbudget resolution and get the appropriations process started?\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Speaker Ryan's promises to end Republican \nobstruction and dysfunction and return to regular order, but I cannot \nsee how what is unfolding now is a step in that direction.\n  Last fall, Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a \nbipartisan budget agreement. Now Republicans, appeasing the most \nextreme fringe of their party, are considering breaking that agreement. \nBreaking this agreement will not be without consequences for this \nNation, including deeper cuts to seniors and working families.\n  Mr. Speaker, the majority's fumble on the budget has ushered in a new \nlevel of dysfunction for this institution. My Republican friends' \ninability to govern has gotten so bad that they can't even agree to \nfollow through on an agreement they have already agreed to and has been \nsigned into law.\n  As we debate today, it is still not clear how the majority plans to \nmove forward on one of this body's most basic constitutional \nobligations: appropriating funds to run the country.\n  I told the young people working with me that I thought of a metaphor \nlast night about when I first learned to swim. I grew up in an area \nwhere there were a lot of lakes, so it was automatic that all of us \nwould learn how to swim, and we did. In learning to swim, among the \nthings that the young boys taught me was there were times when you just \ntread water, where you don't move forward or backward. If you are \nbackstroking, just tread water. Some learned to float. I didn't. But \napparently my Republican friends have learned to float and have learned \nto tread water because we are not going anywhere fast in this \ninstitution of dysfunction.\n  The inability to fulfill this obligation is truly astounding and \nreveals a Republican majority that may wish upon every star in the sky \nto return to regular order but has no earthly idea of how to do so. \nIndeed, the only regularity we see coming out of today's Republican \nleadership is one dedicated to disorder.\n  The inability to even begin a fruitful discussion of a budget process \nis but one among many pieces of evidence that prove that the Republican \nhopes of regular order are as elusive as is their ability to put forth \na plan that will benefit working class Americans, strengthen our \ninfrastructure, and provide for the least among us. It would be comical \nif it were not so dire.\n  Let's recap how we have arrived at this point of Republican inability \nto govern. For the first time in 40 years, Republicans refuse to even \ninvite a representative from the administration to testify on the \nPresident's budget proposal. Then, Republican leaders failed to hold a \ncommittee markup on a budget resolution last week and fumbled their \nplans to present their conference with a promised budget blueprint. \nNow, in order to appease the insatiable radical fringe of his party, \nSpeaker Ryan is threatening to break the terms of the bipartisan budget \nagreement passed into law last year--totally unbelievable.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. They want us to work \ntogether to fund their government and solve the problems of this \ncountry. This whole Republican budget process has shown that the \nmajority and the radical fringe rightwing of their party are simply not \nup to that task.\n  I might add that I read last night that the majority leader in the \nother body has made it very clear that he is not going to play along \nwith House Republican functionaries who would send stuff to the Senate \nthat is not going to pass. I predict that we will one day have the \nusual omnibus at the end of this process, and that is tragic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so pending Mr. \nHastings' conclusion, I will reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers as well, and I \nam prepared to close.\n  I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer \nan amendment to the rule to bring up a resolution that would require \nthe Republican majority to stop its partisan games and finally hold \nhearings on the President's budget proposal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and \ndefeat the previous question.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill underlying this rule institutes a number of \nproposals that have broad bipartisan support. So again I ask: Why are \nwe here debating a rule for such a bill? Quite obviously, it is because \nRepublicans have no choice but to tread water. In doing so, they have \ncalled a time-out on helping the American people; they have called a \ntime-out on doing their job.\n  They have done so so that they may make haste in putting Humpty \nDumpty back together again.\n  Good luck, my friends. Truly, truly, I wish you good luck.\n  In the meantime, rest assured that those of us on this side of the \naisle stand ready in getting to the people's business once you can pull \nyourselves together and put forth a budget plan. I am, of course, \nsuspect of whether our friends on the other side of the aisle will be \nable to do so.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do want to point out today is March 2, significant for \nmany of us in Texas because that is Texas Independence Day, a date that \nis recognized across the Nation as one that brought independence to the \nState of Texas.\n  I would point out it seems like oftentimes, in my role here \npresenting the Republican case for the rule from the Rules Committee, \nit also becomes my duty to provide some historical perspective for the \nHouse of Representatives, and today is no exception.\n  March 2, today, the first year that the Democrats had the majority in \nrecent memory was calendar year 2007.\n\n[[Page H1097]]\n\nWhen was a budget passed in calendar year 2007? It was passed on March \n29. I would point out that the only thing bipartisan about that budget \nresolution was the opposition.\n  Calendar 2008, a bit better, the budget passed on March 13, the \nmiddle of the month, about 2 weeks from where we are today. Once again, \non that budget, 212 yeas and 207 nays. But the nays were bipartisan. \nThe yeas, of course, were of a single party.\n  Calendar year 2009, the budget didn't pass until the month of April, \nand, once again, the only thing bipartisan about the budget that year \nwas its opposition.\n  Then, finally, I would point out that the following calendar year, \n2010, there was no budget submitted.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, my understanding from the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is they are actively working on the budget. I wish them \nGodspeed. I am thankful that I don't have to be in the room while it is \nbeing done, but I have every confidence that they will produce a budget \ndocument that the House will then consider. But today--today--Mr. \nSpeaker, today's rule provides for consideration of an important fix to \nthe Nation's Medicaid program.\n  I certainly want to thank Dr. Larry Bucshon and Mr. Collins of New \nYork--both, of the Energy and Commerce Committee, two important members \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce--for their work on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and \n``yes'' on the underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n     An amendment to H. Res. 632 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 624) \n     Directing the Committee on the Budget to hold a public \n     hearing on the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request \n     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as a \n     witness. The resolution shall be considered as read. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the \n     resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening \n     motion or demand for division of the question except one hour \n     of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H. Res. 624.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1097-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1245\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Benishek).

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon) and the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Tonko) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The bipartisan bill before us today improves access to quality \nhealthcare providers for vulnerable Medicaid patients.\n  Today, State Medicaid programs too often suffer from waste, fraud, \nand abuse, which can harm beneficiaries and waste taxpayer dollars. At \nthe same time, too many Medicaid patients may have a hard time finding \na doctor. Our bill takes an important step forward in addressing both \nof these issues.\n  First, H.R. 3716 would ensure healthcare providers that are \nterminated from Medicaid or from one State's Medicaid program for \nreasons\n\n[[Page H1098]]\n\nof fraud, integrity, or quality are also terminated from other State \nMedicaid programs. The Office of Inspector General at HHS has \npreviously found that 12 percent of terminated providers were \nparticipating in a State Medicaid program after the same provider was \nterminated from another State Medicaid program.\n  It is critical that fraudulent providers are not allowed to defraud \ntaxpayers or to harm patients across the board. Medicaid beneficiaries \nare some of the most vulnerable patients, so our bipartisan bill will \nensure that they are better protected. This commonsense bill was \nreported favorably from our Health Subcommittee and from the full \nEnergy and Commerce Committee last year.\n  The other important aspect of this legislation was authored by Chris \nCollins of New York. This provision of the bill requires State Medicaid \nprograms to provide beneficiaries who are served under fee-for-service \nor primary care case management programs an electronic directory of \nphysicians who are participating in the program.\n  Research shows that too often Medicaid patients today have a hard \ntime finding a doctor. The Government Accountability Office has \npreviously found that Medicaid patients face particular challenges in \naccessing certain types of care, such as obtaining specialty care or \ndental care. Additionally, the GAO has previously reported that 38 \nStates experienced challenges in ensuring enough participating \nproviders.\n  To help empower Medicaid patients and equip them with better \ninformation, this policy would apply requirements similar to those in \nplace for Medicaid managed care plans to fee-for-service and/or primary \ncare case management programs.\n  Under the bill, States would be required to list on their Web sites a \ndirectory of physicians that would include the physician's name, \nspecialty, address, and telephone number. Additionally, for physicians \nserving as case managers through the PCCM programs, States would be \nrequired to include information on whether a physician is accepting new \npatients as well as to list the physician's cultural and linguistic \ncapabilities.\n  In a day and age when Medicaid patients can use their phones to \nsearch for the nearest gas station or grocery store, it makes good \nsense to ensure that States are giving patients better information so \nthat they can readily find a doctor near them who accepts Medicaid \npatients.\n  Finally, according to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 3716 \nwould reduce Federal outlays by $15 million over a 10-year budget \nwindow because the Medicaid program would no longer be paying providers \nthat were terminated for reasons of fraud, integrity, or quality. The \nCBO does not estimate State-specific savings, but this bill would also \nsave State Medicaid programs several million dollars over the same \ntimeframe.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation provides commonsense reforms that help \nprotect Medicaid beneficiaries, that improve access to care, and that \nsave Federal and State dollars in the Medicaid program. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 3716.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am here to express my strong support for the Ensuring Access to \nQuality Medicaid Providers Act.\n  In particular, I am pleased that this legislation incorporates the \nMedicaid Directory of Caregivers Act, also known as the Medicaid DOC \nAct. This is legislation in which I joined with my colleague and friend \nfrom New York, Representative Collins, in introducing.\n  I thank Representative Collins for his initiative in this area and \nfor working together on this issue in a collaborative and bipartisan \nway. I also thank the Energy and Commerce Committee staffs on both \nsides for providing constructive feedback and for expeditiously moving \nthis bill out of committee.\n  The impetus behind this bill is simple and straightforward: to make \nit easier for Medicaid beneficiaries to find and access a doctor.\n  The underlying legislation would require States that operate a fee-\nfor-service Medicaid program to publish an online provider directory, \njust like managed care plans and private insurance are already required \nto do. By creating a one-stop-shop for Medicaid beneficiaries to find \ninformation on participating providers, this commonsense legislation \nwill make it easier for individuals and families to access quality \nhealth care.\n  The legislation details the minimum items that must be included in a \nprovider directory, but it also allows States to go beyond those given \nstandards. All consumers deserve to have access to a basic electronic \nprovider directory to find the best physicians for their use.\n  The second component of the legislation under consideration would \nprovide the CMS with critical tools to keep patients safe, to protect \ntaxpayer dollars, and to protect the integrity of our Medicaid program.\n  This bipartisan bill, introduced by Representatives Bucshon, Welch, \nand Butterfield, implements previous OIG recommendations and builds on \nauthorities originally authorized under the ACA. The ACA included a \nprovision that prohibited disqualified providers from Medicare or a one \nState Medicaid program from simply crossing State lines and receiving \npayments in another State Medicaid program.\n\n  The ACA provision has been hard to implement, however, because States \ndon't have a consistent or a standardized way of knowing when a \nspecific provider has been terminated by Medicare or by another State. \nAll States are not currently required to report this information, and \nif it is reported, it is in many differing formats, limiting the data's \nusability.\n  This legislation would require all States to report information on \nfraudulent providers to the Secretary for inclusion in a currently \nexisting termination database that is accessible to all States. The \nlegislation also requires the Secretary to develop uniform criteria for \nStates to use when submitting information.\n  The language would also require all providers in managed care to \nenroll with State Medicaid agencies so that States know all providers \nthat are participating in the program. This legislation preserves all \nexisting provider appeals processes, and it changes nothing regarding \nthe underlying standard for fraud in this part of the program.\n  In closing, Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support this \nbipartisan legislation, which makes Medicaid more consumer-friendly and \nstrengthens program integrity.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is the type of legislation that we should be passing on the \nHouse floor, and I will urge the Senate to pass this legislation later. \nThis is just good government. It corrects some obvious flaws in the \nMedicaid program that will protect patients and save taxpayers money. I \nam very pleased that we are able to address this today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TONKO. As I earlier mentioned in my comments, one of the key \nparticipants in putting this effort together was Representative Welch \nfrom the State of Vermont.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a good \nfriend and a fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member.\n  Mr. WELCH. I thank the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are lucky we have Dr. Bucshon, a good Member, a good \nfriend, and a great Energy and Commerce Committee person, who, with his \nexperience as a physician, is able to give us the benefit of this bill. \nI thank the gentleman from Indiana for that.\n  The Medicaid program is an incredibly important program to get health \ncare to poor Americans who need it. The vast majority of our providers \nuse the Medicaid program to provide those services, but some fraudulent \nproviders use that program to rip off taxpayers. It has got to stop.\n  One of the things that Dr. Bucshon observed and brought to our \nattention was that when States are aggressively monitoring for fraud \nand when they identify a fraudulent provider, they write that person \noff the rolls so that that provider can't keep ripping off the \ntaxpayers. But that information doesn't get disseminated to other \nStates, so that fraudulent provider simply steps across the State line, \nsets\n\n[[Page H1099]]\n\nup another operation, and starts ripping off taxpayers all over again.\n  This legislation addresses that rip-off. I am glad it does because we \ncan debate about lots of things, but there is unity here about wanting \nto make certain that any taxpayer dollar is well spent and that it is \nnot ripped off by a fraudulent provider. This sets up practical \nmechanisms for States that have identified a fraudulent provider so \nthey may share that information with other States so they don't find \nthemselves digging the same hole.\n  We have bipartisan support for this. It is a money-saving bill. The \nCBO estimates that it would save approximately $28 million over 10 \nyears.\n  That may sound like small money; but do you want to know something?\n  That is real money. It is about the money, but it is also about \nconstant vigilance so as to make sure that the programs we design for \ngood intentions work.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. TONKO. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELCH. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is just what we should be doing here so we can look \nat things that have good intentions, like the Medicaid program, and \nfind where there are holes in it and try to close them so that the \nprogram runs better so that taxpayer money is saved and so that the \nefficiency of government is enhanced.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  And that is a mutual responsibility that we have so that people can \nhave confidence that the taxpayer dollars that they are spending, \nwhether it is for Medicaid or the Pentagon or any other program, are \nspent for the intended purposes and are not wasted.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman for his comments. It is true that when you find \ncommon ground and work together, good things happen, and this is one of \nthose instances.\n  I think there are a lot of areas in health care. I was a healthcare \nprovider before I was a heart surgeon. I took care of Medicaid and \nMedicare patients, private insurance patients, and patients that did \nnot have the ability to pay. I think that we need to continue to look \nfor ways to improve our safety net healthcare programs, mainly continue \nto look for ways to make sure that people have access to health care in \nthe United States regardless of their ability to pay, regardless of \ntheir ZIP Code.\n  That said, we need to make sure that people have access to quality \nhealth care, and that is why bills like this are so important. It weeds \nout providers that are fraudulent and have other quality-related \nproblems.\n  As a physician--and I will speak for some of my physician friends--\nthis is the type of thing that we all want in our specialties. We want \nto make sure that the patients that we serve have access to physicians \nwho are providing quality health care and are not defrauding the \nsystem.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I will continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Chair, I thank both Congressman Bucshon \nand Congressman Tonko for their help on this very important bill that \nwe are debating today. Included in Congressman Bucshon's bill, H.R. \n3716, is a bill that Mr. Tonko and I put together, H.R. 3821, the \nMedicare Directory of Caregivers, or DOC, Act.\n  Our thought behind this bill came from the GAO report that identified \naccess to care as one of the key issues facing Medicaid beneficiaries. \nThere is nothing worse than someone saying: ``The good news is you have \ngot medical insurance coverage through Medicaid. The bad news is they \ncan't find a physician.''\n  So as a very good, commonsense government idea, what Representative \nTonko and I came up with was the thought that we should be publishing \non each State's Web site a list of the providers who have seen a \nMedicaid patient in the last 12 months, the name of the physician, the \naddress, the telephone number, and their specialty, so at least these \nfolks navigating the system to find a doctor have somewhere to go as a \nstarting point: ``Here is a doctor that has seen a Medicaid patient in \nthe last 12 months. Let me give them a call.'' So they are not just \nlost going through the phonebook, so to speak, or Google.\n  What our bill would do, it would require that States that operate a \nfee-for-service or primary care case management program set up an \nonline directory of physicians who have seen these Medicaid patients. \nWe believe that this kind of access to caregivers will keep people out \nof the emergency rooms. They will have coordinated care by a physician, \nwhich is the best and most inexpensive way to treat them.\n  Representative Bucshon's bill combined with our bill, H.R. 3821, does \nsave $15 million over the 10-year period, as scored. The bill went \nthrough regular order and passed out of the Energy and Commerce \nsubcommittee and full committee by voice vote with no objections.\n  We are also encouraged to know the White House has signaled that they \ndo support passage of this important access to care legislation.\n  Again, I thank Chairmen Upton and Pitts, and Ranking Members Pallone \nand Green for their support. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor \nof this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the standing Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce, who has shown great leadership for the Democrats \nat the Energy and Commerce table. He is very much supportive of this \neffort here, and we thank him for that.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to support H.R. 3716, the \nEnsuring Access to Quality Medicaid Providers Act. This legislation is \nthe compilation of two bills, H.R. 3821 and H.R. 3716, which are true \nefforts to improve program integrity in Medicaid in ways that will \nstrengthen the Medicaid program. Both bipartisan bills passed out of \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee through regular order and were \nfavorably reported by voice vote.\n  Part of the new compiled bill reflects H.R. 3821, the Medicaid DOC \nAct. This bipartisan initiative, introduced by Representatives Collins \nof New York and Tonko, would require States that participate in fee-\nfor-service Medicaid to publish electronic provider directories. This \nis critical information for patients so they can more easily find \ndoctors in their area.\n  Currently, managed care plans in Medicaid are already required to \nmaintain these directories, but there is no such requirement for fee-\nfor-service Medicaid programs. While some States are already providing \nthese directories, not every State does so. This commonsense and \nconsumer-friendly legislation will require that all States provide \ntheir Medicaid patients with this information, and it does so quickly, \nrequiring directories to be up and running in less than 1 year.\n  Now, while the bill includes minimum items that must be included in a \nprovider directory, it also encourages States to go beyond these \nstandards. While I am hopeful that States will take the initiative to \nprovide other information, like whether doctors are taking new \npatients, the timeline set forth in this legislation is so accelerated, \nit is important that we build this foundation first before adding \nadditional requirements to States. I look forward to continuing to work \non this important issue with my colleagues.\n  The second part of the bill would provide CMS with critical tools to \nkeep patients safe, protect taxpayer dollars, and protect the integrity \nof the Medicaid program.\n  This bipartisan bill, introduced by Representatives Bucshon, Welch, \nand Butterfield, implements previous OIG recommendations and builds on \nauthorities originally authorized under the Affordable Care Act, which \nprohibited disqualified providers from Medicare or one State Medicaid \nprogram from simply crossing State lines and receiving payments in \nanother State Medicaid program.\n  But the current law has been hard to implement because States don't \nhave a consistent or standardized way of knowing when a specific \nprovider has been terminated by Medicare or another State. Since States \nare not currently required to report this information or, if it is \nreported, it is in many\n\n[[Page H1100]]\n\ndiffering formats, it limits the data's usability.\n  This legislation being considered would require all States to report \ninformation on fraudulent providers to the Secretary for inclusion in \nan existing termination database that is accessible to all States. It \nalso requires the Secretary to develop uniform criteria for States to \nuse when submitting information and ensures those providers in managed \ncare plans are enrolled with the State and also captured in the \ndatabase.\n  Finally, the bill preserves and protects all existing provider appeal \nprocesses and changes nothing regarding the underlying standard for \nfraud in this part of the program, an important protection. This is \nsmart policy that stakeholders and the administration agree will \nimprove Federal and State efforts.\n  I urge Members to support the bill.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance).\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chair, this is the way Congress should work, in a \nbipartisan capacity on an issue of importance to better the health of \nthe American Nation.\n  As is so often true of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, we \nwork in a bipartisan fashion. It is the committee of jurisdiction for \nso many of the issues that reach this floor, with the support in \ncommittee and in subcommittee of both Republicans and Democrats. \nLegislation coming out of our committee, the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, is legislation that passes here on the floor, goes over to \nthe other House, and is eventually signed into law by the President of \nthe United States. I am pleased that we are working closely with the \nother elected branch of government in this area.\n  I commend Congressman Bucshon, Dr. Bucshon, for his legislation that \nwill so improve the issue we are discussing, and I think that Medicaid \nproviders is an important matter for the entire Nation. I also \ncompliment Congressman Collins of New York for his involvement on this \nissue.\n  With a program as large as Medicaid, it will always be a target for \nthose who engage in fraud, but we can work to limit the impact of those \nwho engage in fraud. The Congressman's bill is a positive step in that \ndirection. It will save millions of dollars and send a message loud and \nclear that bad actors in one State should not be allowed to participate \nanywhere.\n  Medicaid-managed care plans already provide a network of doctors and \nnurses to care for patients. The requirement in this bill ensures that \npatients in fee-for-service Medicaid programs do not have to fend for \nthemselves.\n  Research has shown that access to doctors can be a problem for \nMedicaid beneficiaries, so this commonsense step will help ensure \nbeneficiaries are empowered with better information and that this \nhappens across the board.\n  I thank Dr. Bucshon and Mr. Collins, as well as the Health \nSubcommittee and its chairman, Chairman Pitts, and the full committee, \nincluding, of course, Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone. Let's \nwork together to ensure passage of this legislation on the floor of the \nHouse today.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. \n3716, the Ensuring Access to Quality Medicaid Providers Act.\n  A recent report by the HHS inspector general found that more than 1 \nin every 10 Medicaid providers who were terminated for fraud, \nintegrity, or quality in one State were still participating in another \nState's Medicaid program.\n  To ensure that Medicaid patients are receiving their care from a \nqualified, licensed doctor, H.R. 3716 provides that disqualified \nproviders be reported within 21 days to CMS, and each Medicaid provider \nmust be enrolled with the State Medicaid agency.\n  H.R. 3716 also provides that State Medicaid programs include an \nelectronic directory of physicians who serve Medicaid patients. Today, \nmany Medicaid patients have a hard time finding a doctor and instead \nrely on the emergency room. With an established directory, Medicaid \npatients will be able to know which doctors are available to them and \nwill ultimately get better care.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the reforms in H.R. 3716 so we \ncan make sure that Medicaid patients are receiving the care and \nattention they deserve.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, again, I just would thank all who have been \ninvolved with the effort here--from my perspective, particularly \nRepresentative Collins, Dr. Bucshon, Representative Welch, and others \nwho put together, I think, a good effort here to have a bipartisan, \ncollaborative effort that speaks to sensitivity, speaks to compassion \ntoward the patients, those requiring the access to health care, and \ncertainly has great respect for the taxpayer and the ensuing outcomes.\n  With that, I would encourage my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chair, I would just like to echo the words of Mr. \nTonko. This is good legislation. It improves the Medicaid program. It \nensures access to quality providers for our Medicaid recipients in all \nof our States. Also, it helps our States to determine when people have \nbeen kicked off the program as a provider in another State and, \ntherefore, helps them protect the patients in their own States.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, today we are making a difference for the \nnation's most vulnerable. Republicans and Democrats working to \nstrengthen Medicaid, and the White House has officially given its seal \nof approval to these commonsense reforms.\n  Today is an important day and underscores what we can accomplish when \nwe work together.\n  Medicaid is an important lifeline for so many in Michigan and across \nthe country. It is estimated the program will expand to cover 83 \nmillion people this year--to put that into perspective, that's one in \nfour Americans. Given its rapidly growing size, it is imperative the \nprogram is working as it is intended--providing care for folks who need \nit most.\n  The Ensuring Access to Quality Medicaid Providers Act we are \nconsidering is the product of two bills authored by committee members \nDr. Larry Bucshon and Rep. Chris Collins that unanimously cleared both \nthe Health Subcommittee and full committee last fall.\n  Dr. Bucshon led the effort to help cut down on fraud by eliminating \nbad actors. The bipartisan legislation ensures that providers \nterminated from Medicare or a state Medicaid program for reasons of \nfraud, integrity, or quality are terminated across the board from all \nother state Medicaid programs.\n  With a program as large as Medicaid, it will always be a target for \nfraudsters, but we can work to limit their impact, and this bill is an \npositive step that will save millions of dollars and send the message \nloud and clear that bad actors in one state should not be allowed to \nparticipate anywhere, period.\n  In addition to reducing fraud, we are helping increase access for \nthose most in need. Finding a doctor is often a difficult task, and Mr. \nCollins led this effort to increase access to care beyond the emergency \nroom. If a state is using a fee-for-service or primary case management \nsystem to deliver care to Medicaid patients, this bill requires they \nprovide those patients with a directory of physicians.\n  Medicaid managed care plans already provide a network of doctors and \nnurses to care for patients. This requirement ensures that patients in \nfee-for-service Medicaid programs don't have to fend for themselves.\n  Research has shown that access to doctors can be a problem for \nMedicaid beneficiaries, so this commonsense step will help ensure \nbeneficiaries are empowered with better information that is more \nreadily available. And that's a good thing.\n  This bill doesn't solve all our problems, but it is a significant \nbipartisan step forward. And yesterday, the Office of Management and \nBudget announced the administration ``supports House passage of H.R. \n3716 because it improves program integrity for Medicaid and the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.''\n  We've got Republicans, Democrats, and the White House all in lockstep \nsupporting meaningful, 21st century reforms for Medicaid. This bill \nshows that it's possible to work together on Medicaid.\n  I'd like to once again thank Dr. Bucshon and Mr. Collins, as well as \nHelath Subcommittee Chairman Pitts and full committee Ranking Member \nPallone. Together, we are building upon the committee's proud \nbipartisan record of success. Let's keep the momentum going to help our \nmost vulnerable folks.\n\n[[Page H1101]]\n\n  The CHAIR.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the\n\n[[Page H1105]]\n\nenclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in \nExecutive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, is to continue in effect beyond \nMarch 6, 2016.\n  The actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic \nprocesses and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, \nstability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to \nthe misappropriation of its assets, as well as the actions and policies \nof the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported \nannexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to pose \nan unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined that \nit is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in \nExecutive Order 13660 with respect to Ukraine.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 2, 2016.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 NOTICE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Ukraine\n\n  On March 6, 2014, by Executive Order 13660, I declared a national \nemergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat \nto the national security and foreign policy of the United States \nconstituted by the actions and policies of persons that undermine \ndemocratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, \nsecurity, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and \ncontribute to the misappropriation of its assets.\n  On March 16, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13661, which expanded the \nscope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, and \nfound that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian \nFederation with respect to Ukraine undermine democratic processes and \ninstitutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, \nsovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the \nmisappropriation of its assets.\n  On March 20, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13662, which further \nexpanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 13660, as expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661, and found \nthat the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian \nFederation, including its purported annexation of Crimea and its use of \nforce in Ukraine, continue to undermine democratic processes and \ninstitutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, \nsovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the \nmisappropriation of its assets.\n  On December 19, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13685, to take \nadditional steps to address the Russian occupation of the Crimea region \nof Ukraine.\n  The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue \nto pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national \nemergency declared on March 6, 2014, and the measures adopted on that \ndate, on March 16, 2014, on March 20, 2014, and December 19, 2014, to \ndeal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2016. \nTherefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 13660.\n  This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and \ntransmitted to the Congress.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 2, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1105-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana.

These actions and policies \ncontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign \npolicy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that \nit is necessary to continue this national emergency and to maintain in \nforce the sanctions to respond to this threat.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 2, 2016.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 NOTICE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe\n\n  On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a \nnational emergency and blocked the property of certain persons, \npursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. \n1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nforeign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and \npolicies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other \npersons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. \nThese actions and policies had contributed to the deliberate breakdown \nin the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and \nintimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability \nin the southern African region.\n  On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to \ntake additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared \nin Executive Order 13288, including the blocking of the property of \nadditional persons engaged in undermining democratic processes or \ninstitutions in Zimbabwe.\n  On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which \nexpanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 13288 and authorized the blocking of the property of additional \npersons who were engaged in undermining democratic processes or \ninstitutions in Zimbabwe, facilitating public corruption by senior \nofficials, or were responsible for committing human rights abuses \nrelated to political repression.\n  The actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. \nFor this reason, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and \nthe measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July \n25, 2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond \nMarch 6, 2016.

Byers Jr. being awarded the Medal of Honor by \n     President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House on \n     February 29.\n       The Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator is only the 11th \n     living service member to be awarded the Medal of Honor for \n     bravery displayed in Afghanistan.\n       According to Navy information, Byers was born in Toledo in \n     1979 and grew up in Grand Rapids, Ohio. After graduating from \n     Otsego High School, where he played varsity soccer, he joined \n     the Navy in 1998.\n       Byers attended hospital corpsman school and also completed \n     a basic underwater demolition/SEAL course and special \n     operations combat medic course in 2003.\n       He went on 11 overseas deployments, including nine combat \n     tours.\n       The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the armed \n     forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry \n     and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives above and \n     beyond the call of duty.\n       The mission that lead to his Medal of Honor award involved \n     the rescue of Dr. Dilip Joseph, an American who was abducted \n     with his driver and Afghan interpreter in December of 2012.\n       U.S. intelligence located Joseph in a remote mountainous \n     area in a small, single-room building, and Byers was part of \n     the team assigned to the recovery mission.\n       In a subsequent Navy Interview, Byers detailed his role in \n     that mission:\n       ``So that night was December 8 in Eastern Afghanistan, it \n     was a cool night, we got off the helicopters, did a four- or \n     five-hour pretty arduous hike through the mountains, and upon \n     getting to our target building where we assumed the American \n     hostage was at, our point man Nick Cheque, he was right in \n     front of me, he saw a guard come out of the door, he engaged \n     that guard and we started sprinting towards the door.\n       ``Nick made his way in, and I made my way in right behind \n     him, and I went down by the wall, and I engaged an enemy by \n     the backside of the wall. And then I saw another person \n     moving across the floor, so by the time I got to him he was \n     on his back and I was able to get down on top of him and \n     straddle him with my knees, and I had to adjust my night \n     vision to try to get some facial recognition.\n       ``At the same time this is happening I'm calling out trying \n     to find the location of the American hostage. And finally he \n     spoke up and it was at that time I engaged the person I was \n     on top of and jumped off, and jumped off of the guy I was on \n     and jumped onto the doctor who was about three or four, maybe \n     five feet to my right.\n       ``The reason I did that is because I was wearing body \n     armor, so I wanted to protect him from any other potential \n     threats in the room.\n       ``Anyone who's been in combat knows that in those moments \n     you either react, or you get killed.\n       ``When I did that there was a guy that was right behind him \n     within arm's reach, who was armed, and I was able to pin that \n     guy to the wall by his throat, kind-of holding the doctor, \n     and waiting for my teammates to come in and take care of the \n     threat that was right next to us. When I was done, I still \n     laid on top of him, and kept asking him `hey can you walk,' \n     you know, and `is there anything medically wrong with you,' \n     because our goal is to bring this guy back alive.\n       So, he said he was fine, and once we got outside, I noticed \n     that our medics were working on Nick, and you know, being a \n     medic myself I passed off the American hostage off to our \n     other teammates and I went over to work on Nick, and did \n     resuscitative efforts on him all the way to the hospital, \n     where he was announced dead there.''\n       The official citation noted: ``Chief Petty Officer Byers \n     displayed superior gallantry, extraordinary heroism at grave \n     personal risk, dedication to his teammates, and calm tactical \n     leadership while liberating Dr. Dilip Joseph from \n     captivity.''\n       Byers said that when he found out he was being awarded the \n     Medal of Honor, ``I felt very honored and very humbled \n     because I'm gonna be a representative for the Navy and the \n     naval special warfare community, and there's a weight that's \n     carried with that.\n       ``And that weight is the sacrifices that everybody has made \n     within this community. Guys like Nick Cheque and all of our \n     other brothers that have fallen, is it's an affirmation of \n     the job that we do, and an appreciation of the job we do.''\n       In the interview, Byers also credited the support of his \n     family, and noted that when he told his mother about the \n     award ceremony, ``the first question out of her mouth is `Do \n     you think I can come to it?' And I said of course, mom, I \n     think you'll be able to come to it.''\n       He also noted that his daughter ``knows that I'm daddy, and \n     she loves me just for that. If you talk to her one-on-one, \n     she'll tell you all the five nicknames she has for me, and \n     none of them includes `hero.' ''\n       He concluded, ``I'm gonna continue to be a SEAL. And I'm \n     gonna take whatever job or mission is next for me, and just \n     continue doing that. I don't have any plans on changing my \n     job at this time. I still love what I do, and as long as I \n     love what I do I'll continue doing it.''\n       Byers' personal decorations include the Bronze Star with \n     Valor (five awards), the Purple Heart (two awards), the Joint \n     Service Commendation Medal with Valor, the Navy Commendation \n     Medal (three awards, one with Valor), the Combat Action \n     ribbon (two awards), and the Good Conduct Medal (five \n     awards).\n       He is one of only eight living Navy Medal of Honor \n     recipients. There are 78 living recipients total.\n       Ohio has had 319 other Medal of Honor recipients with a \n     connection to this state, dating back to the Civil War.\n\n                           Summary of Action\n\n\n Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator (SEAL) Edward C. Byers Jr.: For \n       actions during Operation Enduring Freedom on Dec. 8, 2012\n\n       Chief Special Warfare Operator (SEAL) Edward C. Byers Jr., \n     United States Navy, distinguished himself by heroic gallantry \n     as an Assault Team Member attached to a Joint Task Force in \n     support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM on 8 December 2012.\n\n\n                        specific accomplishment\n\n       Dr. Dilip Joseph is an American citizen, who was abducted \n     with his driver and Afghan interpreter on 5 December 2012. \n     Intelligence reports indicated that Dr. Joseph might be \n     transported to another location as early as 9 December 2012. \n     Dr. Joseph was being held in a small, single-room building.\n       The target compound was located in a remote area beside a \n     mountain in the Qarghah'i District of Laghman Province, \n     Afghanistan. Chief Byers was part of the rescue team that \n     planned to make entry into the room of guards where the \n     hostage was believed to be located. Success of the rescue \n     operation relied upon surprise, speed, and aggressive action. \n     Trading personal security\n\n[[Page H1107]]\n\n     for speed of action was inherent to the success of this \n     rescue mission. Each assaulter in the rescue force \n     volunteered for this operation with full appreciation for the \n     risks they were to undertake.\n       With the approval of the Commander of all International \n     Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan, the rescue force \n     launched from its forward operating base. The infiltration \n     was an exhaustive patrol across unimproved trails and \n     mountainous terrain. After nearly four hours of patrolling, \n     the rescue force was positioned to make its assault on the \n     target compound.\n       As the patrol closed to within 25 meters of the target \n     building, a guard became aware of the rescue force. The \n     forward-most assaulter shot at the guard and ran towards the \n     door to make entry as the guard disappeared inside. Chief \n     Byers was the second assaulter in a sprint towards the door. \n     Six layers of blankets securely fastened to the ceiling and \n     walls served as the Afghan door. While Chief Byers tried to \n     rip down the blankets, the first assaulter pushed his way \n     through the doorway and was immediately shot by enemy AK-47 \n     fire. Chief Byers, fully aware of the hostile threat inside \n     the room, boldly entered and immediately engaged a guard \n     pointing an AK-47 towards him. As he was engaging that guard, \n     another adult male darted towards the corner of the room. \n     Chief Byers could not distinguish if the person may have been \n     the hostage scrambling away or a guard attempting to arm \n     himself with an AK-47 that lay in the corner. Chief Byers \n     tackled the unknown male and seized control of him. While in \n     hand-to-hand combat, Chief Byers maintained control of the \n     unknown male with one hand, while adjusting the focus of his \n     night vision goggles (NVGs) with his other. Once his NVGs \n     were focused, he recognized that the male was not the hostage \n     and engaged the struggling armed guard.\n       By now other team members had entered the room and were \n     calling to Dr. Joseph to identify himself. Chief Byers heard \n     an unknown voice speak English from his right side. He \n     immediately leaped across the room and selflessly flung his \n     body on top of the American hostage, shielding him from the \n     continued rounds being fired across the room. Almost \n     simultaneously, Chief Byers identified an additional enemy \n     fighter directly behind Dr. Joseph. While covering the \n     hostage with his body, Chief Byers was able to pin the enemy \n     combatant to the wall with his hand around the enemy's \n     throat. Unable to fire any effective rounds into the enemy, \n     Chief Byers was able to restrain the combatant enough to \n     enable his teammate to fire precision shots, eliminating the \n     final threat within the room.\n       Chief Byers quickly talked to Dr. Joseph, confirming that \n     he was able to move. He and his Team Leader stood Dr. Joseph \n     up, calmed him, and let him know he was safe with American \n     Forces. Once Dr. Joseph was moved to the helicopter-landing \n     zone, Chief Byers, a certified paramedic and 18D medic, \n     assisted with the rendering of medical aid to the urgent \n     surgical assaulter. Chief Byers and others performed CPR \n     during the 40-minute flight to Bagram Airfield where his \n     teammate was declared deceased.\n       Chief Petty Officer Byers displayed superior gallantry, \n     extraordinary heroism at grave personal risk, dedication to \n     his teammates, and calm tactical leadership while liberating \n     Dr. Dilip Joseph from captivity. He is unquestionably \n     deserving of the Medal of Honor.\n\n                           Official Citation\n\n\n CHIEF SPECIAL WARFARE OPERATOR (SEA, AIR, AND LAND) EDWARD C. BYERS, \n                         JR. UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n       For service as set forth in the following citation:\n       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of \n     his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Hostage \n     Rescue Force Team Member in Afghanistan in support of \n     Operation ENDURING FREEDOM from 8 to 9 December 2012. As the \n     rescue force approached the target building, an enemy sentry \n     detected them and darted inside to alert his fellow captors. \n     The sentry quickly reemerged, and the lead assaulter \n     attempted to neutralize him. Chief Byers with his team \n     sprinted to the door of the target building. As the primary \n     breacher, Chief Byers stood in the doorway fully exposed to \n     enemy fire while ripping down six layers of heavy blankets \n     fastened to the inside ceiling and walls to clear a path for \n     the rescue force. The first assaulter pushed his way through \n     the blankets, and was mortally wounded by enemy small arms \n     fire from within. Chief Byers, completely aware of the \n     imminent threat, fearlessly rushed into the room and engaged \n     an enemy guard aiming an AK-47 at him. He then tackled \n     another adult male who had darted towards the corner of the \n     room. During the ensuing hand-to-hand struggle, Chief Byers \n     confirmed the man was not the hostage and engaged him. As \n     other rescue team members called out to the hostage, Chief \n     Byers heard a voice respond in English and raced toward it. \n     He jumped atop the American hostage and shielded him from the \n     high volume of fire within the small room. While covering the \n     hostage with his body, Chief Byers immobilized another guard \n     with his bare hands, and restrained the guard until a \n     teammate could eliminate him. His bold and decisive actions \n     under fire saved the lives of the hostage and several of his \n     teammates. By his undaunted courage, intrepid fighting \n     spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of near \n     certain death, Chief Petty Officer Byers reflected great \n     credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the \n     United States Naval Service.\n\n                               Biography\n\n\n    Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator (SEAL) Edward C.

One is described as a former Gitmo detainee who \nformerly fought with militants against Americans in Afghanistan.\n  The 91 high-security prisoners remaining at Guantanamo committed some \nof the most repulsive crimes known to all of us.\n  Severely lacking in detail, the plan to close Gitmo fails to describe \nwhere, under what authority, and at what cost the relocation of these \nterrorists will be.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is against the law to transfer terrorist detainees to \nAmerican soil without congressional approval.\n  The United States should do everything it can to keep terrorists out \nof our country, not purposely bring them here.\n\n[[Page H1108]]\n\n  Closing Gitmo endangers our U.S. national security, and it is a bad \nidea.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1108-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1745\n         SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NOMINATION PROCESS\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, when our Founders wrote the Constitution, \nthey had the wisdom to create a system of checks and balances among the \nthree branches of government. They knew this would limit power, protect \nagainst abuses, and promote liberty.\n  Under our Constitution, the President has the right to nominate \nJustices to the Supreme Court, but one House of the Congress, the \nSenate, has the coequal right to consent to such an appointment. One \nbranch has a power, another has a check.\n  Today, with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, we have a chance to see \nthis system of checks and balances in action. In deciding whether to \nconsent to an appointment to the Supreme Court, the Senate should \nassess whether the President has been acting consistent with the \nConstitution.\n  The chart to my left highlights just a few of President Obama's \nunconstitutional actions since he was reelected in 2012. These actions \nhave been frequent, repeated, and grave. These actions have poisoned \nthe well of deliberation for any appointment by this President.\n  In that light, why wouldn't the Senate withhold consent? It is a game \nthe President chose to play, and withholding consent to his appointment \nis an appropriate consequence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1108-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today is March 2, 2016. 180 years ago, \non March 2, 1836, in a little place called Washington-on-the-Brazos \ndown in Texas, people of what is now Texas declared their independence \nfrom the nation of Mexico--March 2, 1836. Tonight I am here to talk a \nlittle bit about those folks 180 years ago and the cause and the result \nof the Texas War of Independence against Mexico.\n  We have to back up a little bit. For a long time, almost 300 years, \nwhat is now Texas was controlled by the Spanish. They claimed the land \nin Texas. It was sparsely populated: some Indian tribes, but not very \nmany folks. At some point, Spain also controlled what is now Mexico.\n  Mexico, the nation of Mexico, chose to declare independence from that \nEuropean country of Spain and went to war with Spain to secure their \nindependence back in 1820. That revolution--they called it the War of \nIndependence--was successful. Mexico set up an independent nation, a \ndemocracy. They formed a government and a constitution very similar to \nthe United States. Texas was a part of Mexico at that time and was part \nof a state called Coahuila. It was the Coahuila de Texas, two areas of \nnorthern Mexico that were one state in Mexico.\n  Things were fine until Mexico elected a President by the name of \nSanta Anna. When he became President of Mexico, this particular \nPresident abolished the democracy, abolished the constitution of 1824 \nthat set up the Government of Mexico, and declared himself the dictator \nof Mexico. In fact, he destroyed the Republic of Mexico, the democracy \nof Mexico, and put himself as dictator-in-charge.\n  Throughout the history of the world, we know of a lot of dictators, \nbut they all seem to have one thing in common: they take away the \nrights--the civil rights--of the people.\n  Some people in Mexico didn't like this, and therefore they started \ntheir own secession movement, their own revolution, their own \nindependence. Now, most Americans know that Texas was one of those \nareas in Mexico that declared its independence from Mexico, and that \nindependence, that revolution, was successful. But there were other \nareas of northern Mexico--and here on this map I have some of those \nareas--that also declared their independence for the reason they wanted \nto be free. They wanted independence from the dictatorship.\n  There was the Republic of the Yucatan, there was the Republic \nCoahuila, and there were three or four other republics, and the \nRepublic of the Rio Grande. Several areas of population in Mexico \ndeclared their independence.\n  So what happened? Santa Anna not only was the dictator, but he was \nthe commander in chief, and he was the general. He was the guy. He \nmoved his army from Mexico City into these areas of revolution, areas \nwhere people were fighting against the government, the republic, or the \ndictatorship of Santa Anna. He had squelched, really, all of these \nrevolutionary movements; although, portions of these areas did declare \nindependence and appeared to have independence for a period of time.\n  So that brings us to 1835, several months before Texas declared \nindependence. Here is what started the Texas War of Independence:\n  While all of these other movements--some were going on, some would go \non a few months later. But during this period, there was insurrection \nin northern Mexico because people were trying to seek independence. It \nstarted on October 2, 1835, at Gonzales, Texas, a small little \ncommunity in Gonzales, Texas.\n  Remember, Texas is a part of Mexico at this time. The Mexican \nGovernment, when it was a free government, had encouraged immigration \ninto this part of Texas--not just from the United States, but from \nMexico and from European countries.\n  But this town of Gonzales, Texas, was in possession of a cannon. The \ncannon was to protect themselves from the people who lived in the area \nthat were hostiles, as they were called in those days. Native Americans \nare who they were. And that cannon was for that purpose.\n  The Mexican Government said: We want the cannon back. You cannot have \nthe cannon in Gonzales, Texas. We don't want you having it.\n  The Mexican Government made the demand on October 2 to the folks in \nGonzales, Texas: Return the cannon to the Mexican military.\n  The people, the settlers of Gonzales, said: No. We are not going to \ndo it. We are not giving you back the cannon. We need it.\n  So they resisted. They even made a flag. They called it the Come and \nTake It flag. You may have seen that recently. It is still popular with \na lot of folks. It was a flag that said, ``Come and take it,'' with a \ncannon on it. They hoisted this, and they had a skirmish with the \nMexican Army, who came to take the cannon. Shots were fired on both \nsides, multiple shots. Apparently, most of the people shooting weren't \ngreat marksmen. A couple of Mexican soldiers were wounded, and they \nretreated without the cannon. But that event started the actual \nshooting war in the War of Independence.\n  Months before that, there had been complaints. There had been letters \nwritten to the Mexican Government. Stephen F. Austin, the Father of \nTexas, had been imprisoned in Mexico City trying to get some civil \nrights for people who lived in what is now Texas. But it all came to a \nhead at this event in October of 1835.\n  It is interesting what started the Texas War of Independence, the \nshooting war, is very similar to what started\n\n[[Page H1109]]\n\nthe shooting war between the colonists and Great Britain. You remember \nthe British were in Boston. We have all heard about the march through \nLexington and Concord.\n  The purpose the British Army marched through Lexington and Concord in \nthe 1770s was to take the firearms, the weapons, away from the \ncolonists, out of the armories in Lexington and Concord. Of course, the \ncolonists refused. They fired back, and it started the shooting war \nwith the British Empire, later a successful War of Independence.\n  It is interesting that both of them started when government showed up \nto take the weapons, the firearms, of the people who lived in that \narea.\n  The shooting war started, and, quite frankly, it was successful up \nuntil about this time in 1836. An army of Texans had entered a place \ncalled the Alamo in February of 1836--February 23, 1836--because of the \napproaching army of Santa Anna that was coming north into Texas--Tejas, \nas it was called.\n  The men that assembled at the Alamo to try to stop the invading army \ncoming in were an interesting bunch. There were 100 to 187 of them. \nThey came from almost all of the then-States of the United States. They \ncame from several foreign countries, including Great Britain, Scotland, \nIreland, France, Germany, and Austria. Many of them were from what we \ncall Mexico, and they had come into the Alamo.\n  An interesting name that is unique to Texas history is that Texans of \nSpanish Mexican descent were called Tejanos, a unique name for Texans, \nTejanos of Spanish Mexican or Hispanic descent. There were eleven of \nthem at the Alamo.\n  The 180 to 187 were from all walks of life. I told you they were from \nall different countries. They were not only Anglos and Tejanos, but \nthere were two African Americans, two Blacks, at the Alamo, we \nunderstand. They were lawyers; they were frontiersmen; they were \nshopkeepers; they were young, and they were old.\n  There was even a United States Congressman at the Alamo. His name was \nDavid Crockett. He was a former Congressman from the State of \nTennessee. He had gone to Texas to help in the revolution and also to \nsee the fortunes that he could make as an individual.\n  There were a lot of reasons why people came to Texas, but 180 to 187 \nof them were in the Alamo to defend and to protect that concept of \nfreedom.\n  This is a painting of what the Alamo looked like at the time those \nmen were in the Alamo.\n  So they entered the Alamo--let's get the sequence of events correct--\nFebruary 23. They are in the Alamo on March 2 when Texas declared \nindependence. They were in the Alamo for 13 days. The final battle at \nthe Alamo was on March 6, 1836.\n  While they were in the Alamo, they were led by the commander of the \nAlamo, who is really my most favorite person in all of history. He was \na 27-year-old lawyer from South Carolina by way of Alabama. He had come \nto Texas to settle in the 1830s, and his name was William Barret \nTravis. He was placed in command of the Alamo, of all 180, 187 of the \nfolks that were there. While he was in the Alamo--he entered on \nFebruary 23--he realized that the enemy was going to be a superior \nforce.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  In the cold, damp Alamo, a blue norther, as we called it in those \ndays, had come. It was cold. The Alamo is near San Antonio, Texas. He \nwrote a letter asking for help. I have a copy of his letter on my wall \nin my office.\n  Here is what it said. To me, it is one of the most passionate letters \never written about freedom. It is dated February 24, 1836, in Bexar.\n\n       To the People of Texas and All Patriots and Fellow \n     Citizens. I am besieged by a thousand or more of the enemy \n     under Santa Anna. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily \n     and will no doubt increase to 3,000 or 4,000 in 4 or 5 days. \n     The enemy has demanded surrender at its discretion. \n     Otherwise, the fort will be put to the sword. I have answered \n     that demand with a cannon shot, and the flag still waves \n     proudly over the wall. I ask that you come to my aid with all \n     dispatch. If this call is neglected, I am determined to \n     sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who \n     never forgets what is due his own honor and his country--\n     victory or death. William Barret Travis, Commander.\n\n  That is a portion of the letter that he wrote that he sent out \nthroughout the area of Texas asking for help. The courier was Jim \nBonham, another South Carolinian that had come to Texas. He was William \nBarret Travis' boyhood friend. He would take this letter to different \nareas of Texas asking for help.\n  Only one group of folks answered that letter, and it was the men in \nGonzales, Texas, where this all started. They decided that they would \nleave Gonzales, which is near San Antonio, march to the Alamo and help \ndefend the Alamo. There were 32 of them.\n  When they arrived at the Alamo--some historians have said as they \nwalked into the Alamo--Travis said they came here to die. That brought \nthe total up to about 180 to 187.\n  If you will, Mr. Speaker, think about what those 32 men left behind. \nThis is a rough area of the world in Texas, just the weather. But the \npeople they left behind were their wives and their kids because the men \nhad gone to defend the Alamo.\n  After the Alamo fell and all of those men were killed, it was then \nleft up to those wives and children to make an existence in frontier \nTexas. They, in their own right, were amazing people that went ahead \nand forged an existence after Texas independence was declared.\n  So they are in the Alamo. On March 2, Texas declares independence. \nProbably the men in the Alamo never knew that Texas declared \nindependence.\n  Finally, on March 6, after 13 days, Santa Anna and his superior army \nstormed the Alamo. All 187 Texans were killed. If any surrendered, they \nwere executed.\n  The Mexican casualties, according to Santa Anna, were about 1,000 \ncasualties on the Mexican side. The Tejanos that were in the Alamo, all \n11, were also killed in the attack.\n  Travis made the comment in a later letter that was sent out of the \nAlamo before this March 6 attack that defeat will cost the enemy more \nthan victory. It turns out he was right.\n  Anyway, the Alamo fell. The flag that flew over the Alamo--I don't \nknow if you can see it, Mr. Speaker--was not the Lone Star flag. A lot \nof people think it was the Lone Star flag, which is our Texas State \nflag.\n  It is the flag of Mexico with the Mexican eagle removed from the \nflag. And the date of 1824 was placed on that flag. Most historians \nthink that was the flag that flew over the Alamo.\n  What is the significance of this? 1824 was the year that the \nconstitution was written for the Republic of Mexico. The defenders of \nthe Alamo wanted a constitutional government.\n  That is why they flew this flag, the 1824 constitution flag, to let \nthe world know that is why they were defending the concept of liberty, \nfreedom, and a constitutional government as opposed to a dictatorship.\n  But the Alamo fell. Santa Anna then started moving northeast through \nTexas. The Alamo is in San Antonio, Bexar County. It was just called \nBexar in those days.\n  Meanwhile, an individual by the name of Sam Houston, who was the \ncommander of all Texas armies, the few that there were, had been \npreparing an army while the men in the Alamo were at the Alamo.\n  He was assembling more volunteers--everybody was a volunteer--not \nonly from Texas, but other Tejanos. Other folks from other States \nformed an army to defeat or to take on Santa Anna.\n  Santa Anna had actually split his army into three different columns. \nHe was moving his three columns up through northeast Texas from Mexico.\n  Sam Houston and his army weren't ready; so, he didn't attack Santa \nAnna. In fact, he moved east. It is called the Runaway Scrape.\n  Not only was the army moving east away from Santa Anna's invaders, \nbut the people who lived there were leaving, too, because they were \nafraid of the Mexican Army.\n  They were afraid of Santa Anna, is who they were afraid of. So you \nhave the army, you have the settlers, and you have everybody moving \nnortheast, called the Runaway Scrape.\n  Sam Houston continued to move. He would not engage the Mexican Army. \nIn fact, some Texas folks--politicians--were irritated with Sam Houston \nbecause he wouldn't go to battle.\n  They kept moving east. They went through San Antonio, what is now\n\n[[Page H1110]]\n\nInterstate 10 between San Antonio and Houston. They went right through \nthat area, right through what is now Houston. The Mexican Army is \nfollowing him. Santa Anna is following him.\n  They go to a place called Harrisburg, which is just east of Houston, \non the marshes of the San Jacinto River, a marshy area, to a peninsula, \nand Sam Houston stopped on April 20, 1836.\n  Santa Anna continued to march and came on the peninsula. Both armies \nare on the peninsula. On April 21, here is what happened.\n  As you know, Mr. Speaker, most battles throughout history, no matter \nwhere they are, no matter who they are--the Greeks, the Romans, \neverybody--start at sunup or right before sunup. But that didn't happen \non April 21, 1836.\n  The Texans went to battle in the middle of the afternoon. They \nweren't going to wait until the next day. The soldiers were ready to do \nbattle. Sam Houston really had no choice but to lead them into battle. \nAnd so he did.\n  In the middle of the afternoon, just one column--there were only a \nhandful of them, more than at the Alamo--a single column, single file, \nwas led by an individual playing a flute, another person carrying the \nflag, and a third individual beating the drums.\n  The flutist didn't know any songs. So he played an old--we would call \nit a house of ill repute song, ``Come to the Bower.'' I don't know the \nlyrics of it, Mr. Speaker, but you can look it up.\n  He played on his flute ``Come to the Bower,'' which was the song they \nmarched into battle with, carrying a flag of Lady Liberty, a semi-\nclothed individual on the flag. Then you had the drummer.\n  Then you had all of these really scary-looking folks going into \nbattle, the Texas Army. Most of them didn't have any kind of uniforms. \nThey dressed like frontiersmen. They had a shotgun, a long rifle, a \ntomahawk, knives, well-armed individuals.\n\n  Also with them was Juan Seguin. Juan Seguin was a captain in the \nTexas Army. He was a Tejano. He led this cavalry of Tejanos to protect \none of the flanks when the Texans were marching down. He, like the rest \nof the Texas Army, did not have uniforms. They wore their normal \nclothes.\n  Sam Houston wanted to make sure that the Texans and the foot soldiers \ndidn't mix up the Mexican Army with the Tejanos that were in the \ncavalry.\n  So he had all of the Tejanos put a playing card in their sombrero. In \nthose days, apparently, the cards weren't small like they are today. \nThey were big.\n  They stuck this 4x6 card--or something like that--in their hats, \ntheir sombreros, so that everybody would know that they were on the \nside of liberty, not part of the Mexican Army, a unique part of Texas \nhistory.\n  So, in the middle of the day, what had happened was Santa Anna was \ntaking a nap. It was siesta time. Now, some say historically--modern \nrevisionists--that this isn't exactly true, but I believe it because I \nwant to believe it.\n  Santa Anna was preoccupied with an individual that was loyal to the \nRepublic of Texas, an individual that we fondly call the Yellow Rose of \nTexas now. Therefore, he wasn't prepared to go into battle when the \nTexans were coming down this small hill.\n  In any event, they were caught by surprise. This battle lasted 18 \nminutes. Eleven Texans were killed, 600 of the enemy were killed, and \nthe rest were captured. In fact, more were captured later than in the \nTexas Army.\n  The battle lasted 18 minutes. Military historians studied this battle \nbecause of its decisiveness. So General Houston led one battle. It was \nsuccessful. Santa Anna was captured.\n  Texas claims independence from Mexico--that was April 21, 1836--and \ngoes ahead and forms a government, forms a republic and, in September \nof the same year, elects a president and a vice president.\n  From October of 1835 to September of 1836 was the War of \nIndependence. Declaration of independence was on March 2. April 21 the \nbattle was successful. Texas is a free and independent country and \nremains so for 9 years.\n  The battle cry at the Battle of San Jacinto, as you have heard in \nhistory, was ``Remember the Alamo.'' ``Remember Goliad.'' That was \nanother place where Texans were massacred that fought Santa Anna's \narmy.\n  This is what Texas looked like when Texas declared independence from \nMexico. Maybe you can see it, Mr. Speaker. I don't know.\n  You see what is now Texas over here, but you see a lot of other land. \nYou see Oklahoma, part of Kansas, part of New Mexico, part of Colorado. \nIt even goes up to part of Idaho, almost to the Canadian border. All of \nthis area here, Texas claimed all of--that is the Republic of Texas--\nand claimed it for 9 years.\n  Texas periodically would try to join the United States as the 28th \nState. Two times Texas tried to join the Union, and two times Congress \nrejected Texas' approval into the Union.\n  On the third time, rather than have a treaty with Texas--because \nTexas was an independent country--a joint resolution was filed.\n  It passed the House of Representatives and it passed the Senate, \nbecause you didn't need two-thirds vote then. We still have those \ndiscussions today, don't we? A joint resolution.\n  By one vote, Texas was admitted to the Union in 1845 and, in 1846, \nactually came into the United States as the 28th State.\n  It was a republic once. A lot of people in Texas still think we are a \nrepublic, and we seem to act like it sometimes. But we have a unique \nhistory.\n  The history of Texas, why I like it so much, is because everybody \nwanted to live in Texas, wanted to come to Texas, of all races, of all \nnationalities, from all States.\n  They fought in a war against another nation, a dictator, for the same \nreason that the 13 colonies fought for independence against Great \nBritain: for freedom and for liberty.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  There is an independent streak that runs through all Texans. It is a \nstate of mind for Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 34 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are of an independent mind, of an \nindependent philosophy. March 2 is an important day for us because our \nancestors and people we don't even know about decided that it was worth \ntheir lives to fight against tyranny--against a totalitarian government \nrun by a dictator. They were volunteers. They were normal people who \njust had that flame of liberty in their souls, and they refused to have \nit taken away from them.\n  So we remember those folks who created Texas, who fought for \nindependence for Texas, those men at the Alamo--William Barret Travis, \nDavy Crockett, Jim Bowie, Jim Bonham, and 187 more individuals. The \nyoungest was 15, Tapley Holland from Ohio. The oldest was 68--who \nfought and died for that liberty.\n  When Texas became part of the United States, it had great depth \nbecause of the War of Independence. Part of the deal for Texas to be \nadmitted to the Union, even by one vote, was this land that I mentioned \nto you that was all sold to the Federal Government, to the Union, to \npay off the debts of the Republic of Texas. Thus, as we know now, Texas \nlooks like this. All of these other areas became other States that were \nlater admitted to the United States.\n  When there was the agreement between Texas and the United States to \njoin the Union, it was agreed--and it is still possible--that Texas may \ndivide now the State of Texas into five different States. Now, that is \nnot going to happen, because nobody is going to be able to agree on \nwhat should be called ``Texas''; but we can divide into five States, \nand that is the decision of the people who live in Texas.\n  One of the other provisions of the joint resolution was that Texas \nmay fly its flag, the Lone Star Flag--the flag of the one star, the \nLone Star, the Lone Republic--even with the American flag. When you go \nto Texas, you will see a lot of American flags, and you will see a lot \nof Texas flags, but most of the Texas flags are flying level with the \nAmerican flag. They can do that by law. Texas does that because of its \nagreement and admission into the Union.\n  Our country has a great history, Mr. Speaker, with 50 States, with \nall of our territories. Our history is unique. No place on Earth is \nlike the United\n\n[[Page H1111]]\n\nStates. It is because of our history, because of the diversity of the \npeoples and cultures in this country. The diversity of Texas, the \ndiversity of the United States is what gives it strength. It is not a \nweakness. It is a strength.\n  It is, I think, quite important that we as Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, who represent the 50 States of the United States, make \nsure that we talk about our history--how we are a unique Nation among \npeoples, how we have always been a unique Nation among peoples--and \npreserve what those folks at the Alamo fought for and what our folks \nfought for in the Colonies in wars since then, which are freedom and \nliberty. Those are not trite words. They are core words. The concept of \nliberty lives in every person ever born in history. Most people never \nsee it. Most people in the world today aren't free, but there are a \nfew, and those few--some of those few--are in what we call the United \nStates of America.\n  I thank all of those Texans back in Texas for honoring Texas \nIndependence Day, March 2, 1836. Especially, we should always honor \nthose people who lived in our history who gave their lives for the rest \nof us, because they were good folk.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1111-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1111-H1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Donovan).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, this week, we open Women's History \nMonth--an opportunity for us to celebrate the progress women have made \nand the amazing contributions that we are responsible for.\n  We have more women in Congress now than ever before. Women are now \nthe leading breadwinners or are the only breadwinners in 40 percent of \nhouseholds. We have more women who lead major companies and who are in \nprominent positions, like on the Supreme Court. Women today are more \nlikely to earn college degrees and to attend graduate school than are \ntheir male counterparts, and more women are entering traditionally \nmale-dominated fields. That progress has been incredibly swift. We are \ntalking about gains that have really only happened in the past 60 \nyears. Still, there are many, many milestones that women have yet to \nreach.\n  Even with the most women Congress has ever seen, this body, \nsupposedly elected to both represent and reflect the United States, is \nstill overwhelmingly 80 percent male, in fact. Women still make 78 \ncents for every dollar a man earns, particularly troubling when you \nthink about the 40 percent of women I just mentioned who are supporting \ntheir families. Black women make even less at 64 cents on the dollar \nwhile Latina women make just 66 cents on the dollar. If this week is \nany indicator, there are still great numbers of people, primarily men, \nwho feel we are incapable of making our own decisions about our health \ncare.\n  We have got a long way to go, Mr. Speaker. Part of the reason we \ncan't get all the way there is that we have not passed the Equal Rights \nAmendment. We have been avoiding ensuring protection for women in the \nConstitution for almost 100 years. Quite frankly, there is only so much \nwe can do until we offer that basic level of protection.\n  Mr. Speaker, the ERA was first drafted and introduced in the 1920s. \nIt finally passed in 1972 and was sent to the States for ratification, \nwhere it received 35 of the 38 approvals that it needed. Unfortunately, \ntime ran out. One of the reasons we have yet to solve some of the \ngreatest challenges facing our Nation's women is the lack of true \nprotection in the Constitution.\n  What better way to ensure the right to fair pay for women? What \nbetter way to ensure equal treatment in the workplace? What better way \nto protect against laws that inherently limit women? What better way to \nprotect all of the progress we have made and to ensure that women can \ncontinue to excel?\n  The Equal Rights Amendment would provide the foundation for \nlegislation that protects women from discrimination at every level--\nlegislation that is more necessary now than it has ever been with more \nand more women leading at home and in the workplace.\n  We will spend a lot of time in the coming weeks talking about what we \nneed to do for women--from the passage of the Fair Pay Act to ensuring \npaid leave for women and men. Yet there is one thing that we should \nhave done long ago, and my colleagues are here tonight, on the floor \nwith me, to call for action where we have failed before.\n  It is now my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. \nCarolyn B. Maloney), the primary sponsor of the ERA bill.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, \nand the Congressional Progressive Caucus for dedicating this time to \ntalk about passing the Equal Rights Amendment--a cause I have fought \nfor my entire time in Congress.\n  March is Women's History Month, and we have many accomplishments to \ncelebrate and to be proud of, but we must remain focused on the \ncontinued struggle for full equality for women. Without the ERA, this \ngoal will not be fully realized, and half of Americans will not realize \ntheir full potential. All of us, men and women, stand to benefit from \ntrue gender equality.\n  Consider, for instance, some laws that are being proposed across the \nNation that have disparate negative impacts on women:\n  In Illinois, a bill sponsored by men is pending that would deny a \nbirth certificate to a newborn of a single mother unless a father is \nlisted on the birth certificate. This would make it impossible for a \nsingle mother to enroll her child in a public school, for her child to \nobtain a driver's license, or for her to collect child support and \nother benefits for the child. The law is silent on single fathers.\n  In Kentucky, the State senate has passed a bill sponsored by a man \nthat would force all women who are seeking to terminate pregnancies to \nundergo ultrasounds, whether they want to or not, and to have doctors \ndescribe the images to them. While we cannot know for sure how an ERA \nwould affect the outcome of future Supreme Court cases, we have seen \nthat its absence leaves women vulnerable to discrimination without \ntheir having legal recourse.\n  These legislative efforts to roll back hard-won progress and to \ncurtail rights are directed squarely at women. You will not find \nequivalent examples of bills that roll back or constrain the rights of \nmen--and men only. Unfortunately, that noble and empowering declaration \nin our founding document that ``all men are created equal'' left some \nof us out. In fact, it leaves about half the population of America out.\n  Many people are actually surprised when they realize that the United \nStates Constitution does not mention women. That omission has, \nunfortunately, become a glaring problem when it comes to achieving full \nequality--and not just a problem for women but for families as well--\nfor everyone. For instance, when women make less than men just because \nthey are women, it is an issue that affects their entire families.\n  We saw that in the case of Lilly Ledbetter. The Supreme Court found \nthat she had been paid less for doing the very same job as her male \ncounterparts. This not only meant that, for years, she made less money \nthan her male colleagues in order to support her family and to provide \nfor her children throughout her working life, but it meant that she \nwould also spend her entire retirement being less financially secure.\n  Such unfair and unequal treatment should certainly be prohibited \nunder our Constitution. Yet the late Supreme\n\n[[Page H1112]]\n\nCourt Justice Antonin Scalia famously told an interviewer for the \nCalifornia Lawyer Magazine that he believed that the Constitution does \nnot outlaw this kind of discrimination because, in his view, the 14th \nAmendment does not apply to women.\n  The 14th Amendment reads that no State shall ``deny to any person . . \n. the equal protection of the laws.''\n  To most people, that would seem to be pretty simple and \nstraightforward; but Justice Scalia argued that the word ``person'' \nshould not apply to women. In his view, when it was written, it was \nonly meant to apply to the recently emancipated slaves.\n  The problem here is that there is ambiguity about whether or not \ngender discrimination is explicitly prohibited by the Constitution. The \nonly solution to this challenge is to plainly include women in the \nConstitution. So between the State and congressional legislators who \nbelieve it is permissible to roll back hard-won rights and to pass \nlegislation that unfairly and unequally burdens women--and the \nidiosyncratic views of Supreme Court Justices who declare women are not \npeople--it is essential to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in a brief \namendment that simply reads:\n  ``Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place \nsubject to its jurisdiction. Equality of rights under the law shall not \nbe denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account \nof sex.''\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Let's put women in the Constitution at long last.\n  Research shows that 75 to 90 percent of Americans mistakenly believe \nthat the ERA has already passed and that men and women are equal under \nthe law. In 2012, a poll asked: Do you think the Constitution should \nguarantee equal rights for men and women? And 91 percent said yes, \nincluding 86 percent of Republicans.\n  The way things stand now, the Supreme Court has ruled that the \nConstitution provides strict guidelines against discrimination based on \nrace and national origin, but it is silent on issues of gender \ndiscrimination.\n  When it comes to gender discrimination, the Court has applied a \nlesser standard that makes it easier to get away with discriminating \nagainst women. Plain old common sense and your basic sense of fairness \nshould tell you that the same strict scrutiny, protection against \ndiscrimination based on race and national origin, should also apply to \ndiscrimination based on sex.\n  So the ERA would establish unequivocally, once and for all, that \nwomen are entitled to equal treatment under the law. Equal treatment \nmeans equal treatment. Equal means equal for all, women included. The \nERA would, once and for all, provide clear, constitutional guidance on \ngender equity issues. The ERA would lend the force of the Constitution \nto existing prohibitions against sex discrimination in the workplace or \nschools. The ERA would stop bias in wages, benefits, hiring practices, \nand other conditions of employment.\n  If America wants to be a world leader in the promotion of human \nrights, it needs to lead by example on women's rights. Sadly, in this \narea, America is exceptional only in a bad way.\n  The U.S. stands out as one of the few nations that does not even \naddress gender equality in its Constitution. As the world's leading \ndemocracy, we are falling behind on women's equality. At a time when we \nseek to champion democracy around the world, we must guarantee equality \nhere at home. It is time for the United States to secure equal rights \nfor women across our Nation by ratifying the ERA.\n  Progress can all too easily be rolled back. Laws can be repealed, and \njudicial attitudes can shift, turning women into second class citizens. \nIt seems like I spend a majority of my time here in Congress just \nfighting to hold on to what we already have, trying to keep it from \nbeing rolled back. An ERA would protect the progress made on women's \nrights from any shifting political trends.\n  Women are still not receiving equal pay for equal work. According to \nthe U.S. Census Bureau, women still earn 78 cents for every dollar \nearned by a man, and this has contributed to older women being the \nlargest segment of poverty in our great Nation. Because when you are \npaid less, your pension is less, your 401(k) is less, your Social \nSecurity is less, and that happens to have profound effects on women.\n  Just this past week there was an article in The Wall Street Journal \nthat talked about the largest group of people that are growing in the \nworkforce are older women, and this is because they cannot afford to \nretire. They have to continue working because of the discrimination in \npay and because of having taken times when they weren't in the \nworkforce to take care of a sick parent or to nurse and raise a child.\n  Sex and pregnancy discrimination persists in the workforce. \nGovernmental programs, such as Social Security, still unequally provide \nbenefits to men and women.\n  An ERA would be a woman's best defense against harmful practices that \npunish her simply because she is a woman. We cannot keep fighting \ndiscrimination against women one battle at a time, constantly playing \ndefense. Passing the ERA will put women on equal footing in the legal \nsystem of all 50 States, particularly in areas where women have \nhistorically been treated as second class citizens.\n  We have 186 bipartisan cosponsors of H.J. Res. 52 in the House, which \nI proudly introduced with Representative Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming--\njust 32 shy of a majority. It reflects the strength of the belief that \nwomen should be included in the Constitution and guaranteed equal \ntreatment under the law.\n  It is time to stop making excuses. Women and like-minded men have to \ndemand that Congress and State governments get this done. Equal means \nequal.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank her from the bottom \nof my heart for really organizing this important Special Order.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for being \nwith us this evening.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Graham).\n  Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank Congresswoman Watson \nColeman for holding this special session and bringing attention to the \nEqual Rights Amendment.\n  When I was born in 1963, we lived in a different world. It was legal \nto openly discriminate against hiring women; it was legal to \ndiscriminate against women in lending and credit; it was legal to pay \nwomen substantially less than men; and it was legal to fire a woman \njust for becoming pregnant.\n  Fortunately, when I was born, things were beginning to change. Women \nwere fighting for and gaining greater equality.\n  Today, women are better protected from those forms of discrimination. \nWe have made great strides, but we haven't yet been able to recognize \nour equality in the Constitution. There is nothing more sacred, nothing \nmore important to America than our Constitution.\n  I support the Equal Rights Amendment because I grew up in a changing \nworld, but I want my daughter and the next generation to grow up in a \nchanged world. I want my daughter to live in a country where her and \nevery woman's equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or \nabridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\n  To illustrate why I believe we should and still can ratify the Equal \nRights Amendment, I want to specifically speak about the history of the \nERA in my home State of Florida.\n  Our House of Representatives voted for ratification of the ERA three \nseparate times--in 1972, 1975, and 1979--but our Senate remained more \ndivided on the issue.\n  Bill Cotterell, a columnist for the Tallahassee Democrat, recently \nopined:\n\n       It was still a very different world, where a Member of the \n     legislature walked around with a toy pig under his arm, \n     proudly proclaiming himself a male chauvinist.\n\n  It was a different world, one still changing, but I am proud to say \nthere were men who stood up for the women of our State in the State \nsenate. One of them was my father, Bob Graham, who bucked his own \nDemocratic Party leadership to support the ERA, a move that helped earn \nhim the title of a doghouse Democrat.\n  After repeated failures in the Senate, some thought the ERA was dead, \nbut it resurfaced in Florida in 1982. That summer, just a few weeks \nremaining before\n\n[[Page H1113]]\n\nthe ratification deadline, more than 10,000 men and women marched on \nour State capitol in support of the amendment.\n  Hearing their call and supporting their cause, my father, who had \nmoved out of the doghouse into the Governor's mansion, called our \nlegislature into special session. For the fourth time, the House voted \nin favor of the amendment, but unfortunately the senate blocked \nratification. That was 34 years ago.\n\n  And today I believe our State is better than that. I believe, given \nanother chance to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, Democrats and \nRepublicans in Florida could be united to support equality for women.\n  I am proud to have grown up in a changing world, but it is time for \nour daughters and the next generation of women to grow up in a changed \nworld. It is time to recognize their equality in our Constitution.\n  I thank the Congresswoman for bringing attention to this issue and \nfor all that you do on behalf of women.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier), the sponsor of legislation that would \nretroactively lift the deadline for the ratification of the ERA.\n  Ms. SPEIER. I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for bringing us \ntogether tonight to talk about one of the most fundamental issues \nfacing women in this country. I would hope that we would do these \nSpecial Orders on a monthly basis or maybe even more frequently to kind \nof beat the drum about how important it is for us to address this \nissue.\n  Today we see everything we need to see to convince us of the need to \nratify the Equal Rights Amendment and put women's equality into the \nConstitution. We have a pay gap that has not closed where women are \nmaking 79 cents for every dollar that men make. For African American \nwomen that is 63 cents, and for Latina women it is 54 cents for every \ndollar earned by a man.\n  In fact, women in this country have to work until April 15 of the \nfollowing year--tax day, ironically--to make as much money as their \nmale counterparts. We can't afford that. We can't afford that in a \ncountry that speaks of equality.\n  Meanwhile, we have a Congress and State legislators who are focused \nlike a laser beam on attacking women's health. We just spent 5 hours \ntoday in a hearing of a special committee designed specifically to \nattack women's health. Since the start of 2016--merely 2 months ago, \nand for the last 2 months--there have been more than 201 anti-choice \nbills introduced in State legislatures across this country, efforts to \nundermine a woman's right to choose.\n  We have a Supreme Court seat at stake and issues of gender equality \nhanging in the balance. It is important to quote what the late Justice \nScalia said about discrimination against women. He was a constitutional \nexpert, an originalist, and he said the following:\n  ``Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the \nbasis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.''\n  When I read that quotation by Justice Scalia--may he rest in peace--I \nhad shivers up and down my spine because it was so direct. It was so \nclear. It makes the point that the Constitution of this country does \nnot prohibit discrimination based on sex, even though the vast majority \nof Americans believe it is already in the Constitution.\n  Ninety-six percent of U.S. adults believe that male and female \ncitizens should have equal rights, and 72 percent mistakenly believe it \nis already in the Constitution. As Justice Scalia pointed out, it is \nnot.\n  So what does that mean?\n  That means that every single woman in this country can be subject to \ndiscrimination and not have a legal foot to stand on.\n  Probably one of the most obvious cases is the case of Peggy Young. \nPeggy Young worked for United Parcel Service for 10 years. She was a \ngood worker, a hard worker. And then, lo and behold, she gets pregnant. \nShe gets pregnant. She goes to her supervisor and she says: I am \npregnant.\n  He says: Okay. Go to your doctor and find out what accommodations you \nwill require.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  She went to her doctor, and her doctor said: Well, you can do \nanything except you can't lift more than 10 pounds.\n  So she came back to her supervisor and said: I can do anything except \nI can't lift more than 10 pounds.\n  He said: Oh, my gosh, that is a terrible liability.\n  For all intents and purposes, she was fired from her job. She was \ntold she will have to take a leave of absence, that she will not be \npaid, and that she would not be eligible for health benefits. So her \nentire pregnancy she had no prenatal care and no health insurance.\n  Now, what makes this story particularly insidious is that during that \nsame timeframe, men at the United Parcel Service who had heart disease, \nheart attacks, had had a DUI, or had diabetes were asked to go to their \ndoctors and find out what accommodations they should propose. Some of \nthem came back with the exact same accommodation: that they could not \nlift more than 10 pounds.\n  What did United Parcel Service do? United Parcel Service accommodated \nthem. That is profound discrimination.\n  But guess what. Peggy Young filed a lawsuit. It went all the way to \nthe Supreme Court, and it got remanded. It got remanded in part because \nnot only did she have to prove that there was discrimination, which \nclearly there was; she had to prove that it was intentional \ndiscrimination by United Parcel Service, and she couldn't prove that.\n  Now, in all the other forms of discrimination, whether it is based on \nrace or religion, you only have to prove that there was discrimination, \nnot that there was intentional acts of discrimination. So that is why \nit is so important that we get this in the Constitution.\n  We have a new generation of women who are more independent, more able \nto support themselves, and more politically empowered than ever. I just \nread an article that shows single women are now our most potent \npolitical force in this country. Single women--whether they are single \nnever been married, single divorced, single separated, single--are our \nmost potent electoral force. They deserve the right to full legal \nequality under our Constitution. How can this body, of all bodies, not \nrecognize the importance of equality among men and women?\n  So I have introduced H.J. Res. 51. It is very simple.\n  The ERA was introduced first in 1923 by Alice Paul, and introduced \nevery Congress since then, and then it was introduced and actually \npassed the House and passed the Senate. It then had to be ratified by \nthree-quarters of the States. Unfortunately, when that was drafted, in \nthe preamble they put a timeline. It was ratified by 35 States, but not \n38. So it came back to Congress, and they amended the preamble and \nextended the length of time in which the ERA could be passed by other \nStates. And then nothing happened.\n  What this resolution does--and it would only require a majority of \nthe Members of this body to pass it--is basically use the precedent and \ntake the preamble and the time deadline and just strike it.\n  There is no need for a deadline in a constitutional amendment. Most \nconstitutional amendments have not been subject to a deadline. There is \nprecedent that they were willing to change it as it relates to the ERA, \nand I say let's make it yet another precedent and just take the \ntimeline out of it. That would give us the opportunity to get three \nmore States to pass the ERA, to ratify it.\n  We already know in Virginia it has been passed by the senate, and we \nare waiting for action in the house. As my good friend from Florida \nsaid, in Florida they could pass it, conceivably, now.\n  So why not do what is fundamentally right? Why not do what is so \nsimple? Twenty-four simple words, that is all the ERA is. It is on one \npage, and it is simply: ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be \ndenied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of \nsex.''\n  The time has come, Members, and I applaud my good colleague from New \nJersey for bringing us together. We\n\n[[Page H1114]]\n\nshould do it again. I enjoy working with you on any number of issues.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman, \nand I want to say tonight that we definitely will be coming back here \nagain on a Special Order hour and addressing this issue. We will just \ncontinue to do it until we can see some movement. I thank you for that.\n  Mr. Speaker, the women tonight, the Members of the House, have spoken \nso eloquently and so compellingly on this issue and the urgency with \nwhich we need to take this issue up. But the women of this Nation, they \nare very strong and intelligent and capable citizens as well.\n  As our laws in our society have given women a turn at bat, we have \nstepped up to the plate, and we have proven time and again that we can \ndo what men do just as well as they do it, and often even better.\n  Although expectations and stereotypes are changing, women are still \nlacking in equal footing. Last year the United States fell to 28th \nplace in the annual world equality rankings, behind even Rwanda and the \nPhilippines. We are one of only a few nations that fails to \nspecifically affirm the legal equality of men and women in our \ngoverning documents, a failure we would hold any other nation \naccountable for.\n  The ERA is the biggest and most basic step we can take to ensure \nequality for every woman. We need it, and we need it now. So let us \nwork together to give women equal rights once and for all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/house-section/article/H1114-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BILLS PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Karen L.
