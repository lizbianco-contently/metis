Mr. Speaker, our charge in Congress is to be very \ncareful and frugal and honest with the people's money that they send \nvia their hard-earned tax dollars.\n  Today we have an opportunity to make good on part of that with our \ncommitment to making the government work better for the people it \nserves, control spending, and work at finally getting down the national \ndebt.\n  The VA medical facility construction process is broken and highly in \nneed of major reform. For example, in Colorado, the VA spent at least \ntriple, probably quadruple, even quintuple, what it was expected to \nspend on the construction of a replacement hospital due to \nmismanagement and lack of accountability.\n  The GAO found in 2013 that the VA's four largest medical construction \nprojects were experiencing significant delays and massive cost \nincreases. In my district, the VA plans to build two replacement \nclinics, in Redding and in Chico, which the VA says will take 5 years.\n  In order to streamline and improve the VA's medical facility \nconstruction process, the House will vote on H.R. 3106 today, which is \nsponsored by Chairman Jeff Miller of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  The bill includes commonsense reforms that will require the VA to use \nindustry standards for medical facility construction projects and \nincrease congressional oversight.\n  I am proud to support this bill and to continue to work to be \naccountable to the American people, especially our veterans, who need \nand deserve clear access, present access, and timely access to the \nhealth care they deserve.\n\n[[Page H598]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H598-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     FLINT, MICHIGAN, WATER CRISIS\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the families and the children exposed to \nhigh levels of lead in my hometown of Flint deserve action by the \npeople who did this to them.\n  The State of Michigan--Governor Snyder's administration--created this \npublic health emergency through their own inaction and by decisions \nthat their appointed emergency manager made in the city of Flint, which \nhas led to this crisis. They need to act in a manner equal to the \ngravity of this terrible situation.\n  The Federal Government can help as well. The President has already \ndeclared a state of emergency, but Congress can act, too. I have \nlegislation that I introduced last week that is a comprehensive set of \nsolutions that not only deals with the need to replace those lead \nservice lines that are leaching lead into the water system in \nhouseholds, but also provides the kind of support for children and \nfamilies to get through this crisis and give them, as individuals, and \nmy community, as a community, a chance on a future.\n  Resources are needed, not just a get well card, not just an apology, \nbut we need financial resources. The State needs to step up. I am \nasking this Congress to do so as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H598-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2016.\n     Hon.

DOC. NO. 114-86)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on \nAppropriations and ordered to be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States: \n  As I look back on the past seven years, I am inspired by America's \nprogress--and I am more determined than ever to keep our country moving \nforward. When I took office, our Nation was in the midst of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. The economy was shedding 800,000 \njobs a month. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse and our \nmanufacturing sector was in decline. Many families were struggling to \npay their bills and make ends meet. Millions more saw their savings \nevaporate, even as retirement neared.\n  But thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, we \nrescued our economy from the depths of the recession, revitalized our \nauto industry, and laid down new rules to safeguard our economy from \nrecklessness on Wall Street. We made the largest investment in clean \nenergy in our history, and made health care reform a reality. And \ntoday, our economy is the strongest, most durable on Earth.\n  Our businesses have created more than 14 million jobs over 70 months, \nthe longest streak of job growth on record. We have cut our \nunemployment rate in half. Our manufacturing sector has added nearly \n900,000 jobs in the last six years--and our auto industry just had its \nbest year of sales ever. We are less reliant on foreign oil than at any \npoint in the previous four decades. Nearly 18 million people have \ngained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), cutting the \nuninsured rate to a record low. Our children are graduating from high \nschool at the highest rate ever. And we managed to accomplish all of \nthis while dramatically cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters \nand setting our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path. Together, we \nhave brought America back.\n  Yet while it is important to take stock of our progress, this Budget \nis not about looking back at the road we have traveled. It is about \nlooking forward. It is about making sure our economy works for \neverybody, not just those at the top. It is about choosing investments \nthat not only make us stronger today, but also reflect the kind of \ncountry we aspire to be--the kind of country we want to pass on to our \nchildren and grandchildren. It is about answering the big questions \nthat will define America and the world in the 21st Century.\n  My Budget makes critical investments while adhering to the bipartisan \nbudget agreement I signed into law last fall, and it lifts \nsequestration in future years so that we continue to invest in our \neconomic future and our national security. It also drives down deficits \nand maintains our fiscal progress through smart savings from health \ncare, immigration, and tax reforms. And, it focuses on meeting our \ngreatest challenges not only for the year ahead, but for decades to \ncome.\n  First, by accelerating the pace of American innovation, we can create \njobs and build the economy of the future while tackling our greatest \nchallenges, including addressing climate change and finding new \ntreatments--and cures--for devastating diseases.\n  The challenge of climate change will define the contours of this \ncentury more dramatically than any other. Last year was the hottest on \nrecord, surpassing the record set just a year before. Climate change is \nalready causing damage, including longer, more severe droughts and \ndangerous floods, disruptions to our food and water supply, and threats \nto our health, our economy, and our security.\n  We have made great strides to foster a robust clean energy industry \nand move our economy away from energy sources that fuel climate change. \nIn communities across the Nation, wind power is now cheaper than \ndirtier, conventional power, and solar power is saving Americans tens \nof millions of dollars a year on their energy bills. The solar industry \nemploys more workers than the coal industry--in jobs that pay better \nthan average.\n  Despite these advances, we can and must do more. Rather than \nshrinking from the challenge, America must foster the spirit of \ninnovation to create jobs, build a climate-smart economy of the future, \nand protect the only planet we have. To speed our transition to an \naffordable, reliable, clean energy system, my Budget funds Mission \nInnovation, our landmark commitment to double clean energy research and \ndevelopment funding. It also calls for a 21st Century Clean \nTransportation initiative that would help to put hundreds of thousands \nof Americans to work modernizing our infrastructure to ease congestion \nand make it easier for businesses to bring goods to market through new \ntechnologies such as autonomous vehicles and high-speed rail, funded \nthrough a fee paid by oil companies. It proposes to modernize our \nbusiness tax system to promote innovation and job creation. It invests \nin strategies to make our communities more resilient to floods, \nwildfires, and other effects of climate change. And, it protects and \nmodernizes our water supply and preserves our natural landscapes. These \ninvestments, coupled with those\n\n[[Page H599]]\n\nin other cutting-edge technology sectors ranging from manufacturing to \nspace exploration, will drive new jobs, new industries, and a new \nunderstanding of the world around us.\n  Just as a commitment to innovation can accelerate our efforts to \nprotect our planet and create a sustainable economy, it can also drive \ncritical medical breakthroughs. The Budget supports a new ``moonshot'' \nto finally cure cancer, an effort that will be led by the Vice \nPresident and will channel resources, technology, and our collective \nknowledge to save lives and end this deadly disease. It also supports \nthe Precision Medicine Initiative to accelerate the development of \ncustomized treatments that take into account a patient's genes, \nenvironment, and lifestyle, as well as the BRAIN Initiative, which will \ndramatically increase our understanding of how the brain works.\n  Second, we must work to deliver a fair shot at opportunity for all, \nboth because this reflects American values and because, in the 21st \nCentury global economy, our competitiveness depends on tapping the full \npotential of every American. Even as we have rebounded from the worst \neconomic crisis of our lifetimes, too many families struggle to reach \nthe middle class and stay there, and too many kids face obstacles on \nthe path to success.\n  Real opportunity begins with education. My Budget supports the \nambitious goal that all children should have access to high-quality \npreschool, including kids from low-income families who too often enter \nkindergarten already behind. It also supports States and cities as they \nimplement a new education law that will place all students on a path to \ngraduate prepared for college and successful careers. The bipartisan \nEvery Student Succeeds Act sets high standards for our schools and \nstudents, ensures that States are held accountable for the success of \nall students, including those in the lowest performing schools, spurs \ninnovation in education, helps schools recruit and support great \nteachers, and encourages States to reduce unnecessary testing. And \nbecause jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are \nprojected to grow faster than other jobs in the years ahead, the Budget \nmakes critical investments in math and science. Through a new Computer \nScience for All initiative, the Budget will expand the teaching and \nlearning of these important concepts across America's schools, better \npreparing our Nation's students for today's innovation economy.\n\n  Higher education is the clearest path to the middle class. By 2020, \ntwo-thirds of jobs will require some education beyond high school. For \nour students and for our economy, we must make a quality college \neducation affordable for every American. To support that goal, the \nBudget strengthens Pell Grants to help families pay for college by \nincreasing the scholarships available to students who take enough \ncourses to stay on track for on-time graduation, allowing students \nmaking progress toward their degrees to get support for summer classes, \nand providing scholarships to help incarcerated Americans turn their \nlives around, get jobs, and support their families. It also offers two \nyears of free community college to every responsible student and \nstrengthens the American Opportunity Tax Credit.\n  In addition to preparing students for careers, we must help workers \ngain the skills they need to fill jobs in growing industries. My Budget \nbuilds on the progress we have made to improve the Nation's job \ntraining programs through implementation of the bipartisan Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act. It funds innovative strategies to train \nmore workers and young people for 21st Century jobs. And it doubles \ndown on apprenticeships--a proven pathway to the middle class--and \nsupports a robust set of protections for the health, safety, wages, \nworking conditions, and retirement security of working Americans.\n  Even as we invest in better skills and education for our workforce, \nwe must respond to dramatic changes in our economy and our workforce: \nmore automation; increased global competition; corporations less rooted \nin their communities; frequent job changes throughout a worker's \ncareer; and a growing gap between the wealthiest and everyone else. \nThese trends squeeze workers, even when they have jobs, even when the \neconomy is growing. They make it harder to start a career, a family, a \nbusiness, or retirement.\n  To address these changes and give Americans more economic security, \nwe need to update several key benefit structures to make sure that \nworkers can balance work and family, save for retirement, and get back \non their feet if they lose a job. The Budget supports these priorities \nby funding high-quality child care, encouraging State paid leave \npolicies, extending employer-based retirement plans to part-time \nworkers, putting us on a path to more portable benefit models, and \nproviding a new tax credit for two-earner families. It also modernizes \nthe unemployment insurance system, so that more unemployed workers \nreceive the unemployment benefits they need and an opportunity to \nretrain for their next job. And, if that new job does not pay as much \ninitially, it offers a system of wage insurance to encourage workers to \nrejoin the workforce and help them pay their bills. The Budget includes \ntax cuts for middle-class and working families that will make paychecks \ngo further in meeting the costs of child care, education, and saving \nfor retirement. It builds upon the demonstrated success of the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit by expanding it for workers without children and non-\ncustodial parents.\n  Providing opportunity to all Americans means tackling poverty. Too \nmany Americans live in communities with under-performing schools and \nfew jobs. We know from groundbreaking new research that growing up in \nthese communities can put lifelong limits on a child's opportunities. \nOver the past few years, we have made progress in supporting families \nthat were falling behind. For example, working family tax credits keep \nmore than 9 million people--including 5 million children--out of \npoverty each year, and the ACA provides access to quality, affordable \nhealth care to millions. Nevertheless, we need to do more to ensure \nthat a child's zip code does not determine his or her destiny. \nImproving the opportunity and economic security of poor children and \nfamilies is both a moral and an economic imperative.\n  The Budget funds innovative strategies to support this goal, \nincluding helping families move to safer neighborhoods with better \nschools and more jobs, revitalizing distressed communities to create \nmore neighborhoods of opportunity, preventing families experiencing a \nfinancial crisis from becoming homeless, and ensuring that children \nhave enough to eat when school is out for the summer. It also supports \nefforts to break the cycle of poverty and incarceration through \ncriminal justice reform.\n  Finally, as we work to build a brighter future at home, we must also \nstrengthen our national security and global leadership. The United \nStates of America is the most powerful nation on Earth, blessed with \nthe finest fighting force in the history of the world.\n  Still, this is a dangerous time. We face many threats, including the \nthreat of terrorist attacks and violent extremism in many forms. My \nhighest priority is keeping the American people safe and going after \nterrorist networks. That is why my Budget increases support for our \ncomprehensive strategy to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant (ISIL), in partnership with more than 60 other countries, by \neliminating its leadership, cutting off its financing, disrupting its \nplots, stopping the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamping out its \nvicious ideology. If the Congress is serious about winning this war and \nwants to send a message to the troops and the world, it should \nspecifically authorize the use of military force against ISIL.\n  The Budget also sustains and builds the strength of our unmatched \nmilitary forces, making the investments and reforms that will maintain \nour Nation's superiority and ensure our advantage over any potential \nadversary. It also makes investments to ensure that our men and women \nin uniform, who sacrifice so much to defend our Nation and keep us \nsafe, get the support they have earned to succeed and thrive when they \nreturn home.\n  Cybersecurity is one of our most important national security \nchallenges. As our economy becomes increasingly digital, more sensitive \ninformation is vulnerable to malicious cyber activity. This challenge \nrequires bold, aggressive action. My Budget significantly\n\n[[Page H600]]\n\nincreases our investment in cybersecurity through a Cybersecurity \nNational Action Plan. This Plan includes retiring outdated Federal \ninformation technology (IT) systems that were designed in a different \nage and increasingly are vulnerable to attack, reforming the way that \nthe Federal Government manages and responds to cyber threats, and \nrecruiting the best cyber talent. It will also help strengthen \ncybersecurity in the private sector and the digital ecosystem as a \nwhole, enhancing cyber education and making sure companies and \nconsumers have the tools they need to protect themselves. But many of \nour challenges in cybersecurity require bold, long-term commitments to \nchange the way we operate in an increasingly digital world. That is \nwhy, to complement these steps, I am also creating a commission of \nexperts to make recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity awareness \nand protections inside and outside of Government, protecting privacy, \nand empowering Americans to take better control of their digital \nsecurity.\n  To ensure security at home, we must also demonstrate leadership \naround the world. Strong leadership means not only a wise application \nof military power, but also rallying other nations behind causes that \nare right. It means viewing our diplomacy and development efforts \naround the world as an essential instrument of our national security \nstrategy, and mobilizing the private sector and other donors alongside \nour foreign assistance to help achieve our global development and \nclimate priorities. The Budget supports this vision with funding for \neffective global health programs to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other \nillnesses; assistance for displaced persons and refugees, including \nfrom Syria; and expanding educational opportunities for girls, among \nmany other critical development initiatives.\n  As we make these investments to meet our greatest challenges, we are \nalso working to build a 21st Century Government that delivers for the \nAmerican people. The Budget supports efforts to make the Federal \nGovernment more efficient and effective, through smarter IT delivery \nand procurement, improving digital services, eliminating outdated \nregulations, and recruiting and retaining the best talent. It also \ninvests in a new approach to working in local communities, one that \ndisrupts an outdated, top-down approach, and makes our efforts more \nresponsive to the ideas and concerns of local citizens. The Budget \nsupports the use of data and evidence to drive policymaking, so the \nFederal Government can do more of what works and stop doing what does \nnot.\n  The Budget is a roadmap to a future that embodies America's values \nand aspirations: a future of opportunity and security for all of our \nfamilies; a rising standard of living; and a sustainable, peaceful \nplanet for our kids. This future is within our reach. But just as it \ntook the collective efforts of the American people to rise from the \nrecession and rebuild an even stronger economy, so will it take all of \nus working together to meet the challenges that lie ahead.\n  It will not be easy. But I have never been more optimistic about \nAmerica's future than I am today. Over the past seven years, I have \nseen the strength, resilience, and commitment of the American people. I \nknow that when we are united in the face of challenges, our Nation \nemerges stronger and better than before. I know that when we work \ntogether, there are no limits to what we can achieve. Together, we will \nmove forward to innovate, to expand opportunity and security, and to \nmake our Nation safer and stronger than ever before.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 9, 2016. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H600-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTAL OF FINAL \n                   REPORT BY COMMISSION ON CARE.\n\n       Section 202(b)(3)(B) of the Veterans Access, Choice, and \n     Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146; 128 Stat. \n     1773) is amended by striking ``Not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the initial meeting of the Commission'' and \n     inserting ``Not later than June 30, 2016''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4437, a bill that I am honored \nto sponsor, to extend the deadline for the submittal of the final \nreport that is required by the Commission on Care.\n  The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, which Congress \npassed in 2014 in response to the Department of Veterans Affairs' \ncrisis that saw far too many veterans waiting too long for the care \nthat they needed, required the establishment of a Commission on Care to \nexamine veteran access to care and recommend how to best organize the \nVA healthcare system over the next 20 years.\n  The law required the Commission to develop a final report 180 days \nafter their first meeting, or by February 20, 2016.\n  However, the Commission has requested that Congress extend the \nreporting deadline to June in order to provide the commissioners more \ntime to develop their findings and recommendations. As such, H.R. 4437 \nwould extend the Commission's final reporting deadline to June 30 of \nthis year.\n  The Commission's work is vitally important to determining the future \nof the VA healthcare system, and I am proud to sponsor this bill to \nallow the commissioners more time to carry out their mission on behalf \nof our Nation's veterans.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 4437, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4437, of which I am an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  When the Congress passed and the President signed into law the \nVeterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, we included a \nsection requiring an independent assessment of the hospital care, \nmedical services, and other health care furnished in medical facilities \nof the VA. We also established a Commission on Care to examine the \naccess of veterans to health care from the\n\n[[Page H601]]\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and strategically examine how best to \norganize the Veterans Health Administration, local health care \nresources, and deliver health care to veterans over the next 20 years.\n  The Commission has contacted us to explain that they will not be able \nto meet the statutory deadline of presenting their report to us in \ntime, and would like an extension until June of 2016.\n  I feel this is a very important report, and I am willing to extend \nthe authorization for the Commission on Care in order to receive this \ninformation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support \nH.R. 4437.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4437.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H601-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H601-H603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONSTRUCTION REFORM ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

This bill would strengthen the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' major construction program by making a \nnumber of needed improvements to VA's construction management \nprocesses.\n  As the owner and operator of one of the Federal Government's largest \nreal property portfolios, VA manages a complex and costly major medical \nfacility construction program.\n  In recent years, that program has been fraught with failures and \nmismanagement that has led to millions of dollars of cost increases and \nyears of schedule delays on all of VA's major medical facility \nconstruction projects.\n  The most glaring example of these failings can be seen in the \nconstruction of the replacement VA medical center in Denver, Colorado.\n  The discussion surrounding that facility--if my colleagues will \nrecall--began more than 16 years ago, in 1999. Construction is now \nexpected to conclude in 2018. Upon completion, that project will be \nmore than $1 billion over budget and many, many years behind schedule. \nThat is assuming, of course, that the project does not experience any \nfurther delays.\n  To prevent any further construction calamities like the ongoing one \nin Denver, this bill would require VA to use industry standards, \nstandard designs, and best practices for all medical facility \nconstruction projects; to complete a master plan for each VA medical \nfacility; and to provide regular reports on super construction \nprojects.\n  To further strengthen oversight of VA's construction projects, the \nbill would also create an assistant inspector general for construction \nwithin the VA Office of Inspector General.\n  These are commonsense reforms that will lead, ultimately, to better \nfacilities for our veterans and better use of our taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank the chairman for his fair and even leadership on this \ncommittee. While we don't agree on all issues, I feel he has made an \neffort to allow all voices to be heard, and for that I want to thank \nhim. I thank the chairman for bringing this important legislation to \nour attention.\n  As we have seen by recent events, the VA has been challenged with \nmajor construction projects. Before they undertook the most recent \nmedical center construction projects, it had been at least 15 years \nsince a new medical center had been built.\n  This lack of experience showed and continues to show today. Not one \nof the major hospitals is on its original timeline. However, the VA has \ndemonstrated they are able to do small, less complicated projects on \ntime and under budget.\n  The bill also references ``a non-department Federal entity to provide \nfull project management services for the super construction project, \nincluding management over the project design, acquisition, \nconstruction, and contract changes.''\n  We all know from experience that there is only one Federal entity \nthat fits that description, and that is the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  For those projects that have not broken ground yet, the VA and the \nCorps of Engineers are already working on plans to include the Corps in \nthe planning and construction of major projects over $100 million.\n\n[[Page H603]]\n\n  I continue to believe that the threshold for a super construction \nproject should be at least $250 million. As a member of the Committee \non Transportation and Infrastructure, I know how busy the Army Corps is \nin responding to the projects that the committee requires them to \ncomplete. It is important that they do not get bogged down with \nprojects of insufficient complexity. I will continue to watch the \nconstruction process and follow the complexity issue to determine if \nthe threshold needs to be increased in the future.\n  I am pleased this legislation also includes an assistant inspector \ngeneral for construction. Oversight of the projects needs a person who \nhas the expertise to evaluate the complexity of VA's ongoing \nconstruction projects.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), my good friend, a member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, and somebody who has been on this from \nthe very, very beginning.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Construction \nReform Act of 2016, an important piece of legislation that will further \nreform VA's severely troubled major construction program.\n  For decades, the Government Accountability Office has documented \nhundreds of millions of dollars in cost overruns on mismanaged VA major \nconstruction projects. GAO reports from 1981, 1993, 2009, and 2013 all \nreflect a stunning degree of bureaucratic incompetence in VA's \nconstruction management. In my own district, a single VA hospital \nproject is over $1 billion over budget, and years behind schedule.\n  VA's construction failures represent billions of wasted tax dollars \nthat should have gone towards VA's core mission: taking care of our \nNation's veterans.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Since 2012, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee has conducted at \nleast six separate hearings exploring the VA's construction failures, \nand this bill's reforms incorporate many of the committee's findings.\n  First, it forces the VA to leave hospital construction to the \nexperts--to Federal construction managers like the Army Corps of \nEngineers. In fact, the contractor on the troubled Aurora, Colorado, \nproject demanded that the Army Corps of Engineers take over the project \nfrom the VA before they returned to work on the project.\n  Previously, in 2014, the House unanimously passed my legislation, \nwhich required the Army Corps to take over the VA's most troubled \nprojects, including the project in Aurora. I am pleased that my \ncolleagues in both the House and the Senate are now fully supportive of \nthis transfer of authority.\n  Second, this bill introduces a much-needed improvement over the \ncontract change order process. The GAO and the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee identified the VA's inept change order management as a major \ndriver of both cost increases and project delays.\n  Third, the bill creates a new, independent assistant inspector \ngeneral for construction who would be required to report directly to \nCongress when significant construction problems have been discovered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. As we learned with the project in Aurora, the VA went to \ngreat lengths to hide the significant problems with the project from \nthe American people, insisting in congressional hearing after hearing \nthat the project was on time and on budget. It was not until the \nproject's contractor sued the VA--and won on every count in December of \n2014--that the VA finally admitted it had significant problems with the \nAurora project.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure and continue with \nthe long-needed construction reforms in the VA.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to \nsupport H.R. 3106, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3106, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to make certain improvements in the \nadministration of Department medical facility construction projects.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H603-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H603-H614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     VETERANS EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION, AND HEALTHCARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and to add any extraneous materials on H.R. 3016, as \namended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection?\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3016, as amended, the Veterans Employment, \nEducation, and Healthcare Improvement Act.\n  This bill, which was introduced by the chairman of our Subcommittee \non Economic Opportunity, Congressman Wenstrup of Ohio, includes a \nnumber of provisions relating to veterans' health care, education, and \nemployment benefits.\n  One provision of the bill would authorize the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to create a new fourth administration to streamline the \noversight of the many VA programs and benefits that assist veterans \nwith transition and that promote their economic welfare. These benefits \ninclude vocational rehabilitation and employment, GI Bill education \nbenefits, the verification of veteran-owned small businesses, the VA's \nportion of the Transition Assistance Program, and the home loan \nguaranty program.\n  Another provision of the bill would make needed improvements to \neducation and vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits by, \namong other things, closing a costly loophole that has allowed some \ncontracted-out flight schools to charge the VA hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in excessive tuition and fee payments.\n  Still other provisions would improve the administration of benefits \nand expand opportunities for the use of the home loan benefit by \neliminating the loan limit that caps the amount of money the VA will \nguarantee under the home loan program. This would help tens of \nthousands of veterans who are living in high-cost areas to realize the \ndream that many Americans strive for.\n  Health-related provisions of the bill would elevate the role of \npodiatrists in the VA medical facilities, improve care for the newborn \nchildren of female veterans, create a pilot program on service dog \ntraining for veterans with post-traumatic stress, and require the \nGovernment Accountability Office to conduct period audits of the VA's \nbudget.\n  I am grateful to Dr. Wenstrup, to Dr. Roe, and to the many other \nsponsors of these provisions for their hard work and leadership in \ncrafting and in developing this legislation, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3016, as amended, the VA Provider Equity \nAct.\n  The provisions of title I directly affect the health of veterans by \nmaking podiatrists equal to other doctors in the VA, by making Medal of \nHonor recipients a top priority in receiving health care at the VA, and \nby making the newborn babies of servicemembers eligible for VA health \ncare in the first 6 weeks of life, to follow their mothers' eligibility \nat the VA.\n  The legislation authorizes a GAO audit of the Veterans Health \nAdministration's budget. I feel that the Veterans Health Administration \nhas been more responsive under the leadership of Dr. David Shulkin, but \nI agree that everyone would be better informed of how the VHA is \nworking if we are all starting on the same page. I am also pleased that \na successful dog training program will be expanded to other parts of \nthe country to help veterans who are recovering from TBI and PTSD.\n  I am particularly pleased to support provisions in H.R. 3016 which \nimprove the veterans' education and rehabilitation program and which \nincrease limits on the veterans' home loan program while maintaining \nthe VA's strict lending requirements.\n  H.R. 3016 also contains several important improvements in education \nand employment programs for veterans. Representative Takano will have \nmore to say because he has taken the lead on these as the ranking \nmember of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Miller for compromising on the \nestablishment of a new administration within the VA, called the \nVeterans Economic Opportunity and Transition Administration.\n  While I appreciate the chairman's attempt to compromise on another \nkey provision, I want to make it clear that I oppose the policy to cut \nin half the living stipend for the children of servicemembers who have \nreceived their\n\n[[Page H612]]\n\nparents' transferred GI Bill benefits. We promised the men and women \nwho signed up to serve in our Nation's military that they would be able \nto transfer their entire GI Bill benefits to a dependent spouse or \nchild. It is unfair that we are now breaking part of that promise. \nWhile I understand that this change pays for the other essential \nprovisions in this bill, I would have preferred that we would have kept \nthe promise we made to servicemembers while finding other ways to pay \nfor this package.\n  As this legislation moves forward, I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to find a different way to pay for these provisions that \ndoes not violate the promise we made to our veterans.\n  I had hoped our Republican colleagues would have brought this bill to \nthe floor under an open rule so as to have given us the opportunity to \npropose amendments and to debate ways to improve the more controversial \nprovisions of this bill. I am disappointed that we are not able to \noffer amendments to improve the bill today. Yet I will support this \nbill overall due to the number of positive improvements.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from the Second District of Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), the chairman \nof the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee and a combat veteran, himself.\n\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3016, the \nVeterans Employment, Education, and Healthcare Improvement Act, as \namended.\n  I am proud to sponsor this bill and am glad to be joined by veteran \nservice organizations in their support, like the VFW and the DAV. It \nwill help ensure that the veterans receive the benefits they have \nearned.\n  This veterans' legislation contains over 30 provisions from over a \ndozen Members of Congress and is the result of countless hours of work \namongst the members of the committee. I want to highlight three \nspecific provisions in the bill that improve the benefits our veterans \nreceive.\n  First is the VA Provider Equity Act, which would strengthen access to \nthe comprehensive, first-class health care that veterans deserve. We \nall know wait times for health care at the VA remain somewhat \nunacceptable in many places. This is true, in part, because the VA \nstruggles to employ enough healthcare specialists to meet the needs of \nveterans.\n  The VA Provider Equity Act responds to this issue by aligning \noutdated VA standards more closely with the private sector practices of \ntoday. When introduced, every doctor on the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs joined as an original cosponsor, understanding that we need to \nmake it easier for the VA to recruit and retain the specialists our \nveterans so desperately need.\n  The bill also includes H.R. 2344, the Veterans Vocational \nRehabilitation and Employment Improvement Act of 2015, which I \nintroduced earlier this year. The VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and \nEmployment program helps disabled veterans to prepare for employment or \nto live as independently as possible. If a veteran chooses to pursue \neducation or training through this program, current law does not \nrequire the courses to be approved for GI benefits. My provision would \ntighten this requirement to provide additional oversight and \nprotections for our veterans.\n  We also include the GI Bill Quality Enhancement Act. By giving State \nApproving Agencies the increased oversight of GI Bill programs, this \nprovision would provide veterans with the information they need to make \ngood choices about education and training programs that offer the best \nquality.\n  The Veterans Employment, Education, and Healthcare Improvement Act \nwould make important progress in streamlining veterans' access to their \nearned benefits. It is one simple step we can take to ensure that our \nveterans receive the benefits they have earned.\n  I thank Representative Takano for his help in moving this forward, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. I thank Ranking Member Corrine Brown for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3016.\n  While there are parts of this bill that I hope to see changed as it \nmoves forward, it includes numerous provisions that will have a \npositive impact on our Nation's veteran population, including several \nprovisions I authored.\n  Section 307 of this bill is the language from my GI Bill Fairness \nAct, bipartisan legislation to close a gap faced by our National \nGuardsmen and Reservists who have been repeatedly called to war \nthroughout operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Currently, members of the Guard and Reserve who are wounded in combat \nare sometimes placed on Active Duty for their recovery, treatment, and \nrehabilitation. Unfortunately, current Federal law does not recognize \nsuch Active Duty orders as eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill education \nassistance, meaning that, unlike other members of the military, those \nwho serve in the Guard and Reserve may actually lose benefits for being \ninjured in the line of duty. This provision in H.R. 3016 would end \nunequal treatment and ensure these guardsmen and reservists are able to \naccrue GI Bill benefits, when ordered to Active Duty, for the purposes \nof receiving medical care.\n  H.R. 3016 also includes my Work-Study for Student Veterans Act, which \nwould reinstate certain VA work-study activities that expired on June \n30, 2013. The VA's Student Work-Study Allowance Program allows \nqualifying student veterans who are in college degree programs or in \nvocational or professional programs to be paid for working in a variety \nof capacities on campus, at VA facilities, or at other veteran-centered \norganizations to assist fellow veterans. The work-study program \nachieves two important goals: offering student veterans a way to earn a \nlittle extra money and providing transitioning veterans with the \nguidance and assistance of fellow veterans who know firsthand what that \ntransition is like.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  I also strongly support section 306 of the bill, which caps the \namount of post-9/11 GI Bill funds available to flight schools--private \nflight schools--that contract with community colleges at the same \namount that the GI Bill caps funds available to private universities.\n  Due to a current loophole in the GI Bill, student veterans have been \nable to take pilot training classes with questionable job placement \nprospects at exorbitant cost to the taxpayers. According to the Los \nAngeles Times, one flight company charged 12 student veterans over \n$500,000 each in GI Bill funds.\n  While it is true that flight training can be more expensive than \nother vocational or academic programs, VA data shows that while the \nnumber of student veterans taking flight training increased by only 9 \npercent between fiscal years '13 and '14, the total cost to taxpayers \nfor this program grew by 87 percent during this same period, costing \n$37 million in taxpayer dollars.\n  The drafters of the GI Bill never intended to create this windfall \nfor the flight school industry. What's more, VFW and the American \nLegion support the cap, agreeing that this loophole is a disservice to \nstudent veterans who would be better served by one of the many flight \nschool programs that cost well under the cap.\n  I do have serious reservations about section 301 of this legislation, \nwhich would cut by half the monthly housing allowance provided to \nchildren of servicemembers who will have post-9/11 GI Bill benefits \ntransferred to them. I don't believe that we should be paying for the \ngreat provisions in this bill by cutting benefits.\n  Furthermore, the bill on the House floor today does not include a \ngrandfather clause. That means that some current servicemembers will \nsee the terms that they agreed to when they signed up changed. As this \nbill advances, I strongly urge the chairman and ranking member to find \nanother pay-for and eliminate section 301.\n  With that being said, I believe overall, with some tweaks, this \nlegislation will provide valuable support for our veterans, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support H.R. 3016.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham), who is\n\n[[Page H613]]\n\nfrom the Fifth District of Louisiana and is a fine member of our \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Miller, \nRanking Member Brown, Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and \nMemorial Affairs Ranking Member Titus, and all Members who worked so \nhard to bring this bill to the floor.\n  There are many provisions in H.R. 677, as amended, that would help \nimprove services for veterans and their families, but I want to focus \nmy remarks on a section that I am proud to have authored.\n  First, the bill would authorize an automatic COLA for beneficiaries \nwho receive the VA disability compensation. Although the Congress \ngenerally approves COLA legislation every year, veterans have to wait \nuntil Congress actually acts.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Walz).\n  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, as you have heard, I associate myself with the \nremarks of the positive nature of the provisions in this bill. It has \nbeen the House Veterans' Affairs Committee that has been in the \nforefront of improving veterans care, from the post-9/11 GI Bill, to \nhealthcare changes, to job placements. We have been at the forefront of \nVA improvements, accountability, and reform.\n  While this bill continues in that vein, as you have heard here, there \nis one provision in it that, for me personally, I cannot cross. To pay \nfor these programs, an offset has to be found. That is a noble and \ncorrect principle; meaning, if we add anything, we need to find the \npay-for somewhere else to not add to the debt.\n  In the case of this, to pay for these absolutely wonderful programs, \nmany which I helped write, we went back and we took a benefit. I am not \ngoing to debate whether that benefit was overly generous. I am not \ngoing to debate how many are using it.\n  If one veteran signed up, served this Nation, went overseas and \nfought for our defense and they were promised a benefit, to pull it \nback at this time is an egregious breach of trust. At a time when the \nVA is hurting, at a time when the faith in government is hurting, the \nfaith in the media, our soldiers need to know there are some things \nthat will not be crossed.\n  So I want to be very clear on this. The motives of the people who \nworked on this should never be questioned. I have never seen people \nwith more integrity and more care for our veterans. Thought goes into \nthis. Improvements try to be made. And when the American people are \nfrustrated and they see nothing gets done, this committee and the \nbipartisanship of the care of our veterans is absolutely paramount.\n  This is a devilish situation. How do we find the pay-for? My question \nis--and, yes, perhaps it is a chip on my shoulder of an enlisted \nsoldier--why come to the soldiers first? There is nowhere else in the \nFederal Government that we can find this.\n  The chairman rightfully pointed out today another egregious waste of \nmoney in decorating and bonuses to VA officials who are not fulfilling \ntheir duty. My question is: can't we find some way to at least get the \npeople through who were there and, if we want to make the changes, do \nso? I know every effort in good faith has been made to do that. Yes, it \ncan be argued that this was overly generous and should not have been \nthere in the first place, but it was. It was signed up for and people \nwent. I have stood in front of troops who said: You promised it to me, \nand I am counting on using it.\n  It seems to me that as Representatives of the American people, I can \ngo back and ask my constituents, and they will agree on almost nothing. \nIf I ask them, ``Should we do everything necessary to care for our \nveterans,'' the answer is ``yes.'' If we can't find the offset, then \nlet's have the courage to go back and ask them what would they be \nwilling to do.\n  I myself will be voting ``no'' on this piece of legislation, but I \njust urge my colleagues to have to weigh this. I hope over the years \nthat I have proven I am not a person who would get in the way of having \nthe perfect get in the way of the good or not trying to work for \ncompromises. It is a line that I feel, if we cross, the trust gets \nbreached, and it is very difficult to gain it back.\n\n  I thank all Members who worked on this.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers at this \ntime.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, to my good friend from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), who is a \nstalwart supporter of veterans on our committee and brings many, many \ngood issues to the forefront for both sides of the aisle to be able to \nwork on together, I do not question his motives in his negative vote \nagainst this bill.\n  I would say that any child who has already had their parents' post-9/\n11 child benefits transferred to them will not be affected by this \nchange. They would still receive 100 percent of their current living \nstipend.\n  It also gives 180 days after enactment before it begins to take \neffect. So any servicemembers who are eligible to transfer their \nbenefits but have not done so would have 180 days to do so, so their \nchild would still receive 100 percent of their monthly stipend.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the 15th Congressional \nDistrict of Ohio (Mr. Stivers).\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the folks on the \ncommittee for their great work on this bill. I stand today to support \nthe bill and also to recognize one of the sections is the Veterans Dog \nTherapy Act, which was rolled into H.R. 3016.\n  We lose 22 of our former servicemembers every day to suicide. This \nlegislation will create a pilot program at three to five of our VA \nfacilities, which is modeled on the Warrior Canine Connection program \nfor getting access to service dogs for our veterans.\n  Veterans enrolled in this program with service dogs have seen \nimprovements in their PTSD and TBI-related symptoms. Additionally, it \nis shown that veterans who own service dogs have fewer symptoms of \ndepression, better interpersonal skills, a lowered risk of substance \nabuse, and better overall mental health. While no one thing can help \ncure our suicide epidemic among veterans, this is a good start.\n  I want to thank Tim Walz for being my cosponsor on this bill. I am \nglad it is rolled in.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this provision as well as the entire \nbill.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from the Ninth Congressional District of Georgia (Mr. \nCollins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. \n3016, the Veterans Employment, Education, and Healthcare Improvement \nAct.\n  I want to thank the chairman for yielding and his leadership. As we \nhave heard today, this is something that truly does bring us together. \nAs someone who continues to serve in the Air Force and looking at my \nbrothers and sisters in arms, this is something we should be about.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) for bringing \nthis important legislation to the floor, including language from my \nlegislation, H.R. 423, concerning VA post-delivery care services.\n  I also want to thank Dr. Roe from Tennessee for his amendment that \nwould extend the coverage for a female veteran's post-delivery care to \n42 days.\n  Female veterans face unique challenges, especially when many of the \nservices available to them are designed for males. One of the most \nsignificant problems female veterans face is access to health care.\n  Currently, the VA is authorized to provide up to 7 days of post-\ndelivery care for a female veteran's newborn baby. Mr. Roe's amendment \nwill expand coverage to 42 days, the length that the VA currently \nprovides for mothers.\n  Females represent the fastest growing group of veterans who are \nenrolling in VA health care, and many of them are mothers or soon will \nbe. It is past time for the VA to expand its care and services to meet \nthe needs of the female veteran. These women have risked their lives to \nprotect our Nation, and our responsibility to them doesn't end when \nthey are no longer serving on Active Duty. In fact, their service to \nour country may jeopardize the very lives of their future children, \nmeaning our responsibility to them is even greater.\n  Research shows that having PTSD in the year before delivery increases \na\n\n[[Page H614]]\n\nwoman's risk of premature delivery by 35 percent. Premature infants \ntypically need longer hospitalizations after they are born. I know what \nit is like to be the parent of a little baby who needed intensive \nmedical care for an extended period of time from the moment she was \nborn. By the way, she is getting ready to turn 24 right now.\n  Any new mother who has given selflessly to her country shouldn't have \nto worry about Congress standing in her way as she tries to give \nselflessly to her own child.\n  I thank my colleague and Chairman Miller for their leadership on this \nissue, and I would urge the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers at this \ntime.\n  I would encourage all my colleagues to support H.R. 3016, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n3016, ``Veterans Employment, Education, and Healthcare Improvement.''\n  I support this bill because it will benefit our veterans who have \nsuffered debilitating injuries to their lower extremities as a result \nof their service to the United States.\n  Specifically, this bill clarifies the role of podiatrists in the \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs and increases their pay grade to match \nother VA physician compensation.\n  There is a need in the Department of Veteran Affairs to classify \npodiatrists as physicians.\n  Our veterans continue to suffer from a variety of foot and lower leg \nconditions as a direct result of their honorable service which can \nresult from both traumatic and progressive etiologies.\n  A growing number of our veterans have diabetes, which puts them at \nrisk for other disorders and even amputation.\n  The VA Podiatry Program Office spends a great deal of its time \ncollaborating with a number of other programs developing and \nimplementing initiatives relative to the prevention and treatment of \ndiabetes and disorders related to diabetes.\n  Houston, Texas is home to the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center, in one of the nation's greatest medical centers; the \nMEDMC has 837 medical providers, but no board certified podiatrists.\n   Our veterans need and deserve specialized treatment and assistance \nfor foot injuries.\n  My congressional district is home to over 25,000 veterans and as an \navid supporter of Veteran Affairs I strongly support this bill.\n  As a supporter and co-sponsor of numerous bills to assist veterans, \nsuch as H.R. 90, the Healthcare Improvement Act, I strongly believe it \nis our duty to give our veterans the best care when they return home.\n  It is important we recognize podiatrists, who change the lives of our \nveterans, to be defined as physicians by the Department of Veteran \nAffairs, and increase their pay grade to reflect other VA physician \ncompensation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3016, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to make certain improvements in the laws \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs relating to health \ncare, educational assistance, and vocational rehabilitation, to \nestablish the Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition \nAdministration, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H614-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H614-H616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CAREER-READY STUDENT VETERANS ACT\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include any extraneous material they may have on H.R. 2360, as \namended, in the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The post-9/11 GI Bill provides student veterans with a wonderful \nopportunity to educate themselves for a job in the new economy. \nThousands of training programs and schools have been approved for use \nof this program, which has benefited millions of veterans.\n  Unfortunately, there are some schools that are not simply providing \nquality education or training that sufficiently prepares students for \njobs in their field of study.\n\n[[Page H615]]\n\n  The committee has found that, in some cases, students have been \ncaught in a situation where the school they attended is properly \naccredited, but the program they are using at the school is not. This \nhas led to situations where students have completed a training or a \ndegree program only to find out that this training does not qualify \nthem to receive the necessary credentials or take the necessary tests \nto practice in the career field for which they used their benefits.\n  This was clearly not the intention of the GI Bill, and I am glad that \nthis bill would ensure that in order to be eligible for GI Bill \nbenefits, an accredited or nonaccredited program must meet State \naccreditation, licensure, or certification standards. This requirement \nwould not only protect student veterans but would also protect the \nintegrity of the GI Bill for future generations.\n  I want to thank Chairman Wenstrup of our Subcommittee on Economic \nOpportunity and the author of the bill, Ranking Member Takano, for \ntheir work on this legislation, which has my full support.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2306, as amended.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2360, the Career-Ready Student \nVeterans Act. Mr. Speaker, I do so for two important reasons.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  The first is that it protects veterans using their GI Bill benefits \nby requiring that all career education programs meet proper \naccreditation, licensure, and certification requirements in order to be \neligible for the GI Bill.\n  The second reason I am so happy to support H.R. 2360 is that it \nrepresents the very best of the legislative process. It is the product \nof collaboration between the majority and the minority, but it is also \na collaboration between Congress and the VSO and academic communities.\n  I want to give due credit to the bill's original author, Subcommittee \non Economic Opportunity Ranking Member Mark Takano, and Chairman \nWenstrup and his staff for working so hard to ensure that the bill \nmeets its goal of preparing student veterans for their chosen fields of \nstudy.\n  The Career-Ready Student Veterans Act puts in place a protection for \nstudent veterans which already exists for servicemen who use the \nDepartment of Defense tuition assistance benefits.\n  I am pleased that the bill creates this basic fairness and ensures \nthat the GI Bill benefits help veterans earn credit that will lead to \nmeaningful employment.\n  In addition to ensuring that career-education programs meet proper \naccreditation requirements, the bill also requires that they publicly \ndisclose any additional steps that the student veteran needs to take to \nprepare them for entry into their chosen profession.\n  I understand this legislation has passed out of committee in the \nSenate and enjoys bipartisan support there. Again, I want to \ncongratulate the bill's original authors on this side and offer my \nstrong support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support \nH.R. 2360, the Career-Ready Student Veterans Act, a straightforward \nsolution that will ensure that career education programs set our \nveterans on the proper path to their desired employment.\n  As a proud member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity and a \ncosponsor of this legislation, H.R. 2360 would ensure that GI Bill-\neligible career education programs provide our veterans with the \naccreditation and credentials they need to build a career in the \nprofessional field or specialty of their choosing.\n  This bill requires that career-education programs that accept GI Bill \ntuition payments must have programmatic accreditation if accreditation \nis required for employment in the career for which the program is \ndesigned to prepare its students.\n  The bill also requires that career-education programs designed to \nprepare an individual for licensure or certification in a State must \nmeet the curriculum and instructional requirements set by the State for \nlicensure or certification.\n  Mr. Speaker, if our veterans invest their time and effort to learn a \nskill set, they will have the peace of mind to know they are on the \nright career-education path and the confidence to know that, if they \nwork hard, they will receive the appropriate certification they need to \nstart their desired employment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Mr. Takano for his leadership on \nthis legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan \nlegislation, H.R. 2360, the Career-Ready Student Veterans Act. This \nbill will ensure that our veterans are using their post-9/11 GI \nbenefits at career-education programs that actually do what they say \nthey do: prepare students for entry into a specific career field.\n  My legislation would require that, in order to be eligible to receive \nGI Bill benefits, programs have programmatic accreditation, if required \nby the State for employment in a specific field.\n  Programs also must prepare students for licensure or certification in \na field, if required by the State, and they must meet any State-\nmandated curricular or instructional requirements.\n  This closely mirrors language included in the fiscal year 2014 \nNational Defense Authorization Act in relation to military tuition \nassistance.\n  We all know the importance of a good job in helping veterans \nsuccessfully transition out of service and into civilian life. \nEducation and training is often a necessary part of finding that job.\n  Unfortunately, too many veterans waste their time and hard-earned \neducation benefits at career-education programs that don't actually \nprepare them for that career field. For example, most States require \nprospective lawyers to have graduated from a law program accredited by \nthe American Bar Association in order to sit for the bar exam.\n  As we all know, you must pass the bar to practice law. When veterans \nunwittingly spend their GI Bill benefits at law programs not accredited \nby the ABA, they graduate with no prospects of becoming a lawyer in \nmost States. My legislation will make sure that this no longer happens.\n  I thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member Brown as well as Chairman \nWenstrup and my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for their \nsupport.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the Career-Ready Student \nVeterans Act.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 2360.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers at \nthis time. I, too, urge a ``yea'' vote on H.R. 2360, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House \nCommittee on Homeland Security and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, I rise in support of H.R. 2360, the ``Career-Ready \nStudent Veterans Act of 2015.''\n  This bill encourages new criteria for state approval of applications \nby educational institutions providing veterans with non-accredited \ncourses.\n  H.R. 2360 respects the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \neducational assistance, provides specific instructions for when the VA \ncan waive requirements by the bill, and instructs the VA to submit to \nCongress notice of, and justification for, a waiver within 30 days of \nissuance.\n  The bill clarifies specific circumstances for when the VA shall \ndisapprove a course of education and when a course shall not be subject \nto disapproval by reason of this Act.\n  Specifically, H.R. 2360 achieves these goals by:\n  1. Requiring programs designed to prepare individuals for state \nlicensure or certification to fulfill any state instructional \ncurriculum licensure or certification requirements\n\n[[Page H616]]\n\n  2. Providing conditions for the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nrefer to when waiving requirements or disapproving a course of \neducation\n  Finally, H.R. 2360 facilitates the approval of certain programs of \neducation for the purposes of enhancing educational assistance provided \nby the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 2360 aligns with the significance of \nlegislation I have introduced in the past.\n  I introduced H.R. 76, Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for \nVeterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act Of 2015. This \nbill also enhanced the educational options for veterans by focusing on \nthe necessity to establish opportunities that facilitate the transition \nfor veterans from the hostile armed force environment to school or \nworkplace.\n  I introduced H.R. 78, New Chance for a New Start in Life Act of 2015. \nThis bill addresses financial awareness pertaining to grants, and \nemployment training programs to assist long-term unemployed persons to \nre-enter the workforce in areas projected to have the highest rates of \ndemand.\n  Pertaining to educational institutions providing veterans with non-\naccredited courses, enforcement of the criteria for state approval of \napplications allows veterans to benefit from the improvement of the \napproval process.\n  H.R. 2360 is the first step toward enforcing this implementation \nstrategy and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \n``Career-Ready Student Veterans Act of 2015.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2360, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H616-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H616-H617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LAKE BALDWIN VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC PROPERTY CONVEYANCE\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4056, as amended, which was \nintroduced by my colleague and fellow Floridian, Congressman Mica.\n  This bill would authorize the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs \nto convey The Community Living Center on the Lake Baldwin campus in \nOrlando to the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  This conveyance is in line with the VA's plans to repurpose the Lake \nBaldwin campus and would save VA from expending money, maintaining the \nproperty that the Department has no further use for while allowing this \nparcel of land to continue to be used in the service of our veterans.\n  I am grateful to Congressman Mica for sponsoring this legislation.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation, H.R. 4056, introduced by my colleague \nfrom Florida, Mr. John Mica, will authorize the VA to convey to the \nFlorida Department of Veterans Affairs The Community Living Center at \nthe Lake Baldwin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Orlando, \nFlorida.\n  When the Orlando VA center is fully completed, it will include 134 \ninpatient beds, an outpatient clinic, parking garage, chapel, and \ncentral energy plant.\n  One of the first buildings opened at the Orlando VA Medical Center \nwas the 120-bed Community Living Center and the 60-bed domiciliary. \nBoth are now open and accepting veterans. With the new facilities, it \nis not necessary for the VA to keep two facilities open in close \nproximity.\n  I am pleased that Mr. Mica was able to work with the Florida \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to take over this facility and continue \nto serve the veterans of central Florida.\n  Let me just say one other thing. I am just very impressed with the \nopening of this facility, the domiciliary, and also the clinic. We were \nable to get that facility open before the hospital opened, and it was \ntaking veterans.\n  In addition to that, the Department of Defense gave that facility to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs--institutional memory is very \nimportant--and I am just very pleased that we will continue to use this \nfacility for veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Mica for bringing this before the \nHouse.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from the Seventh District of Florida (Mr. Mica), who authored \nthis piece of legislation.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Chairman \nMiller and also thank Ranking Member Brown for their strong support in \nhelping to expedite this legislation.\n  This is a simple measure. It does transfer a vacant 120-bed VA \nnursing care building in Orlando's VA veteran Baldwin Park facility to \nthe Florida Department of Veterans Affairs, as the chairman described.\n  As the ranking member mentioned, we actually have opened a 120-bed \nnew facility to the south of Orlando and a 60-bed domiciliary unit also \nopen now for nearly 2 years. Adjacent to that is a new hospital at Lake \nNona.\n  I think Ms. Brown was with me back in 1999 when this 120-bed nursing \ncare facility was dedicated. The facility is not that old. It was \nclosed 2 years ago when we opened the new facility, and the VA used \nthat building and some of the rooms for transition for training for \nemployment.\n  Now the new hospital is open. The new 120-bed facility is open to the \nsouth and domiciliary unit. We have agreement from the State of Florida \nto take that facility. You might be interested to know why central \nFlorida would want another veterans facility.\n\n[[Page H617]]\n\n  In some areas, there is a declining population. The chief financial \nofficer of the State just announced that we had 1,000 new people come \nto Florida every day last year. We have now exceeded 20 million. Many \nof those are veterans, and they are settling in central Florida.\n  We do have an agreement with the State of Florida to assume this \nfacility. They can open it quicker. They can do it in a cost-effective \nmanner for VA. They can take some of the burden off of the Federal VA, \nwhich we know has a full set of challenges right now.\n  I want to thank VA Secretary McDonald. I also want to thank my \ncolleagues in 2014, the ranking member, Ms. Brown; Mr. Webster; Mr. \nGrayson; and myself.\n  We all wrote to Secretary Shinseki, the Secretary at that time, and \nasked that this be done. It has taken a little bit of time, but we are \ngetting there.\n  Again, I ask concurrence in passing H.R. 4056. It will expedite and \nmake available the needed nursing homes with our aging veterans \npopulation and many thousands of veterans moving to the State of \nFlorida and, particularly, central Florida.\n  I thank you again for expediting this, and I ask for the House to \nconcur in passing H.R. 4056.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Abraham) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nadd extraneous materials to H.R. 677, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Louisiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 677, as amended.\n  H.R. 677, as amended, contains many important provisions that would \nhelp\n\n[[Page H626]]\n\nour Nation's veterans, including provisions to provide an automatic \nannual COLA, cost-of-living adjustment, for veterans' benefits; \nexpedite the processing of veterans' claims and appeals; improve VA's \nfiduciary program; expand the official documentation accepted by the \nSecretary of Defense to grant veteran status with limited benefits to \nWorld War II Merchant Marine and Coastwise Merchant Seamen; designate \ncertain cities as American World War II cities; and express the sense \nof Congress honoring American veterans disabled for life.\n  I want to recognize the hard work of the Members whose proposals have \nbeen incorporated into H.R. 677, as amended. I particularly want to \nthank my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee: Chairman \nMiller, Ranking Member Brown, Ms. Titus, Dr. Ruiz, Mr. Walz, and Mr. \nO'Rourke. In addition, I want to acknowledge the contributions of \nRepresentatives Johnson, Butterfield, Latta, Rouzer, and Frankel.\n  H.R. 677, as amended, incorporates legislation that Chairman Miller \nintroduced that would expand the eligibility for a medallion provided \nby VA for private headstones that identify the deceased as a veteran.\n  These medallions may be attached to privately purchased headstones of \nveterans who are buried in private cemeteries. They are inscribed with \nthe word ``veteran'' across the top, and the branch of service is \ninscribed along the bottom. The medallions have proven to be very \npopular, with many families choosing to use it to honor the service of \ntheir loved one.\n  Unfortunately, current law only authorizes medallions for veterans \nwho died before November 1, 1990. During a Disability Assistance and \nMemorial Affairs Subcommittee hearing, the VA testified that it has \nbeen forced to deny 91 percent of applications for medallions because \nthe requests were made by families of veterans who died before November \n1, 1990.\n  H.R. 677, as amended, would allow the VA to provide these medallions \nto individuals who served in the Armed Forces after April 6, 1917, \nwhich is the date the United States entered World War I.\n  The reason that this proposal limits eligibility to those who served \nafter April 6, 1917, is due to the possibility that attaching a \nmedallion to an older headstone may cause damage. There are also \nconcerns that placing medallions on antique headstones in older \ncemeteries may alter the appearance of historic cemeteries.\n  H.R. 677, as amended, would protect historic gravestones and \ncemeteries, but also recognizes the importance in honoring the service \nand sacrifice of those who have served our Nation in the Armed Forces.\n  These medallions ensure that veterans who are buried in private \ncemeteries and whose graves are marked by privately purchased \nheadstones can easily be distinguished. I hope that when people visit \nthese cemeteries and see these medallions they take a few moments to \nremember that we all owe our freedom to our Nation's veterans. These \npatriotic heroes deserve nothing less.\n  This bill also includes the text of H.R. 1575, a bill that was \nintroduced by Ranking Member Brown to extend a pilot program on \ncounseling in retreat settings for women veterans who are newly \nseparated from service. This pilot was originally authorized in 2010, \nand pilot participants have reported unanimously positive experiences \nand a significant improvement in well-being, stress, and positive \ncoping skills following their participation in the retreats.\n  I am grateful to the ranking member for sponsoring this provision in \nrecognition of the good work being done in this pilot program and the \nneed to ensure that women veterans continue to have access to it.\n  There are many provisions in H.R. 677, as amended, that would help \nimprove services for veterans and their families, but I want to focus \nmy remarks on the section that I am proud to have authored.\n  First, the bill would authorize an automatic annual COLA for \nbeneficiaries who receive VA disability compensation. Although Congress \ngenerally approves COLA legislation every year, veterans have to wait \nuntil Congress actually acts. This can be very stressful for our \nveterans and their families who depend on their payments to make ends \nmeet. Our Nation's heroes should not have to wait to know whether they \nare going to be able to pay their bills or not.\n  H.R. 677, as amended, would ensure that our Nation's veterans \nautomatically receive the same annual COLA as Social Security \nrecipients. This critical provision will help our Nation's veterans \nbetter plan for their financial future, and I urge all Members to \nsupport it.\n  Second, this legislation would help make it more convenient for \nveterans to schedule disability examinations by extending the temporary \nauthorization that allows the VA to use contract physicians to conduct \ndisability examinations through 2017.\n  Veterans in rural areas, like the Fifth District which I represent, \nmay have to travel long distances to see a VA examiner for a disability \nexamination. My proposal would make it easier to schedule disability \nexaminations by permitting the VA to contract with any physician with a \ncurrent, unrestricted license to conduct these examinations in the \nUnited States.\n\n  Additionally, H.R. 677, as amended, would require the VA to provide \nCongress with regular types of claims veterans file. This information \nwill help better inform our efforts to reform the VA and ensure \nveterans receive timely, accurate claims decisions.\n  Section 4 of H.R. 677, as amended, would also express the sense of \nCongress that the VA should develop a designated form for an increased \nrating claim or reopening of a claim that does not require the \nresubmittal of information previously submitted to the Department.\n  I am grateful for the ranking member's response in this provision in \nrecognition of the good work being done in this pilot program, and we \nneed to ensure that it is passed. I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to all the members of our \ncommittee who have worked to address these issues in a bipartisan \nmanner, and I truly hope we can stay focused on what is important here, \nwhich is helping veterans.\n  This bill extends a pilot counseling program for women veterans \nseparating from the military and coping with PTSD and other combat-\nrelated stress issues. These specialized programs are helping women \ntransition from the military and start the next phase of their lives.\n  I would also like to highlight an important piece of this legislation \nthat was originally introduced by my friend and colleague, Mr. \nO'Rourke, the Express Appeals Act.\n  As highlighted by my friend and colleague, Representative Titus, \nother members of the committee, and even the VA Secretary just 2 weeks \nago, the appeals process is in crisis. We in the House have heard the \ncry for help and have responded.\n  After passing this bill, we will wait for our friends in the Senate \nto take action. We encourage them to remember our veterans suffer for \nour inaction. This action provides a critical and widely supported \nalternative appeals process.\n  I applaud Representatives O'Rourke and Cook, Chairman Miller, the VA, \nthe Board of Appeals, the DAV, the VFW, PVA, AMVETS, IAVA, and MOAA in \nworking together for almost 2 years to reach broad consensus on an \nalternative path forward.\n  The Express Appeals Act, similar to the VA's Fully Developed Claim \nprogram, offers veterans an alternative option to do more of the work \non their own, with the promise of an expedited decision from the Board \nof Veterans Appeals.\n  My friend and colleague, Representative Ruiz's bill, H.R. 2691, the \nVeterans' Survivors Claims Processing and Automation Act of 2015, is \nalso included in this legislation. This provision would automate claims \nfor the surviving family members of veterans.\n  I truly believe how we treat our veterans plays a major role in who \nis willing to fight our wars and defend our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n\n[[Page H627]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support \nH.R. 677, the American Heroes COLA Act.\n  There are a lot of very excellent provisions to this bill, not the \nleast of which is the automatic COLA, but I actually want to speak to \npart of this bill that deals with the claims processing.\n  The legislation offered by my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) \nwould set out to improve the claims processing through several steps. I \nwant to highlight them.\n  First, it would require the VA to accept medical evidence from \nmedical professionals in the community to support veterans' disability \nclaims. Second, it would establish a commission to independently \nevaluate the VA's disability claims and appealed claims backlog. Last, \nit would develop an alternative program to determine appeals for \ndisability claims more quickly.\n  Each of these steps offers solutions to the current backlog. This \nbill is a smart, proactive, bipartisan bill that will help reduce the \ndaunting piles of paperwork and delays that many veterans continue to \nface.\n  I am very proud to be in support of this bill. It is another step in \ndoing our best to reduce the claims backlog, and I thank Mr. Abraham \nfor his leadership on this.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to \nsupport H.R. 677, as amended.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Let me first thank Mr. Takano for yielding, and I \nthank all of you for your advocacy on this bill. This is a very, very \nimportant piece of legislation for our veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are running out of time to finally recognize the \ncritical contributions of a forgotten but critical segment of brave men \nand women who served our country during World War II. Because we are \nrunning out of time, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 677, which \ncontains provisions from my bill, H.R. 1288, that would create a \npathway for these forgotten individuals to finally be recognized for \ntheir service to our country.\n  I am referring to an overlooked segment of the World War II Merchant \nMarine, known as Coastwise Merchant Seamen. These men and women, Mr. \nSpeaker, served the vital role of transporting raw materials and \nsupplies between our domestic military installations and production \nfacilities during the war. Their jobs were absolutely essential to the \nwar effort.\n  To this day, many of these mariners have never been recognized for \ntheir service, largely at no fault of their own, but rather because of \ndecisions made by the Federal Government. It has been virtually \nimpossible for many of these mariners to obtain the required documents \nneeded to prove their World War II service due to government orders \nthat either had these documents destroyed or never kept at all.\n  Even today, government inaction and delay on transferring the \nsurviving documents to the National Archives and Records Administration \nmakes searching for and obtaining the required documents practically \nimpossible. As each day passes, this issue grows more acute due to the \nadvanced age of these mariners.\n  We must make it possible for these great Americans to receive their \ndue recognition while we still have the chance.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  More importantly, we have to do this now, while these mariners still \nhave the chance to know that their sacrifices were not in vain, and \ntheir Nation and government are appreciative of their service.\n  Mr. Speaker, these mariners are national treasures, and we are here \ntoday because of their sacrifices. They deserve, each of them, to be \nrecognized for their service, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthis effort by voting ``yes'' on this bill.\n  I want to thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Brown, subcommittee \nChairman Abraham, and Ranking Member Titus for working with me and my \nstaff on this issue, and including provisions of my bill in the base \ntext.\n  I want to thank the committee staff for all of their hard work. I am \nappreciative of their efforts. This has been a true team effort, and we \nare now one step closer to finally doing the right thing.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Frankel).\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank Mr. Takano for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 677, a bill that honors \nAmerican veterans disabled for life. I thank my friend from Florida, \nChairman Jeff Miller, for cosponsoring this bill with me and \nshepherding its passage.\n  As the mother of a United States Marine veteran, I want to first \nstart by thanking all our veterans who have served us. Thankfully for \nmy family, my son returned safely from two wars.\n  But, sadly, there are many for whom leaving the battlefield does not \nmark the end of a conflict, for them or their family. Jeff Colaiacovo \nis one of those people. I am proud to say he is a constituent and one \nof my heroes.\n  On his 18th birthday, unlike many young men of his generation, he \nvolunteered for the Army to go to the Vietnam War, and it would be \nbrutal.\n  A few months into his tour, in 1967, Jeff's tank hit a mine, and \nshrapnel exploded into his eyes, blinding him. Miraculously, the \ndoctors were able to recover his vision, and soon after, he was back on \nthe battlefield.\n  Then, on August 30, 1967, Jeff's tank was hit by a rocket-propelled \ngrenade, trapping him inside, his body engulfed in flames. He spent 5 \nmonths in burn units around the world.\n  He left the Army with an honorable discharge. And, again, he was not \nto be deterred. He got married. He raised children. He started a small \nbusiness.\n  The thing is, Mr. Speaker, the injuries he sustained during his \nservice left him disabled for life. And to this day, Jeff is under \nheavy medication for PTSD. He bears the scars of duty that remind us \nall of what he and many others gave in serving us.\n  Now, this bill recognizes that October 5 is the anniversary of the \ndedication of the Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, a magnificent \nmemorial that sits just steps away from the Capitol.\n  On one of its walls reads a quote from Dwight D. Eisenhower: ``Each \nof you bears upon his body the permanent, honorable scars of dangerous \nservice: service rendered in order that our great nation might continue \nto live according to the expressed will of its own citizens.''\n  In honor of Jeff, and so many others, let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As I conclude, I would like to speak about a provision in this bill. \nIncluded here is language extending the very successful pilot program \nrun by the Department of Veterans Affairs which provides psychiatric \nand psychological counseling and support in retreat settings for newly \nreturned women veterans.\n  A Veterans Health Administration report showed that this limited, 2-\nyear pilot program, run by the Readjustment Counseling Service, \nproduced positive, measurable results helping returning women veterans \nexperiencing post-traumatic stress, depression, sleep disturbances and \nisolation, many having been evaluated as service-connected for severe \nPTSD.\n  In surveys, participants have consistently reported experiencing a \nmarked decrease in stress symptoms and an increase in coping skills, \nincluding understanding better how to develop support systems and to \naccess available resources at the VA and in their communities as they \nreenter civilian life.\n  Post-9/11 women veterans, often combat veterans, are brought together \nin groups of about 20, in outdoor settings. These veterans, most of \nwhom are coping with the effects of severe PTSD, some as a result of \nsexual trauma while in the military, participated in trust-building \nexercises and worked with counselors and psychological educators to \nbuild peer support.\n  Financial and occupational counseling and conflict resolution \ntraining were also offered on an as-needed basis.\n  I urge support of this provision and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I continue to urge support of H.R. 677.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H628]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n677, the ``American Heroes COLA Act.''\n  This bill requires that, whenever there is an increase in benefit \namounts payable under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability \nInsurance) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs shall increase by the same percentage the amounts payable as \nveterans' disability compensation.\n  H.R. 677 does the following:\n  1. compensates for dependents\n  2. a clothing allowance for certain disabled adults\n  3. compensation for surviving spouses and children\n  This bill requires that veterans are given the correct percentage and \nbenefit amounts from the Social Security Act.\n  Retired military veterans, VA rates for compensation and pension for \ndisabled veterans and surviving families will be effective December 1, \n2015 and will be reflected on the first check to be paid on December \n31, 2015.\n  Congress enacted the COLA provision as part of the 1972 Social \nSecurity Amendments, and automatic annual COLAs began in 1975. Before \nthat, benefits were increased only when Congress enacted special \nlegislation.\n  COLA impacts benefits to about 59 social security recipients, 1.96 \nmillion military retirees and 4 million disabled veterans.\n  This increase in benefit amounts will help alleviate financial stress \nthat millions of our disabled veterans have.\n  As the sponsor of H.R. 76 ``the HERO Transition from Battlespace to \nWorkplace Act,'' I strongly support our veterans and any bill that \nhelps mitigate soldier to citizen transition.\n  As Abraham Lincoln stated, ``Honor to the soldier and sailor \neverywhere, who bravely bears his country's cause. Honor, also, to the \ncitizen who cares for his brother in the field and serves, as he best \ncan, the same cause.''\n  H.R. 677 is a positive step forward in increasing in benefit amounts \npayable as veteran's disability compensation.\n  I strongly support this bill and urge my colleagues to join me and do \nthe same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 677, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to provide for annual cost-of-living \nadjustments to be made automatically by law each year in the rates of \ndisability compensation for veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for \nsurvivors of certain service-connected disabled veterans, and for other \npurposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H628-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H628-H630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VA MEDICAL CENTER RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nadd extraneous material on H.R. 3234, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Louisiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3234, as amended, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs VA Medical Center Recovery Act.\n  This bill would require the VA to publish key health metrics and use \nthese metrics to determine semiannually which VA medical centers are \nperforming satisfactorily and which are underperforming.\n  If a VA medical center is determined to be underperforming, VA would \nbe required to send a rapid deployment team to the facility within 30 \ndays to establish a remediation plan and provide needed help in problem \nareas.\n  The VA would also be required to send regular reports to Congress on \nwhich facilities are underperforming and what actions have been taken \nto improve their performance.\n  In addition, the bill would require the VA inspector general to \nprioritize investigations related to underperforming medical centers \nand the Office of Accountability Review to prioritize investigations of \nwhistleblower retaliation relating to underperforming medical centers.\n  This bill would also include a provision to strengthen training for \nundergraduate nurses on veterans unique issues, needs, and benefits.\n  H.R. 3234, as amended, is sponsored by Congresswoman Martha Roby from \nAlabama, and I am grateful for her leadership in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my colleagues to support H.R. \n3234, the VA Medical Center Recovery Act.\n  This bill puts the responsibility for identifying and improving the \nworst performing VA medical centers squarely on the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, requiring him to deploy teams of experts to turn \naround failing facilities.\n  The bill would, for the first time, require the VA to publish key \nmetrics known as SAIL data on the Federal Register and would require \nthe Secretary to report to Congress any medical centers determined to \nbe failing.\n  Some of my colleagues might wonder why such a bill is necessary, \ngiven the VA reform law that we passed more than a year ago. That was a \ngood bill, but it wasn't a silver bullet. Many problems still exist in \nthe VA, and it is our responsibility to address them.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Central Alabama VA in my district became known as \none of the worst in the country. My staff and I worked with \nwhistleblowers and the press to uncover major instances of misconduct, \nnegligence, and mismanagement inside the Central Alabama VA, including:\n  Widespread manipulation of scheduling data. A nation-leading 57 \npercent of employees reported that managers instructed them to change \nappointment times to hide long waits.\n  More than 1,000 patient X-rays, some showing malignancies, went \nmissing for months and even years.\n  A pulmonologist was caught twice falsifying more than 1,200 patient \nrecords but somehow given a satisfactory review.\n  An employee took a recovering veteran to a crackhouse, bought him \ndrugs, and paid for prostitutes, all to extort his benefits. When \ncaught, the employee wasn't fired, not until a year later, after our \noffice exposed it publicly.\n  In the wake of these exposures, the Central Alabama VA Director \nbecame the first senior VA manager fired under the new law.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. ROBY. But even after leadership changes, data showed that the \nCentral Alabama VA's two medical centers in Montgomery and Tuskegee \nwere ranked the worst and the second worst in the Nation for delays in \npatient care.\n  By any measure, the Central Alabama VA was the definition of a \nfailing VA system. We had a severe problem, and it required immediate \nattention.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, getting the attention of the top VA leaders proved \ndifficult. Once our problems left the front page, there wasn't a whole \nlot of followup.\n  My veterans in Alabama were subject to some of the worst healthcare \nservice in the country, and no one wanted to take responsibility.\n  Mr. Speaker, I began to think maybe it was because we were depending \non a broken bureaucracy to fix itself, that maybe it was because we \nwere asking VA leaders, rather than requiring them, to intervene.\n  Mr. Speaker, I decided that it was time that we changed that. So, in \nJuly, I filed that legislation and began working with the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee to get a hearing and a vote.\n  I don't sit on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, so I want to thank \nthe chairman, Jeff Miller; the subcommittee chairman, Dan Benishek; and \nall the members of the committee for being receptive and working with \nme on this bill.\n  I also want to thank all the committee staff for their hard work.\n  There is no question this bill represents a major step forward and a \nfoundation to build upon.\n  It should be noted that almost 2 years after the scandal first broke, \nwe are making progress in central Alabama at the VA. Staffing is up, \nwait times are down. We are building a Community Veterans Health \nNetwork that I believe one day can be an example for the entire Nation. \nWe have a long way to go, and I am truly optimistic about the future.\n\n  But, Mr. Speaker, it shouldn't have taken this long and it shouldn't \nhave taken a Member of Congress breathing down the necks of top VA \nofficials to get the attention that our veterans deserve.\n  You know, sometimes I wonder what would have happened if our \ncourageous whistleblowers hadn't stepped up or if the reporters we \nworked with didn't think it was a story?\n  What if the truth about the missing X-rays, the manipulated \npulmonology records, and the crackhouse never came out? What if we want \nexposed all of that?\n  Would our veterans in central Alabama still be subject to the worst \nhealth care in the country? Would we even know?\n  I don't want what happened in central Alabama to ever happen again \nanywhere. This bill helps to ensure that by requiring key VA health \nmetrics to be published for everyone to see and making sure that the VA \nofficials at the very top cannot hide behind the layers of bureaucracy \nwhen it comes to severely failing centers.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation, H.R. 3234, as amended, is designed to \nestablish criteria for the evaluation and improvement of VA medical \ncenters. The\n\n[[Page H630]]\n\nbill requires the VA to create key health metrics to measure whether \neach medical center is satisfactory or underperforming.\n  The metrics will be published on the VA Web site, and an \nunderperforming medical center will be subject to a rapid deployment \nteam being sent to the facility to create a remediation plan and bring \nthem up to standards. The VA will issue quarterly reports on the \nunderperforming facilities and their progress in the following \nremediation plan.\n  Additionally, the bill seeks to require the VA to enter into \npartnerships with recognized schools of nursing to provide \nundergraduate nursing students enrolled in such schools with \nstandardized training. The bill lists the 11 areas the training should \ninvolve, including PTSD, TBI, and military sexual trauma.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill addresses issues the committee has expressed \nconcerns about in the past. I support its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3234, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I also once again encourage all Members to \nsupport H.R. 3234, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3234, \nthe Failing VA Medical Center Recovery Act.\n  I support this legislation because it would establish in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs an Office of Failing Medical Center \nRecovery, and the position of Under Secretary for Failing Medical \nCenter Recovery to head the Office.\n  The Office shall carry out the managerial and day-to-day operational \ncontrol of each VA failing medical center.\n  The bill directs that the VA shall: publish in the Federal Register \nand on a publicly available VA website a compilation of key health \nmetrics for each VA medical center; certify semiannually that each VA \nmedical center ranked as ``failing'' is subject to managerial and day-\nto-day operational control by the Office; revoke the certification of a \nVA medical center as a failing medical center if it achieves a ranking \nof ``satisfactory'' or better for three consecutive fiscal quarters; \nsubmit to Congress a quarterly report on the Office, including actions \ntaken by the Under Secretary regarding covered failing medical centers; \nand transfer each covered failing medical center from the direct \ncontrol of the relevant Veterans Integrated Service Network to the \ndirect control of the Under Secretary.\n  The bill also ensures that the Inspector General of the VA will \nprioritize investigations relating to covered failing medical centers, \nand the Office of Accountability Review will prioritize investigations \nof whistle blower retaliation relating to such centers.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reason this important legislation is needed is \nillustrated by the tragic and heart breaking cases of thousands of \nveterans who were left waiting for care for serious medical conditions.\n  In the State of Texas we have 1,099,141 Veterans under the age of 65 \nand 590,618 who are over the age of 65. There are over 1,689,759 \nveterans living in our state.\n  The 18th Congressional District has 20,607 under age 65 and 9,844 \nVeterans over the age of 65.\n  The Michael E. Debakey Veterans Hospital Center, located in Houston \nTexas serves the health care needs of thousands of veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  The Debakey Veterans Hospital Center provides support to veterans and \ntheir families who are amputees, cancer, spinal cord injuries, \ntraumatic brain injury, and have visual impairments.\n  The Medical center provides family support services through its \nFisher House that provides living suites at no cost to family members \nof hospitalized Veterans and military members.\n  Today, with our vote on H.R. 3234, we can renew our commitment to our \nnation's more than 2 million troops and reservists, their families, and \nthe 22 million veterans who served our nation.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3234.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3234, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to evaluate the ability of each medical center of the \nDepartment to provide quality health care to veterans, to ensure that \nthe Secretary improves such medical centers that are underperforming, \nand for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H630-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H630-H633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEMALE VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nadd extraneous material on H.R. 2915, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Louisiana?\n\n[[Page H631]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2915, as amended, the Female Veteran \nSuicide Prevention Act. This bill would amend the Clay Hunt Suicide \nPrevention for American Veterans, or the SAV Act, by directing the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to ensure that the independent third-\nparty evaluation of mental health and suicide prevention programs \nrequired in the act identifies programs and metrics that are effective \nin treating women veterans.\n  Women are an important and an increasing segment of our Active Duty \nand veteran populations, and, moving forward, we must ensure that VA \ntakes the unique needs of women veterans into account when conducting \nprogram reviews and evaluations.\n  This is particularly important for mental health and suicide \nprevention programs, given that recent research has shown that female \nveterans commit suicide at nearly six times the rate of other women and \nare five times more likely to commit suicide than male veterans.\n  H.R. 2915, as amended, would also require the VA to establish and \ndisseminate standards and procedures to ensure that a veteran who has \nparticipated in a classified mission or served in a sensitive unit \nwhile in the Armed Forces may access VA mental health care in a manner \nthat fully accommodates his or her obligation to not improperly \ndisclose classified information.\n  Serious concerns have been raised about the mental health care that \nVA provides to veterans following the suicide death of Sergeant Daniel \nSomers in 2013. Sergeant Somers served on a number of classified \nmissions during his time in the military.\n  When he separated from service and sought VA care, he was enrolled in \ngroup therapy sessions despite his fear of being unable to participate \ncomfortably in group sessions due to his fear that he may inadvertently \nshare classified information.\n  Had VA been more responsive to Sergeant Somers' concerns and provided \nhim treatment that was sensitive to has concerns, he may be with us \ntoday.\n  H.R. 2915, as amended, is sponsored by Congresswoman Julia Brownley \nof California, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, and \nincorporates provisions sponsored by Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema of \nArizona.\n  I am grateful to both of them for their work.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2915, as amended.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2915, a bill to direct the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to identify mental health care and suicide \nprevention programs that are effective in treating women veterans as a \npart of the evaluation of such programs by the Secretary.\n  My friend, the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, Ms. Julia \nBrownley, was integral to identifying the issues affecting women \nsuicides. I commend her leadership in bringing this issue to our \nattention.\n  Congress has long recognized the unacceptable rates of suicide among \nour Nation's veterans. Most recently, Congress passed the Clay Hunt \nSuicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, Public Law 114-2, which \nrequires an independent third party to evaluate VA mental health care \nand suicide prevention programs.\n  VA's most recent suicide data report was released in February of \n2013. That report found that 18 to 22 veterans per day commit suicide. \nIn a follow-up report, the VA found an increase in the suicide rate \namong female veterans who use the VA healthcare system.\n  This finding echoes recent research that found that female veterans \ncommit suicide nearly six times the rate of other women and that women \nveterans are five times more likely to be successful in committing \nsuicide than male veterans.\n  This bill would amend the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American \nVeterans Act to include within the independent third-party evaluation \nspecific metrics applicable to women and to identify the VA mental \nhealth care and suicide prevention programs that are most effective and \nhave the highest satisfaction rates among with women veterans.\n  Additionally, this legislation includes a provision that my friend, \nRepresentative Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, has been working on for \nyears.\n  This section requires the VA to establish and publish standards and \nprocedures to ensure that a woman who participated in a classified \nmission or served in a sensitive unit while in the Armed Forces may \naccess VA mental health care without improperly disclosing classified \ninformation.\n  This provision would also require the VA to find alternative methods \nof mental health treatment for veterans who need to access care without \nbeing put in a position where they may reveal information that should \nnot be disclosed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. Once again, \nI encourage all Members to support H.R. 2915, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Brownley).\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank \nChairman Miller and Ranking Member Brown for their help in moving the \nFemale Veteran Suicide Prevention Act forward.\n\n  I would also like to recognize my colleague from Arizona whose bill \nhonoring the memory of her constituent, Army veteran Sergeant Daniel \nSomers, has been included.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you know, the women veteran population is more than 2 \nmillion and growing quickly. But our understanding of the experience of \nwomen in the military and women veterans is not keeping pace with this \nrapidly changing demographic.\n  We agree that one of the most pressing and immediate issues we must \naddress, as Members of Congress, is the tragic epidemic of suicide \namong all of our veterans. Last year Congress passed the Clay Hunt SAV \nAct, which required the VA to conduct annual evaluations of its suicide \nprevention and mental health programs.\n  I am confident that the Clay Hunt bill will save lives. But recently \nresearchers analyzed data from 23 States and the Suicide Repository on \nmore than 170,000 suicides over a 10-year period.\n  These researchers found data suggesting that female veteran suicide \nfollows very different patterns than male veteran suicide. The \nstatistics are extremely startling. Suicide among women veterans \nincreased by an astounding 40 percent from 2000 to 2010.\n  The suicide rate among veteran women is nearly six times higher than \namong nonveteran women. For women ages 18 to 29, the risk of suicide is \neven higher, at nearly 12 times the rate of nonveteran women.\n  We don't know whether the reasons are related to the high rate of \nmilitary sexual assault, gender-specific experiences on the \nbattlefield, or factors that distinguish differing personal \nbackgrounds, which is exactly the point. Without looking more closely \nat the root causes, we cannot hope to find better solutions.\n  Last year the Los Angeles Times wrote about this issue describing the \nheartbreaking case of Army medic Sara Leatherman. Even before her \ndeployment, Sara had experienced depression and attempted suicide.\n  She was discharged early from her deployment because of a back injury \nsustained in Iraq. Suffering from post-traumatic stress and \nexperiencing physical pain from her injury, Sara was not able to live \nby herself and moved in with her grandmother.\n  Sara was trying to get her life back on track and was attending \ncommunity college. Although Sara was receiving VA treatment for PTSD, \nat the very young age of 24, she tragically took her life. Her family \nhas been utterly destroyed by their loss.\n  While so very distressing, the VA was unable to help Sara. So we must \nhonor Sara's memory and the memory of other women veterans whom we so \ntragically lost to suicide by doing our very best to better understand \nthe underlying and unique causes that lead women veterans to take their \nlives over wanting to live their lives.\n  I introduced the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act to do just \nthat by\n\n[[Page H632]]\n\nbuilding upon and improving the Clay Hunt SAV Act. My bill will help \nidentify the different mental health and suicide prevention programs \nthat are most effective for either male or female veterans.\n  My bill will also require the VA to report to Congress annually on \nthe results of this analysis. Finally, my bill will require that VA's \nevaluation of its suicide prevention programs include specific \nperformance metrics for women veterans.\n  The Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act passed the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee proudly with bipartisan support. It is also supported \nby the Service Women's Action Network, The American Legion, the \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart, Disabled American Veterans, Iraq \nand Afghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nParalyzed Veterans of America, and the Vietnam Veterans of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill will give us more tools in the toolbox to help \nsave the lives of men and women who have bravely served our country \nwith great honor and distinction. One human life unnecessarily lost is \none life too many.\n  I thank my colleagues on the committee for making the Female Veteran \nSuicide Prevention Act a priority. I urge all of my colleagues to join \nme in voting ``yes'' on this important legislation.\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Julia Brownley,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Brownley: On behalf of the over 2 \n     million members of The American Legion, I would like to \n     express our support for H.R. 2915, the Female Veteran Suicide \n     Prevention Act. This bill, as written, would improve female \n     veteran suicide prevention programs within the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) by amending Title 38 directing the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to identify mental health care \n     and suicide prevention programs and metrics that are \n     effective in treating women veterans. This bill also strives \n     to improve suicide prevention programs for female veterans \n     enrolled in the VA healthcare system.\n       In 2014, The American Legion passed a resolution urging the \n     President and Congress to sign into law the Suicide \n     Prevention for American Veterans Act or similar acts that \n     will expand and improve the care provided to veterans and \n     servicemembers who have mental health issues or are at risk \n     of suicide. Under this Act, the Departments of Defense and \n     Veterans Affairs would be required to review their mental \n     health care programs on an annual basis to ensure their \n     effectiveness, offer special training on identifying those \n     high risk veterans who are suicidal to their mental health \n     providers, and to improve the process regarding medical \n     records and prescriptions for the purpose of ensuring that \n     there is a seamless health care process for those \n     servicemembers who are transitioning out of the service.\n       Again, The American Legion supports H.R 2915, the Female \n     Veteran Suicide Prevention Act and applauds your leadership \n     in addressing this critical issue facing our nation's \n     veterans and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dale Barnett,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Military Order of\n\n\n                                             the Purple Heart,\n\n                               Springfield, VA, December 15, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeff Miller,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Miller:  On behalf of the Military Order of \n     the Purple Heart (MOPH), I am pleased to offer support for \n     H.R. 2915, the ``Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act''. \n     This legislation, if enacted, would help to identify mental \n     health and suicide prevention programs that are the most \n     effective and have the best outcomes among women veterans and \n     would require that the results be reported to both the Senate \n     and House Veterans Committees.\n       The recent data that has been published is deeply \n     troubling. The data suggests that the suicide rate among \n     women veterans is approximately six times higher than that of \n     women who did not serve in the military.\n       While the Department of Veterans Affairs is examining why \n     the suicide rate among women veterans is so much higher and \n     how a history of Military Sexual Trauma may be one of the \n     contributing factors, we as a nation must devote the time and \n     resources to support these women who served our country in \n     uniform.\n       MOPH requests that you bring this legislation before your \n     committee as soon as possible so that America's women \n     veterans understand that this issue will be given a high \n     priority and that their service is appreciated.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Robert Puskar,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, again, I wish to thank my colleagues, Ms. \nBrownley and Ms. Sinema, for bringing the issues surrounding the \nprevention of female suicides in the military to our attention.\n  I urge passage of this very important bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nFemale Veteran Suicide Prevention Act (H.R. 2915).\n  The VA estimates that 22 veterans take their own lives each day, or \nover 8,000 per year--more than have been killed in action since 9/11. \nThe incidence of suicide among our veteran population is stunning, \ntragic beyond words, and simply unacceptable.\n  Too many veterans have returned from fighting our enemies overseas to \nfighting for their lives at home. As the son of a WW2 combat veteran, I \nhave witnessed the residual wounds of war, the struggle to cope with \nthe post-traumatic stress that can continue for decades and the pain \nthat a lack of access to services can cause for veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  Recognizing this great, unmet need, Congress recently enacted the \nbipartisan ``Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) \nAct,'' legislation targeting the gaps in the VA's mental health and \nsuicide prevention efforts. Among other provisions, the law requires \nannual, independent third party evaluations of the effectiveness of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' (VA) programs and establishes best \npractices for caring for at-risk veterans.\n  While the Clay Hunt Act is a comprehensive and well-designed law--I \ncosponsored and voted for it twice--there is one area where \nimprovements could be made to maximize its impact and better assist one \ngroup of veterans: female veterans.\n  As the House Veterans' Affairs Committee report states: In 2014, the \nVA released an update to the survey and found increases in the suicide \nrate in female users of the VA health care system. Female veterans \ncommit suicide at nearly six times the rate of other women and that \nwomen veterans are five times more likely to commit suicide than male \nveterans. Yet the VA's research focuses primarily on men and little is \nknown about the complex causes and factors that are driving the suicide \nrate among females who have served.\n  The bill we are voting on today offers a modest but important step to \nenhance our understanding of, and hopefully help remedy, these \nstaggering numbers. Specifically, H.R. 2915 directs the VA to identify \nmental health care and suicide prevention programs that are most \neffective and have the highest satisfaction rates among women veterans.\n  We as a nation have a duty and obligation to repay the debt we owe to \nthose who have fought in defense of our nation and our ideals. This \nbill helps ensure we better address the physical and emotional wounds \nof all veterans and I urge all members to support it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a proud cosponsor I rise in strong \nsupport of H.R. 2915, the ``Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act,'' \nwhich directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to implement mental \nhealth care and suicide prevention programs and identify metrics that \nare effective in reducing the incidence of suicide among female \nveterans.\n  Over the last decade suicide has become a major issue for the \nmilitary, but the research has been predominantly focused on men and \ntoo much remains unknown about the cause and frequency of suicide among \nfemale veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, several recent studies show that, unfortunately, female \nmilitary veterans commit suicide at nearly 6 times the rate of other \nwomen.\n  The suicide rate among female veterans is so high that it approaches \nthat of their male counterparts, a finding that surprises researchers \nbecause men generally are far more likely than women to commit suicide.\n  The highest rates of suicide are found among young female veterans, \nages 18-29, who are 12 times more likely to commit suicide as their \ncivilian counterparts.\n  This is heart breaking, but perhaps not unexpected, since reports \nindicate that 10% of women serving on active duty are victims of rape \nand another 13% were subjected to other unwanted sexual contact.\n  Mr. Speaker, in every other age group, including women who served as \nfar back as the 1950s, suicide rates for female veterans are between 4 \nand 8 times higher than that of their civilian counterparts.\n  These trends are so disturbing that it has earned the sobriquet from \nthe Houston Chronicle as ``The Silent National Epidemic.''\n  The Texas Department of State Health Services lists a decedent's \nmilitary experience in his or her death record, regardless of whether \nthe deceased was serving in the armed forces at time of death.\n  While it is not clear what is driving the rates of female veteran \nsuicides, the consistency across age groups suggests that a \nstatistically significant correlation exists between gender and \nmilitary service but the sad truth is that we lack sufficient data to \ngenerate externally valid inferences about causation.\n\n[[Page H633]]\n\n  In the general population, women attempt suicide more often than men \nbut succeed less because women usually use pills or other methods that \nare less lethal than firearms.\n  Female veterans, however, are more likely than other women to possess \nfirearms, and more likely to use a firearm to commit suicide (40% \ncompared to 34% of civilian women).\n  H.R. 2915 is intended to make progress in identifying the causes and \nreducing the incidences of suicide by female veterans.\n  The bravery and devotion of female veterans, who have provided heroic \nservice to our nation, often at great personal costs, is unquestioned.\n  We owe it to them to be there when they need our help just as they \nwere there to answer the call when their country needed them.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 2915, the \n``Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2915, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to identify mental health care and suicide prevention programs \nand metrics that are effective in treating women veterans as part of \nthe evaluation of such programs by the Secretary, and for other \npurposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H633-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H633-H634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ILLIANA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PROPERTY \n                               CONVEYANCE\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to add extraneous material on H.R. 3262.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Louisiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3262.\n  This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to convey \nproperty on the VA Illiana Health Care System campus in Danville, \nIllinois, to the Danville Area Community College.\n  Authorizing this conveyance would allow the VA to dispose of a vacant \nbuilding for which it has no intended future use and is costly to \nmaintain.\n  It would also allow the Department to straighten their property line, \nsubsequently shortening the amount of fencing that is required to \nsecure the safety of the medical center campus.\n  H.R. 3262 is sponsored by my friend and colleague from Illinois, \nCongressman John Shimkus, and I thank him for his leadership in \nsponsoring and advancing this legislation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3262.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3262 authorizes the VA to convey to the Danville \nArea Community College of Danville, Illinois, what is known as Building \nNumber 48, which is part of the VA Illiana Health Care System.\n  In return, the college will convey back to the VA certain lands near \nthe college library building.\n  We do not have any issues with the legislation, and I urge its \npassage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus).\n  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it does take an act of Congress to transfer \nlands and buildings, and that is kind of what we are doing here today, \nso I rise in support of this bill.\n  It is a very simple bill that is going to benefit the VA there in \nDanville, but also the local community with the Danville Area Community \nCollege.\n  Danville, Illinois, is a small town that has been home to some big \nnames. Dick Van Dyke called Danville home in his childhood. Speaker Joe \nCannon, a name we all know in Congress, was from Danville. Today, \nDanville is home to the VA Illiana Health Care System and the Danville \nArea Community College, commonly known as DACC.\n  DACC's president, Dr. Alice Jacobs, is an exceptional leader who has \ndedicated 45 years to higher education, including the last 16 years \nleading DACC. She has recently announced her retirement in the coming \nyear, and I thank her for her dedicated service to the students and the \ncommunity of Danville and wish her the best in the future.\n  The VA and DACC are an excellent example of how two institutions can \nwork in cooperation to serve our veterans. The location of the VA \nhospital adjacent to the community college campus allows our veterans \nreturning home to seek their medical care and help with benefits, while \nthe college provides the opportunity for educational and training \nexperiences that can help them transition into civilian life.\n  However, when the property lines were drawn between these two fine \ninstitutions, it wasn't in a straight line. Today, that has created a \nchallenge as the VA explores the option of building a security fence \nalong its boundary. Building that fence along the existing property \nlines will be more expensive. My bill, H.R. 3262, solves this problem \nby swapping two small parcels of land that both the VA and DACC have \nagreed to, creating a straight fence line.\n  Swapping these parcels is beneficial for the local community as well. \nIn exchange for the land it gives up, DACC will receive a parcel of \nland with a historic, century-old Carnegie Library. This building has \nbecome so deteriorated and expensive to maintain that the VA has \nstopped using it. Now the building sits vacant while the VA still pays \nfor basic maintenance and utilities. In its testimony to the House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee's Health Subcommittee, the VA stated that \ndisposing of this building would save an estimated $98,000 over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Danville and DACC see great potential for the building. Through the \ngenerosity of a private donor, DACC plans\n\n[[Page H634]]\n\nto transform the old library into a cultural center, providing the \nlocal treasure. Swapping these parcels of land is a win for the VA, \nsaving money on the construction of the fence and maintenance of an \nunused building, and a win for Danville, providing the community with a \nhistorically significant location to host a valuable cultural \nattraction.\n  H.R. 3262 is a simple, win-win bill for all parties involved.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member Brown for \ntheir support in moving this bill, along with the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee staff for their work in getting the bill to the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3262.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3262.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 3262.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was working in New York City in the fall of 2001 when \nterrorists tore a hole in our skyline and nearly 3,000 Americans lost \ntheir lives. Like many others, I lost people that I knew. For many, \nthey lost their dearest loved ones--their soulmate, mother, father, \nbrother, sister, children, child, friend.\n  All of us were moved by stories of heroism that followed that event--\nhundreds of firefighters and police and other first responders who gave \ntheir own lives to save others.\n  In the months that followed, I remember coming around that site every \nmorning as I went to work because I couldn't take the tunnel anymore. \nIt was closed. I would take the ferry from New York to New Jersey. We \nwould come around the tip of Manhattan. Every morning as we passed the \nWorld Trade Center site, a hush would fall on that ferry boat, and \npeople would ponder what happened there. That went on as autumn turned \ninto winter and winter turned into spring, month after month, as we \nwatched the seemingly endless restoration of that tragic site.\n  Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2011--10 years later--the National \nSeptember 11 Memorial opened. It was erected to remember those who \nfell, to recognize the endurance of the survivors, to honor the bravery \nof those who risked their lives, and often lost their lives, to save \nothers, and, above all, to remember the power of our free Nation to \novercome evil with good. It stands as a reminder to every generation \nthat we must never forget and we must never falter.\n  Mr. Speaker, private citizens with deep concern erected that \nmemorial. I applaud them for their good work. But now it is our part to \npreserve and protect this hallowed ground and to answer this national \ntragedy with national support. The National 9/11 Memorial at the World \nTrade Center Act recognizes this site as a national memorial. It \nprovides for funding for security and operations.\n  I want to thank the many who have endorsed this bill. Eighty-two \nMembers of this Chamber have cosponsored it. Police organizations have \ngotten behind it, including the National Association of Police \nOrganizations and the Fraternal Order of Police, veterans \norganizations, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Vets of America, \nGovernor Chris Christie of New Jersey, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New \nYork, and, most importantly, nearly a dozen family and friend support \ngroups of those that were most deeply impacted by 9/11.\n  Private donors and concerned citizens have done their part at this \nsite, and they continue to. But now it is our solemn duty, I believe, \nto honor the fallen and to protect the living.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the National 9/11 Memorial at the World \nTrade Center Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H635]]\n\n  This bill, as we know, designates the 9/11 Memorial at the World \nTrade Center as the National September 11 Memorial and authorizes a \ngrant program of up to $25 million per year for the next 7 years to \nsupport the operation and the maintenance of the memorial.\n  The bill was amended at markup to make the grant program available to \nother September 11 memorials located in the United States. Money for \nthe grant program will be subject to appropriation and come out of the \noverall budget of the Department of Interior.\n  I want to thank and congratulate my colleague from New York, \nRepresentative Nadler, as the lead Democratic cosponsor. He has \ndiligently guided this bill through the legislative process. It is \nbecause of his hard work and advocacy that it has come this far.\n  September 11 both rattled and united this country like few other \nevents in our history. We still live with the repercussions, and the \nmemorial is a fitting tribute and a solemn reminder.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National 9/\n11 Memorial at the World Trade Center Act.\n  The events of September 11 continue to stir emotions for Americans \nwhen we think about that day's tragic losses, remarkable acts of \nbravery, and the stark reminders that life is precious and evil is \nreal.\n  As a Nation, we have pledged to ``Never Forget'' what happened on \nSeptember 11, and today, by passing this legislation, we can put our \nactions behind that sentiment.\n  2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and the 15th \nanniversary of 9/11. Just as the USS Arizona provides a place for \nfuture generations to understand where--and more importantly how and \nwhy--we were attacked in 1941, the National September 11 Memorial gives \nAmericans a place to understand the tragedy of that day and ongoing \nsacrifices of the United States Armed Forces. Indeed, December 7 and \nSeptember 11 are now two dates that will live in infamy.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  I thank my colleague, Tom MacArthur, for introducing this \nlegislation, and I thank everyone from the National September 11th \nMemorial and Museum for all of their hard work.\n  I have been to the Memorial and have felt the incredibly emotional \neffect it has had on each visitor. Unfortunately, many of our enemies \nsee this symbol of our Nation's strength and resolve as a target, and, \nas such, the Memorial requires a high level of security in order to \nkeep its over 6 million annual visitors safe. This legislation ensures \nthe Memorial will receive the support it needs to provide a safe \nexperience for every visitor who passes through, whether he be His \nHoliness, Pope Francis, or whether he be the young schoolchild who was \nnot yet been born on September 11, 2001.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize a very special person, Rob \nO'Neill, a former member of SEAL Team 6, who is best known for his \nactions in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The 9/11 Memorial has \na special place in his heart, and he has been a strong advocate for \nthis bill. He has told me and others that the site is important to him \nand to his fellow special operators. It helps signify the cause for \nwhich they were fighting. In fact, the shirt he wore on the mission is \non display at the museum, along with other artifacts from 9/11 and from \nthe many years since, chronicling how Americans have pulled together to \nsupport each other, to secure our Nation, and to re-dedicate ourselves \nto liberty and justice. So I thank Mr. O'Neill for his service and for \nhis sacrifice.\n  Once again, I convey my support for this bill, and I encourage all of \nmy colleagues to pass the 9/11 Memorial Act.\n  I thank Tricia Evans and Ian Foley, who are on my staff, for their \nhard work on this bill.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not extend to \nRepresentative MacArthur my appreciation for his leadership and for \nbringing the bill to this point as well.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York \n(Mr. Nadler), whom I thank for his leadership and hard work in getting \nthis bill to this point.\n  Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, more than 14 years ago, two jet planes were deliberately \ncrashed into the World Trade Center--killing thousands of innocent \npeople. A third plane slammed into the Pentagon, and a fourth plane, \nlikely destined for this very Capitol complex in which we now stand, \nwas brought down by a group of courageous passengers in a field in \nShanksville, Pennsylvania.\n  As I do today, I represented Ground Zero--the World Trade Center \narea--on September 11, 2001. In the hours immediately after the attack, \nI left Washington and took the last train back to my home in New York. \nI will never forget the moment I first saw the ravaged skyline of Lower \nManhattan from the train windows. Normally, on the train, while going \nbetween Philadelphia and New York, I would look to see the first \nglimpse I could catch of the Twin Towers. Now what you could see were \nnot the Twin Towers but long, tall, billowing clouds of smoke that were \ngoing straight up and then were stretching down the Jersey Shore. The \nTwin Towers had been replaced by the brutal glow of raging fires and of \nblack, billowing smoke.\n  The train that left at 10 o'clock arrived at 6 p.m. We had been held \nup in Baltimore while they walked the tracks, looking for bombs. Coming \nout of Penn Station at 6 o'clock was like a scene from the movie ``On \nthe Beach'' for those who remember that movie. Nothing was moving. The \ncity at 33rd Street and Eighth Avenue seemed completely empty--no \npeople, no cars, no buses. There was nothing moving as if it were \ncompletely depopulated. To get home, I had to call a friend to come \npick me up.\n  When I went down to the World Trade Center the next morning, the \nscene was absolutely horrible. There was fire, smoke, debris, twisted \nmetal, human remains--total devastation. Yet, even then, there were \nsigns of hope. Firefighters, police, Emergency Medical Technicians, \nironworkers, and construction workers of all types rushed to Ground \nZero from around the country to offer their help. Messages of support \nand comfort flooded in from all 50 States. The American people were \nunited and determined to help New York get back on its feet. The attack \nmay have occurred in my district, but it was an attack on our Nation as \na whole, and we all recognized that.\n  In the years since the attacks, America has acted as a Nation to help \nrebuild New York and to support the responders, survivors, and families \nof the victims. Last year, Congress reauthorized the James Zadroga 9/11 \nHealth and Compensation Act so as to provide health care and support \nthe 33,000 responders and survivors who now live in all 50 States and \nin 429 congressional districts. By passing a permanent health program \nand reauthorizing the Victim Compensation Fund, Congress provided peace \nof mind for tens of thousands of brave Americans.\n  In addition to making our responders and survivors whole, Congress \ninvested billions of dollars to help rebuild Lower Manhattan. One World \nTrade Center now fills the hole that was left in our skyline when the \ntowers fell, and businesses that were shuttered after the attack are \nreopened and are thriving. In what was once the shadow of the towers, \nthere now stands a comprehensive museum that is dedicated to sharing \nthe stories of September 11th and the bravery of those who risked \neverything to protect their fellow Americans on that day and on the \ndays following.\n  In place of the smoking hole that Congressman MacArthur and I saw day \nafter day in Lower Manhattan, there now exists a somber and inspiring \nmemorial. It is a site of remembrance and hope--a place for every \nAmerican to come and reflect as to what happened on that September \nmorning and to renew our promise to never forget the events of that \nday. It is a national memorial for a national tragedy.\n  That is why I am pleased to cosponsor the legislation, introduced by \nmy colleague from New Jersey, to provide Federal recognition and \nsupport for the memorial. This legislation will help ensure the \nmemorial continues to provide a sacred and inspiring spot for \ngenerations to come.\n\n[[Page H636]]\n\n  I appreciate the bipartisan support from the members of the Natural \nResources Committee and from the House leadership in bringing this bill \nto the floor today. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nHouse Appropriations Committee every year to ensure that the National \n9/11 Memorial and Museum receives appropriate levels of funding. I will \nalso work with my colleagues to maintain open communications with the \nDepartment of the Interior to ensure the money is spent wisely and \nachieves our shared goal of ensuring the memorial remains a spot of \nreflection and peace and is accessible to millions of visitors every \nday.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and provide the recognition \nand support this memorial deserves.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge Representative Nadler, and \nI thank him for his support in this process.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan).\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago this September 11th, our \ncountry suffered the most deadly and devastating attack since its \nbirth. Terrorists chose the Twin Towers because they stood proud and \nthey stood tall. They stood as symbols of the raw power of people free \nto pursue their dreams, to live their values, and to practice their \nfaiths.\n  When the towers fell, they took Americans from every corner of our \nNation; and when the President stood atop a fire engine and spoke \nthrough a bullhorn to console a broken Nation, he spoke to every man, \nwoman, and child in our United States who was suffering and was \nsaddened by an unimaginable act of hate. Heroes from all over the \ncountry came to Lower Manhattan to sift through the rubble and pick up \nthe pieces. It was a site of national tragedy, a site of national \nheroism, and it must also be the site of a national memorial. It is \nonly fitting that the 9/11 Memorial receives proper funding just like \nevery other national memorial. It is sacred ground, and it must be \nmaintained accordingly. Also, annual security costs run into the \nmillions of dollars as the site remains a top terrorist target.\n  Mr. Speaker, terrorists may have attacked our country at three \nlocations that day, but they also attacked the spirit inside all of us. \nI encourage every Member of this body to vote for this legislation and \nto visit the 9/11 Memorial and Museum to see what I and Representative \nNadler see every day.\n  I thank Representative MacArthur for introducing this legislation, \nand I again thank--always--the heroes of that fateful day.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3036, the National 9/11 \nMemorial at the World Trade Center Act, which was introduced by my \nfriends Congressmen Tom MacArthur and Jerry Nadler--two sentinels of \nAmericans' liberty and freedom.\n  President Bush traveled to the site with Democrats and Republicans. I \nhave never seen in my experience here no other effort close to it of \nhow we were united. We accomplished so much when we were united, and we \nlearned to respect each other even more. On that day, our lives, our \ncountry, and the world changed forever. In the aftermath, Americans \ncame together for a common purpose--to rescue, to rebuild, and to \nremember those we had lost--friends and neighbors, many of them. They \nwere from all faiths, all persuasions.\n  This memorial and the museum at the World Trade Center were \nconstructed so that we would never forget those brothers and sisters, \nchildren and parents, cousins and colleagues. We called them that at \nthe time; yet the further we get from 9/11 we very seldom refer to \n``sisters'' and ``brothers'' except for our relatives and our brave \nfirst responders who perished during one of the darkest moments in our \nNation's history.\n  Ensuring this Memorial site will be here for years to come will give \nmillions of people around the world the opportunity to pay tribute to \nthose who were lost and to find inspiration in how our Nation has \nrecovered. As a proud supporter of our National Park Service, I know it \nwill make sure the site remains a sacred place of healing and of hope \nas a national memorial.\n  As a result, Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of H.R. 3036 in \norder to solidify the memorial's standing, to honor the memories of \nthose we lost, and to ensure future generations can learn about that \ntragic day.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 11\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Stefanik).\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3036, the 9/11 \nMemorial Act.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. MacArthur, for his leadership on this \nincredibly important issue.\n  Fifteen years ago on September 11th, every American will remember \nwhere he was when the horrifying news broke of these terrorist attacks. \nMr. Speaker, as the youngest Member currently serving in Congress, I \nwas in my high school English class when the horrible news was shared \nwith my classmates from our teacher. I remember my schoolmates, crying, \nwho couldn't get ahold of their older siblings, of their aunts and \nuncles, of their cousins who worked in the World Trade Center.\n  On that horrifying day when terrorists attacked our Nation, we also \nsaw true acts of heroism. As the workers of the World Trade Center were \nrunning out to escape, our first responders were running up the stairs \nto save their fellow Americans. Strangers helped fellow strangers \nescape the buildings. New Yorkers helped others walk miles home to get \nto their families.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  New Yorkers will never forget the horrifying attacks. This Nation \nwill never forget these horrifying attacks. The 9/11 memorial is truly \nhallowed ground.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage \nof this legislation.\n  This legislation, this 9/11 National Memorial, no matter what corner \nof this great Nation of ours we are from, we have a shared legacy here. \nThat shared legacy is about sacrifice, heroism, and indeed loss as \nwell.\n  We have a shared future from this memorial about determination, \nresilience, and the very nature of this Nation to be hopeful and to \nlook forward. To one another, we have a shared responsibility. This \nmemorial will remind us of that and keep that thought very much alive \nin all of us.\n  Again, let me congratulate and thank the sponsors of the legislation, \nMr. Nadler and Mr. MacArthur, for their fine work and for bringing this \nbefore us today.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my \ncolleagues. Events like 9/11--and the world that it has brought us \ninto--demand that we come together, and I am glad that we have done \nthat on this bill. We have come together to honor the fallen and to \nprotect the living.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in making this the voice of this Chamber \nas we vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of \nH.R. 3036, The National 9/11 Memorial at the World Trade Center Act, \nand thank my colleagues Reps. MacArthur and Nadler for their leadership \nto bring this bill to the House floor.\n  In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress has come \ntogether to rebuild New York and the Pentagon and support the \nresponders, survivors, and families of the victims. Last year, we \nreauthorized the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, making \nthe health care program essential permanent and extending the Victims \nCompensation Fund for an additional five years, with full funding.\n  As a New Yorker, the memory of 9/11 continues to evoke pain and \nsorrow--and the Memorial at Ground Zero stirs these emotions like no \nother place. The dramatic reflecting pools are a sanctuary of calm \nwithin the bustle of lower Manhattan and a moving tribute to the \nthousands of innocent Americans lost in the attacks.\n  This bill affirms our commitment to remember those lost on 9/11 by \ndesignating the site\n\n[[Page H637]]\n\na national memorial and enabling the memorial to access the federal \nsupport it needs for security and maintenance. The 9/11 Memorial is now \namong New York's most popular sites, with over 23 million visitors \nsince it opened in 2011. This designation will ensure that the site \ncontinues to welcome everyone who comes to remember those we have lost.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House \nCommittee on Homeland Security and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, I rise in support of H.R. 3036, the ``National 9/11 \nMemorial at the World Trade Center Act.''\n  This bill will designate the National September 11 Memorial located \nat the World Trade Center site in New York City, New York, as a \nnational memorial.\n  H.R. 3036 authorizes the Secretary of Interior to award a grant in an \namount not to exceed $25 million each fiscal year to the National \nSeptember 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation \nfor the operation and maintenance of the memorial.\n  Finally, the bill requires the National September 11 Memorial and \nMuseum to report annually to the Interior Secretary and Congress on (1) \nthe amount of grant funds expended; (2) the purpose for which the funds \nwere used; and (3) any other information the Secretary may require.\n  As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security since its \ncreation, and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism and Homeland Security, I strongly support this resolution.\n  I will never forget September 11, 2001, a day on which I stood on the \nEast Front steps of the Capitol on September 11, along with 150 Members \nof the House of Representatives, singing ``God Bless America.''\n  September 11, 2001 remains a tragedy that defines our Nation's \nhistory since that fateful day for many reasons.\n  This year marks the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks that \nkilled 2,977 men, women, and children.\n  At the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan, 2,753 people were \nkilled when hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines \nFlight 175 were intentionally crashed in the North and South towers.\n  Of those who perished during the initial attacks and the subsequent \ncollapses of the towers, 343 were New York City firefighters, another \n23 were New York City police officers and 37 others were officers at \nthe Port Authority.\n  The victims ranged in age from two to 85 years.\n  At the Pentagon in Washington, 184 people were killed when hijacked \nAmerican Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the building.\n  Near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, 40 passengers and crew members aboard \nUnited Airlines Flight 93 died when the plane crashed into a field.\n  It is believed that the hijackers crashed the plane in that location, \nrather than their unknown target, after the passengers and crew \nattempted to retake control of the flight.\n  The act of those passengers to stop the hijackers likely saved the \nlives of thousands of their fellow Americans that day.\n  The heroic work done by the first responders who rushed into the \nburning Twin Towers and the Pentagon saved lives.\n  We will forever remember the first responders who lost their lives in \nthe line of duty on September 11.\n  This Nation shall forever be grateful for the selfless sacrifice \nshown that day.\n  That is why the National September 11 Memorial and Museum is so \nimportant.\n  The National September 11 Memorial at the World Trade Center \nremembers and honors the thousands of innocent lives lost during the \nSeptember 11th attacks, and the attacks of February 26, 1993.\n  This Memorial is a testament to the triumph of human dignity over \nhuman depravity and affirms an unwavering commitment to the fundamental \nvalue of human life.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3036, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H637-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H637-H638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    JOHN H.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 890) to correct the boundaries of the John H. Chafee Coastal \nBarrier Resources System Unit P16, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF JOHN H. CHAFEE COASTAL BARRIER \n                   RESOURCES SYSTEM MAP.\n\n       (a) In General.--The maps subtitled ``Cape Romano Unit P15, \n     Tigertail Unit FL-63P'' and ``Keewaydin Island Unit P16'' \n     included in the set of maps entitled ``Coastal Barrier \n     Resources System'' referred to in section 4(a) of the Coastal \n     Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(a)) and relating to \n     certain John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System units \n     in Florida are hereby replaced by other maps relating to the \n     units subtitled ``Cape Romano Unit P15/P15P'', ``Keewaydin \n     Island Unit P16/P16P, Tigertail Unit FL-63P'', and \n     ``Keewaydin Island Unit P16/P16P'', respectively, and dated \n     April 10, 2015.\n       (b) Availability.--The Secretary of the Interior shall keep \n     the replacement maps referred to in subsection (a) on file \n     and available for inspection in accordance with section 4(b) \n     of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(b)).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. MacArthur) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Grijalva) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This bipartisan bill corrects Coastal Barrier Resources System \nboundary errors in Collier County, Florida. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, which administers the coastal barriers system program, has \nacknowledged the need to correct these errors and has since remapped \nthe area.\n  The agency sent the new maps to the Congress, which has the sole \nauthority to change the boundaries and codify the correct maps in this \ncase. This is what the bill, as amended, achieves. I urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, or CBRA, requires the \nidentification of hazardous areas on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and \nmakes Federal subsidies off limits to people who choose to develop \nthese lands.\n  Particularly in this time of rising sea levels and increased storm \nsurge brought on by global warming, CBRA is critical to protecting \nAmerican taxpayers and sensitive coastal ecosystems.\n  H.R. 890 would adjust the boundaries of several Coastal Barrier \nResources System units in Florida. These changes have been carefully \nmapped by the Fish and Wildlife Service and reflect improvements in \ntechnology that have allowed us to show with great accuracy which \nparcels of land do and do not constitute coastal barrier resources \nunder the law.\n  As a result, numerous properties that were originally included by \nmistake will be removed, and other properties that have been identified \nas at risk will be included. These changes to the CBRS are protective \nof private property rights, the environment, and the taxpayers.\n  I urge support of this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, having no other Members to address this legislation on \nmy side, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Clawson).\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to \npresent H.R. 890, which adopts new Coastal Barrier Resources System \nmaps for the southern part of my district, Florida 19, in southwest \nCollier County, Florida.\n\n[[Page H638]]\n\n  A special thanks to my fellow Members--Don Beyer, Mario Diaz-Balart, \nand Chairman Rob Bishop--for their support and helping me push this \nthrough. I urge support of the passage.\n  On a personal note, it has been my lifelong concern for the \nenvironment and involvement in water quality issues in my hometown of \nBonita Springs, Florida, that led me to Congress on an unknowing path \nreally. So introducing this bill, to me, today is really special and \npersonal.\n  A special note of thanks to those who helped--so many folks--\nparticularly Bob and Jack for their perseverance. Perseverance paid \noff. Also, I thank Cherie for her abiding inspiration and to Yodi.\n  The CBRS was created by Congress with the 1982 Coastal Barrier \nResources Act. This initiative preserves the ecological integrity of \ncoastal areas while still protecting private property rights. This \ninitiative preserves the ecological integrity of coastal areas that \nserve as important barriers against wind and tidal forces caused by \ncoastal storms, and reduces further development in these sensitive \nareas. In other words, it creates a perpetual protected area for our \nwonderful Gulf wildlife.\n  These new maps have passed public review, OMB review, and have been \nreleased by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  This is the southern part of my district. The new maps correct errors \nfrom 40 years ago, which seriously hurt some 1,600 of our constituents \nand hurt their access to flood insurance, home mortgages, and \nrefinancing.\n  These new maps also add 17,000 acres in perpetuity to CBRS, 17,000 \nacres principally in this zone right here, between Naples and Marco \nIsland and also a little bit south. Keewaydin Island--that you see \nright here, just south of Naples--and Cape Romano are part of the \npristine, picturesque Ten Thousand Islands chain that begins 20 miles \nof Naples. These newly preserved areas highlighted on these charts \ncover five geographical units, part of now over 40,000 continuous acres \nthat will be permanently protected.\n  This is government doing something right for all stakeholders and for \nall the generations that will follow us.\n  H.R. 890, protecting 15 miles of natural coastal barriers, is sound \neconomics. It is a piece of what needs to be done toward growing \nsouthwest Florida's multibillion dollar private and commercial real \nestate values and south Florida's tourism industry, which brings in \nover 5 million visitors to my district. It also employs one out of \nevery five people in the local workforce.\n  I am proud to report that this bill will create the largest grouping \nof CBRS units nationwide, protecting our unique Florida Everglades and \necosystem, aquatic plants and animals, other wildlife, and also \nprotecting private properties from storms and floods.\n  Keewaydin Island right here, just south of Naples, is one of the \nlargest, if not the largest, sea turtle nesting areas in Florida and in \nthe United States. Depending on the time of year, these are the nests \nthat we see throughout our district on the beach. Also in this area, we \nsee lots of the beautiful spoonbill that you can't find in too many \ndifferent places.\n\n  The Florida Everglades are a natural treasure. It is home to wildlife \nand plants that are unique in our Nation: fish, tortoises, reptiles, \nand insects. It is our duty to protect these species. This bill will \nhave a permanent, positive impact on preserving this fragile ecological \narea and quality of life.\n  Three years ago, I waded into the Gulf of Mexico with my folks. They \nurged me to get involved in local politics, hoping that I could have \njust a small impact and make a small, positive difference in the health \nof the waters of southwest Florida. My mom is gone now, but she always \nhoped that a moment like this would come.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this is a moment that we can \naccomplish something positive for our constituents, positive for our \neconomy, and positive for our waters of south Florida. I am very \nappreciative to have a small role, and I acknowledge that we have so \nmuch more to do to conserve the beauty of southwest Florida for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H639]]\n\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3894, Talia's law, which would \nrequire military and Department of Defense civilian personnel working \non a military installation to report instances of child abuse and \nneglect to State Child Protective Services in addition to their \ndesignated Department of Defense point of contact.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Our Nation is extremely proud of our military servicemembers and the \nsacrifices they endure to protect our national security. Members of our \nmilitary's Active Duty Reserve component and the National Guard knit \nthe blanket of freedom to keep us safe from those who wish to do us \nharm.\n  Standing beside our Nation's brave servicemembers are the spouses and \nchildren who bear constant challenges and maintain resiliency \nthroughout the continuous moves and the strain deployments incur on \nfamilies.\n  There are approximately 2 million children with one or both parents \nwho serve in the U.S. military, and the support role these children \nfulfill is beyond significant and should be commended. Our Nation's \nmilitary dependents face greater academic challenges and emotional \nstress due to relocation and attending multiple schools.\n  It is difficult enough growing up and enduring adolescence without \nhaving to move every couple of years, face new surroundings, make new \nfriends, and all the while having a mother or father serving our Nation \nin harm's way.\n  Military children must rely on their loved ones, family, friends, and \ntheir parents to get through the struggles that only a military \nhousehold can understand.\n  However, it is when those individuals, those adults who these \nchildren trust the most, hurt them in any way. It is inexcusable. Our \nchildren are truly our Nation's future, and anyone who abuses or \nneglects a child is appalling and must be held accountable.\n  That is why I stand here today in support of H.R. 3894, an imperative \npiece of legislation which would require a childcare provider located \non a DOD installation to report any signs of child abuse or neglect \ndirectly to Child Protective Services and the provider's chain of \ncommand.\n  Not only does this bill enforce the reporting procedure, but it also \nrequires those individuals who work with children on an installation \nreceive the necessary training to recognize child abuse as well as \nfully understand the reporting requirements.\n  I applaud my Committee on Armed Services colleague and friend, Ms. \nGabbard, for her leadership on this issue and encourage the rest of my \nHouse colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In 2005, 5-year-old Talia Williams was beaten to death by her own \nfather, who was stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii at the time. \nTalia suffered through months and months of abuse from her father and \nher stepmother, which ultimately led to her death.\n  Why didn't someone do something? Why was this allowed to occur? Why \ndidn't someone take action to stop this horrific abuse that was visible \nto so many who knew Talia? There were multiple reports that were made \nto military officials, but when it came right down to it, nothing was \ndone to take Talia out of harm's way.\n  I am rising today to ask my colleagues to support my bill, H.R. 3894, \nTalia's Law, because more than 10 years after Talia's tragic death, the \nsame gaps in the military's reporting requirements that failed to \nprotect Talia remain unchanged. In fact, over the last decade, there \nhave been 29,000 cases of child abuse and neglect in military homes.\n  Now, outside of the military, in the civilian world, doctors, \npsychologists, social workers, teachers, or other professionals who \nwork closely with children are required to report any suspected cases \nof child abuse and neglect directly to that State's Child Protective \nServices.\n  But the military's reporting requirements do not require that direct \nreporting to State authorities. So reports of Talia's suspected abuse \nnever reached the Hawaii Child Protective Services. Instead, they \nstayed within the Army's chain of command.\n  Now, I know there were a lot of people around Talia who had good \nintentions and who were gravely concerned about the abuse that they \nwere seeing, but the fact remains that Talia was never removed from \nthis abusive environment.\n  To close this gap and fix this problem, Talia's Law requires the same \nprotections that exist for any other child, whether they are in a \nmilitary household or not. This bill requires immediate and direct \nreporting to State Child Protective Services in cases of suspected \nabuse and neglect.\n  I recently spoke to Talia's mother, Tarshia, who knows that this bill \nwill not bring Talia back, it cannot right the wrongs that failed to \nprotect Talia.\n  But what she does know and what she does hope is that the passage of \nthis bill will take an important step forward in helping to better \nprotect the thousands of other children in military families who may be \nfacing this same situation and get them the care and services that they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to honor Talia and all of \nour children in military families and support H.R. 3894.\n  I would also like to thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Ms. Stefanik) for her very thoughtful remarks on this and for \nchampioning Talia's Law to be able to help these children who are \nfacing numerous challenges and who deserve better than to have this \nkind of abuse.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nHawaii (Mr. Takai), my friend and colleague, the distinguished \ngentleman representing Hawaii's First Congressional District.\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in favor of a bill my friend and \ncolleague Tulsi Gabbard and I have introduced.\n  H.R. 3894, Talia's Law, gets its name from a 5-year-old girl named \nTalia Williams who was beaten to death at the hands of her father, an \nArmy soldier stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.\n  We in Hawaii and all across the country are so thankful for the \nsacrifices our servicemen and servicewomen make to protect our \nfreedoms, but we also have a duty to protect the most vulnerable among \nus, our children. In Hawaii, we call them our keiki.\n  As a father myself, I am proud to stand up for Talia's Law, which \nwould require prompt reporting of possible abuses not only to a \nmilitary supervisor, but also prompt reporting of possible abuse and \nneglect to the State's Child Protective Services. It would strengthen \nreporting requirements for these allegations and make sure that they \nare properly investigated.\n  I hope that, as we deliberate this bill, we also draw attention to \nthe fact that Congress can come together and should come together to \nprovide better access to resources for those in uniform suffering from \nwounds that may not be visible to the eyes.\n  I ask for the consideration of this bill and its urgent passage. \nThese children, our keiki, and all the victims of abuse and neglect \ncannot wait.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3984, \nlegislation requiring military and civilian personnel of the Department \nof Defense required by law to report suspected instances of child abuse \nand neglect to do so promptly and directly to State child protective \nservice agencies.\n  I support this legislation sponsored by Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard \nof Hawaii, a good friend and veterans of the Armed Services, because no \nchild should have to bear the pain and suffering of abuse or neglect \nalone.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reason this important legislation is needed is \nillustrated by the tragic and heart breaking case of Talia Williams, an \ninnocent and loving 5-year old girl who was beaten to death by her \nfather, an active-duty infantryman stationed in Hawaii.\n  After investigation and through subsequent legal proceedings, it came \nto light that before being murdered, precious Talia had suffered \nthrough months of torture and abuse by both her father and stepmother.\n  Even worse, Mr. Speaker, it was revealed that multiple federal \nemployees, including military police and workers at her on-base child\n\n[[Page H640]]\n\ncare facility, failed to report suspected signs of Talia's abuse.\n  But the shocking case of Talia Williams is not isolated; it is \nestimated that more than 29,000 children have been abused in military \nhomes over the past decade.\n  The system failed Talia Williams but it is not too late to save other \nchildren at risk by passing H.R. 3894.\n  Under current law, Family Advocacy Programs operated by the Armed \nForces are to identify individuals who are mandated to report known or \nsuspected cases of child abuse to designated ``points of contact,'' who \nthen are to conduct an assessment investigation into the reported abuse \nand to communicate with State child protective services agencies.\n  H.R. 3894 amends current law and requires DoD professionals who come \ninto contact with children such as physicians, psychologists, social \nworkers, and teachers to report suspected instances of abuse or neglect \ndirectly to the State child protective services agencies in addition to \nDefense Department points of contact or chain of command.\n  H.R. 3894 also requires these ``mandated reporters'' to receive \ntraining in accordance with state guidelines in order to improve their \nability to recognize evidence of child abuse and neglect and understand \nmandatory reporting requirements imposed by law.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is too late to save Talia Williams but out of the \nhorrific tragedy that claimed her life, it is possible to identify and \nsave other children from a similar fate.\n  H.R. 3894 will help ensure that instances of child abuse and neglect \nare recognized and reported immediately by empowering appropriate \nmilitary and civilian personnel in the Department of Defense with the \nskills and training need to recognize evidence of child abuse and \nneglect and to place on them an affirmative duty to report instances of \nsuspected abuse or neglect promptly and directly to child protective \nagencies.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3894.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3894.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H640-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last week, I visited Penn \nState University, which is located in Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District, for a discussion on the effect that invasive \nspecies are having on forests across our Commonwealth. I was joined by \nseveral experts in the field of entomology--from the university and \nfrom Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.\n  Among the insects discussed were the spotted lanternfly, the gypsy \nmoth, and the emerald ash borer. These experts discussed at length the \nchallenges each species presents as well as the ongoing efforts to \ncombat the devastating impact and spread.\n  As chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and \nForestry, I know that my State is not alone and that the effects of \nthese pests are being felt all across the Nation.\n  I applaud the research being done at Penn State University and by \nforesters and entomologists around the Nation. Research and applying \nthat science will go a long way in preventing these species from \nspreading further and causing more destruction on our forests.\n  I remain hopeful that we can all work together to ensure that our \nforests remain healthy, both ecologically and economically.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H641-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN HEROES COLA ACT\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, the House passed H.R. 677, \nthe American Heroes COLA Act, legislation I introduced with Dr. Abraham \nfrom Louisiana. This legislation will ensure that veterans receive \nautomatic cost-of-living increases annually based on the consumer price \nindex.\n  Unlike with Social Security, Congress must act each year to provide \nveterans with the COLA increases they need and deserve. Now, by \npermanently adjusting benefits to include cost-of-living increases, we \nare providing critical peace of mind to those who have so heroically \nserved our country.\n  Furthermore, this legislation includes two provisions to address the \nVA appeals problem, which currently has 440,000 claims backlogged. The \nfirst, authored by Congressman O'Rourke, creates a fully developed \nappeals pilot program. The second I introduced with Chairman Miller to \ncreate a task force to examine the appeals process and make \nrecommendations for improvements before the situation gets worse.\n  H.R. 677 and some of the other bills that we passed today take \nimportant steps towards ensuring that our veterans are able to get the \nbenefits they have earned and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H641-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MARIA KELLER AND ZAKRIA GHANI RECEIVE YOUTH VOLUNTEER AWARDS\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

It is estimated that 800,000 students have received books \nfrom the organization.\n  Zakria, a senior at Al-Amal School, was a finalist for raising \ncritical money for the victims of a devastating fire in Minneapolis. \nHis efforts resulted in raising $8,500 within one week after the fire \nin order to help the affected victims and residents.\n  Mr. Speaker, the work and service by these young people to serve and \nassist others should be inspiring to us all, and thanks to their \nactions, countless people have been helped.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor St. Elmo Brady. He was the \nfirst African American to obtain a Ph.D. degree in chemistry in the \nUnited States. He received a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of \nIllinois in 1916 for work done at the Noyes Laboratory. Dr. Brady was a \npioneer in the teaching of science at both Tuskegee University and at \nHoward University in Washington, D.C.\n  His research included work on determining the structure of organic \nacids, methods of determining properties of alkaloids and infrared \nspectroscopy. This later research resulted in the formation of the Fisk \nInfrared Spectroscopy Research Laboratory and the Fisk Infrared \nInstitute. In conjunction with faculty from the University of Illinois, \nDr. Brady also established a summer program in infrared spectroscopy, \nwhich was open to faculty from all colleges and universities.\n  Dr. Brady is just one of the many African American pioneering \nscientists whose work should be lifted up as the role model that it is, \nnot just during Black History Month, but all year round.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H641-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1900\n                     IMPORTANCE OF THE MOX FACILITY\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today in the President's \nbudget proposal, sadly, the President terminated funding to the Mixed \nOxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) at the Savannah River site. I am \ndisappointed the President has not acknowledged how crucial MOX is to \nenvironmental cleanup and promoting nonproliferation.\n  Support for MOX is bipartisan, as shown by former New Mexico Governor \nand Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, along with former Senator \nRichard Lugar. Both are experts who advocate the completion of the \nfacility. Today, MOX is 70 percent completed, and there is no viable \nalternative for eliminating plutonium. What is more, closing MOX would \nmake South Carolina and Georgia a permanent repository for nuclear \nwaste.\n  MOX is also critical to upholding our nonproliferation agreement with \nthe Russian Federation.\n  I am grateful for the leadership of Governor Nikki Haley along with \nAttorney General Alan Wilson, who have already filed a lawsuit against \nthe Department of Energy to enforce the law for South Carolina's \nagreement with the Federal Government.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  Thank you, Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill, for eliminating Osama bin Laden.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H641-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H641-H642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REHABILITATION RESEARCH IMPROVEMENT BILL\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN.

Before long, it could be an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile with a nuclear warhead headed for some American city.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not some wacky idea out of a Hollywood movie. On \nJanuary 6, the North Koreans tested a more advanced nuclear bomb that \ncould kill even more people than the nuclear bomb they already have. \nLast Saturday, North Korea conducted a rocket launch to try to develop \na ballistic missile that could hit the United States.\n  The North Koreans also support Hezbollah, work with Iran on missile \ndevelopment, hacked Sony Entertainment, kidnapped an American college \nstudent and put him in jail, and there is much more.\n  Mr. Speaker, North Korea is a rogue state lusting for international \nmischief.

Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Wear Something Red \nWednesday to bring back our girls.\n  Boko Haram is burning children alive.

The rest of Sani's family survived only to be \nviciously gunned down in front of him. Sani represents the millions of \nchildren and women who are being raped, kidnapped, mutilated, and \nkilled by the world's deadliest terrorist organization, Boko Haram.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate \nOkeechobee High School, home of the Fighting Brahmans of Okeechobee, \nFlorida, for receiving a Wilson Golden Football from the National \nFootball League to commemorate the 50th year of the Super Bowl.\n  As part of the nationwide Super Bowl 50 celebration, the NFL started \nthe Super Bowl High School honor roll program to acknowledge high \nschools and communities that have directly influenced Super Bowl \nhistory and impacted the game of football for the better. High schools \nacross the country were chosen to honor each player or head coach who \ngraduated from the school and was on an active Super Bowl roster.\n  Okeechobee High School was chosen because of its esteemed alumni, \nJimmie Jones, who played in both Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII with the \nDallas Cowboys. Interestingly, after the victory of Super Bowl XXVII, \nJimmie chose to be in Okeechobee for a parade rather than a parade \nthrough Dallas with his team. We are all proud to call him one of our \nown.\n  It is my honor to represent Okeechobee in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H642-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER CRISIS IN FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KAPTUR.

At this point, so many weeks \nafter the lead crisis was identified, to have no central medical team \nexamining those children is a sacrilege. To have no water buffalo \nsupplied by the National Guard with pressurized PVC tubing taking water \nto people's homes, rather than just this bottle delivery; to have no \nhot showers that are portable, which the military has, that they could \nput in the schools in that community, to me, was absolutely appalling.\n  I was told that the Governor of that State had not even met with the \npeople of the community. He had come in for a press conference. Is that \nwhat this is about?\n  I met children who had hemorrhages and ulcers from drinking that \nwater, who had black rashes all over their bodies with pus.\n  Our country has a responsibility to the citizens of this country. \nThere ought to be a central coordinator. If that Governor can't appoint \none, the President of the United States should. Those children and the \ncitizens of that city ought to be taken care of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H642-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CURTIS FOLTZ' RETIREMENT AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GEORGIA PORTS \n                               AUTHORITY\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. \nFortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to share a story with everyone \ntonight. Although I live in Nebraska, I keep an old family van here in \nWashington, D.C., which is particularly helpful when our children are \nvisiting.\n  On one particular occasion, the van was very messy. My children were \nsmaller then, and I had not had the time to clean it. I was actually \nparking the van in a downtown garage here in\n\n[[Page H643]]\n\nthe city, and somewhat embarrassingly, I handed the keys to the \nattendant and said to him: Sorry, I have five children.\n  He looked at me and smiled. He says: Oh, don't worry. I have seven \nchildren, and they are going to take care of me when I am old.\n  I looked back at him, and I also smiled. I said: You know what that \nis called? That is called social security.\n  He then said: I like that. Could I say that?\n  I said: You can say it all that you like.\n  Mr. Speaker, while we think of Social Security as that important \nretirement security program, which is so essential to so many people, I \nwant to take a moment to just explore a broader understanding of how we \nfind our security together as a people, as a Nation.\n  I want to re-imagine this term ``Social Security'' in a wider sense \nof the phrase, what it means to find belonging, protection, and mutual \nsupport. Ultimately, society depends upon a binding set of narratives \nand an agreement with one another about one fundamental fact: the \nagreement that we should care about each other, that we are committed \nto one another, and that we have a common vision.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, Americans are continuing to confront a number of \nlongstanding challenges to our country's well-being. Let's be honest. \nThere is widespread distrust of government, and the economy's capacity \nis sadly deepening a sense of division and further fracturing our \nsociety as more and more people seem to feel left out.\n  Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, our Nation still does have great character \nand great strength, found first and foremost in durable values that \nkeep us resilient with the ability to adapt and change, even in the \nmost turbulent of times. So although there is justifiable anxiety and \nanger at the present moment--in fact, they are a hallmark of the \npresent moment--Americans do desire a new settlement of both security \nand opportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, here is the dilemma: a constant focus on a Washington-\nbased solution offers a false sense of solidarity and is no substitute \nfor community. Technocratic management through centralized government \ncannot rekindle the vibrancy of our society. And far from healing our \nwounded culture, the government simply cannot fix everything that is \nwrong. Doing so, attempting to do so will simply recalculate winners \nand losers. This is especially true when America's political system \nsuffers from so much discord and dysfunction.\n  So here is the answer: a hopeful politics and a truly good society \nare ultimately relational. For instance, although we are not immune \nfrom harsher downward trends where I live, we have, in my State of \nNebraska, to some degree, I believe, safeguarded the importance of \ncommunity, the necessity and integrity of the family, and the quality \nof care for ourselves as well as those around us.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  I am proud of this fact, Mr. Speaker. I often refer to it as the \nNebraska model. Such social vibrancy reduces the necessity for \ngovernment intervention and actually creates happier outcomes.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Social Security program itself is so critical to \nprotecting the well-being of America's seniors. I believe strongly in \nthis program, as so many others do.\n  In fact, when I was a child, I received Social Security myself due to \nthe premature death of my father when I was 12 years old. It helped get \nthe family through. This is an important program for America's security \nand for peace of mind of so many of our elder citizens.\n  But I think a broader view of this concept, this ideal, of Social \nSecurity demands that we regrasp the ideals of community and \ninterdependency with one another. Proper progress in our Nation \nrecognizes that our individual liberty is not merely a license to do \nwhatever we want.\n  A hyper sense of individualism can obscure the foundational truth of \nour shared humanity, which longs for community. It inhibits the common \nendeavors necessary for advancing a brighter future together as a \nnation, as one people.\n  Liberty and, therefore, human happiness are inextricably intertwined \nwith our society, with our responsibility to one another, and that is \nwhat gives fullness to the meaning of Social Security.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/house-section/article/H643-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H643-H649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONTAMINATED WATER IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the cities of \nAmerica--at least many of the cities of America.\n  While I was waiting for the opportunity to speak to the House and \npeople of America, I went into the cloakroom and pulled out today's \nRoll Call, one of what we call the Hill rags. These are one of the \nnewspapers around the Hill.\n  It says ``Lead in the Water, Way Beyond Flint,'' and it talks about \nthe issue of contamination in our water supplies. Indeed, they are \nquite correct.\n  This would be one of maybe 20 different slides I could put up here. \nWhat do these cities of America have in common: Flint, Michigan; \nToledo, Ohio; Sebring, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Brick Township, New \nJersey; Washington, D.C.; Wayne County, North Carolina; Greenville, \nNorth Carolina; Lakehurst Acres, Maine; Chicago, Illinois; Porterville, \nCalifornia? The list goes on and on and on. These are cities that have \nor have had contaminated water in the last couple of years. Some of \nthese are ongoing.\n  We hear a lot of discussion about Flint, Michigan, and the tragedy of \nthe water supply in Flint, Michigan, the lead contamination, the 8,000 \nor 9,000 children who have been inflicted with lead poisoning, and the \nincredible, awful effect that that will have on the development of \ntheir brain and of their future.\n  This issue is one that we are becoming aware of. Actually, we have \nbeen aware of it for a long, long time. The problem is that we haven't \ndone anything about it or we have done very, very little about it.\n  Tonight we are going to talk about contaminated water in America, \nAmerica's cities and towns that are providing water that is not fit to \ndrink.\n  So what to do? Well, we are going to have to deal with the realities \nof 8,000 to 9,000 children, their development, the potential problems \nthat they face in their lives ahead. That will be basically dealing \nwith the fact that we had contaminated water in Flint, Michigan, and in \na host of other cities.\n  We can't live without water. The human body requires it. If you don't \nget it, you are going to die very, very quickly. The fact of the matter \nis I am not at all sure you can live with contaminated water.\n  That is the actual water that was available to residents of Flint, \nMichigan: yucky, yellow, contaminated, polluted water. Not just lead, \nbut yuck. Why would you want to drink that? Well, it is all you have. \nSo you don't want to, but you really don't have any choice. \nContaminated water, what to do?\n  Tonight we are going to discuss this issue. I guess one thing you can \ndo is what California did. In Porterville, California, when the wells \nwent dry, they brought a cattle water trough similar to what I have on \nmy ranch to provide water for my cattle. This water trough provided \nwater for the children of Porterville, California.\n  Now, there is a solution to the water crisis in California. \nPorterville isn't the only city or town in the San Joaquin Valley. In \nfact, there are dozens of towns in the San Joaquin Valley of \nCalifornia, the largest State, the richest State.\n  We like to think of California, my home State, as being ahead of \neverything. I guess we are ahead in providing cattle water troughs to \nprovide water for children in California. We ought to be ashamed.\n  What are we going to do about it? There are 435 people here in the \nHouse of Representatives, and I guess there is another 100 Senators \nacross the way, a President, and all the administration. What are we \ngoing to do about it? I guess we can look at our report card.\n\n[[Page H644]]\n\n  This is from the American Society of Civil Engineers. Let's see. The \n2013 report card for America's infrastructure: Aviation, D; bridges, C \nplus; dams, D; down here, schools, D; roads, railroads, Cs; water--oh, \nhere we are--water, a D.\n  We asked them about this. We said: Why a D?\n  They said: We would give them an F, but it is too much trouble to try \nto figure out how to do an F. So we just go to the lowest, which is D.\n  You don't get any lower than a D from the American Society of Civil \nEngineers. That is our report card in America, folks. It is not just \nwater. It is the entire infrastructure system.\n  You are wondering why. Why does that happen? Take a look at this \nlittle chart. A sharp drop in government infrastructure spending. Let's \nsee. That is 2002.\n  In 2002, $330 billion spent on all infrastructure: roads, bridges, \nairports, water systems, sanitation systems. $325 billion in 2002.\n  And in real 2014 dollars, nondefense spending on infrastructure, here \nwe are in 2012, 2013. We are down to about $200 billion, about $125 \nbillion less spent on infrastructure of all kinds.\n  Oh. Back to water. What about water? Where did we go with water? \nSpending on clean water and drinking water infrastructure in 2014 \ndeflated dollars, go back to 1973.\n  In 1973, the Vietnam war was still going on. Let's see. That would be \nsomewhere around $10 billion in 2014 dollars in 1973. In 2016, we are \ndown to $2 billion.\n  Don't be surprised when you see a list such as I put up a moment ago \nof cities in the United States that have water problems. Aging \ninfrastructure, lead pipes.\n  Here is a picture of a lead pipe. Corroded. You wonder why kids get \nlead poisoning. If you don't spend money on infrastructure, you are \ngoing to wind up with sick kids, you are going to wind up with bridges \nthat collapse, you are going to wind up with a second-rate economy and \na third-world water situation.\n  By the way, that is the bridge on Interstate 5, the road from Canada \nto Mexico down the Pacific coast. The bridge collapsed.\n  What happens when you don't spend money on infrastructure? Your \neconomy fails, your kids get sick, and they are forced to drink water \nout of a water trough. This is not the America we want to live in. This \nis not the America the public sent us here to provide for them.\n  We like to think of ourselves as the strongest, biggest, best country \nin the world, and we are in many respects, but when it comes to \nproviding for the fundamentals of life--water--we get a D rating.\n  We get kids getting their water supply out of a water trough. We get \nkids in Flint, Michigan, who are poisoned with lead. That is not the \nonly city. It is across the United States, city after city.\n  In the Central Valley of California, it is arsenic, it is lead, it is \nother contaminants. Huh-uh. We have got work to do here in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is our responsibility. It is our task. We can't \ntoss it off to somebody else.\n  So, yeah, Roll Call, you are correct: ``Lead in the Water, Way Beyond \nFlint.'' Arsenic in the water. Fecal contamination in the water. You \nname it. City after city, ancient systems, more than 100 years old, \nlead pipes which were put in the ground a century ago, leaching lead \ninto the food supply. That is America.\n  What would it cost? About $348 billion just for the water systems. \nHow can we pay for it? Well, there is a way.\n  Oh, America, are you aware that we are into a new nuclear arms race? \nWe are. In the next 25 years, a trillion dollars of your tax money is \ngoing to be spent on a total rearmament of our nuclear weapons systems: \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, submarines, \nstealth aircraft. A trillion dollars.\n  City after city in America limps along, poisoning its children with \n100-year-old water systems. We have got some choices to make here. What \nare we going to spend your tax money on? New nuclear bombs or new water \npipes? Choices.\n  Joining me tonight to discuss these sets of issues are some of my \ndear friends. Paul Tonko and I have been working on this infrastructure \nissue for 5 years now, what we call the East Coast-West Coast. I am \ngoing to ask Paul if he would wait just a few moments.\n  Sheila Jackson Lee, you were in Flint, Michigan, last week--I guess \nyesterday, actually, for a discussion in Flint, Michigan. Share with us \nbriefly, if you would, your reflections on what you saw there.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much. And I thank the gentleman from \nNew York for his kindness in my brief support of all of you on the \nfloor.\n  Let me first of all acknowledge, as I indicated, your potent and \npowerful question to America of $348 billion to solve our problem and \nare our children that valuable or are our children worth it. My answer \nis yes.\n  Let me add my appreciation, though I know that he would not want to \nbe in this predicament, to Congressman Kildee and the entire Michigan \ndelegation who were there on Saturday.\n  They stood arm in arm listening to Flint residents just to see how \npainful it is to hear a mother talk about a child with spots all over \nhis body and to have her point to other children and say, ``They are \ngetting sick, and I have lost my hair'' or a teacher say, ``I have \nchildren coming to school with pus sores.''\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  So, let me say a few points. I sit on the Judiciary Committee. And \nalso have the privilege of sitting on the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee as a guest. I just want to say that we need to hold \nsomeone accountable, which will then generate into what the solution \nis.\n  April 2014, a nonscientist--I just came out of the Rules Committee on \nscience legislation--made a decision to go to Flint River. He had no \nanti-corrosion plan. Really, there lies the source of problems \nthroughout a number of these cities that you have indicated. You had \none with non-toxins. They were just breaking the law and suffering \nbecause of lack of money. Saving $5 million has resulted in spending \nmultiple millions of dollars--maybe $1 billion-plus--to try and salvage \nthis great city.\n  With Governor Snyder, of course, there is no accountability. Just to \nshow you an example, it is very difficult to read these emails that \nwere released. The Governor indicates that this was not relevant to the \nissue.\n  The main point is that while we are talking about the \ninfrastructure--and I do support Mr. Kildee's effort as well as our \ncolleagues in the Senate to help this city of 765 million, we must also \nhold ourselves accountable--this body of Republicans and Democrats who \nknow that we must invest in infrastructure.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I sent a letter early in \nJanuary asking for an investigation by the Department of Justice. The \nFBI is now investigating. We want to make sure there is a review of \nwhether there is malfeasance.\n  So, I come to the floor today to say there are many questions and \nthere must be many answers. I want to make sure there is an accountable \nstandard. I want to say to the American people that we can't have a \ncity like Flint, where decisions are made--General Motors, by the way, \nstopped using the water--that we have no anticorrosion plan. This is \nhappening across America, partly, because cities are broke and because \nwe have not invested in the overall infrastructure of America, as you, \nMr. Garamendi have said on the floor over and over again.\n  So, I wanted to come to the floor to thank my colleagues. Knowing how \npainful it is to represent that area, I thank Congressman Kildee for \nhis leadership. Congresswoman Lawrence, who is a neighbor, is working \nwith him. Congressman Conyers, Congresswoman Dingell, Sandy Levin, and \nsome Senators have all been working so hard on this issue.\n  Count me in as a collaborator as we stand before the American people \nand say: Send me. We are prepared to fight for more infrastructure to \nhelp cities across America.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas. I know that your \nconcerns are very real. You traveled to Flint, and you have been \nworking on these issues for many, many years. Thank you for your \nparticipation.\n\n[[Page H645]]\n\n  Tomorrow, the Democrats are holding their own committee hearing on \nthis issue. I am certain that we will go through the issues that you \ntalked about: what actually happened and who is actually responsible. \nSo, that will be a discussion for tomorrow. Perhaps we will cover it on \nthe floor tonight.\n  Let me now turn to my colleague from New York, Mr. Paul Tonko, for \nthe continuation of the East-West show.\n  Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative Garamendi, for leading us in \nwhat is a very important bit of discussion.\n  In a broad term, infrastructure is something that needs our immediate \nattention because of years of neglect, but it comes to that water \ninfrastructure that has been highlighted of late. I like to call it the \nhidden infrastructure. It can't be out of sight, out of mind. That \nwould be a very painful outcome if that is the approach that is taken \nby certainly us as legislators or by society at large.\n  You are right: for a number of years, we have been discussing \ninfrastructure. I have made it my goal to invest in water \ninfrastructure for a number of reasons, but also because of my \nassignment on the Energy and Commerce Committee as ranking--the lead \nDemocrat--on the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, which \nreports to the Energy and Commerce Committee. It is through that \nsubcommittee that the assignment of the Safe Drinking Water Act is \nhoused. So it is important for us to maintain a vigilance, if you will, \nfor the outcomes that are deemed acceptable--and that is that we do not \nreceive a D on our report card for water infrastructure.\n  When you shared that information, Representative Garamendi, I thought \nto myself that if any of us brought home a D on a report card, there \nwould be a little bit of a challenge offered our way to improve that \nreport card with the next semester. So, I believe that we have failed \nin this effort to maintain a strong Federal partnership.\n  There has been a lot of finger pointing going on since the Flint, \nMichigan, issue arose in the public's awareness as a national issue. \nThat finger pointing won't solve anything. But if we are going to \nfinger point, we need to also internalize that. We need to look at \nCongress and what it has done.\n  When you talked about the levels of funding, in the early seventies, \nI came onto my county board in 1976, in Montgomery County in upstate \nNew York. I can vividly recall that we had a very lucrative revenue \nflow from the Federal Government for our water systems.\n  Today, what we look at is something like a 4 percent investment \ncoming from the Federal Government on the total bill. That is grossly \ninadequate. The fact that we can turn our backs on this infrastructure \nand allow situations like Flint, Michigan; Sebring, Ohio; Troy, New \nYork; or Los Angeles, California, to grip us, to shock our senses and \nnot respond, leaves us in a very pitiful state, I believe.\n  We need to do better than that. We need to form a plan of action. \nThat plan of action must include a stronger investment in the water \ninfrastructure of this country.\n  Now, some of that also requires, I think, an enhancement of the \ninvestment made in the drinking water SRF, or the State Revolving Fund. \nThat fund has not been reauthorized since 2003. So we need to go \nforward and reauthorize and enhance the SRF so that our States, as \npartners with the Federal Government, can then go forward and have some \nrelief in responding to the strapped cities that are really impacted by \na declining tax base, in many cases, and the very small bit of \npopulation in some of our rural communities that are trying to maintain \nsystems that want to speak to public health and public safety and to \noffer a commodity that is not only important, but essential.\n\n  It is essential for the quality of life in our homes, it is essential \nfor small businesses, it is essential for our manufacturing base, it is \nessential for our farming community. All of this requires water. Many \nsuggest that we are transitioning from an oil-based economy to a water-\nbased economy.\n  So, if we are anticipating greater use and reliance on water as a \ncommodity, let's put our act into working order. That means that you \ninvest not like we did last year, where the outcome was at some $843 \nmillion, which was some $43 million worth of a cut. That is completely \ngoing in the wrong direction. That is not listening to the needs of \nlocal government or to the basic, core essential need of sound drinking \nwater, clean drinking water.\n  It is blue infrastructure. That is what we need to invest in--making \ncertain that we have an abundance and an essential supply of clean \ndrinking water. It is absolutely mandatory in a modern economy. If we \nare going to compete effectively in an innovation economy, we need to \nprovide the essentials, including water, to the business, residential, \nand ag community.\n  When I look at some of the neglect, it is so interesting to see that \nwe wait for crises like that of Flint. Does Flint require Federal \ninvestment? Absolutely. I stand ready and willing to assist Flint. I \nwould rank what happened there as immoral.\n  So, we need to move forward and assist Flint, but the saga shouldn't \nbegin and end there. We need to create a national response that \nempowers our communities across the country. We need to have \ninteraction and dialogue at the table to best understand where we have \nfallen down, where we have failed.\n  We need to have officials from Flint, Michigan, and from the State of \nMichigan here to testify. I don't think it is appropriate for Governor \nSnyder of that State to walk away from that invitation.\n  It is important for us to go forward with the sort of communication, \nthe dialogue, that will build the soundest response. And if we do not \nrespond out of necessity to Flint, Michigan; Troy, New York, Sebring, \nOhio; and Los Angeles, and the list continues to grow, we will then \njust see these issues keep rising in our communities.\n  When I last saw Troy, New York's dilemma, they were repairing things \nin the worst weather--conditions that were near zero, where they needed \nto heat the site in order to weld the materials that were completing \nthe project. A major line, Representative Garamendi, broke. It was \ntheir main line. A 33-inch pipe was shooting water 100 feet into the \nair. Ten million gallons of water went into the street.\n  Are we going to sit back and say that is acceptable in a Nation like \nthis--a Nation of abundance--that considers itself a world leader? No \nworld-leading nation can ignore its infrastructure like we have ignored \nthe water infrastructure.\n  Blue infrastructure is what we should be about: providing that clean \ndrinking water. We have nearly a quarter of a million breaks annually \nin the systems from coast-to-coast. A quarter of a million. There are \n700-some breaks per day.\n  Think about it. That wouldn't be acceptable to an ordinary business \nplan of any type. It should not be acceptable to the Federal Government \nplan in assisting communities with the sound commodity of drinking \nwater.\n  So, Representative Garamendi, I am just thrilled to join you this \nevening to continue to carry the message forward that we need action, \nwe need a plan of action, we need commitment, and we need resources. It \nbegins now. Every missed opportunity here will perhaps cause the \nopportunity for yet another tragedy in a community that just should not \nhappen.\n  Again, it is about investing soundly, effectively, and appropriately, \nin what it is an essential commodity: water for our communities.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, thank you so very, very much. You brought \nto this issue enormous facts and passion. Your work as the ranking \nmember on the subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee \npositions you in a very, very important place. Your passion and \nknowledge should help carry the day on this.\n  Mr. Tonko, if you can stick around, we will come back to this one \nmore time.\n  I would like now to call on my colleague from California, Mr. Ted \nLieu from Los Angeles.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Thank you, Representative Garamendi, for \nyour work on clean water and for highlighting this issue in Flint, as \nwell as in communities across America.\n  I sit on the Oversight Committee. On February 3, we held a hearing on \nthe Flint water crisis. Based on the information presented, it is clear \nto me that\n\n[[Page H646]]\n\nwhat happened in Flint was a crime of epic proportions. Tens of \nthousands of women, children, and men were poisoned when lead leached \nfrom lead pipes into the drinking water. Those who were most \nresponsible know who they are. They should resign. Some of them should \nbe prosecuted.\n  We need to make sure that we do what is right for the residents of \nFlint, as well as other communities across America, and make sure this \nnever happens again. It is clear that this is not an issue just in \nFlint, but the problem with toxic water is an issue across our Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Washington, D.C., had elevated levels of lead in 2000. Sebring, Ohio, \nnow has elevated levels of lead. And there was a report by the Natural \nResources Defense Council in 2011 that showed 19 cities had toxic \nissues with their drinking water.\n  There are a variety of solutions. First of all, we need to fund the \nCDC lead abatement program that had been cut by the Republican \nlegislature in 2002. We need to restore funding and fully fund that \nprogram.\n  We need to also make a strong investment in improving our water \ninfrastructure. I sit on the Budget Committee. I will be putting in \namendments to make sure that we increase funding to water \ninfrastructure across America.\n  And we need to look at alternatives to lead pipes. An article in \nSalon noted that we have many cities across America now using PVC \npipes, also known as plastic pipes, as an eco-friendly alternative.\n  Canadian and American cities have had success with these pipes. They \nlast longer than metal pipes, over 100 years. They do not corrode. They \ndo not leach, and they do not contain lead.\n  What is happening in Flint, they are looking at a short-term \nsolution, which is to recoat their lead pipes. I believe that is not \nacceptable. I believe the Governor needs to come in and replace all the \nlead pipes with a nonlead alternative.\n  The mayor of Flint has called for full replacement. I support that. I \nknow Representative Garamendi and others support that.\n  I want to give great credit to the great work by Representative \nKildee for his constituents in Flint.\n  I also want to note that if we don't do something now, who knows \nwhether your children or your grandchildren will be poisoned by lead in \nyour drinking water.\n  It is very important that we make enormous infrastructure \ninvestments, and the time to do that is now.\n  Thank you again, Representative Garamendi, for highlighting this \nissue.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Lieu, you said you are on the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee. You had the hearing last week and began \nthe process of developing an understanding of what happened and who was \nresponsible. Critically important.\n  You also said you are on the Budget Committee. So if I might just \nlobby you for a moment--\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Let me just lobby you. You are going to be taking up \nthe budget--I think tomorrow, actually.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. We have various markups coming up. That \nis correct.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Okay. So the budget is going to be coming up, and that \nis the allocation of the $4 trillion that the Federal Government will \nspend. We will be spending it on education. We will be spending it on \nroads, on the military and the like.\n  Let me just toss you some numbers for your consideration. Now, these \nare adjusted 2015 dollars, so we are keeping equal-value dollars.\n  In 2007, the State Revolving Fund for Drinking Water, which Mr. Tonko \ntalked about, had $957 million for that program. That goes to the \nStates to repair their water systems. And it stayed around $900 million \nthe next year.\n  And then we had the stimulus bill in 2009, and we spent $3 billion. \nThen we went back down, $1.5 billion, $1 billion, $947 million, and we \nstayed somewhere in the range of $900 million through 2016. So that is \nthe current year. And that is $863 million that we are spending this \nyear on the State Revolving Fund.\n  Keep in mind that it is estimated that we need $328 billion to repair \nall the pipes.\n  Now, the President's budget has $1.2 billion for the coming year. He \njust introduced that today.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Right.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Okay. Also, in the President's budget, he has $1.36 \nbillion for the new Long Range Strike Bomber; $113 million for a \nground-based strategic deterrence; $1.4 billion for the Ohio class \nsubmarine--those are nuclear submarines; the new long-range cruise \nmissile, $995 million; to rebuild the B61 bomb, $137 million; and the \ntotal amount that the National Nuclear Security Administration is \nspending this new year, 2017, $9.24 billion.\n  Now, it would seem to me that this is just in the nuclear enterprise. \nThese are our nuclear weapons.\n  So my lobbying is this: When you put together the budget, could you \nsomehow squeeze out of the nuclear arms race that we are engaged in \nabout a billion dollars so that we can stop poisoning our children?\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. You made some very good points. And, as \nyou know, America is the leading economy in the world. Our GDP is \ngreater than the next two countries combined. We certainly have the \nresources to make sure we don't poison our kids with lead in their \nwater or other toxic material.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Just double, if you would, just double the amount we \nare spending for the clean drinking water programs at the Federal level \nfrom about $1 billion to, let's say, $2 billion, or maybe even $3 \nbillion, by squeezing some of the expenditures that we find in other \naccounts.\n  My particular target is the nuclear weapons account, which will in \nthe next 25 years cost the American taxpayers $1 trillion. So when you \ngo to the hearing, keep that in mind.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Thank you for raising that issue. I will \nabsolutely look into it. I am glad you brought it up. So let me look \ninto that issue.\n  I do want to say something about what Representative Tonko mentioned, \nwhich is the hundreds of water main breaks we have daily. That just \nshows a crumbling infrastructure. In America, in the 21st century, that \nshould not be happening.\n  What we saw in Flint and we are seeing in other cities across America \nis a result of disinvestment in our government, in cities and \nmunicipalities. You get what you pay for, and right now, we are getting \nchildren that are being poisoned with lead. So we need to increase \ninvestment.\n\n  I will look into the issues you raised, Representative Garamendi. \nThank you for highlighting these issues.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I appreciate the opportunity to lobby you. You are in \na very important position, as are all of us; 435 of us are going to \nmake choices about what is important and how we spend our constituents' \ntax money. And these are choices we are going to make.\n  We often don't really look at it, but the budget that will be \nforthcoming, the President's budget, and then the response of this \nHouse to that budget, will allocate that $4 trillion across a whole \nvariety of programs.\n  We really do have the opportunity here, as we put together the budget \nand then the appropriations following, to take up the challenge that \nMr. Tonko put before us in the State Revolving Fund.\n  Mr. Lieu, thank you so very much for joining us.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Thank you. I look forward to working with \nyou and Representative Tonko and others to make sure we invest in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. We appreciate you being here. Thank you so very much.\n  Well, Mr. Tonko, lead pipes.\n  Mr. TONKO. Lead pipes. The $863 million in the Drinking Water SRF of \nwhich I spoke is a lot of money. But when you put it into context of \nmaybe 10 million lead service lines in the country, when you think of \ninfrastructure that is beyond 100 years old--when I did tours--I have \nbeen doing tours in my district of the water systems, and I have found \nsystems as old as 145 years. That is when Rutherford B. Hayes was in \nthe White House.\n  And I saw pipes that were 8-inch in diameter reduced to 4-inch flow \nbecause of calcification. I saw pipes removed because of corrosion by \nthe acidity of soils that has taken its toll.\n\n[[Page H647]]\n\n  You think of new technology, invention, innovation, gauges that can \nbe utilized, liners that can be put in certain pipes for extending the \nuseful life, things that we can be doing that provide for preventative \nmaintenance and speak to public health and public safety.\n  You know, it is a bit of wonderment, isn't it, that we will trade our \ncell phones every other year, or perhaps every year, because they have \ngot a new product on the shelf; or will trade in our screens, our TV \nscreens, because they are simply not big enough; or the car has got too \nmany miles or we just came to dislike the color, and so we trade in the \nautomobile every three, 4 years. But we are content to live with water \npipes for 145 years. It defies human logic. Why do we accept that?\n  Why don't we dig into this hidden infrastructure and invest in a way \nthat will avoid thousands of families being impacted by contamination \nof lead?\n  Children, innocent children impacted by societal neglect. Investment \nthat ought to be highest priority, not put on the back burner.\n  Well, the response, as we know, is: How are you going to pay for it? \nWhat is the cost?\n  What is the cost of doing something? Let's contrast that with the \ncost of not doing something.\n  What are the bills going to be?\n  For Flint, Michigan, alone, we don't think people are going to stay \nsilent with this tragedy in their lives. What is the impact to \nindustry?\n  When I saw these lines burst in the city of Troy, New York, this \nwinter, businesses were shut down. Schools were shut. They were closed \nfor days. Families didn't have water in their homes.\n  What is the cost? What is the price tag?\n  So it needs to be a framework that is large enough to calculate the \nhuman impact, the financial impact, societal impact, the economic \nconsequences. These are real.\n  Again, we are a country, a people that can claim the pioneer spirit \nwithin our DNA. How do we dare say ``no'' to what ought to be a sound \ninvestment, to grow jobs, maintain jobs, to compete effectively on a \nglobal scale in an innovation economy?\n  We can do better. We must do better.\n  And when we look at the situations out there where we have convinced \nourselves that we are not worthy of investment, that is not leadership. \nWe are trying to stall and pass it on to the next generation.\n  Well, this generation that will be that next generation of leaders is \nbeing impacted healthwise as we speak. Unacceptable. Immoral. We can do \nbetter.\n  Representative Garamendi, I know there are voices that really want to \nproduce here and do this progressive bit of investment that will \nstrengthen our communities.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. As you were talking, I think back when I was growing \nup, and we used to call this, not infrastructure, we used to call this \n``public works.'' Public works.\n  This is for the public. It is infrastructure, but this is the public \ninvestment in the things that an individual, even a private company, \ncannot do. This is something that we do as a community in the public \ndomain.\n  It is work. We are talking, if we were to invest $2 billion this \ncoming year in these community water systems, we would actually \ngenerate thousands of jobs, and we would increase the economic growth \nimmediately.\n  It has been estimated that for every dollar you put into public \nworks, infrastructure, you immediately increase the economy by $1.3, \n$1.4. So this is a way of investing immediately, putting people to work \nin good, middle class jobs, and laying in the public works for future \neconomic growth and, as you just said so eloquently, protecting our \nhealth, our children's health. So this is absolutely essential.\n  We are at a very propitious moment. The President proposed today the \nbudget for the United States of America's next fiscal year, beginning \nOctober 1, 2016.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  It is his proposal on how to spend about $4 trillion of taxpayer \nmoney and debt. We, as the representatives of the people of the United \nStates, will take that and modify it.\n  What if we just made one modification in that $4 trillion and said: \nWe are going to spend an additional billion dollars or an additional $2 \nbillion on public works water systems? What would it mean?\n  The 140-year-old pipes that you talked about, could they be replaced? \nCould the 250,000 water main breaks across the United States be reduced \nto maybe just 200,000?\n  People going to work, engineers designing the system, financiers \nfiguring out how to put together the local money, the State money, and \nthe Federal money, generating jobs, growing our economy, and stopping \nthe poisoning of our children.\n  The President proposed his budget today. Tomorrow our colleagues take \nup the budget and begin to decide how to move that money to things that \nare a priority. Here we are.\n  Mr. TONKO. Representative Garamendi, when we talk about the \ninfrastructure hidden beneath the surface of the streets and scape of \nour communities, it is hard to imagine wooden pipes along with those \ndecrepit 145-year-old pipes in calcification galore.\n  The enormity of the situation needs to be perhaps graphically shared. \nUnder the city of Albany, the capital of New York, which is part of the \n20th Congressional District that I represent, happens to lie 317 miles \nof pipe, drinking water infrastructure.\n  You could travel from Albany, New York, to Baltimore, Maryland. That \nis the sort of linear responsibility associated with that system. \nShould we anticipate rightfully that there may be some bumps along the \nroad of that 317-mile stretch in any given year?\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. A pothole, maybe?\n  Mr. TONKO. Absolutely. So let's think of it in those sorts of terms \nso that we can have a better understanding and awareness of an aged \ninfrastructure, which, by the way, is also accompanied by a \ndiscontinued inventory in many cases.\n  Valves that are required are no longer manufactured. So we have to \ncome up with some innovative response when there is a break.\n  While we have talked a lot about capital improvements, capital \ninfrastructure, and physical infrastructure that is required to pay for \nand build back these systems, there is also that third leg of the \nstool: human infrastructure.\n  When I tour these water systems in my district, one of the learning \ncurves is the declining effort of professionals--not their effort--the \ndeclining numbers of professionals who have the awesome responsibility \nof operating and maintaining these systems.\n  So the education, the training, the retraining, the higher education, \nand the certification of individuals who makes these systems work and \nprovide for that water when you turn on the tap, they are there.\n  But there is an aging out because I think we have ignored this. So \ncareer paths have not been developed in the minds of students to go \ninto this sort of science. And it is an important, awesome \nresponsibility.\n  Will that institutional knowledge be passed on or will we just go \nwithout? So the human infrastructure is an important piece of this \npuzzle, also, to have the qualified women and men conducting their \nprofessionalism to serve the community.\n  So when you turn that tap on and anticipate--rightfully again--that \nclean drinking water is the result, think of all the decisionmaking, \nthink of all the investment, think of the stewardship, and the \noperating know-how that is required. It is awesome.\n  It is also a system, as we have been shown, that, when there is \nfailure, you can have a large number of people impacted and in severe \nmeasure.\n  So I believe that this Nation cares about its drinking water capacity \nand state of purity and sound condition. They want that abundant supply \nof clean water, and we need stronger partnership from the Federal level \nbeing more committed, more lucrative funding streams to the States, and \nthen the States incorporating with their local communities to come up \nwith innovative concepts.\n  My gosh, we are producing new materials that perhaps won't corrode as \neasily or that can retrofit the given systems. We have gauges that can \ntell us where the next break may come. So you are dealing with the \nknow-how that provides for the most effective and\n\n[[Page H648]]\n\nefficient outcome from a taxpayer perspective.\n  All of this technology with software to accompany it is available. \nBut, again, the technical assistance, the grants, the loans--affordable \nloans--that we can advance to the communities are important steps in \nthe process of providing for a 21st-century infrastructure.\n  We shouldn't be content with a D on our report card. D means \ndevastating. D means dangerous. D means in decline. Let's move forward \nand advance for that A on the report card.\n  I know you wanted those As on your report card, Mr. Garamendi. I \nwanted them on mine.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. The art of the possible. The art of the possible is \nwhat we have here.\n  Mr. Tonko, I don't know where you were when I brought this up. This \nis the drinking water in Flint, Michigan. That is a recent photo from a \nwater tap in Flint, Michigan. Unacceptable. The bottom line is it is \nunacceptable. Not only is it dirty, it is poisonous.\n  Mr. TONKO. And frightening.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. It is poisonous.\n  So we are going to make some choices. My plea to my colleagues here--\nand it echoes what you said--you can talk about it in terms of jobs. \nThousands and thousands of jobs would be created if we invested in our \ninfrastructure, our public works, and the water systems.\n  Is the money available to do it? If we make the right choice, it is. \nIf we make the right choice to invest in ending the poisoning of our \nchildren, it is there. We can move $4 trillion around in one way or \n     another and build modern infrastructure. We could do that.\n  We are going to do it now. We are going to do it now. The issue of \nthe budget begins today. In the United States Congress, 535 American \ncitizens are brought to this Capitol to make decisions about the health \nand the safety of their children. We have been given that \nresponsibility.\n  God knows there is enough money around $4 trillion to find a way to \nspend the money to build the water systems to stop the poisoning of our \nchildren. It is just a matter of choices.\n  What do we choose to do? Refurbish a nuclear bomb that, God willing, \nwe would never ever even think about using? That is our choice. It is \nour choice.\n  As your representatives, we can move money into providing the public \nworks to meet the fundamental human need, in this case, drinkable, \npotable, safe water. It is fundamental.\n  You cannot live but 3 days without water, and the last 2 days aren't \nworth living anyway because you are comatose. Water. Choices. Public \nworks. Investment in the future. Jobs today. Engineers, as you talked \nabout. Financial. All of that.\n  It is disheartening. I hear my colleagues like Sheila Jackson Lee \ncome in and talk about going to Flint, Michigan. I will never forget \nMr. Kildee on the floor last Thursday.\n  I asked him to talk to me about that young child that you saw in your \ncommunity that you represent. He said the kid turned to him and said: I \nam not going to be smart enough. We make choices.\n  Mr. TONKO. Think of the reduction in the quality of life there. We \ncommend Representative Kildee, Representative Lawrence, and all of the \nmembers of the Michigan delegation for the work that they have done.\n  Again, to the price tag, the cost, let's look at the other side. \nEarlier I talked about 7 billion--7 billion--gallons of water lost with \nthese main breaks, with these breaks of any kind. 7 billion gallons.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Can we talk about the California drought in this \ncontext?\n  Mr. TONKO. Exactly. Can you ill afford any waste of water? But it is \nnot just water coming through those pipes. It is tax dollars flowing \nwith that water. It is treated water.\n  So it is foolish for us to continue along this path of hidden \ninfrastructure mentality because, when it is not addressed, water and \ntax dollars--hard-earned constituent money--are flowing out of those \npipes.\n  Before I came here, Representative Garamendi, you know that I worked \nat NYSERDA, the New York State Energy, Research, and Development \nAuthority.\n  We got national awards for energy efficiency incorporated at water \ntreatment facilities. So we took that effort to reduce the price tag of \nday-to-day operational costs.\n  There are ways to save money. A broken pipe is pouring money down the \ndrain. So let's stop that foolish expenditure and go wisely to the \ninvestment that enables us with our intellect, our passion, and our \nsense of virtue to get things done correctly.\n  Generations before us had that vision. Pioneers built this country. \nPeople came here as immigrants and tethered their American Dream.\n  They climbed the ladder of opportunity and built strong communities \nbased on that American Dream, and we in our present moment can't find \nit within ourselves to address those basic core needs?\n  We pride ourselves on being a modern society and having the luxury of \nclean water. The blue infrastructure moment is now. Let's invest in \nthat clean water infrastructure. Let's not torture our communities. \nLet's not disrespect our children. We are better than that.\n  We have the engineering savvy. We have the academic prowess. We have \nthe intellectual capacity. Now do we have the will? I believe we do.\n  I believe this country, if asked: ``Do you want to invest in \nAmerica's drinking water systems?'' would say a resounding yes. Flint, \nMichigan; Sebring, Ohio; Los Angeles, California; Troy, New York--the \nlist goes on and on.\n  If we do nothing, we should anticipate that this list will continue \nto make a growing, passionate statement that we are dragging our feet. \nWe are allowing a hidden infrastructure to be truly that, hidden, out \nof sight and out of mind.\n  Don't burden us with the responsibility. Don't share the facts. It is \ntoo painful. I don't want to hear that it is going to cost us \nsomething.\n  We see what the cost is. Representative Garamendi held up the photo \nof that polluted water, that poisonous water. That is unacceptable in a \ncountry as great as America. Unacceptable.\n  We have invested in the soundness of education, research, and \ninnovation, and to not utilize the byproducts of those investments is \nsheer foolishness. It is not exercising the love of country that needs \nto be engaged in this Chamber and across the country.\n  We can get this done. I am a firm believer--firm believer--that, with \nvoices resonating in chorus about this issue and the connected \ntragedies of disinvestment, we will get it done. We will get it done.\n  Representative Garamendi, I appreciate the efforts you make to bring \nthese issues to the attention of the American public.\n  For those who listen at home and watch at home, encourage your \nrepresentatives to get on board with the investment in our clean \ndrinking water infrastructure. It is so critical.\n  This moment can bring us together. This isn't about a partisan issue. \nWe didn't ask those children what party their families may be assigned, \nhave chosen. This serves us all.\n  Let's go forward united in the voice and the passion to get it done, \nthe determination and the integrity to say that we had a challenge and, \nin the old American way, we responded to it and succeeded.\n  Again, thank you for bringing us together.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, I wasn't in Flint, Michigan when \nRepresentative Kildee spoke to that young child--I think he was \nprobably 4 or 5--who had been drinking this lead contaminated water, \nand was aware that he had been drinking the water. When that young kid \nturned to Mr. Kildee and said: I am afraid I won't be smart enough, I \nvisualize it.\n  My question to you, to myself, and to my colleagues here in the House \nof Representatives and across the way in the Senate is: Will we be \nsmart enough to protect our children? I think we must be smart enough \nto do that.\n  Mr. TONKO. When it comes to smart, incorporating this work with the \nappropriate agencies--the EPA and the DEC in my home State of New \nYork--there is a situation very close to my district in Hoosick Falls \nthat is going through a similar contaminated water situation critical \nto their quality of life and their public health.\n  We need to advance that partnership, that soundness of checks and \nbalances,\n\n[[Page H649]]\n\nthat will make certain that every bit of the way it is based on \nresponsibility and professionalism and good faith efforts.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I was just thinking about your community that you \nmentioned, Albany and the like. I represent the University of \nCalifornia, Davis, in Davis, California. I think they have got maybe 12 \nwells that provide most of the water. About half of those wells are \ncontaminated. They are building a new water system, and it should go \nonline in the next few months, or maybe a year, or maybe sooner. They \nare investing. Perhaps they got some of this money from the State \nrevolving fund.\n  It is an example of a community that wrestled with this for about a \ndecade. They turned out to be smart enough to address it. They did it \nwith their neighboring community of Woodland. A new water system is \ngoing into place. They will have safe drinking water.\n  There are other communities spread throughout California that don't \nhave the same opportunity. It is our task to address this. I think we \nare smart enough to do so. I think there is enough money in the system \nto do it.\n  Mr. Tonko, would you like to do a quick 15 second wrap?\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the speaker for the opportunity to share thoughts \non the floor here this evening.\n  Blue infrastructure, let's get it done. Let's provide America one of \nher core basic needs.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI.
