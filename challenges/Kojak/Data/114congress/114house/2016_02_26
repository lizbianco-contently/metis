Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 20th \nanniversary of one of South Florida's grooviest communities, my \nhometown of the village of Pinecrest.\n  Since its incorporation in 1996, the village of Pinecrest has been \nknown as a family-friendly community with many parks and recreational \nareas and neighborhood activities that are open to all South \nFloridians.\n  The village is committed to sustainable stewardship and environmental \nsensitivity, keeping it one of the most beautiful places in which to \nlive and work.\n  In celebration of its founding, the residents, schools, public \nofficials, and businesses will join together on Saturday, March 12, for \na parade starting at Palmetto Elementary School and ending with a \ncommunity picnic at Evelyn Greer Park.\n  I encourage my Congressional colleagues to join me in congratulating \nthe village of Pinecrest and to join our community in celebration of \nthis magnificent milestone.\n  I am honored to represent the families in the village, and Dexter and \nI have been proud to call this wonderful community our home for almost \n30 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H953-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H953-H954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  (Mr. ASHFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Black History \nMonth and the countless contributions of African Americans as well as \nrecognizing a man who embodies the best of this celebration.\n  Michael Maroney is president of the Omaha Economic Development \nCorporation. Our North Omaha community is a vibrant neighborhood, but \none still facing economic challenges.\n  Michael finds and furthers projects that result in more jobs, \nbusiness ownership, diverse housing options, and training \nopportunities. Through Michael's leadership, the city of Omaha is \nmaking significant strides to lessen the stress and strain of poverty.\n  Every American, no matter the color of their skin, should be able to \nachieve their full potential. One roadblock to this goal is the Supreme \nCourt's flawed opinion in the Shelby v. Holder case,\n\n[[Page H954]]\n\nwhich significantly weakens the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Until Congress \npasses bipartisan legislation to right this wrong, every American's \nsacred franchise, the right to vote, is under attack.\n  So this Black History Month, let us make time to recommit to working \ntogether to ensure a better, brighter, and more equitable future for \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H954-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ERIC WILLIAMS CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, our Nation's correctional officers risk \ntheir safety every day in order to keep prisoners, visitors, and other \nofficers safe.\n  In most Federal prisons, there are only one or two officers on duty \nin a cell block, meaning officers are guarding nearly 130 prisoners \nwith virtually nothing to protect themselves.\n  We have seen the reality of this situation with the death of \nCorrectional Officer Eric Williams, who was murdered by an inmate at a \nPennsylvania prison. In addition, last year more than 2,500 weapons \nwere confiscated from inmates in Federal prisons.\n  The Bureau of Prisons is currently operating a 1-year pilot program \nthat allows correctional officers in some Federal prisons to carry \npepper spray for protection.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week the House passed the Eric Williams \nCorrectional Officers Protection Act, legislation that I have \nsupported, to expand this pilot program to medium-security prisons and \nrequire a training course before they can use this pepper spray.\n  We need to provide our correctional officers the tools they need to \nprotect themselves and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H954-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Over 1,000 students have \ngraduated from the STAR Foundation, and 70 percent of their graduates \nimprove their employment status within 15 months of graduation. Some \noutstanding students can even receive a personal computer for their \nhome.\n  I am grateful for the work that the STAR Foundation is doing in the \nFirst Congressional District of Georgia, and I wish the program and its \ngraduates success for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H954-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WEEK\n\n  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, small-business owners make up over 90 \npercent of private sector employers in my home State of Hawaii, and \nthey are the backbone of our economy both in Hawaii and across the \ncountry.\n  In our close-knit community built on generations of small-business \nowners willing to lend a hand to a neighbor in need, this is one of the \nthings that makes our State so special and that helps to bring the \naloha spirit alive both for visitors and kama`aina alike.\n  Last week I had the chance to spend some time planting kale and beets \nat the Palaka Moon Farm with Waimanalo small-business owners Malia \nSmith and Kevin Vaccarello.\n  I then went and helped them open their Ai Love Nalo cafe, where they \nseek to improve the health and well-being of their community around \nthem by feeding them delicious, locally grown food.\n  It is the hard work of people like Malia and Kevin and the love that \nthey put into their business and work that are at the heart of our \neconomy in communities across the country and in Hawaii.\n  As we recognize National Entrepreneurship Week this week, I want to \nsay thank you to all of our small-business owners and entrepreneurs for \ntheir dedication and for what they do to strengthen and serve our \ncommunities every single day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H954-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PRESIDENT'S MISSING PLAN\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when I was in law school, if a person \ndid not turn in a term paper, they flunked. But the former \nconstitutional law professor has missed a deadline required by law.\n  Under the bipartisan 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, the \nPresident is required to send Congress a real, comprehensive strategy \nto defeat ISIS. He signed this law. The due date was February 15. The \npaper is overdue.\n  Confronting terrorism and emphasizing the safety and security of the \nUnited States is critical. Why hasn't the President complied with the \nlaw he signed? Where is the plan? Where is the strategy? People are \nbeing killed by ISIS.\n  The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General \nStewart, stated that ISIS ``will probably attempt to conduct additional \nattacks in Europe, and attempt to direct attacks on the U.S. homeland \nin 2016.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not law school. This is the real world where \nterrorists kill the innocent. The President should spend more time \ndeveloping a plan to defeat ISIS than planning to close the jailhouse \nfor terrorists in Guantanamo Bay.\n  I wonder what grade the President, the constitutional law professor, \nwould give himself, the Commander in Chief, for ignoring this legal \nrequirement to turn in his paper.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H954-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H954-H955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SENATE SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION\n\n  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the United States \nSenate is failing to serve the American people.\n  This week Senate Republicans announced their plan to simply ignore \nPresident Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court with no hearings, no \nvotes, no chance for the public to witness an open and honest debate \nover the future of the Court.\n  This is what the world's greatest deliberative body looks like under \nRepublican control. Refusing to fill the vacancy until the next \nelection disregards the will of the American people who elected \nPresident Obama twice, despite Republicans making it their primary \nmission to deny him a second term.\n\n[[Page H955]]\n\n  It also reflects a dramatic change of heart from Senator Grassley, \nwho once said a nominee should be considered, regardless of election \npolitics. This is hypocrisy, plain and simple.\n  I accept that Senate Republicans have the constitutional authority to \nreject the President's nominee, but I do not accept their refusal to \neven consider that nominee. The American people shouldn't accept it \neither.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H955-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ANNIVERSARY OF THE POTTER COUNTY EXTENSION\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Recreational Fishing and \n     Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) recreational fishing and hunting are important and \n     traditional activities in which millions of Americans \n     participate;\n       (2) recreational anglers and hunters have been and continue \n     to be among the foremost supporters of sound fish and \n     wildlife management and conservation in the United States;\n       (3) recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally \n     acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be \n     provided on Federal lands and waters without adverse effects \n     on other uses or users;\n       (4) recreational anglers, hunters, and sporting \n     organizations provide direct assistance to fish and wildlife \n     managers and enforcement officers of the Federal Government \n     as well as State and local governments by investing volunteer \n     time and effort to fish and wildlife conservation;\n       (5) recreational anglers, hunters, and the associated \n     industries have generated billions of dollars of critical \n     funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and \n     management by providing revenues from purchases of fishing \n     and hunting licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as excise \n     taxes on fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting \n     equipment that have generated billions of dollars of critical \n     funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and \n     management;\n       (6) recreational shooting is also an important and \n     traditional activity in which millions of Americans \n     participate;\n       (7) safe recreational shooting is a valid use of Federal \n     lands, including the establishment of safe and convenient \n     recreational shooting ranges on such lands, and participation \n     in recreational shooting helps recruit and retain hunters and \n     contributes to wildlife conservation;\n       (8) opportunities to recreationally fish, hunt, and shoot \n     are declining, which depresses participation in these \n     traditional activities, and depressed participation adversely \n     impacts fish and wildlife conservation and funding for \n     important conservation efforts; and\n       (9) the public interest would be served, and our citizens' \n     fish and wildlife resources benefitted, by action to ensure \n     that opportunities are facilitated to engage in fishing and \n     hunting on Federal land as recognized by Executive Order No. \n     12962, relating to recreational fisheries, and Executive \n     Order No. 13443, relating to facilitation of hunting heritage \n     and wildlife conservation.\n\n     SEC. 603.

Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Wittman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, this manager's amendment makes technical \nchanges to the underlying bill, makes expenditures under the Federal \nLand Transaction Facilitation Act subject to appropriation, and \neliminates the Pittman-Robertson interest on obligations language, \ntitle XII, which was signed into law last year.\n  The manager's amendment also adds an important new title to the bill, \nthe Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act, which makes that law more \ntransparent. The Equal Access to Justice Act, or EAJA, was originally \npassed in 1980 as a social safety net program for seniors, veterans, \nand small businesses.\n  It was designed to pay back these little guys for the cost of suing \nthe Federal Government in a once-in-a-lifetime event. However, special \ninterest groups have used EAJA as a way to be reimbursed for lawsuits \nwhen they can't be reimbursed under the Nation's environmental laws. \nThese illegitimate reimbursements not only cost taxpayers money, but \nthey tie up our land management agencies, chasing procedural lawsuits \ninstead of doing their actual job.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the manager's \namendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I simply take a minute. Since we have no \namendments on leaded bullets or lead in fishing, this may be the only \ntime it is germane to clear up an issue from our debate yesterday \nevening.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), my good friend, mentioned \nabout at shooting ranges, especially, bullets often end up back in the \nground.\n  I just wanted to clarify, and let me quote from the Science and \nEnvironmental Health Network, that in the environment many chemicals \nare degraded by sunlight, destroyed through reactions with other \nenvironmental substances or metabolized by naturally occurring \nbacteria. Some chemicals, however, have features that enable them to \nresist environmental degradation. They are classified as persistent and \ncan accumulate in soils and aquatic environments. Metals such as lead, \nmercury, and arsenic are always persistent since they are basic \nelements and cannot be further broken down and destroyed in the \nenvironment. Lead contamination of air, soil, or drinking water can \nultimately result in significant exposures in fetuses, infants, and \nchildren, resulting in impaired brain development.\n  Mr. Chair, I just wanted to get that on the record that the lead is \nnot going to degrade once it hits the soil during hunting or fishing.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n\n[[Page H964]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chair, H.R. 2406 would increase Federal assistance \nmade available in the Pittman-Robertson Act for construction, \noperations, and maintenance of recreational shooting ranges on public \nlands.\n  I, myself, am an avid outdoorsman and a big proponent of recreational \nactivities, and I understand the value of recreational shooting. \nHowever, I believe that with these privileges come certain \nresponsibilities. One of those responsibilities is to ensure that we \nare not creating a situation where dangerous people are allowed to hone \ntheir shooting skills on the taxpayers' dime.\n  My amendment today simply says, if you operate a public shooting \nrange and if you receive Federal assistance by way of this act, then \nyou must have a policy, a notice of some sort in place stating that no \nperson who is prohibited by Federal law from possessing a firearm is \nallowed to use the shooting range.\n  Nothing in this amendment creates new gun laws. Nothing in this \namendment would infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners. \nNothing in this amendment is onerous in any way. We are simply saying \nthat the Federal Government should not be in the business of \nsubsidizing dangerous people improving their marksmanship or creating \nspaces around guns where convicted felons feel like they can operate \noutside the law and endanger law-abiding sportsmen and -women. The \nFederal Government has an obligation to keep people safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, this amends the definition of public \ntarget ranges in title II and the definition of public target range as \nused for Pittman-Robertson funding.\n  This amendment is unnecessary, as it prohibits behavior which is \nalready against the law. This amendment is also impractical. \nAdministrators at public ranges would have no way of knowing who is \nprohibited and who is not. Public target ranges are not equipped to run \nbackground checks, and requiring them to do so would largely undermine \nthe other purposes of the bill, like expanding access to ranges.\n  This amendment does not distinguish between public target ranges that \nallow only archery versus those that allow firearm use. The amendment \nwould prohibit, without justification, certain persons from taking \nadvantage of otherwise lawful and harmless recreational archery.\n  Access to the national background check screening data base is \nstrictly limited by law and cannot be used to screen people just \nbecause they want to use a target range. The National Rifle \nAssociation, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and Safari Club \nInternational oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, with respect for my friend from Virginia, there \nis nothing in the amendment that suggests or requires background checks \nfor people wanting to use public shooting ranges--in fact, just the \nopposite. All we are asking is that there be a policy or a notice \nsaying, if you are otherwise prohibited from using weapons under \nFederal law, that you can't practice, hone your shooting skills on \nthese ranges.\n  Mr. Wittman and I both come from Virginia, where we have six target \nranges managed by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. \nThose six public target ranges have 17 rules. These rules include: use \npaper targets only; organized competitive shooting is prohibited; use \nof unauthorized target materials, such as cans, bottles, clay birds is \nprohibited. None of these is onerous. All we are asking is for an 18th \nrule that says, if you are otherwise prohibited from using a gun under \nFederal law, then you can't use it at the target range.\n  We are not trying to extend background checks to everyone. That is \nnot what this says. All we are trying to do is make sure that people \nwho can't otherwise have possession of a gun don't go to a target \nrange, rent one, and practice.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I remind the gentleman from Virginia--we \nall have an interest in shooting sports--that there is no evidence to \nsuggest that there is an issue right now with felons using this \nopportunity to perpetrate crimes at public shooting ranges, so I think \nit is a solution in search of a problem. We want to make sure that \nthere is a balance there and that, indeed, people have access to these \nranges.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, Federal law prohibits certain criminals \nfrom possessing firearms. This amendment assumes that a criminal who is \nforbidden from possessing a firearm, who then breaks that law and \npossesses one anyway, will then obey a law that says he can't bring the \nillegally possessed gun to a shooting range.\n  I have news for the author of this amendment. The last place a \ncriminal wants to be is on a shooting range where he is surrounded by \nlaw-abiding and armed citizens. Criminals prefer gun-free zones where \ndecent people can't fight back.\n  So what is the real purpose of this amendment? I think it is twofold. \nThe first is to imply that gun ranges are brimming with criminals who \nare honing their skills to go on rampages. That is an insult to the \nmany millions of Americans who own guns and who use shooting ranges.\n  Second, and more disturbing, it is to put the owners and managers of \nshooting ranges in an impossible legal position. How are they supposed \nto comply with this law? The gentleman says, well, they don't need to \ndo background checks of every consumer, but what else are they then \nsupposed to do in order to abide by this law? Require a 2-week waiting \nperiod to make reservations? How long before leftist legal firms begin \nsuing these gun ranges for failing to do due diligence in thoroughly \nprobing the backgrounds of their customers?\n  We have many laws on the books to prohibit the illegal use of \nfirearms and to prohibit criminals from possessing them. That is the \nproblem with criminals: they just don't obey our laws. But instead of \nputting them behind bars, where they can't hurt anyone, the left seeks \nto make it increasingly difficult for law-abiding citizens to defend \nthemselves.\n  It shouldn't surprise us that the sum total of these laws is more gun \nviolence and not less. I urge the House to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, all I need is just a few seconds to point out \nto my friend from California that many of the things that he objects to \nare irrelevant and not germane to this amendment.\n\n  We are not asking for background checks. We are certainly not setting \nup a structure where lawyers can sue. We are simply asking for a policy \nor notice\n\n[[Page H965]]\n\nto be in place, as many other policies and notices are in place at gun \nshooting ranges around the country, that recognize that Federal law \nprohibits certain people, some dangerous people from possessing or \nusing firearms in the United States, and especially the public shooting \nrange that is being funded by the Federal Government under Pittman-\nRobertson.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to remind folks, too, that the law \nalready prohibits certain individuals from possessing a firearm, from \nusing it at a public range. The acquisition or possession of a firearm \nby a person subject to 18 U.S. Code 922, section (g), under any \ncircumstances for any purpose is already a Federal felony. I think the \nlaw already covers that as far as who can and cannot own a firearm.\n  Having the additional effort of saying you can't access a public \nrange is secondary to the primary violation of the law. I think that \nthat is already covered if you are looking at making sure that guns \naren't put in the hands of those folks who are convicted of these \ncrimes.\n  Again, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment. I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same, to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 14, line 3, strike title III.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me, first of all, thank the Rules \nCommittee for making my amendment in order. Let me also thank Mr. \nWittman and Mr. Beyer for their leadership on this issue.\n  Let me state for the record that I am from Texas, where there are \nmany fishermen, many hunters, and many sportsmen and -women, but we are \nalso a people that understand unto whom much is given, much is \nexpected. My amendment speaks to that very issue.\n  My amendment No. 3 strikes title III of the underlying bill that \ncreates a loophole in the Marine Mammal Protection Act that would allow \na handful of hunters to import polar bear trophies into the United \nStates.\n  Let me provide for my colleagues a simple bit of information. Most \npeople do not know, but polar bears are officially classified as marine \nmammals and, as such, are included under the 1972 Marine Mammal \nProtection Act. They are also listed under the U.S. Endangered Species \nAct, affording the iconic animals further protection against hunting, \ntrapping, and capturing.\n  Over the last few years, these laws did not stop a handful of wealthy \nindividuals from flying up to Canada to bag a trophy polar bear for \ntheir collection back home, even though they were warned that U.S. law \nwould prohibit the importation of skins, heads, and other products from \nbears that they were hunting.\n  In 1994, well-funded hunting interests convinced Congress to amend \nthe act, allowing a limited number of bears from trophy hunts, but only \nif the animal came from a designated population that could withstand \nthe loss. Then in 2007, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a proposed \nrule to list the polar bear as threatened. This continues.\n  In the Humane Society letter that supports my amendment, it is \nindicated that, in fact, we may lose two-thirds of the polar bear \npopulation by 2070.\n  My amendment is smart, it is right, it is humane. It responds to the \nconscience and the rightness of this country.\n  I am saddened to see these lovely animals--if I can call them that--\nbecome trophies to make someone else feel good. I ask my colleagues to \nrecognize the importance of taking care of what God has given us.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes a provision of the \nSHARE Act that will allow the importation of 41 polar bears legally \nharvested from sustainable populations in Canada before the polar bear \nwas listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, it always interests me when some people try to undo \nsomething that has already occurred legally.\n  Legally, these bears were taken under license of the Canadian \nGovernment. Legally, they should have been allowed to be imported. And \nthen, Secretary Kempthorne listed the polar bear as a threatened \nspecies. They are not endangered. In fact, we have a study now that the \npolar bear population has increased, not decreased.\n  The point is, these are 41 hides that were shot legally by individual \nhunters under the auspices of the Canadian law with proper guiding \nfacilities, proper taxidermy facilities, and these bears are dead.\n  By the way, as these dead bears come to the United States, they \ncreate money to take and help conserve the rest of the live bears. If I \nwas out buying something or it was given to me and it was declared \nillegal later on, I can't keep it? This is silliness.\n  This is a good part of this bill. It rectifies something that was \ndone legally for hunters that did their hunting legally. Now we are \nsaying that for human purposes, for the protection of the polar bear, \nwe are not going to allow those 41 hides to come back into the United \nStates that were shot legally?\n  We are not going to collect the money we used to save polar bears \nfrom these legally shot bears. This is not about the future. And by the \nway, Fish and Wildlife sort of likes this program.\n  I am always amazed that somebody is going to save a species that is \nnot endangered--in fact, is not threatened--because they are going to \nsave dead bears from coming into the United States that were shot \nlegally.\n  I oppose this amendment. It is a mischievous amendment.\n  This amendment was backed by the Humane Society. Of course they are \ngoing to support her amendment, but the fact is they were shot legally. \nThey should be allowed to be brought back in the country, as they were \nshot under the Government of Canada's auspices.\n  So let's reject this amendment. Let's stick to the facts, not \nemotions.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Virginia also has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have a letter from the Humane \nSociety that I will include in the Record, along with an article \nregarding polar bear hunting.\n\n                                                The Humane Society\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                                February 24, 2016 \n     Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Rep. Jackson Lee: The Humane Society of the United \n     States, Humane Society Legislative Fund, and Humane Society \n     International strongly support your amendment to H.R. 2406, \n     the so-called ``Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational \n     Enhancement (SHARE) Act of 2015.'' This harmful legislation \n     contains a variety of provisions that threaten wildlife, \n     including one that would allow U.S. trophy hunters to import \n     the heads and hides of threatened polar bears from Canada. \n     Your amendment to strike this\n\n[[Page H966]]\n\n     language sends a strong message that our country should be \n     protecting vulnerable species, not carving out exceptions for \n     the small fraction of the hunting public that travels the \n     globe to kill its most majestic creatures.\n       Title III of H.R. 2406 would weaken the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act by permitting the importation of trophies from \n     41 polar bears killed as the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     finalized a rule listing them as threatened under the \n     Endangered Species Act. The wealthy trophy hunters that shot \n     these bears had full knowledge of the pending rule, and knew \n     that U.S. law would likely prohibit them from bringing back \n     their kill. We should not give these hunters a free pass to \n     exploit a regulatory loophole.\n       This is just the latest in a recent series of import \n     allowances by Congress. It would send a message that \n     politically-connected trophy hunters can kill endangered and \n     threatened species around the globe, put the trophies in \n     storage, and wait around for their congressional allies to \n     get them permission to bring the heads and hides into the \n     country for display over mantles in living rooms. The \n     provision does not help rank-and-file hunters and sportsmen, \n     who would never dream of traveling to the Arctic to shoot a \n     polar bear, or to Africa to shoot a lion.\n       Scientists estimate that we may lose two-thirds of the \n     polar bear population by 2050. Congress should do all it can \n     / to protect such vanishing species from extinction instead \n     of incentivizing trophy hunters to kill as many as possible \n     in advance of pending ESA listings. This is a critical \n     measure to ensure the long-term viability of imperiled \n     animals around the globe.\n       When Cecil, the beloved African lion, was killed by an \n     American dentist it shined a light on the shameful subculture \n     of trophy hunters, who spend their fortunes traveling the \n     globe to kill the rarest and most majestic species on earth. \n     We applaud your amendment, which provides real protections \n     for endangered and threatened species.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayne Pacelle,\n       President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United States.\n     Michael Markarian,\n       President, Humane Society Legislative Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From TakePart.com, May 5, 2013]\n\n       Polar Bear Trophy Hunters: Kill Now, Get Permission Later\n\n                            (By David Kirby)\n\n       Most people don't know it, but polar bears are officially \n     classified as marine mammals, and as such are included under \n     the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. They are also listed \n     under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, affording the iconic \n     animals further protection against hunting, trapping and \n     capturing.\n       But over the past few years, those laws did not stop a \n     handful of wealthy individuals from flying up to Canada to \n     bag a ``trophy'' polar bear for their collection back home, \n     even though they were warned that U.S. law would prohibit the \n     importation of skins, heads and other products from the bears \n     they were hunting.\n       Those trophy hunters have in the past managed to secure an \n     exemption from Congress, allowing some of the trophy bears to \n     enter the United States.\n       Now the trophy hunters and their friends in D.C. are at it \n     again. Last week, Rep. Don Young (R-AK) introduced a new bill \n     in the house, ``To amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of \n     1972 to allow the importation of polar bear trophies taken in \n     sport hunts in Canada.''\n       On the Senate side, Mike Crapo (R-ID) offered a similar \n     though slightly more restrictive bill, the ``Polar Bear \n     Conservation and Fairness Act of 2013.''\n       The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 outlawed the sport \n     hunting of all polar bears in the United States and banned \n     the import of any marine mammal product into the country.\n       But in 1994, well-funded hunting interests convinced \n     Congress to amend the act, allowing in a limited number of \n     bears from trophy hunts, but only if the animal came from a \n     designated population that could withstand the loss.\n       Then, in January 2007, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) \n     issued a proposed rule to list the polar bear as \n     ``threatened'' on the endangered species list, which meant no \n     bears from any populations could be imported.\n       FWS had until January 2008 to issue its final ruling. But \n     the deadline came and went and there was still no listing of \n     the bears. A federal court intervened, ordering the agency to \n     publish the rule by May 15, 2008, adding that the new rule \n     would take effect immediately.\n       By law, then, no polar bear killed from any population \n     could be imported after May 15, 2008, into the U.S., \n     regardless of when the permit had been issued.\n       Trophy hunters were given repeated warnings from hunting \n     organizations and government agencies that trophy bears \n     killed in 2008 would not be allowed into the United States: \n     They were hunting at their own risk.\n       Even pro-trophy-hunting groups such as Conservation Force \n     issued repeated and dire warnings to its members, including \n     one in a December 2007 newsletter that stated, ``American \n     hunters are asking us whether they should even look at polar \n     bear hunts in light of the current effort by the U.S. Fish & \n     Wildlife Service to list this species as threatened; [t]he \n     bottom line is, no American hunter should be putting hard, \n     non-returnable money down on a polar bear hunt at this \n     point.''\n       And, the newsletter continued, ``We feel compelled to tell \n     you that American trophy hunters are likely to be barred from \n     importing bears they take this season. Moreover, there is a \n     chance that bears taken previous to this season may be barred \n     as well. American clients with polar bear trophies still in \n     Canada or Nunavut need to get those bears home.''\n       The warning was not heeded by everyone. At least 40 \n     Canadian polar bears were killed by U.S. trophy hunters from \n     March until May of 2008--when they were cautioned that the \n     Endangered Species Act would be in effect, disallowing any \n     imports of trophy polar bears.\n       Now, those polar bear carcasses are collecting dust in \n     refrigerated storage in Canada at great cost to the hunters, \n     who desperately want to bring their trophies back stateside.\n       ``We are disheartened to see this type of legislation \n     introduced in Congress. We have seen it time and time \n     again,'' says Lena Spadacene, policy manager for wildlife \n     protection at the Humane Society of the United States, which \n     has spearheaded the fight against importing polar bear \n     products.\n       A similar bill was introduced in the last session of \n     Congress, Spadacene said, but was defeated by a coalition of \n     conservation groups. ``We worked diligently on that issue and \n     pulled together one of the most comprehensive reports on \n     trophy hunting and exemptions,'' she says.\n       ``The law should be consistently applied, and we should not \n     have a special carve-out for a few trophy hunters who shot \n     polar bears in Canada, knowing full well that they may not be \n     able to import the trophies under U.S. law,'' the report \n     stated.\n       ``While some argue this is just a small number of trophies, \n     it encourages hunters to continue killing protected species \n     in other countries, store the trophies in warehouses, and \n     simply wait for their allies in Congress to get them a waiver \n     on the imports,'' the report said. ``It sets a \n     dangerous precedent, and encourages more killing of \n     threatened species and protected marine mammals, which \n     flies in the face of the Endangered Species Act and Marine \n     Mammal Protection Act.''\n       ``We don't want to reward bad behavior.'' Spadacene says. \n     When the trophy hunters learned that polar bears would be \n     listed as threatened, ``they rushed to Canada to bag \n     themselves a trophy, but some of them did not make it in \n     time. Now they are paying money every month for refrigeration \n     until they can lobby their friends in Congress.''\n       It's a worrying pattern, Spadacene says, and it could \n     easily affect other species in the future.\n       Once it becomes known that a species is about to be put on \n     the endangered list, it motivates some hunters to go out and \n     kill while they still can. And if they miss the deadline, \n     then they hope they can just win an exemption from \n     Washington.\n       ``Passing this legislation now is only going to entice and \n     incentivize the bad behavior even more,'' Spadacene says.\n       She adds, ``Whenever our elected officials grant special \n     exemptions for trophy hunting, it undermines conservation \n     policy. Shooting an iconic species for display or bragging \n     rights and then crying to Congress for a bailout is simply \n     bad form and should not be tolerated.''\n       Spadacene explains the trophy hunters ``were warned of the \n     law and they shot polar bears anyway. If we allow this \n     exemption to happen, we can predict it will happen again with \n     other species, or potentially with polar bears again.''\n       Then there is the question of priorities in Congress. With \n     so many problems vexing the country, is the fate of 40 dead \n     bears really so important that Capitol Hill should vote on \n     this bill?\n       ``The last session was what many considered to be the most \n     ineffective and incompetent legislature in the history of \n     democracy, exactly because they were working on legislation \n     like this,'' Spadacene says. ``It's this kind of special-\n     interest legislation that makes Americans frustrated with \n     Congress. It's so self-serving for a small group of wealthy \n     trophy hunters, and does nothing for the American people or \n     conservation.''\n       Judd Deere, a spokesman for Senator Crapo, has the opposite \n     take on the matter.\n       ``There is nothing more frustrating for the American people \n     than regulations that make no sense,'' Deere says. ``It's \n     frustrating for these hunters, and it's unfortunately \n     requiring Congress to act. This legislation was a commitment \n     that my boss made in the last Congress. We got really close \n     last time. I hope we can get it done this time.''\n       It is sure to be a bitter battle.\n       The polar bear legislation ``is being cast as a private \n     relief measure to help a few hunters bring in a handful of \n     personal trophies,'' the HSUS report said. ``But in reality \n     it would provide incentive for still more killing of polar \n     bears in Canada, by providing more hope to would-be bear \n     slayers they can convince Congress to amend the law just one \n     more time.''\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, scientists estimate, as I indicated, \nthat we may lose two-thirds of the polar bear population by 2050. \nTherefore, we, as custodians of these very precious\n\n[[Page H967]]\n\nanimals, should do all that we can to protect a vanishing species from \nextinction instead of incentivizing trophy hunters to kill as many as \npossible in advance of pending ESA listings. This is a critical measure \nto assure the long-term viability of imperiled animals.\n  Let me also cite for the record that the appeals court upholds \nEndangered Species Act protections for polar bears.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues that we saw an unfortunate \ncircumstance just a few months ago when Cecil the lion was killed out \nof mistake or I don't know what, but this giant of an animal, this \nreflection of the idea of the importance of the animal kingdom, was \nkilled.\n  I introduced H.R. 3448, Cecil the Lion Endangered and Threatened \nSpecies Act. It is similar to the amendment I have today. I ask my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Chair, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Bishop and \nRanking Member Grijalva for their leadership and commitment to working \nto maintain and preserve America's natural resources and wildlife \nhabitat.\n  I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and \nmembers of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee \nAmendment No. 3.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 3 is an important revision to the SHARE Act \nbecause it serves to preserve the original intent of Congress under the \nMarine Mammal Protection Act, as well as the Endangered Species Act.\n  Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment strikes Title III of the \nunderlying bill that creates a loophole in the Marine Mammal Protection \nAct which would allow a handful of hunters to import polar bear \ntrophies into the United States in contravention of current law.\n  While H.R. 2406 purports to enhance recreational outdoor \nopportunities and does in fact have some favorable provisions, Title \nIII, as well as many other harmful provisions make clear, that this \nlegislation would in reality jeopardize already fragile ecosystems and \nnegatively impact animal welfare and wildlife.\n  As a longstanding member of the Congressional Animal Rights Caucus \nand champion of wildlife preservation and protection of animals, I am \ndeeply concerned about the harmful provisions of H.R. 2406 and the \nimpact this legislation will have on endangered and threatened \npopulations.\n  Title III of the SHARE Act is particularly concerning, because it \ncreates a loophole in the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) allowing \nfor a special class of hunters to import polar bear trophies into the \nUnited States in contravention of the law.\n  The MMPA was set up because it was recognized that many marine mammal \nstocks, including polar bears, were in danger of becoming endangered or \nextinct.\n  The sole, most important, objective of the MMPA is to help maintain \nthe health and stability of the ecosystem.\n  The polar bears for which these hunters seek permits for were hunted \nin Canada after the species was proposed for listing as threatened \nunder the Endangered Species Act and was done so with full knowledge \nand warning that U.S. law would prohibit their eventual importation.\n  Enacting Title III of the SHARE Act would threaten this imperiled \nspecies by encouraging hunters to race for trophies the moment a \nspecies is considered for listing under the Endangered Species Act, \nstore them abroad and then seek waivers from Congress to import their \ntrophies later.\n  Granting such a waiver sets a dangerous precedent and sends signals \nto trophy hunters that they can flout the law--effectively rewarding \nhunters who raced to kill polar bears for trophies before their listing \nunder the Endangered Species Act.\n  Alternately, removal of this language will help ensure that hunters \nare not encouraged to seek bad faith waivers from Congress to import \nthreatened and endangered species at a later time.\n  These bears were knowingly hunted in Canada after the species was \nproposed for listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The survival and protection of the polar bear habitat is an urgent \nissue for wildlife experts and those who treasure our natural habitat.\n  H.R. 2406, as it stands, is opposed by virtually every leading \nenvironmental organization in the nation.\n  The Humane Society of the United States, the Humane Society \nLegislative Fund, and the Humane Society International, as well as \nseveral others including the Animal Welfare Institute, Center for \nBiological Diversity, and Born Free USA have all submitted letters in \nstrong support my Jackson Lee Amendment as a necessary provision to \nprovide real protections for endangered and threatened species.\n  Earlier this year, I also introduced H.R. 3448, the Cecil the Lion \nEndangered and Threatened Species Act in response to the tragic killing \nof Cecil the Lion and the impermeable need for greater protections to \nshield all threatened and endangered species from trophy-hunting.\n  You have no doubt heard about the recent tragic illegal killing of \nCecil the Lion, a 13-year-old lion, dominant male of his pride, and one \nof Zimbabwe's most beloved symbols of wildlife and important driver of \ntourism.\n  The hunter, along with hired professionals, lured Cecil out of Hwange \nNational Park and shot him, allegedly without a permit, and collected \nthe head and skin.\n  Beyond Cecil, over two thirds of the world's cat species are \nrecognized as species in need of protection under federal or \ninternational law.\n  My legislation to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973, would \nprohibit the taking and transportation of any endangered or threatened \nspecies as a trophy into the United States.\n  Currently, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) does not protect the vast \nmajority of wild animals killed and imported by American hunters.\n  While the ESA allows for the importation of endangered and threatened \nspecies for scientific research, propagation or survival of the \nspecies, hunters are abusing this limited exception to murder and \ntransport protected wildlife for sport.\n  As a result of the ESA loophole, tens of thousands of wild animals \nare killed every year by American trophy hunters and transported into \nthe United States.\n  In particular, Africa's lion population has declined 90 percent in \nthe past 75 years.\n  The conservation of rare and threatened species is critically \nimportant to the sustainability of our ecosystem and wildlife as we \nknow it.\n  Polar bears, like African lions, currently face unprecedented threats \nby humans on two fronts: sport hunting and loss of habitat.\n  The polar bear and African lion are vulnerable species sitting at the \ntop of the food chain. The health of these animals is an indicator and \nfoundation for the health of the ecosystem as a whole, and by \nprotecting the sustainability of these specific umbrella species, we \ncan have tremendous impacts on entire ecosystems.\n  The International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has ``Red \nListed'' polar bears as a ``Vulnerable'' species--thus, meeting \ncriteria as a threatened species facing a high risk of extinction in \nthe wild.\n  While Canada is the only country that allows for sport hunting of \npolar bears, it is unfortunate that what was once a necessity of life \nfor indigenous Inuit communities in Canada, killing polar bears has now \nbecome a bloody sport for profit and prestige.\n  It is estimated there are 20,000-25,000 polar bears left in the wild \na number that has only been sustainable through federal protection.\n  Mr. Chairman, the SHARE Act of 2015, if enacted would continue to \nthreaten the sustainability of one our most vulnerable species as well \nas the critical preservation of our wildlife.\n  Scaling back protections on vulnerable and threatened species in the \nface of legislation aimed to do otherwise will have substantial adverse \nimpacts on wildlife and conservation efforts, as well as policy \nimplications rewarding those who failed to comply with federal law.\n  We simply cannot afford to let threatened and endangered species die \nneedlessly for sport or profit.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment would protect polar bears while at the same \ntime preserving Congress's intent under the Marine Mammal Protection \nAct and the Endangered Species Act.\n  I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 3.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to reiterate something that \nMr. Young said. There is a thousand-dollar importation fee that is \nassessed on all 41 of those trophies. Those dollars go to polar bear \nconservation and research. So we are looking to use these efforts to \ncontinue the promulgation of this species. We want to make sure polar \nbear populations continue to grow.\n  Hunters provide, I believe, the largest measure of conservation of \nany group out there that is looking to preserve polar bears. It is in \neveryone's interest to make sure these things happen.\n  We have a number of groups out there that are in support of this \nbill: the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, the National Rifle \nAssociation, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Safari Club \nInternational, and the Boone and Crockett Club. All those organizations \nare deeply committed to\n\n[[Page H968]]\n\nmaking sure that we continue and grow these species.\n  We want to make sure we understand that, but hunters are the best \nconservationists on the planet because they are involved in making sure \nthe species continue. They use their resources to put into species \ncontinuation. They want to make sure these species are properly managed \nand that we have good science in managing those species. I believe that \nthis is what we want. We want to make sure that we are encouraging \nthat.\n  This amendment does not allow us to do that. It strikes those \nprovisions. I would strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, there are a litany of organizations \nthat are supporting this amendment: the League of Conservation Voters, \nthe Alaskan Wilderness League, Animal Welfare League, Born Free USA.\n  With respect to lions, let me recite that over the last 75 years, we \nhave lost 90 percent of African lions because we did not have the \nrestraints. I would make the argument that we should not do that in \nthis case.\n  When we let go and let free, we will find out that they will go \nbeyond the 41. They will be calling after polar bears for trophies. We \nneed to ban this in our legislation to ensure the protection of all of \nthose.\n  Let me ask my colleagues to take into consideration the importance of \nour responsibilities of preservation.\n  Trophies? Money?\n  I can assure you that there are a bounty of humane organizations that \nwill provide any amount of dollars to do the research that is necessary \nto protect this vulnerable population. They are listed on the \nEndangered Species Act. They are vulnerable.\n  These trophies should not be an indication to the American people \nthat they can bring in polar bears--who may themselves become extinct--\nbecause we believe that trophies are more important than studying the \nspecies and growing the species to the extent that scientists and \nothers can restrain them and make sure that we do have a population \nwithin the realm and reason of supporting the ecosystem that we need.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would reiterate polar bears are not \nendangered. They are not on the endangered species list.\n  I want to remind folks, too, these 41 trophies were harvested in \nCanada. Canada has a world-class management program for polar bears. \nThey have used the best science.\n  Remember, these polar bears were taken in 2008, based upon the \nscience Canada was using to manage the program. The polar bears in \nCanada, both at the time and now, are increasing in population. Canada \ndoes a great job in managing this.\n  This is just a situation where polar bears legally harvested under \nthe best management programs available should be allowed to come back \ninto the United States. I would encourage my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Costa\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Mrs. Bustos), I offer amendment No. 4.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 20, line 19, strike ``; and'' and insert a semicolon.\n       Page 20, line 21, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 20, after line 21, insert the following:\n       ``(viii) Administrator of the Small Business Administration \n     or designated representative.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Costa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n             Modification to Amendment Offered by Mr. Costa\n\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4 \nbe printed in House Report 114-429 and be modified in the form that I \nhave placed at the desk.\n  The Clerk will report the modification.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n  Modification to amendment offered by Mr. Costa:\n\n       Page 19, line 24, strike ``7'' and insert ``8''.\n       Page 20, line 19, strike ``; and'' and insert a semicolon.\n       Page 20, line 21, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 20, after line 21, insert the following:\n       ``(viii) Administrator of the Small Business Administration \n     or designated representative.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, Representative Bustos and I would like to \nthank Congressmen Beyer and Wittman and the Rules Committee for \nallowing us to present this amendment on the floor.\n  This amendment would help ensure that the interests of small \nbusinesses that rely on wildlife conservation and recreational hunting \ncontinue to thrive.\n  As established by this bill, the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage \nConservation Council Advisory Committee's duties would include advising \nthe Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture on policies and programs \nthat help increase the participation in hunting and wildlife \nconservation activities and promote awareness of the importance of both \nwildlife conservation and the economic benefits of recreational \nhunting.\n  There is no question that recreational hunting has economic benefits. \nIn 2011, hunters put $38.3 billion into our economy. The small \nbusinesses across the country that cater to the needs of these hunters \nand wildlife watchers--be they stores, hotels, trail guides--are \nbedrocks of our local economies that are near our public lands. We know \nthat.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  As is, however, none of the governmental bodies set to serve on this \nadvisory committee that is being proposed as a part of this legislation \nrepresent the perspective or the needs of these small businesses.\n  Small businesses are the economic engine that is driving our economy. \nWe know that. It has been that way for years. They should not be left \nbehind or be left out of this.\n  This amendment would simply add the Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration to be listed as an ex-officio member of this \nadvisory committee.\n  Having a representative from the Small Business Administration or \ntheir designee will strengthen the voice of small businesses that rely \non tourism associated with hunting or shooting or sports or \nrecreational or wildlife activities that this legislation intends to \npromote.\n  So my colleague, Representative Bustos, and I ask that you join us in \nsupporting this small-business amendment ensuring that they have a seat \nat the table by supporting this effort.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, \noffered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n\n[[Page H969]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 49, line 20, after the period, insert ``Such closures \n     shall be clearly marked with signs and dates of closures, and \n     shall not include gates, chains, walls, or other barriers on \n     the hunter access corridor.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the \nnumerous hunters in my district who have called me, very frustrated, \nevery hunting season that the National Forest Service, with no cause, \nno rationale, and no reason, closes down their access to hunt in the \nMark Twain National Forest. With gates, locks and chains, they limit \nthe residents of central and southeast Missouri.\n  I have been contacted by numerous folks in my district about not \nhaving proper postings of corridors within the National Park System \nwhenever they decide to change its random gates. What this amendment \nwould do is it would require the National Forest Service to publish \nsigns of any hunting corridors that they decide to close.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to state that we support this \namendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. Meng\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 59, line 10, strike ``officer'' and insert \n     ``officers''.\n       Page 59, beginning at line 16, strike ``officer'' and \n     insert ``officers''.\n       Page 59, line 20, strike ``one''.\n       Page 59, line 21, strike ``officer'' and insert \n     ``officers''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service law enforcement officers to be placed in diplomatic \nposts abroad in an effort to combat the illegal killing of African \nelephants.\n  Honestly, this is an activity in which the Fish and Wildlife Service \nalready engages. What the underlying bill does in section 1004, \nhowever, which I think is commendable, is explicitly authorizes this \nactivity in law for the first time.\n  Unfortunately, I feel the authorization is overly narrow because it \nallows only one FWS officer to be placed in a single country at a time. \nI think this was likely a drafting oversight and simply wish to allow \nmore than one FWS officer to be assigned to a foreign country at a \ntime.\n  Let me be clear. This amendment does not mandate that multiple \nofficers be sent abroad. It does not authorize any additional funds for \nthese activities. It does not require an increase in any way on the \nnumber of FWS officers placed abroad. It simply allows more than one \nFWS officer to be placed in a single country at any given time.\n  In reality, this amendment could, should we wish it, result in a net \ndecrease in the number of FWS law enforcement agents placed abroad, \nresulting in lowered costs to the U.S. Government for these activities.\n  Imagine a scenario in which elephant poaching and ivory trafficking \nwas running rampant in 20 different nations and we wished to assist in \nthe combating of these activities by leveraging the expertise and \nexperience of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officers.\n  As written, we would only be allowed to place one officer in each \ncountry, for a total of 20 total officers deployed internationally.\n  What if the Secretary of the Interior determined, however, that \nformulating a task force of five specialists, who would be deployed \njointly, as needed, would be the best possible course of action to \ncombat the poaching of African elephants?\n  As written, the SHARE Act would force this task force to be split up \nand housed in five different African nations. The amendment before us, \nhowever, would permit the entire task force to be housed under one \nroof.\n  At the end of the day, housing the entire task force in a single \nlocation could be much more effective strategically and could result in \nsignificant savings to the U.S. Government if it is housed in the \nnation with the lowest cost of living.\n  Mr. Chair, no matter how one may feel about the broader bill before \nus, I feel that section 1004 of the bill is a worthwhile section. I \nhope you will support my amendment seeking to improve it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title X add the following:\n\n     SEC. __ GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     conduct a study examining the effects of a ban of the trade \n     in of fossilized ivory from mammoths and mastodons on the \n     illegal importation and trade of African and Asian elephant \n     ivory within the United States, with the exception of \n     importation or trade thereof related to museum exhibitions or \n     scientific research, and report to Congress the findings of \n     such study.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Huffman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, today I am offering an amendment to the \nSHARE Act to direct the Government Accountability Office to delve \ndeeper into an important issue, and that is the ivory trade, which has \nsparked international concern.\n  Last year my home State of California became the third State in the \ncountry to approve tougher restrictions on the intrastate ivory trade, \njoining New York and New Jersey in that regard.\n  The new California law, AB 96, closes a loophole that had allowed the \nimport of ivory harvested from animals killed before 1977.\n  Now, this loophole made a ban of the import of elephant ivory nearly \nimpossible to enforce because distinguishing between pre- and post-1977 \nivory products would require very expensive isotope testing.\n  The California law also included a ban on the growing trade in \nmammoth ivory--this is ivory discovered in Siberia and elsewhere--\nironically made easier because of warming weather and melting tundra \ndue to the impacts of climate change.\n  There is growing concern that Chinese ivory traders are passing off \nillegal elephant tusks as mammoth ivory in order to avoid international \nelephant ivory bans.\n  But distinguishing between mammoth ivory and elephant ivory requires \ntechnical testing, which makes, again, enforcement of an elephant ivory \nban very difficult unless the mammoth ivory trade is also addressed.\n  Now, some argue that, despite this difficulty, legal mammoth ivory \ncan reduce the market for illegal elephant ivory. Although I don't \nagree with that, I do understand the concerns.\n  That is why, with this amendment, we are simply asking the GAO to \nstudy\n\n[[Page H970]]\n\nthe issue, to look at what various experts have to say, and give us \nsome advice.\n  To make smart policy decisions, we need that kind of information on \nhow a ban on the trade of fossilized ivory from mammoths would affect \nthe illegal importation and trade of elephant ivory within the United \nStates.\n  So I respectfully request your support of this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would request an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 69, line 1, strike title XIV.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, title XIV of this bill would give States and \nterritories the authority to override Federal fishing rules in coastal \nwaters of national parks, national marine sanctuaries, and some marine \nnational monuments. This is simply not right.\n  Places like Biscayne National Park, Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale \nNational Marine Sanctuary, and Rose Atoll Marine National Monument \nbelong to all Americans, not just to the fishing interests in Florida, \nHawaii, and American Samoa.\n  Protection of these special ocean places has overwhelming public \nsupport and is recognized by the scientific community as critical to \nmaking fisheries more productive.\n  What is more, most of these areas do not even preclude fishing. \nCalifornia's national marine sanctuaries generate more than $140 \nmillion a year in economic impact from commercial fishing.\n  Recreational anglers spend more than $100 million a year on fishing \nin the Florida Keys.\n  I attended the public hearing in Homestead, Florida, last year on \nclosing a very small part--less than 6 percent--of Biscayne National \nBay for a marine national monument simply to bring the fish back, many \nfish that fishermen there hadn't seen in years.\n  But fishing is not the only important use of these waters. Whale \nwatching, snorkeling, scuba diving, and scientific research all \ngenerate enormous benefits, not to mention the impact that protecting \ncoral reefs and other diverse productive habitats has on stabilizing \nour oceans and our fisheries in the face of global warming.\n  Sometimes it is necessary to protect certain areas of the ocean, \nparticularly those that have been over-fished in the past or are \nparticularly sensitive to fishing impacts, if we want to support a wide \nvariety of uses and keep our oceans healthy. Science shows that this \nbenefits fishermen in the long run as well.\n  My amendment is simple. It strikes title XIV of H.R. 2406 and leaves \nfishery management decisions in the waters of marine parks, \nsanctuaries, and monuments up to the Federal agencies charged with \nmanaging these resources in trust for all Americans.\n  We would never think of allowing Wyoming to set hunting rules for \nYellowstone, but without this amendment, this bill would allow the same \nthing to happen for our ocean parks that are every bit as magnificent.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, yesterday I noted that one of our \nprincipal objectives of the Federal lands policy must be to restore the \nFederal Government as a good neighbor to the communities impacted by \nthe Federal lands.\n  Gifford Pinchot, the founder of the Forest Service, advised his \nforesters to find out in advance what the public will stand for. If it \nis right and they won't stand for it, postpone action and educate them.\n  That is essentially what this bill does. It says that the Federal \nGovernment needs to listen to States and territories before imposing \nfishing regulations in State waters.\n  This amendment would strip this language and say, in effect: We don't \ncare what local communities think. We know what is best.\n  It speaks volumes about why States and communities are openly \nrevolting against Federal lands policy.\n  Pinchot also advised us to get rid of an attitude of personal \narrogance or pride of attainment of superior knowledge. I would commend \nthat advice to the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, with respect to my colleague and friend from \nCalifornia, I don't think that is the way the system works.\n  In fact, right now fishing limitations are developed in coordination \nwith their respective States and territories. They are just not given \nfinal, blanket veto power. The Park Service and the States benefit from \ncooperative fisheries research and management and full participation. \nMy only personal experience is with the Biscayne Bay where there were \nmany, many public hearings. The public was fully involved. The \nfishermen, pro and con, were fully involved in it.\n  The idea is not to eliminate the close coordination of partnership \nwith the States and with the territories, but, rather, to avoid giving \nthe States and territories the ultimate veto power over what \nessentially are national decisions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.\n  Now, we know the Natural Resources Committee is a rowdy one to \nmanage, with lots of difficult decisions and inflamed passions.\n  But I thank Chairman Bishop and the great subcommittee chairmen and \nall of the members for doing a great job in ensuring that the American \npeople are the ultimate beneficiaries of our amazing public lands and \nwaters.\n  This title XIV language that would be stripped out of the underlying \nbill by this amendment was taken from my bill, the Preserving Public \nAccess to Public Waters Act, which has 36 bipartisan cosponsors, \nincluding nearly two-thirds of the Florida delegation.\n  Floridians understand the importance of balancing environmental, \nrecreational, and economic considerations along our coast because our \nState is the fishing capital of the world.\n  With that balance in mind, we worked to carefully develop and tailor \nthis language so that it would only apply to a very small area of near-\nshore waters with deep importance to fishermen.\n  My colleague and this amendment's sponsor himself said in the \ncommittee markup that the National Park Service and the National Marine \nSanctuaries cover a negligible percentage of waters within traditional \nState jurisdiction.\n  He is right that we are talking about a relatively small area, but \nthese waters have outsized importance to the folks living in nearby \ncommunities.\n  In my district, the National Park Service is attempting to close over \n30 percent of Biscayne National Park's reefs to fishing in perpetuity \nas part of its new general management plan and in opposition to the \nscientific and management expertise of the FWC, Florida Fish and \nWildlife Conservation Commission.\n  FWC has worked for over a decade to develop mutually agreeable and \nscientifically supported fishing restrictions that stop short of a full \nclosure in these waters, but the National Park Service has completely \ndisregarded the State's authority to manage its own fishing resources \nin Biscayne National Park.\n\n[[Page H971]]\n\n  Rather than work with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation \nCommittee, what did the National Park Service do? It decided to \nabdicate its responsibility to the American public to try to balance \nenvironmental, recreational, and economic considerations.\n  Instead, the National Park Service kowtowed to the whims of a single \nspecial interest group that bankrolled tens of thousands of form \nletters from across the country to hijack the public comment section in \nfavor of closing fishing access to State waters upon which local \nfishermen depend.\n  That is not the proper use of the public comment process. It is not \nin the best interests of south Floridians. It is not in the best \ninterests of the American people. It is not reflective of how we should \nmanage public waters.\n  Let me be clear. The title XIV language in this bill is narrowly \ntargeted. It is simply to keep States involved in the management of \ntheir own waters. It does not apply in any way to Federal waters. This \nlanguage is not anti-environment. It does not roll back any existing \nenvironmental protections nor fishing regulations currently enshrined \nin law.\n  Without keeping this language in the bill, Mr. Chairman, the example \nthat the National Park Service is setting in Biscayne National Park \nwill create a terrible precedent for other State and territorial waters \nin similar circumstances.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge all of our colleagues to oppose this \nharmful amendment.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The gentleman from Virginia \nhas 2\\1/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, in response and with respect to my friend, the \nrepresentative from Florida, Biscayne Bay National Park is 164,800 \nacres. These are Federal lands. This is a national park, Federal \nwaters.\n  She mentioned that only they are going to close 30 percent of the \nreefs. It is very important to note that the reef that existed 100 \nyears ago is down to only 6 percent that is left. So the 30 percent \nthat is going to be closed is 2 percent of the original reef.\n  The whole purpose is to actually serve that special interest, the \nfishing interest of Florida, who desperately need the revival of the \nfish.\n  We found at the public hearing that at least half of the fishermen \nthere were for closing it, and all the fishermen pointed out that the \nwater was so far away, it was rarely fished at all. The worry was the \nprecedent, not the specific part that is closed.\n  We point out that Biscayne Bay itself is only less than 2 percent--\n1.4 percent--of all Florida's waters. So this is a very tiny part. But \nthe point here is not for any special interest, but to revise, because \nstudy after study after study have shown that where these marine \nsanctuaries are created, the fish recover much faster even than \nscientists expected.\n  This is for the long-term benefit of the fishing community, for \nanglers throughout the world, especially serving the larger interests \nof the American public.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important \namendment. We resist giving veto power over Federal decisions to State \ngovernments and territorial governments.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 71, Line 13, insert ``the Mark Twain National Forest \n     in the State of Missouri,'' after ``Mississippi,''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, the great outdoors and hunting \ntraditions of the United States are a way of life for folks all over \nour great country.\n  Throughout our history, they have been championed by Presidents \nGeorge Washington, Dwight Eisenhower, and Teddy Roosevelt, who \nestablished national forests, game preserves, and national parks. The \nSHARE Act continues these great traditions.\n  My amendment, which adds Mark Twain National Forest to the list of \nforests provided in the section, assures the residents of Missouri that \nno executive order, no executive action, or no bureaucrat sitting in \nWashington, D.C., who has never set foot on Mark Twain National Forest \nwill write a rule inhibiting the ability to hunt or fish in our \nnational forests.\n  This amendment secures our freedom to be avid sportsmen. Folks in \nMissouri don't want an overzealous administration to be able to come in \nand dictate to the hunters and anglers of Missouri by executive fiat.\n  Over 1.3 million Missourians hunt or fish, and many go to the Mark \nTwain National Forest each year. It covers roughly 2,331 square miles, \n1.5 million acres, most of which reside in Missouri's Eighth \nCongressional District.\n  I ask the body to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am opposing this amendment, first and foremost, \nbecause it, like so many provisions already in the bill, seeks to \nprevent U.S. public lands from being managed for the benefit of all \nAmericans.\n  National forests are lands of many uses, including hunting and \nfishing. But how those uses are balanced should be decided by expert \nland managers at the Forest Service through a process that is open to \nthe public and consistent with our national conservation laws, not by a \nfew well-connected hunters and their allies in Congress.\n  Furthermore, the practice that this section of the bill is trying to \nprotect is using dogs to hunt deer. Not only is this an ethically \nquestionable hunting tactic, it is wildly controversial in the States \nlisted in this title as well as in my State of Virginia.\n  Its opponents, Mr. Chairman, are not who you might think. These are \nnot what was described yesterday as radical leftists. In fact, it is \nthe complaints from private landowners and not overbearing bureaucrats, \nnot environmentalists, that led the Forest Service to ban deer hounding \nin Louisiana's Kisatchie National Forest in 2012.\n  Don't take my word for it. A 2014 column in Louisiana Sportsman \nstated:\n\n       The boot that finally stamped the life out of deer hunting \n     with dogs in Kisatchie National Forest was trespassing on \n     private property . . . homeowners reported people standing on \n     the public roads in front of their homes with guns, waiting \n     for deer to appear. They reported dogs on their property \n     sometimes attacking their chickens or other livestock. And, \n     worst of all, the homeowners reported belligerent and \n     insolent behavior by these people standing on the roads and \n     entering their property to retrieve their dogs.\n\n  Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest, the subject of this bill, was \nthe scene of a major law enforcement action that found 46 people guilty \nof illegally hunting deer with dogs in 2013, this in spite of the fact \nthat the practice had already been banned in Missouri.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n\n[[Page H972]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment that \nis a commonsense amendment that prevents discrimination against hunters \non public Federal lands by preventing the Forest Service from creating \ntheir own hunting laws that are in conflict with State laws on \nneighboring State and privately owned lands.\n  Mr. Chairman, for many people, the public lands on the national \nforests are the only place they have to hunt. There are many traditions \nand many different ways that people enjoy hunting in the outdoors in my \nState as well as others.\n  We already have similar language in the bill for national forests in \nLouisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Arkansas, and I support adding \nthe Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri to this bill.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to emphasize that the \nForest Service doesn't prohibit hunting right now in the Mark Twain \nNational Forest. It simply prohibits hunting deer with dogs.\n  It does this because of complaints from private landowners, not from \nthe environmentalists and not from bureaucrats. This is literally \nrespect for the public input that comes from that.\n  I continue to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is just a \ncommonsense amendment that adds the Mark Twain National Forest to the \nseveral other forests that are mentioned in the four other States.\n  I ask the body to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       After section 1502, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1503. PUBLICATION OF CLOSURE OF ROADS IN FORESTS.\n\n       The Chief of the Forest Service shall publish a notice in \n     the Federal Register for the closure of any public road on \n     Forest System lands, along with a justification for the \n     closure.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Newhouse) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment \nto H.R. 2406, the SHARE Act, and urge my colleagues to support its \nadoption.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It simply requires the Forest \nService to publish a notice in the Federal Register along with a \njustification explaining the decision for the closure of any public \nroad on Forest Service lands.\n  Some of you may ask why this amendment is necessary, and that is \nunderstandable because, fortunately, many Americans have never had to \ndeal with this issue. However, in my district in the Pacific Northwest \nand in many Federal forests across the country, many people have faced \nthe reality that a public road that they have used for decades is \nsuddenly closed. When I say ``closed,'' if I could refer your attention \nto this photograph, there is a picture indicating that a road is no \nlonger even available for use. It is not just a chain going across the \nroad.\n  However, the reality is far worse. When the Forest Service closes \nmany of these public roads, they do so by piling gravel, downing trees, \nor both, in order to block access. At other times, they create what are \ncalled tank traps, essentially large ditches dug into the ground that \nmakes passage impossible. Furthermore, these practices create \nimpediments that not only block human access but can also restrict the \nmovement of wildlife in our national forests.\n  This has become a serious issue in central Washington. For many \npeople who use these roads, it can have detrimental impacts on their \neveryday lives, whether by making their daily travel much longer or by \nrestricting access to campsites or treasured areas in our national \nforests.\n  Some of these roads have been in use for 70 or 80 years, with \ngenerations of Washingtonians using them for forest access and \nrecreation. Yet, in most cases, the Forest Service has closed them \nwithout even first notifying local residents and the surrounding \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I believe the first indication of a public road being \nclosed should not come when an individual or a family is faced with an \nimpassable roadway, but rather through adequate public notice from the \nForest Service. That is why I have introduced this amendment today.\n  Just to be clear, my amendment simply requires the Forest Service to \nprovide notification when closing a public road on Forest Service land \nas well as justification for such a decision. This is an important \nfirst step in ensuring that rural communities and residents are given \nproper warning and advance notice when a public roadway will suddenly \nbe blocked and access to a Federal forest area will no longer be \navailable.\n  Local residents and communities deserve to know when such an action \nis taking place and whether forest action will be denied. This \namendment will guarantee the Forest Service is being transparent in \nfuture decisions and closures.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Newhouse for yielding.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, rural communities deserve better from \ntheir government. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield to the gentleman from Alaska.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment Mr. Newhouse \non introducing this amendment.\n  These roads were built with taxpayer dollars, yet the Forest Service \narbitrarily goes in and shuts those roads down so people don't have \naccess to them.\n  We have the same problem in our forests in Alaska: no notification, \nand then they will spend millions of dollars closing down a road that \nthe public had access to. Their excuse is: well, it is our land. We \ndon't have to worry about other people using this road now, so we will \njust isolate everybody from it.\n  So I compliment the gentleman for the introduction of his amendment.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from the good \ngentleman from Alaska.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in ambivalent opposition to my \nfriend's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to let Representative Newhouse \nknow I completely appreciate the dilemma that he is in and appreciate \nthe motivation for this amendment.\n  My one concern is that it will require the chief of the Forest \nService to publish notice in the Federal Register, along with a \njustification, any time a national Forest Service road is closed, and \nthere may be some unintended consequences which we should at least \nthink about.\n  For example, the amendment will require the Forest Service to publish \nthe\n\n[[Page H973]]\n\nFederal Register notice to close a road that is being engulfed by \nwildfire, or a road that is covered with debris after a tornado or in \njeopardy of being swept away after a landslide, a power line down on \nthe road, or even one that is closed to prevent militants from coming \nand going, as we have recently seen.\n  I certainly am sympathetic to the idea that there should be a \njustification for anything that closes a public road that people have \nused for many, many years, but I also don't want to hamstring them from \nclosing roads that are necessary for the public safety.\n  I tepidly encourage a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I would only say that since this is a \nbill, the SHARE Act, about public access, about use of our treasures, \nour national forests and public lands, all we are asking from the \nForest Service is a little bit of transparency, notice so that people \naren't caught off guard. Certainly there are extenuating circumstances \nwhere notice, if there is a downed power line or debris is in the \nmiddle of a road that makes it impassable, it seems to me that is a \ntime when notice is even more necessary and imperative for the public \ngood.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's comments, but would still urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Fleming\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                  TITLE XVII--UTILITY TERRAIN VEHICLES\n\n     SEC. 1701. UTILITY TERRAIN VEHICLES IN KISATCHIE NATIONAL \n                   FOREST.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Forest Administrator shall amend the \n     applicable travel plan to allow utility terrain vehicles \n     access on all roads nominated by the Secretary of Louisiana \n     Wildlife and Fisheries in the Kisatchie National Forest, \n     except when such designation would pose an unacceptable \n     safety risk, in which case the Forest Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register with a justification \n     for the closure.\n       (b) Utility Terrain Vehicles Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``utility terrain vehicle''--\n       (1) means any recreational motor vehicle designed for and \n     capable of travel over designated roads, traveling on four or \n     more tires with a maximum tire width of 27 inches, a maximum \n     wheel cleat or lug of \\3/4\\ of an inch, a minimum width of 50 \n     inches but not exceeding 74 inches, a minimum weight of at \n     least 700 pounds but not exceeding 2,000 pounds, and a \n     minimum wheelbase of 61 inches but not exceeding 110 inches;\n       (2) includes vehicles not equipped with a certification \n     label as required by part 567.4 of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations; and\n       (3) does not include golf carts, vehicles specially \n     designed to carry a disabled person, or vehicles otherwise \n     registered under section 32.299 of the Louisiana State \n     statutes.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Fleming) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. \n2406, the SHARE Act, which would allow hunters better access to and \nfrom hunting areas in the Kisatchie National Forest in northern \nLouisiana.\n  The Louisiana Legislature passed House Bill 581 by Louisiana \nRepresentative James Armes in 2015. This new State law would allow \nmunicipalities to designate certain local roads for use by utility \nterrain vehicles, also known as UTVs or side-by-sides. These are not to \nbe confused with ATVs, or all-terrain vehicles. They are larger, weigh \nmore, seat multiple passengers, and are often equipped with safety \nfeatures like roll cages, seatbelts, and enclosed cabs.\n  My amendment would build on the Louisiana law to allow seamless \naccess from these designated local roads into hunting areas within \nKisatchie National Forest. The size of these vehicles makes them more \ndifficult to transport when compared with ATVs. The ever-increasing \nlist of features for UTVs makes them very attractive to hunters in \norder to recover game and transport supplies and equipment.\n  This amendment would allow the Secretary of the Louisiana Department \nof Wildlife and Fisheries to nominate roads that would be opened in the \nKisatchie Forest travel plan, unless the Chief of the Forest Service \ndetermined that such an opening would pose an unacceptable safety risk. \nIf so, the Forest Service would have to publish a justification in the \nFederal Register as to why the road could not be opened.\n  I believe my amendment strikes the right balance of public safety and \nhunter access, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nAbraham), my good friend.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend, Dr. Fleming, for \nintroducing this very important amendment. He and I both know that \nhunting is a major part of Louisiana's heritage and culture. In \nLouisiana, hunters themselves are usually the best steward of our \nenvironment.\n  This amendment would give authority to the Secretary of the Louisiana \nDepartment of Wildlife and Fisheries to nominate roads that could be \nopen for utility terrain vehicles in the Kisatchie National Forest.\n  Like Dr. Fleming said, these vehicles have a minimum footprint and \nare much safer than our traditional ATVs. They are often used by \nhunters to recover game and carry supplies and equipment in and out. \nFor far too long, they have been prohibited from sharing municipal \nroads with other users.\n  Dr. Fleming's amendment would simply make Federal law more consistent \nwith existing State laws of Louisiana where these UTVs are commonly \nused in a safe and responsible manner. This would allow hunters greater \naccess to roads within the Kisatchie Forest travel plan.\n  If the Chief of the Forest Service determined that opening a road to \nUTVs would pose an unacceptable safety risk, then they would have the \nauthority to override this nomination. However, they would be required \nto publish their justification in the Federal Register. This is \nimportant to ensure transparency and accountability in the Federal \ndecisionmaking process.\n  The Kisatchie National Forest is one of Louisiana's national \ntreasures. The citizens of Louisiana should not be unnecessarily \nlimited in how they can use this beautiful public space.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Dr. Fleming's amendment.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, it is difficult to be debating two doctors \non one amendment.\n  I do think that one of the dilemmas here is that this amendment, like \nso much of H.R. 2406, the SHARE Act, continues the essential idea that \nwe should be turning over decisions that have been made at the Federal \nGovernment level by the National Park Service, by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, and by the Forest Service to State governments and even to \nlocal governments.\n  This is not a debate on UTVs. I respect that automobiles and all \nkinds of transportation continue to evolve. Rather, it is the idea that \nwe are setting a damaging precedent with regard to our conservation \nlaws and regulations that again and again we are saying that, rather \nthan taking a national perspective, we are turning to the local folks \nto decide what works best for the country.\n  This amendment allows the State of Louisiana, not the Forest Service \ncharged with managing the Kisatchie National Forest for the benefit of \nthe American people, to determine where and whether it is permissible \nto chase down deer with motorized vehicles. These are thoughtful rules \nestablished through an open, public process. They seek to balance \nmultiple uses and prevent abuses in our national forests.\n  The fact that this amendment focuses on off-road vehicles brings to \nmind the illegal 2014 ATV ride through Recapture Canyon in Utah. That \nis the last thing we want to happen in Kisatchie National Forest.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and the precedent that \nit would set.\n\n[[Page H974]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I would like to just say in rebuttal to my \ngood friend that it is very interesting the radical environmental lobby \nwants to set aside the forest for the enjoyment of humans. The only \nproblem is they cut off all access through their lobbying power by \nhumans to this valuable land, like Kisatchie National Forest.\n  If we are going to have a national forest set side for the American \npeople, let the American people enjoy it. As such, they can't get in \nthere without some type of vehicle. If they have game, they can't get \nthe game out unless they have some type of vehicle.\n  As for the Forest Service, yes, of course, the Forest Service opens \nfor public comment, but they still do what they want to do anyway. That \nis the whole problem.\n  It is time that we allow the American people to step forward and \nspeak in favor of their lifestyles, particularly the hunter lifestyle, \nthe ``Sportsman's Paradise'' lifestyle that we enjoy in Louisiana.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FLEMING. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I would just simply like to close and say \nlet's think about the American people, and let's give the American \npeople access to the valuable and beautiful land that we have here in \nthis Nation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Griffith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, this is a civil liberties amendment. It \nclarifies and strengthens existing Federal law.\n  The amendment is necessary, unfortunately, because while the \nunderlying law protects a traveler who is transporting a firearm under \nthe Federal regulations that the firearm has to be locked in a proper \ncontainer and out of the reach of the person if he is in a car, et \ncetera, in one's traveling from State A to State B, sometimes on the \nway from State A, where the gun is lawful, to State C, where the gun is \nlawful, one must pass through State B, where the gun may or may not be \nlawful.\n  What we have found is that, notwithstanding the fact that it is \nlawful in State A and is lawful in State C and is protected by Federal \nlaw while being transported, some State and local governments have \ndecided that they are not going to follow the Federal law, and they end \nup arresting the otherwise law-abiding traveler. We have examples of \nthis. It is not just that they are out and are necessarily looking for \nthe traveler, but there are circumstances that occur.\n  One example that happens fairly frequently is that an airline \npassenger has done everything he is supposed to have done in that he \nhas followed all of the security rules. Then, for reasons beyond his \ncontrol, his flight in State B is missed. So he has traveled lawfully \nand he has checked his gun lawfully, he has done everything he is \nsupposed to have done, but when he gets to the layover terminal, his \nflight is either already gone or it has been canceled.\n  In one case in particular, the gentleman was told ``you need to go a \nhotel. Take your bags. Come back the next morning.'' When he went back \nthe next morning, he was arrested by State law enforcement individuals \nbecause his gun was not legal, notwithstanding the fact that he had \ndone everything he was supposed to have done.\n  In another very tragic situation, a gentleman was traveling from New \nJersey to South Carolina. He was a veteran, so he stopped off in \nWashington, D.C., at Walter Reed, to see one of his doctors. He was \nlawfully transporting the firearm under Federal law and he was \narrested.\n  Now, while most of these cases end up getting worked out either as a \nmisdemeanor or by some other arrangement, it is still a great \nimpediment on the traveler to use the Federal law lawfully.\n\n[[Page H975]]\n\n  This amendment says if that happens, if one is stopped by the State \nor the local government, that the prosecutor in that State or local \narea must prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt that this individual \nwas not following the Federal law. It sounds like a pretty reasonable \nAmerican principle.\n  If it is determined that the traveler was lawful and was actually \narrested and has to go to court to defend himself, the court will award \nattorneys' fees to that individual.\n  We are just trying to make him whole. We are not paying him for the \ntime he served in jail. We are not paying him for the fact that his \nvacation plans or his travel plans were disrupted. We are just saying \nthat there ought to be something that tells the local and State \ngovernments that you ought not do this again or you are going to pay \nthis gentleman or this gentlewoman her attorneys' fees.\n  To me, that is taking care of civil liberties and is making sure that \nthe people who are following the law are not wrongfully arrested \nwithout their having any recourse. I see this as a civil liberties \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would weaken current law, \nundermine State laws concerning the carrying of firearms, and harm the \nefforts of law enforcement to take action against illegal firearms \ntrafficking.\n  Current law applies only to the transportation of a firearm in a \nmotor vehicle. This bill would expand current law to allow a person to \ntransport a gun outside a motor vehicle so long as the firearm is \nunloaded and locked in a container or is secured with a safety device. \nThis would allow a person to walk down the street with an unloaded gun \nas long as the gun had a trigger lock on it, regardless of the State's \nlaws on carrying guns in public.\n  This amendment would also allow guns on trains, cable cars, and \ntrollies so long as the guns are unloaded and locked, regardless of \nState or local laws. This is because trains, cable cars, and trollies \nare not considered to be motor vehicles under the applicable Federal \ndefinition. Current Federal law gives State governments the authority \nover firearms in these forms of transportation, but the Griffith \namendment would remove that authority.\n  The proposed amendment would also have a negative impact on our law \nenforcement officers' ability to enforce our gun laws. Specifically, \nthis amendment would make it more difficult for officers to investigate \nsuspected gun traffickers and people who illegally carry weapons.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Police \nFoundation.\n\nStatement of the Police Foundation Regarding Proposed Amendment to the \n             Sportsman's Bill (HR 2406), February 25, 2016\n\n       The Police Foundation expresses its grave concerns with a \n     proposed amendment to the Sportsman's Bill (HR 2406), by \n     Congressman Morgan Griffith from Virginia, which will have a \n     chilling effect on enforcement of illegal gun possession and \n     other gun crimes. We strongly oppose the amendment's \n     provision that could make law enforcement agencies liable for \n     investigative stops and detentions of armed subjects.\n       Further, the proposed amendment will drastically undermine \n     states' concealed carry licensing laws. States must be able \n     to determine their own concealed carry statutes and \n     regulations that fit the values and enhance the safety of \n     their communities and constituents.\n       At a time when many cities and counties have just witnessed \n     2015 come to an end with increased homicides and non-fatal \n     shootings, Congress should strengthen, not weaken enforcement \n     of our nation's gun laws.\n       We call on Members of Congress to support law enforcement \n     officers as they perform the most dangerous job of \n     confronting shooters and other armed criminals, and to uphold \n     state and local efforts to make communities safer.\n       We urge Members of Congress to oppose the proposed \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. BEYER. The letter expresses the Police Foundation's grave \nconcerns with this amendment. They write that this amendment ``will \nhave a chilling effect on the enforcement of illegal gun possession and \nother crimes.''\n  Why would Congress narrow the limited set of enforcement tools our \npolice officers currently have to pursue suspected gun traffickers?\n  The Griffith amendment subjects a police officer to a personal \nlawsuit when he or she detains or arrests someone whom the officer \nreasonably believed at the time of detainment was illegally trafficking \nor was carrying a firearm.\n  We must respect our officers' ability to use discretion, albeit \nlimited, when determining if gun trafficking is occurring; so \nsubjecting them to personal lawsuits when they are simply trying to do \ntheir jobs to protect us seems a little reckless. These brave men and \nwomen should not be afraid to carry out their investigative duties due \nto the fear of being sued.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Huffman).\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I thank the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am glad that the gentleman brought up the dilemma \nthat this amendment would pose for law enforcement. It would, \nshockingly, actually, impose individual penalties on law enforcement \nofficers who are just trying to do their jobs but who might mistakenly \ndetain someone in connection with his possession of a firearm if he \nwere transporting it in a way that is protected under this amendment.\n  This is going to have a chilling effect on law enforcement's ability \nto protect Americans from gun trafficking, to make us safer at a time \nwhen there are more guns in the hands of more people than ever before, \nwhen we have more accidents, when we are experiencing a tragic gun \nviolence epidemic.\n  I am also concerned that this amendment goes a little further than \njust being a narrow cleanup of the anecdotal stories we heard about \ntravelers who were inconvenienced or detained. As I read the amendment, \nit not only would allow a person to walk down the street with an \nunloaded gun, as long as that gun had a trigger lock on it--regardless \nof State law, regardless of any local rules that may be in effect--it \nwould allow one to take that gun onto trains, cable cars, and trollies \neven if local jurisdictions prohibited that. Again, so long as the gun \nhad a trigger lock in place.\n  Now, in my district we had a tragic incident a couple of years ago in \nwhich a young teenager had a toy AK-47, and law enforcement believed \nthat it was an actual gun that was threatening members of that \ncommunity. They fired shots that took that young man's life. Imagine \nthe dilemma, whether intended or unintended, as a consequence of this \nbill, and people could suddenly go into parks or even onto public \ntransportation with real AK-47s.\n  What kind of dilemma would law enforcement face?\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I have to tell you that I am really \nsurprised that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle aren't \nsupporting this civil liberties amendment. Clearly, they have \nmisinterpreted the amendment.\n  First of all, it only applies if somebody is lawfully transporting a \ngun--where it is lawful in State A to another State where it is lawful. \nIf you are going to be on a trolly car or on a cable car, you have to \nbe transporting that gun from one State to another and it has to have \nbeen lawful to begin with and lawful at the terminis. It is only in the \ninterim that that would be an issue.\n  I would say to the gentleman that this is not about any kind of \npersonal lawsuits against law enforcement officers. It says the court \nshall award attorneys' fees against the local government or the State \nthat is prosecuting the individual. I would also say to the gentleman \nthat it is only for wrongful arrest.\n  I practiced criminal law for 28 years. There is a huge difference \nbetween detention, which my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave alleged this bill would affect, and arrest. This bill does not do \none single thing. They are simply mistaken on detention. It doesn't do \nanything. If you want to\n\n[[Page H976]]\n\nstop somebody, if you want to investigate, he may miss his flight. \nArrest means one has been placed into custody, has been taken down to \nthe station, has been booked, and is having to post bond.\n  That is what this bill deals with. When someone is wrongfully \narrested, when he has been following the Federal law, he should, in \nfact, have his attorneys' fees restored to him. It is reasonable \nattorneys' fees. It is not whatever--the sky and the Moon--the attorney \nmight ask for. A court determines if they are reasonable attorneys' \nfees.\n  This is just a small measure to make sure that when somebody makes a \nmistake and a local government goes forward with a prosecution, that \nyou get some of that back. We are not paying you for being in jail. We \nare not paying you for being arrested. We are not paying you for having \nyour rights taken.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that we are \ncertainly not objecting to reasonable attorneys' fees and to making \npeople whole. It is the idea that law enforcement officers can be held \npersonally responsible and can be, actually, personally sued for doing \ntheir jobs that we object to.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) very \nmuch. I sit on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentleman who is the proponent of \nthe legislation that, first of all, we have a responsibility to keep \nlaw and order; we have a responsibility to protect the Second \nAmendment; and we have a responsibility to law enforcement officers.\n  Tragically, in the backdrop of this debate was an individual who \nsecured guns and killed and slaughtered people just last night. We want \nto make sure that we are safe and that we are dealing with issues that \nare important to protecting our law enforcement.\n  First of all, this amendment is unnecessary. Current Federal law \nalready entitles a person to transport a firearm from one place to \nanother so long as the firearm is unloaded and the needs of the \nfirearms or any ammunition being transported is not readily accessible \nor directly accessible from the passenger compartment, et cetera.\n  This amendment intends to make a Federal open carry law. This open \ncarry law should be one of the State's determinations. It happens to \nexist in the State that I am from. It should not be placed upon the \nentire country by Federal law.\n  Why?\n  Because whether a gun is supposed to be locked or has a trigger on \nit, it still poses a threat, possibly, to our law enforcement.\n  I oppose this amendment because it is unnecessary and because it puts \nour law enforcement persons in danger.\n  I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment and acknowledge the \nshooting in Kansas as evidence that we don't need more guns being \ncarried back and forth on the streets.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Hardy\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Nevada \n(Mr. Heck), I offer amendment No. 13.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n             TITLE XVII--GOOD SAMARITAN SEARCH AND RECOVERY\n\n     SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Good Samaritan Search and \n     Recovery Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1702.

Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Nevada (Mr. Hardy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of a critically important \namendment being offered by my friend and colleague from Nevada, \nCongressman Joe Heck.\n  This amendment would ensure the inclusion of the text of H.R. 373, \nthe Good\n\n[[Page H977]]\n\nSamaritan Search and Recovery Act of 2015, in the underlying bill.\n  The Good Samaritan Search and Recovery Act, of which I was an \noriginal cosponsor, is a commonsense, bipartisan solution to tearing \ndown the bureaucratic roadblocks that are preventing grieving families \nfrom achieving closure when their loved ones go missing on Federal \nlands.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  This issue was first brought to light by the separate, but tragically \nsimilar, cases in Las Vegas of the taxi driver Keith Goldberg and Air \nForce Staff Sergeant Antonio Tucker.\n  Mr. Goldberg and Staff Sergeant Tucker were missing and presumed \ndead, with their remains believed to have been missing somewhere within \nthe Lake Mead National Recreation Area.\n  In both cases, the local, experienced search and recovery groups \nvolunteered their time and resources to help locate the remains of the \nmissing individuals.\n  Unfortunately, due to the unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles from the \nFederal Government, the group volunteering to help locate and recover \nMr. Goldberg's remains was denied access to the Park Service land to \nconduct its search for 15 months and the group volunteering to help \nlocate the remains of Staff Sergeant Tucker were denied access for 10 \nmonths, needlessly delaying the closure their families sought. This is \nabsolutely unacceptable, and it must change. This amendment will do \nthat.\n  Once these bureaucratic hurdles were finally cleared and the Good \nSamaritan search and recovery groups were allowed access to the park, \nMr. Goldberg's remains were recovered in less than 2 hours and the \nremains of Staff Sergeant Tucker were recovered in less than 2 days.\n  Dr. Heck, a former member of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police \nDepartment's search and rescue team, originally introduced this \nlegislation because he could no longer stomach the cases where \nunnecessary red tape continued to get in the way of providing closure \nfor families faced with tragically similar circumstances.\n  During the 113th Congress, a similar bill passed the House with a \nunanimous vote of 394-0, further proving its bipartisan support. \nUnfortunately, the Senate failed to take action on the measure. Last \nApril the House again passed this important legislation 413-0.\n  Mr. Chairman, those are two votes on this Good Samaritan bill \ntotaling 807 in favor and none opposed. Given our current political \nclimate, it just doesn't get more bipartisan than that.\n  We cannot afford to let the Senate's inaction get in the way of \nachieving this critical fix that will provide closure for so many \nAmericans. We must pass this amendment so that future families won't \nhave to suffer the mental anguish and heartache that the families of \nKeith Goldberg and Antonio Tucker did.\n  In closing, I again thank my colleague from Nevada for offering the \namendment that will truly help the people we serve.\n  I also thank the chairman and ranking member of the Natural Resources \nCommittee for all their diligent work in the Good Samaritan Search and \nRecovery Act.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Nevada. I urge \nmy colleagues to strongly support this amendment.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Ribble\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n\n                         TITLE __--GRAY WOLVES\n\n     SEC. _01.

REISSUANCE OF FINAL RULE REGARDING GRAY WOLVES IN \n                   WYOMING.\n\n       Before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     reissue the final rule published on September 10, 2012 (77 \n     Fed. Reg. 55530), without regard to any other provision of \n     statute or regulation that applies to issuance of such rule. \n     Such reissuance shall not be subject to judicial review.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Ribble) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am proud today to offer the only bipartisan amendment that has been \nfound in order on this bill. I am really proud, after working in \nCongress now for three terms, that Members from both the majority and \nthe minority have come together in an effort to protect the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  This amendment speaks directly to the issue of gray wolves protected \nby the Endangered Species Act in the western Great Lakes region of \nWisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota, as well as Wyoming.\n  There was a period of time that the gray wolves had become almost \nextinct in these areas and the scientists at the Fish and Wildlife \nService decided to protect them from extinction by listing the gray \nwolf as an endangered species.\n  That work was so successful that, in 2011, the Fish and Wildlife \nService decided to de-list the gray wolf. In fact, there are now \nhundreds of mating pairs in these regions. However, those wolves have \ncreated some problems.\n  In spite of this remarkable recovery, in spite of how robust this is, \na surprise Federal court ruling took place in 2014 and invalidated the \nscientists at the Fish and Wildlife Service who were given the \nresponsibility under law of the Endangered Species Act to manage this \npopulation.\n  So my amendment is simple. It just simply restates and delists the \nwolves in these four States only. That is what my amendment does. It \nprotects the Endangered Species Act and the scientists who work at the \nFish and Wildlife Service.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, that was extraordinary. We are here to \nprotect the Endangered Species Act by preempting litigation for \nviolations of the Endangered Species Act. That is pretty extraordinary.\n  I mean, we are not only having Groundhog Day here--because this bill \nhas passed three times before and failed to receive any consideration \nin the Senate and the same thing will happen yet again with this bill--\nbut now we are wandering into Alice in Wonderland. That is \nextraordinary.\n  Yes, the Fish and Wildlife Service did delist in the States the \ngentleman mentioned, but they required that each of those States adopt \nscientifically based management plans.\n  Well, the scientifically based management plan in Wyoming is open \nseason on wolves. Let's try and exterminate them again. There has also \nbeen a tremendous loss of population in a number of the other States \nthat the gentleman referred to.\n  So a judge has found that they violated the Endangered Species Act \nbecause they didn't adopt scientifically based management plans.\n  You know, these are horrible predators, as you can see here. They are \nvery, very fierce. They are, of course, responsible for huge, huge, \nunbelievable--big, as Donald Trump would say, really big--depredation \non cattle.\n  Let's look at the causes for loss of cattle. Well, let's see. \nSeventy-four percent died because of health issues--perhaps we need a \nlittle education on husbandry for some of our ranchers--7.8 percent \ndied due to weather--well,\n\n[[Page H978]]\n\nwe are not having climate change; so, there is nothing we can do about \nthe weather. We don't want to mess with that--2.7 percent is due to \nother predators, mostly coyotes.\n  Animal damage control, now renamed very aptly Wildlife Services, has \nkilled well over a million coyotes. And guess what. There are more \ncoyotes now, more distributed than when they started trying to \nexterminate them.\n  The wolves are in a much more fragile place. They are responsible for \n0.9 percent of the depredation, and they are at critical population \nlevels. They were required to keep 10 breeding pairs in Wyoming. Boy, \nthat is a lot of wolves in a State the size of Wyoming, 10 breeding \npairs.\n  Well, they violated that, and that is why the judge made this ruling. \nNow we are being told we are here to protect the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record, in light of the \ngentleman from Oregon's comments, a letter from the Fish and Wildlife \nService supporting this amendment.\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,\n\n                         Bloomington, Minnesota, January 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Reid J. Ribble,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Ribble: Thank you for your January 16, \n     2015, letter to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) \n     Director Dan Ashe and to me regarding the Service's views on \n     the status of gray wolf populations in the states of \n     Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as our view on \n     state management of gray wolves since the Western Great Lakes \n     Distinct Population Segment (DPS) was removed from Endangered \n     Species Act protection in 2011. An identical letter is being \n     sent to each member who signed the original correspondence. \n     Director Ashe has asked that I respond on his behalf.\n       Most of the information provided below is taken from the \n     2014 report on post-delisting status of gray wolves in the \n     Western Great Lakes DPS (enclosed). Enclosed, you will also \n     see our gray wolf post-delisting monitoring plan for the \n     Western Great Lakes DPS.\n       Our post-delisting monitoring plan used the recovery goals \n     in the 1992 Recovery Plan for the Eastern Timber Wolf to \n     identify the population characteristics that needed \n     monitoring as well as to identify circumstances that could \n     prompt closer scrutiny by the Service and potential \n     consideration of relisting. Those circumstances include the \n     following:\n       A decline that reduces the combined Wisconsin-Michigan \n     (excluding Isle Royale and the Lower Peninsula) late winter \n     wolf population estimate to 200 or fewer wolves;\n       A decline that brings either the Wisconsin or the Michigan \n     (excluding Isle Royale and the Lower Peninsula) wolf estimate \n     to 100 or fewer wolves; and,\n       A decline that brings the Minnesota winter wolf population \n     point estimate or lower end of the 90% confidence interval to \n     1500 or fewer wolves.\n       Since delisting in 2011 through the winter of 2013-2014, \n     numbers of wolves in the three states remained well above \n     established recovery goals (Table 1). Population surveys are \n     conducted by the three states in late winter after hunting \n     and trapping seasons and before the birth of pups in the \n     spring. Thus, the surveys are conducted at a time that the \n     wolf population is at its lowest level during the annual \n     cycle.\n\n  TABLE 1.--RECENT POPULATION ESTIMATES FOR GRAY WOLVES IN MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, AND WISCONSIN. INCLUDED IS THE\n  LAST POPULATION ESTIMATE COMPLETED BEFORE THE WOLF WAS DELISTED AND TWO ESTIMATES COMPLETED AFTER DELISTING.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      Gray Wolf Population Estimates\n                         State                          --------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                2011-2012            2012-2013       2013-2014\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichigan...............................................                      687         602-714         594-678\nMinnesota..............................................        2,921 (2007-2008)           2,211          22,423\nWisconsin..............................................                  815-880         809-834         660-689\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Differences in the trends of wolf numbers among the three \n     states are likely due to different levels of human-caused \n     mortality (Table 2). Also, it is suspected that a decline in \n     white-tailed deer may have played a role in the initial \n     decline of Minnesota wolves after delisting (Table 1). \n     Regardless of the different trends, the wolf population \n     remains well above the original recovery goals for the entire \n     population and within the individual states. In Michigan and \n     Wisconsin, there were at least 594 and 660 wolves, \n     respectively, in early 2014 and the number of wolves in \n     Minnesota appears to have stabilized at around 2400 wolves \n     (Table 1).\n\n  TABLE 2.--WOLF DEATHS CAUSED BY TWO SOURCES OF HUMAN CAUSED MORTALITY, CONTROL OF DOMESTIC ANIMAL DEPREDATION AND HARVEST BY HUNTERS AND TRAPPERS, IN\n THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES DISTINCT POPULATION SEGMENT DURING THE PERIOD WHEN WOLVES IN THE REGION WERE NOT LISTED AS ENDANGERED OR THREATENED, 2012-2014.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      2012                                   2013                                   2014\n               State                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Depredation    Harvest       Total     Depredation    Harvest       Total     Depredation    Harvest       Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichigan...........................           17    No season           17           10           23           33           13    No season           13\nMinnesota..........................          295          413          708          127          238          365          211          272          483\nWisconsin..........................           76          117          193           65          257          322           35          154          189\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The relationship between human-caused mortality and wolf \n     population numbers is well established and evident in the \n     population trends among the three states. In Wisconsin, 14% \n     of the population was harvested by hunters and trappers in \n     2012, yet no change in wolf numbers was detected in the \n     subsequent survey completed during late winter of 2012-2013 \n     (Tables 1 and 2). In 2013, 32% of the population was \n     harvested and the wolf population declined by about 18%. In \n     Minnesota, the decline of the population between 2007-2008 \n     and 2012-2013 was 24 to 25% and was likely caused by hunter/\n     trapper harvest, depredation control, and a 23% decline in \n     deer between 2007 and 2012. In response to the wolf \n     population decline, the Minnesota Department of Natural \n     Resources reduced wolf harvest levels and the population \n     appears to have stabilized. In Michigan, human-caused \n     mortality of wolves by hunters and for depredation control \n     has been relatively minor after delisting and the Michigan \n     wolf population has shown no significant change (Tables 1 and \n     2).\n       Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin have managed wolves \n     according to state wolf management plans that the Service \n     evaluated as part of our decision to delist the species in \n     2011. Our evaluation led to a determination that each state's \n     plan provided for the long-term conservation of a viable wolf \n     population in the region. The state management plans and our \n     evaluation acknowledged that the states could carry out \n     regulated harvests after delisting. In the final rule to \n     delist the Western Great Lakes DPS we made the following \n     comment:\n       ``Unregulated killing was the primary threat to the species \n     historically. The State management plans that will be \n     implemented after delisting provide protection from \n     unregulated killing. It is not the Service's position to \n     decide whether a regulated harvest in and of itself is an \n     appropriate management tool. Instead the Service is concerned \n     with whether the use of that tool might reduce the number of \n     wolves in such a way that they would again be considered a \n     threatened or endangered species under the Act. A regulated \n     harvest of wolves can be carried out in a manner that would \n     not threaten their continued existence.''\n       Since delisting, the states have demonstrated effective \n     management to ensure wolf populations remain viable.\n       We value the cooperation and contributions that state and \n     tribal biologists have made to ensure that the Service could \n     monitor the post-delisting status of wolf populations. Staff \n     from each Department of Natural Resources has been highly \n     responsive to our requests for information, even after the \n     wolf was relisted. We believe that each state has \n     demonstrated an ability to respond to the challenges that are \n     unique to conservation of wolves in the wild. Moreover, they \n     have done so in ways that demonstrate their intent to \n     maintain the wolf as a viable component of their ecosystems.\n       Thank you for your concerns regarding the wolf and its \n     status. If you have any further questions or concerns, please \n     feel free to contact Mr. Peter Fasbender, Field Supervisor \n     for our Twin Cities Ecological Services Field Office.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas O. Melius,\n       Regional Director.\n     Hon. Reid J. Ribble,\n       House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Collin C. Peterson,\n       House of Representatives Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dan Benishek,\n       House of Representatives Washington, DC.\n     Megan Kelhart,\n       Division of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC.\n     Mr. Peter Fasbender,\n       Field Supervisor, Twin Cities Ecological Services Field \n     Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bloomington, MN.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n\n[[Page H979]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chair, I am just stunned by the misrepresentations \nof the previous opponent of this bill. Let me show you what is going on \nreally.\n  Here is the habitat of the wolf. Clearly, it is not endangered. On \nthe red list, it is considered a species of least concern.\n  Let's look at the habitat of the Shiras moose. This is Wyoming, \nMontana, Idaho, and going into Montana. The Shiras moose is in rapid \ndecline, and it is because of this critter.\n  Now, the gentleman from Oregon showed you little puppies as if they \ndo no damage. Look at this moose. This Shiras moose is surrounded by \nwolves, and they are attacking that baby.\n  The reason this is such a big issue is they are wiping out the \nbabies. So there is no longer a breeding population of moose or elk in \nmajor areas of this country, including the Lolo elk herd in Montana and \nthe moose around the Greater Yellowstone area in Wyoming.\n  It is these baby moose they are after. They surround the mother. Two \nof them distract the mother. The rest of them take the babies.\n  There are not enough breeding females left. So when the older females \nage out of the population, there are no breeding females to take their \nplace. It is the wildlife that is getting decimated, Mr. Chairman. This \nis a wildlife issue.\n  To save the moose, I strongly encourage the adoption of this \namendment.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, actually, I think wolves are part of \nwildlife. I heard a mention of Montana Yellowstone.\n  Actually, in Yellowstone, the rivers were in horrible, horrible \ncondition because all of the browse that was being done by elk and \nother critters right down into the streams. Fish populations were \ncrashing. The water was too hot and lost all of the riparian cover.\n  Now you find we have restored balance because there are wolves there \nand the elk and others stay in herds and they stay in the forest. They \ndon't go down and stomp around in the streams.\n  Natural balance is sometimes problematic. The gentlewoman showed a \npicture of a moose under attack. Fairly natural.\n  I don't believe that that is the total cause for the problems with \nthe moose population. In fact, those moose are still hunted. So I guess \nwe need to save the moose from the wolves so the hunters can hunt the \nmoose.\n  So I am on the side of the wolves on this one. I think most American \npeople would like to see this iconic predator restore balance.\n  Coyotes are three times the predators on cattle. If you want to \nprotect cattle, guess what. Wolves kill coyotes. But when you don't \nhave wolves, the coyotes spread and take over.\n  The gentlewoman showed Russia and China and then Canada and a few \nother areas on a map. Those aren't gray wolf populations in many of \nthose areas.\n  I don't know what Siberian wolves look like, but I don't think that--\nsince the land bridge went away, whenever that was, they haven't been \ncoming to the United States. And I don't know about Chinese wolves. I \ndon't know anything at all about Chinese wolves.\n  I do know that wolves here are in a fragile state of recovery. If you \nhunt them back to extinction, which is what basically is going on in \nWyoming, or you hunt below the levels for sustainable populations, as \nsome of these other States are doing with trophy hunting and that, then \nwe are going to be back where we started with the wolves being \nextinguished in the lower 48 and more coyotes.\n  Maybe you will have some more moose. Maybe the elk can go back in the \nstreams in Yellowstone. They probably miss thrashing around in there \nand eating all the riparian cover.\n  I think that this amendment, to substitute political science for \nsound science and for Congress to preempt litigation with this, is \nsomewhat unprecedented, to say the least.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I have not mentioned protecting cattle at \nall. Maybe some of my colleagues will. I have only mentioned trying to \nprotect the Endangered Species Act.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/4\\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan \n(Mr. Benishek).\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for \nthis amendment and the time.\n  I rise today in support of this amendment for the SHARE Act. This \namendment directs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue a rule \nto delist the gray wolf in Wyoming and the Great Lakes region, which \nincludes my State of Michigan.\n  In 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the wolf \nrecovered in Wyoming and the Great Lakes and would remain recovered \nunder federally approved State management plans.\n  I can speak from personal experience about the impact that wolves and \ntheir recovery are having on my district. This photo next to me is of a \nconstituent in my district. One of his calves was attacked and eaten by \na wolf, which may not mean much to the opponents of this, but it means \npretty much to small farmers in Michigan. It isn't just the cattle.\n  As the number of wolves have increased well beyond the recommended \nnumber for recovery, we have seen drastic declines in the deer \npopulation in northern Michigan. My camp has no deer. The economy of \nthe whole area is in collapse because there is no hunting anymore.\n  I understand that some are opposed to ever delisting the wolf, but as \nnumbers continue to expand, we must consider the impact the wolf has on \nthe landscape as a whole. This amendment does not change the Endangered \nSpecies Act. It simply allows for the following of true sound science.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. The gray wolf was recovered in the Great Lakes and \nready for delisting and State management.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I will go ahead and close.\n  About two decades ago, there were only 15 gray wolves in the western \nGreat Lakes States. Today the gray wolf population exceeds 3,700, and \nyet we are to act as if some judge someplace decides that that is not \nenough, that the States of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Wyoming in \nand of themselves cannot manage these populations in accordance with \nthe Fish and Wildlife's actions and with their scientific help.\n  This is not unprecedented, as the minority has mentioned. This \nexactly has happened with Montana and Idaho before.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Ribble, \nLummis, Benishek, and Peterson amendment.\n  Managing gray wolves continues to be a huge problem in my state of \nMinnesota. In spite of the overwhelming evidence by the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service that the gray wolf population in the Western Great \nLakes States has not only recovered, but thrived in the past few years, \na single judge in Washington, D.C. unilaterally decided that gray \nwolves somehow need federal protection. In 2014, Minnesota had nearly \n2,500 gray wolves, by far the highest number in any state besides \nAlaska.\n  This has put the farmers and ranchers in my district in a very \ndifficult situation. They are now forced to choose between following \nthe law or protecting their livestock and livelihoods. Our amendment \nsimply reinstates Fish and Wildlife's original decision to delist gray \nwolves in the Western Great Lakes States from Endangered Species Act \nprotections and allows the agency to relist gray wolves if science \nsupports it. I believe this amendment is scientific and fair.\n  This is a real problem that needs immediate solution. The states--not \nthe federal government--are best equipped to manage gray wolf \npopulations and provide assistance when problem wolves harass my \nconstituent's livelihoods.\n  I urge Members to support this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ribble).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by\n\n[[Page H980]]\n\nthe gentleman from Wisconsin will be postponed.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 15 Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n                   TITLE __--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. _01. PROHIBITION ON ISSUANCE OF FINAL RULE.\n\n       The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \n     shall not issue a final rule that--\n       (1) succeeds the proposed rule entitled ``Non-Subsistence \n     Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and Closure \n     Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska'' (81 Fed. \n     Reg. 887 (January 8, 2016)); or\n       (2) is substantially similar to that proposed rule.\n\n     SEC. _02. WITHDRAWAL OF EXISTING RULE REGARDING HUNTING AND \n                   TRAPPING IN ALASKA.\n\n       The Director of the National Park Service shall withdraw \n     the final rule entitled ``Alaska; Hunting and Trapping in \n     National Preserves'' (80 Fed. Reg. 64325 (October 23, 2015)) \n     by not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and shall not issue a rule that is substantially \n     similar to that rule.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a relatively \ncomplicated amendment in the sense that a lot of people don't have any \nhistory of the Alaska National Lands Act.\n  My amendment prohibits the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service \nfrom issuing a final ruling that would seize authority from the State \nof Alaska's Alaska Fish and Game to manage fish and game on all lands. \nThat was under ANILCA.\n  My amendment also withdraws the existing National Park Service rule \nthat interferes with State wildlife management authority under the \nNational Preserve Lands of Alaska, agreed to by this Congress. The \nAlaska National Interest Land Conservation Act, ANILCA, passed by \nCongress, signed into law in 1980, protects the ability of the State of \nAlaska to manage wildlife across the State on State, private, and \nFederal lands.\n  As Alaska's lone Representative and someone who was intimately \ninvolved in the process of producing ANILCA, an agreement with my \ncolleagues, it is my conclusion that the proposed rule set forth by the \nFish and Wildlife Service and Park Service is in clear violation of \nFederal law.\n  The scope of the proposed Fish and Wildlife Service rule is enormous. \nThere are 76.8 million acres of wildlife refuges in Alaska, an amount \nof land about the size of four Michigans, at least two or three \nVirginias, and on top of that there is 20 million acres of national \npreserves in Alaska, a total of 100 million acres in the State of \nAlaska.\n  But when that agreement was set out, we were to retain management of \nfish and game on all lands, and that is in the law. Very frankly, my \ncolleagues, this is a regulatory overreach by this administration, \npromoted by this administration, breaking the law.\n  Now, the Fish and Wildlife Service asserts their actions are allowed \nby the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. However, as the \noriginal sponsor of that act, I can knowingly and affirmatively state \nthat the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal goes beyond the original \nintent of my legislation that was passed by this House.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act specifically \nstates that ANILCA takes priority over any other conflicts regarding \nrefuge lands in the State of Alaska. I find it somewhat concerning that \nthe Fish and Wildlife would cite a law which forbids them from taking \nsuch actions and then say the justification is because of the law. It \nis not. This is a special interest pressuring group that says that Fish \nand Wildlife will take away the States' rights.\n  If you believe in States' rights, you will take and support this \namendment that I am offering. If you believe in the Federal Government \nonly, not the United States of America, the United States as the \nFederal Government, you will oppose this amendment.\n  I am asking my colleagues to think about what is occurring here: the \noverreach of this Federal Government that has taken away the rights of \nStates and is continuing to try to do it.\n  I urge the passage of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Womack). The gentlewoman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, with nothing but the deepest respect for \nmy colleague from Alaska--and I even want to tell him, I was afraid to \nstand up without getting clearance from one of your other good friends, \nthe resident hunter in my household--but this amendment is yet another \nattempt to allow a State to override perfectly reasonable conservation \npolicies on U.S. public lands.\n  This amendment would prevent the Park Service from managing wildlife \non these lands, even though they are owned by the American taxpayers, \nnot by the State of Alaska.\n  Of particular concern is Alaska's policy of eradicating keystone \npredator species. Because of this policy, allowing wolves and bears to \nseek refuge on these Park Service lands may be the only way to keep \nthem from requiring protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n  I want to be clear about what this rule does and does not do. It does \nnot deny access to hunting. This rule does not reduce hunting in the \nnational preserves in Alaska, period. In fact, it keeps existing \nhunting rules in place.\n  What the rule does do is ban some of the most inhumane and \necologically damaging forms of hunting, things that a true sportsman \nwould never do anyway. Let me share examples. This rule would prevent \nspotlighting black bears and shooting them and their cubs, babies in \ntheir den. It would prevent using bait to attract and kill bears. It \nwould prevent killing wolves during their denning season. Again, \nbabies. And it would prevent the killing of caribou from a motorboat \nwhile under power. Yes, if a deer is swimming and you go after it in a \nboat, it would prevent that caribou that is swimming from being shot.\n  If you think people should be allowed to do any of these what I think \nare unsportsmanlike things, then this amendment is for you. But if you \nare like most Americans, you will be deeply disturbed by these \npractices and will join me in opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, may I remind my good friend from \nMichigan--and she is a dear friend and her husband is a dear friend of \nmine, he voted for my bill, ANILCA--it is the law. It was an agreement \nthat the State would manage.\n  By the way, it is against the law to shoot species of animals from a \nboat. This doesn't change that. It changes the management concept. It \nis overreach by the Federal Government. It is overreach by Fish and \nWildlife. They would not be fish and wildlife managers anymore. They \nare becoming the preservationist group without the management ability \nin the State that lives there.\n  I am not changing anything other than just the fact that the State \nstill has authority under ANILCA. He voted for it. I am suggesting, \nrespectfully, if you want the Federal Government to manage everything, \n100 million acres that we agreed that we could manage in the ANILCA \nlaw, the State, if you want the government to take that all over, let's \njust give the government all the land. Let's stop having free land.\n  You talk about being public land, the public that lives there, they \nwant the State to manage the land. So far they have done a great job.\n  As far as shooting bears, that is against the law in the State of \nAlaska.\n  Now, why are we saying that?\n  Because it is emotionally acceptable. So let's stick to the facts. \nThis is a fact.\n  Do you want the administration, the government to manage all lands or \ndo\n\n[[Page H981]]\n\nyou want to follow the law that we passed in this Congress?\n  The law.\n  We have a tendency here to forget what happened, this Congress. Look \nat the history of ANILCA. It was a compromise. A lot of it I objected \nto, but we passed it in this House and it was accepted by the State \nwith the understanding that the State would manage fish and game and \nnot the Federal Government.\n  By the way, the Park Service in the State of Alaska, the Fish and \nWildlife in the State of Alaska, in the beginning the BLM are not \npartners anymore. It is all run from Washington, D.C.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I have nothing but the utmost respect for \nmy colleague from Alaska. I actually think that he and my spouse share \nthe same sportsmanship policies of hunting, but this rule just \nsimplifies and updates procedures for closing an area or restricting an \nactivity. It updates obsolete subsistence regulations and it prohibits \nvery specifically some of these things that I spoke about. I think we \nwill respectfully disagree.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n      TITLE__--PRESERVATION OF ARCTIC COASTAL PLAIN AS WILDERNESS\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Udall-Eisenhower Arctic \n     Wilderness Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Americans cherish the continued existence of expansive, \n     unspoiled wilderness ecosystems and wildlife found on their \n     public lands, and feel a strong moral responsibility to \n     protect this wilderness heritage as an enduring resource to \n     bequeath undisturbed to future generations of Americans.\n       (2) It is widely believed by ecologists, wildlife \n     scientists, public land specialists, and other experts that \n     the wilderness ecosystem centered around and dependent upon \n     the Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, Alaska, represents the very epitome of a primeval \n     wilderness ecosystem and constitutes the greatest wilderness \n     area and diversity of wildlife habitats of its kind in the \n     United States.\n       (3) President Dwight D. Eisenhower initiated protection of \n     the wilderness values of the Arctic coastal plain in 1960 \n     when he set aside 8,900,000 acres establishing the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Range expressly ``for the purpose of \n     preserving unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational \n     values''.\n       (4) In 1980, when the Congress acted to strengthen the \n     protective management of the Eisenhower-designated area with \n     the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act (Public Law 96-487), Representative Morris \n     K. Udall led the effort to more than double the size of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and extend statutory \n     wilderness protection to most of the original area.\n       (5) Before the enactment of the Alaska National Interest \n     Lands Conservation Act, the House of Representatives twice \n     passed legislation that would have protected the entire \n     Eisenhower-designated area as wilderness, including the \n     Arctic coastal plain.\n       (6) A majority of Americans have supported and continue to \n     support preserving and protecting the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, including the Arctic coastal plain, from any \n     industrial development and consider oil and gas exploration \n     and development in particular to be incompatible with the \n     purposes for which this incomparable wilderness ecosystem has \n     been set aside.\n       (7) When the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was \n     established in 1980 by paragraph (2) of section 303 of the \n     Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Public Law \n     96-487; 94 Stat. 2390; 16 U.S.C. 668dd note), subparagraph \n     (B)(iii) of such paragraph specifically stated that one of \n     the purposes for which the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \n     established and managed would be to provide the opportunity \n     for continued subsistence uses by local residents, and, \n     therefore, the lands designated as wilderness within the \n     Refuge, including the area designated by this title, are and \n     will continue to be managed consistent with such \n     subparagraph.\n       (8) Canada has taken action to preserve those portions of \n     the wilderness ecosystem of the Arctic that exist on its side \n     of the international border and provides strong legal \n     protection for the habitat of the Porcupine River caribou \n     herd that migrates annually through both countries to calve \n     on the Arctic coastal plain.\n       (9) The extension of full wilderness protection for the \n     Arctic coastal plain within the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge will still leave most of the North Slope of Alaska \n     available for the development of energy resources, which will \n     allow Alaska to continue to contribute significantly to \n     meeting the energy needs of the United States without \n     despoiling the unique Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--The Congress hereby declares that \n     it is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to honor the decades of bipartisan efforts that have \n     increasingly protected the great wilderness ecosystem of the \n     Arctic coastal plain;\n       (2) to sustain this natural treasure for the current \n     generation of Americans; and\n       (3) to do everything possible to protect and preserve this \n     magnificent natural ecosystem so that it may be bequeathed in \n     its unspoiled natural condition to future generations of \n     Americans.\n\n     SEC. _03. DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL WILDERNESS, ARCTIC \n                   NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, ALASKA.\n\n       (a) Inclusion of Arctic Coastal Plain.--In furtherance of \n     the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), an area within \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the State of Alaska \n     comprising approximately 1,559,538 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled ``Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge--1002 Area Alternative E--Wilderness Designation'' and \n     dated October 28, 1991, is hereby designated as wilderness \n     and, therefore, as a component of the National Wilderness \n     Preservation System. The map referred to in this subsection \n     shall be available for inspection in the offices of the \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n       (b) Administration.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     administer the area designated as wilderness by subsection \n     (a) in accordance with the Wilderness Act as part of the \n     wilderness area already in existence within the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge as of the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Huffman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, there are some iconic places in this \ncountry that define America. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in \nnortheastern Alaska is one of those places. It is a one-of-a-kind \ntreasure.\n  Today, for the first time, the full House of Representatives has an \nopportunity to cast a vote to permanently preserve and protect this \nspecial place.\n  Now, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), my Republican \nfriend, has joined me in introducing the underlying bill that is \nincorporated in this amendment. Together, we are carrying the torch \nthat prior generations of bipartisan leaders have carried. They have \nunderstood that America's Arctic is a uniquely wild place.\n  It was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who first established \nFederal protections for the coastal plain in 1960 and Democratic \nChairman Mo Udall who expanded the refuge, doubling its size in 1980.\n  I had the great privilege to visit the Arctic Refuge last summer. I \ncamped in the wilderness and I came away with an increased sense of \nurgency to permanently protect the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain.\n  Allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge would irreparably disrupt a \nvery important ecosystem. It would impact the way of life for the \nGwich'in people and forever destroy one of our Nation's last great wild \nplaces. That is why I am offering this amendment to the SHARE Act, to \nask that we protect this American wilderness once and for all.\n  My amendment would designate the threatened biological heart of the \nrefuge, the coastal plain, as wilderness, to finally recognize the \nintrinsic value of this land and what it holds to ensure that it \nremains pristine for generations to come.\n  Congress has been debating whether to drill in this area for nearly \nthree decades. As our public lands suffer from the effects of climate \nchange, most significantly in Alaska, I believe time is of the essence.\n  Now, the Arctic Refuge is wild, it is spectacular, and most \nimportantly, it\n\n[[Page H982]]\n\nis owned by all Americans, not by the oil industry. That is why \nCongressman Fitzpatrick and I introduced our bipartisan legislation to \npermanently designate it as wilderness, following the bipartisan legacy \nthat this legislation has enjoyed for decades.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Arctic Refuge support has always been diverse and nationwide. During \nthe recent public comment period for the draft conservation plan, the \nFish and Wildlife Service received nearly 1 million comments in support \nof wilderness for the Arctic Refuge and in opposition to oil and gas \nexploration and development. Alaskans showed overwhelming support at \npublic hearings and sent thousands of comments, including from 100 \nbusinesses across the State from Kaktovik to Juneau.\n  This legislation has been introduced in every Congress for almost \nthree decades and has never come to a full vote on the House floor. I \nam grateful that, in January of 2015, for the first time, the \nDepartment of the Interior released a conservation plan for the Arctic \nRefuge that recommended wilderness protection--a recommendation that \nwas transmitted to Congress.\n  Only Congress can act to designate the coastal plain as wilderness. \nNow is the time to seize that historic opportunity.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I always admired my friend from \nCalifornia, who doesn't know squat about the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. \nThat is the truth. He may have camped out in it, but he didn't camp out \nin the area which we would like to drill for oil, which this Congress \nset aside for that purpose.\n  By the way, we did pass opening ANWR 11 times. This Congress did it. \nAnd it got stopped in the Senate every time but one. Bill Clinton, \nbless his heart, vetoed it.\n  We have 18 billion barrels of oil--that is a minimum estimate--74 \nmiles away from an existing pipeline on the coastal plain.\n  You say, well, we don't need the oil now. I heard that in 1960. We \ndidn't need the oil, but it went all the way up to $4.50 for gasoline \nat the pump.\n  This is a reserve set aside by Scoop Jackson--a Democrat--myself, and \nTed Stevens so it would be potentially there for development when \nCongress acts. You want to include this as a wilderness area in the \nbill on the behalf and behest of a group of people that really don't \nunderstand this.\n  You say Alaska supports your amendment? In that case, I won't be back \nhere next year. Don't applaud. Don't keep that in mind. I have been \nrunning, now, longer than anybody in this House except for one other \nman. Apparently, Alaska does support this ANWR provision.\n  It is Federal oil. It is not our oil. We have infrastructure in place \nright now that can be used to move that oil if and when it is needed.\n  I am glad the gentleman said only the Congress can designate this, \nbecause your Fish and Wildlife Service recommended it all be \nwilderness--another act of this administration.\n  I happen to agree, very frankly, that the Congress will vote some \nday.\n  And, by the way, if you want to get rid of me, take a vote to open it \nup, and I might retire. But until that time, I am staying here, because \nit is right for this Nation.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would forbid development of one of the \nmost promising and untapped oilfields in the world. I have to ask: How \nis the cause of American energy independence advanced by forbidding \ndevelopment of America's own vast energy resources? We are talking \nabout reserves that are larger than the reserves in the entire nation \nof Mexico or Norway, whom we currently depend on for importing oil.\n  The gentleman from California is right: that land is owned by the \nAmerican people. So is the oil under it. That means about $300 billion \nof revenues into the Federal Treasury. That is about $2,400 for every \nfamily in this country.\n  The proposed development of the Arctic oil requires about 2,000 acres \nout of 19 million acres of the wildlife reserve. That is one-one \nhundredth of 1 percent of that land area. That is how extreme this \nmeasure is.\n  It would sacrifice American prosperity. It would sacrifice oil \nreserves larger than those in all of Mexico. It would sacrifice \nrevenues to the Treasury of $2,400 for every family to place off limits \na tiny part of the frozen Arctic tundra.\n  If you want to know why our economy is stagnating, if you want to \nknow why our country is going bankrupt, you need only look to measures \nlike the amendment before us.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, with great respect to the senior \nlegislator from Alaska, I have no doubt that he knows and understands \nthe coastal plain and that area far better than I do and that anyone \nelse in this body does, but I do know this: every Member of this body--\nin fact, every American--has a stake in protecting the coastal plain of \nthe Arctic wilderness.\n  Migratory birds from the coastal plain go to all 49 of the other \nStates. We are connected, whether we know it or not, with this \ncritical, vital ecosystem in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The whole point of wilderness is to protect areas that we actually \nmay never camp out in, that we may never see, but that are, \nnevertheless, of such great intrinsic value that they deserve this \nspecial protection. That is what this is all about.\n  As to the argument that we need lots of new oil extraction and \ndevelopment in the Arctic, I would just point out that right next door \nto the Arctic Refuge is an enormous, essentially equal-sized area that \nwe set aside for that purpose. It is called the National Petroleum \nReserve. The oil industry has not seen fit to develop in that area, nor \ndoes it look like they will any time soon, with oil hovering around $30 \na barrel and this week the Saudis saying they may be taking it all the \nway down to $20 a barrel.\n  Right now, because of its overdependence on the oil economy, the \nState of Alaska is hemorrhaging. Oil revenues are down by half. The \npermanent fund is hemorrhaging. Meanwhile, the tourist economy, which \nis built around preserving and protecting natural resources, is growing \nand will soon eclipse oil revenues in terms of the economic impact.\n  Let's look to the future.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I always listen to these well-\nwritten arguments by the Sierra Club and others that like to take this \nNation to its knees, which is a reality.\n  We talk about the petroleum reserve set-aside. It was a reserve set \naside for use by this Nation. And they are drilling. They are drilling \ntoday. ConocoPhillips is going in.\n  Ironically, for some reason, the sales that were put up by this \nadministration are not where they wanted to drill. I have an old \nsaying--and people laugh at me when I say it: you don't hunt rabbits on \na pool table just because it is green. All right. You don't drill oil \nif it is not there.\n  Ironically, this administration, bless their hearts, put up sales \nwhere there was nothing there. It was like the pool table. So why would \nthe oil company drill? They can't and will not.\n  And I always ask them: Why don't you ask the oil companies where they \nwould like to drill? We can't do that because someone has asked us to \npreserve that great area. The other area is just as pretty, but it \ndoesn't have any oil.\n  This is an attempt to take 18 billion barrels of oil away from the \nAmerican people and an attempt by special interest groups to make sure \nthis country cannot grow.\n  Oil will be here forever. Let's keep it. Let's oppose this amendment. \nIt is mischievous. It is wrong for this Nation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by\n\n[[Page H983]]\n\nthe gentleman from California will be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 17 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17 \nprinted in House Report 114-429.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n                   TITLE __--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. __. PERIODIC INCREASE IN PRICE OF MIGRATORY BIRD HUNTING \n                   AND CONSERVATION STAMP TO ACCOUNT FOR \n                   INFLATION.\n\n       Section 2 of the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation \n     Stamp Act (16 U.S.C. 718b) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``The Postal'' and \n     inserting ``Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), \n     the Postal''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end of the following:\n       ``(d) Increase in Price of Stamp.--\n       ``(1) Increase authorized.--The Secretary may, after notice \n     and public comment, increase the price of each stamp sold \n     under this section by an amount not to exceed $10 for a \n     hunting year if the Secretary determines the increase--\n       ``(A) is commensurate with the level of inflation as \n     determined by the adjustments in the Consumer Price Index \n     since the last increase; and\n       ``(B) is approved unanimously by the Migratory Bird \n     Conservation Commission.\n       ``(2) Effective date of increase.--An increase in price \n     under paragraph (1) shall take effect--\n       ``(A) no earlier than 2 years after the effective date of \n     the last increase in price; and\n       ``(B) no later than January 1 of the calendar year \n     preceding the hunting year.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 619, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It would simply \nallow the price of the Federal duck stamp to be changed by the rate of \ninflation.\n  Inflation is something that each and every one of us cannot avoid. \nJust as inflation decreases the value of a dollar for all Americans \nover time, it also steadily decreases the real value of a duck stamp. \nThat is very unfortunate, because the duck stamp is a highly effective \nconservation program.\n  The revenue from the Federal duck stamp that all hunters must buy \neach year as a permit to hunt waterfowl is used to preserve wetlands \nand maintain a sustainable population for hunters and bird watchers \nalike.\n  Moreover, the preservation of wetland habitat from the duck stamp, in \nconjunction with the National Wildlife Refuge System, has reversed the \ndecline in waterfowl populations across this country. Also, not \ninsignificant, co-benefits are that these wetlands buffer our \ncommunities from flooding, saving billions of dollars in damages, and \nthey help filter water and recharge, Mr. Chair, aquifers that are vital \nto our groundwater supplies.\n  The duck stamp works. Ninety-eight cents of every dollar spent on a \nduck stamp goes back to preserving wildlife habitat. To date, more than \n$800 million from duck stamp sales have been spent on the preservation \nof over 6 million acres of habitat. The duck stamp is a true user fee, \nwhere all the funds are spent to benefit the fee payer.\n  I hope this is an amendment that the chairman can support as a \ncommonsense update to address the reality of inflation that inevitably \nwill erode the ability of the duck stamps and the National Wildlife \nRefuge System to continue this highly successful conservation program.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognize for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I certainly agree with the gentleman from \nCalifornia that the duck stamp program is a great program. It does a \ntremendous amount of good. We all know the wetlands that are preserved \nwith that. We all know it is a great opportunity for the hunting \ncommunity and the conservation community to come together.\n  As you know, last year, the duck stamp fee was increased, for the \nfirst time in 24 years, from $15 to $25. I, myself, am an avid duck \nhunter. I buy multiple duck stamps because I firmly believe in the \nprogram.\n  The increase last year we believe will yield about $119 million over \n10 years; but we also know, looking historically, that when you put \nthese increases in fees, for the first couple of years the revenue \ndrops because people that would buy them without the need don't do \nthat, and then they come back to actually purchasing it.\n  So we understand that. That is why we have asked the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service to look specifically at how the implementation of this \nfee is going to play out and how the costs associated with the program \nare, so that we can understand how to best manage this, as you said, to \nget the most dollars to wetlands conservation.\n  With the idea of now going to an inflationary factor right on the \nheels of a $10 increase without getting, from the Fish and Wildlife \nService, what the impacts are going to be so we can best maximize the \ndollars, I think, is premature.\n  I serve as a member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, \nand still, I believe the responsibility for any type of increases \nshould still be on the backs of all Members of Congress, not just the \nfour that are on the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission.\n  I applaud the gentleman's effort to draw attention to the duck stamp \nprogram. We all understand the good it does, but I would argue that \nthis inflationary increase measure is premature, especially in the face \nof a $10 increase last year. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I would oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, it is unfortunate that we can't come \ntogether today to support such a simple fix to, as Mr. Wittman pointed \nout, such a highly successful program. I think the operative word that \nyou have said is that it is premature at this point, not that you \nreally oppose the ability to protect our waterfowl populations to keep \nthem vibrant and make sure that duck hunters have ducks to hunt. I \nthink we all agree upon that.\n  I also just want to say that the one issue is just to make clear that \nwe are not talking about automatically increasing inflation. All we are \nsaying is that when inflation does come--which will erode this \nprogram--that there is a process in place that the Secretary of the \nInterior will make a recommendation to the Migratory Bird Conservation \nCommission. That Commission has to support it. At most, it would have \nbeen a 35-cent increase.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  But I hear what you are saying about that, and if you will work with \nme as we go forward to see when is the best time that we can work on \nthis, I will ask to withdraw this amendment.\n  Can I get a commitment that we will work together?\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Yes, I will tell the gentleman from California that we \nwill indeed work with you in looking at the future of the duck stamp \nprogram, making sure that it is managed in the proper way, making sure \nthat, indeed, is getting dollars to where they need to go, and that is \nto preserve those critical wetlands.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-429 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Beyer of Virginia.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Ms. Jackson Lee of Texas.\n\n[[Page H984]]\n\n  Amendment No. 8 by Mr. Beyer of Virginia.\n  Amendment No. 9 by Mr. Smith of Missouri.\n  Amendment No. 12 by Mr. Griffith of Virginia.\n  Amendment No. 14 by Mr. Ribble of Wisconsin.\n  Amendment No. 15 by Mr. Young of Alaska.\n  Amendment No. 16 by Mr. Huffman of California.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mrs. Lawrence moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2406 to the \n     Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n  TITLE XVII--PROTECTING WATER SUPPLY FOR PUBLIC RECREATION AND SAFE \n                                DRINKING\n\n     SEC. 1701. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Every year in the United States, an estimated 4,000 \n     tons of lead are lost in ponds and streams as fishing tackle, \n     such as fishing lures and sinkers.\n       (2) The lead content of fishing tackle has the potential to \n     contaminate water supplies.\n\n     SEC. 1702. PROTECTING WATER SUPPLY FOR PUBLIC RECREATION AND \n                   SAFE DRINKING.\n\n       Section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2603) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Protecting Water Supply for Public Recreation and \n     Safe Drinking.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of this subsection, any manufacturer or processor \n     of an article containing a chemical substance or mixture that \n     has the potential to contaminate water supplies used for \n     public recreation or drinking water provided by a public \n     water system shall generate and provide to all applicable \n     Federal and State agencies responsible for protecting health \n     or the environment data sufficient to understand the risks \n     such article would present to human health and the \n     environment, including studies of the cancer-causing effects, \n     reproductive toxicity, and neurotoxicity of the chemical \n     substance or mixture contained in the article. Exposing the \n     public or the environment to such article without generating \n     such studies shall be considered a prohibited act under this \n     Act.''.\n\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the reading be dispensed with.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Michigan is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, my amendment will ensure that our public \nwater systems and waterways which are used for public recreation will \nbe protected from an estimated 4,000 tons of lead that are \ncontaminating our ponds and streams from lost fishing tackle.\n  My amendment will ensure that all manufacturers of products that \ncontain any type of substance with the potential to contaminate our \nwater systems provide to Federal and State agencies the research so we \nmay understand the risks to human health and the environment.\n  Members of Congress, the manmade water crisis in Flint has shown us \nthe devastating effects of having contaminated water sources. The \n100,000 residents of Flint lost a basic human right: access to clean \nwater.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, our drinking \nwater infrastructure has a D grade. That is A, B, C, D. According to \nthe American Society of Civil Engineers, $126 billion will be needed to \nrestore water and wastewater infrastructure over the next 4 years, \nwhich leaves a funding gap of $84 billion.\n  It is significant to note that the American public overwhelmingly \nsupports investment in our Nation's water infrastructure, as drinking \nwater is not a luxury. It is a basic need for life.\n  A poll released just a week ago by the Value of Water Coalition \nshowed that 95 percent of Americans--and that means on both sides of \nthe aisle--believe it is important to invest in water infrastructure.\n  I regret to say that we in Congress have kicked the can down the road \nyear after year when it comes to investing in our infrastructure.\n  I know that mayors and Governors and Members of this Congress have \nsounded the warning sign over and over again about the possibility of a \ndisaster, but we never imagined that it\n\n[[Page H990]]\n\nwould come in the form of the mass poisoning of an entire American \ncity.\n  The children of Flint, the parents, other citizens of Flint, and the \ncitizens of these United States need Congress, not one side of the \naisle or the other, to act so that we don't see another generation of \nchildren potentially suffer from the negative effects of lead \npoisoning.\n  I urge all Members of this 114th Session of the United States \nCongress to support this motion to recommit on H.R. 2406.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, the minority's motion to recommit is an \nissue about chemicals in drinking water. Chemicals in drinking water is \nan issue that was addressed in the Toxic Substances Control Act, which \nwas before this House.\n  There were multiple opportunities to have a debate about that and to \ndetermine what we do to address that issue. That bill passed out of the \nHouse. It is now in a preconference committee with the Senate. That was \nthe opportunity.\n  This bill, the SHARE Act, is a package of commonsense bills that will \nincrease opportunities for hunters, recreational shooters, and anglers; \nwill eliminate unneeded regulatory impediments; will safeguard against \nnew regulations that impede outdoor sporting activities; and will \nprotect Second Amendment rights. It does not pertain to chemicals in \ndrinking water.\n  Outdoor sporting activities, including hunting, fishing, and \nrecreational shooting, are deeply ingrained in the fabric of America's \nculture and heritage. Values that are instilled by partaking in these \nactivities are passed down from generation to generation and play a \nsignificant part in the lives of millions of Americans.\n  This important legislation will sustain America's rich hunting and \nfishing traditions, will improve access to our public lands for \nresponsible outdoor sporting activities, and will help to ensure that \nthe current and future generations of sportsmen and -women are able to \nenjoy the sporting activities this country holds dear.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on \nthis important legislation and to defeat the motion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-\nminute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute \nvote on the passage of the bill, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 165, \nnays 238, not voting 30, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 100]\n\n                               YEAS--165\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Honda\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to address one of the \nNation's greatest concerns: welfare reform.\n  America's most important resource is our people. The last thing we \nwant any of our citizens to believe is that they are forever stuck in a \nsituation that they cannot rise above.\n  Welfare reform was originally successful because it required work in \nreturn for assistance, gave more power and responsibility to the States \nin fighting poverty, and ensured that States were rewarded for reducing \npoverty instead of increasing dependency.\n  Today, given the slow growth of our economy, many job seekers become \nfrustrated when they are unable to find adequate work. This creates a \nsystem where many become trapped and dependent on State and Federal \nassistance.\n  Solutions to welfare reform have to come from a local level, not from \nWashington. It is imperative that we encourage family values and \neducation more than anything.\n  Washington's primary role is to strengthen the economy, facilitate \ngrowth, and encourage a positive business climate, thus creating jobs \nand reducing dependency on State programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H992-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SPORTSMEN'S HERITAGE AND RECREATIONAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Madam Speaker, today Congress voted to make it easier \nto import killed polar bears and ivory into our Nation.\n  The SHARE Act is a piece of legislation most closely resembling \nGeorge Orwell's novel ``1984,'' riddled with doublespeak and \nnightmarish visions.\n  The Polar Bear Conservation and Fairness Act, part of this bill, \nwould encourage the further hunting and importation of polar bears as \nlong as they follow the rules.\n  The African Elephant Conservation and Legal Ivory Possession Act, \nanother title, would encourage the needless and malicious slaying of \ninnocent and endangered animals for their tusks.\n  And for what? So that gun owners can have a shiny grip on their Smith \n& Wesson .357 Magnum made of a tusk that once was part of a beautiful, \nmajestic elephant. Have we really come to this place in our history in \nwhich the ivory trimming on a gun is more important than a life?\n  I urge the Senate and the President to reject this ethically \nreprehensible and morally repugnant bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H992-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VAIL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. McSALLY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Vail \nUnified School District for their outstanding education achievements. \nYear after year the Arizona Department of Education recognizes Vail as \na top-performing school district and its schools are continuously \nlabeled A-plus.\n  As with any organization, leadership matters. Vail superintendent Cal \nBaker, who I have worked with on many issues related to education, sets \na tone from the top of innovation and excellence, but he is not alone.\n  He has many wingmen and wingwomen, including an engaged school board, \ndedicated staff and teachers, involved parents, and selfless \nvolunteers, who all work together to provide high-quality education to \nkids.\n  Vail's out-of-the-box learning model doesn't just benefit its \nstudents, but benefits others across the State where Vail's best \npractices are exported to other school districts.\n  Recently it was my honor to participate in Vail Pride Day where we \nrecognized excellent performance in so many students. I gave out the \nBoard Community Award to members of the Vail Parent Network for their \nwork in advocating for education.\n  I congratulate Vail on their many achievements and their impact on so \nmany kids by setting them on a course to achieve their dreams and full \npotential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H992-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING WEST WINDSOR-PLAINSBORO HIGH SCHOOL SOUTH\n\n  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.

For 153 years since then, our Nation has struggled to \novercome bigotry and achieve equality for all.\n  Countless courageous leaders have taken up the cause of justice, \nincluding former Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen and our own colleague \nhere in the United States Congress, Congressman John Lewis.\n  Walking on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma with Congressman Lewis \nfor the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches is one of \nthe highlights of my tenure in the United States Congress.\n  As we look back on the accomplishments of the past, we cannot lose \nsight of the urgency with which we must address inequality in our \nsociety today.\n  African Americans today face an unacceptable likelihood of being \nincarcerated, a poverty rate that our Nation's leaders should be \nashamed of, and everyday discrimination that flies in the face of \neverything our Nation stands for.\n  In memory of the heroes who have fought for equality throughout our \nNation's history, we are compelled to act. I am committed to fighting \nfor a more just and equal society. I implore my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H992-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H992-H993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1245\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF DEBBIE SMITH\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS.

From her days with the State PTA to her work as a \nlegislative leader, she served the community in countless ways for over \n20 years, constantly advocating for Nevada to invest in what matters \nmost: our children.\n  After having a brain tumor removed early last year, she returned to \nthe legislature to work on the front lines for major education reform. \nCancer couldn't stop her from making sure that her vision came to \nfruition. In her last political battle, she was able to claim a victory \nthat will long benefit Nevada's students.\n  Debbie was a true friend and a real inspiration.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to note the passing of \nan American hero, Alfred Mann.\n  At 17 years of age, Al Mann was a navigator on a B-29 during World \nWar II. After the war, he was educated with the GI Bill, and he used \nhis genius, his creative skills, to upgrade America's antitank weapons \nof the day.\n  A short time after that, he said he was so happy because he had his \nchance to use his creative genius in building things that helped \npeople. He revolutionized heart pacemakers at that time, and then he \nwent on to help us and help millions of Americans live better through \nhis technology that helped diabetics, people who were deaf, even people \nwho were amputees.\n  Al Mann made a major difference. He represented the very best in \nAmerica. He was a hero. He passed away at 91 years of age. He will be \nmissed, but he has left a wonderful legacy. Now we live better and \nfreer because of people like Al Mann.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H993-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS\n\n  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court is scheduled \nto hear Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt next Tuesday, a case \nchallenging the Texas law that has deprived women of their \nconstitutional right to make their own healthcare decisions. I was \nproud to join 163 of my colleagues in an amicus brief in support of \nwomen's health centers.\n  Texas is home to 5.4 million women of reproductive age, and this \nappalling law would leave only 10 clinics open in the entire State--\n10--in Texas.\n  As a mother of two daughters, I find this unacceptable. It is a moral \noutrage when legislatures full of mostly male politicians interfere in \nwomen's healthcare decisions. From Texas to my home State of Florida, \nto this very body, we are seeing an unprecedented attack on women's \nhealth, and I will not be silent about it.\n  These laws have not and will not make women safer. They are intrusive \nand invade women's personal, most private decisions. It is my deepest \nhope that the Supreme Court overturns this offensive Texas law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H993-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WOMEN'S HEALTHCARE DECISIONS\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, we are less than 5 days away from hearing \noral arguments in the Supreme Court case that could steal the right \naway from women to make their own healthcare decisions.\n  In 2013, the Texas State legislature passed House Bill 2, a very \nstrict anti-abortion law that imposed medically unnecessary \nrestrictions on women's healthcare providers. Lawmakers claimed their \nmotivation was to protect women's health care, but Texas women can \nattest that the law has done little to expand their access to health \ncare.\n  Since the passage of HB 2, over 20 clinics in Texas have shut down. \nWomen in Dallas are facing delays as long as 20 days for an initial \nabortion consultation. Other States have followed the lead, with 22 \nStates passing similar laws that are targeting abortion providers just \nin the last few years.\n  Roe v. Wade made it clear that women have a constitutional right to \nmake choices about their own bodies.\n  Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed that a State cannot create an \nundue burden on women when they seek to exercise their right to safe \nand legal abortions. Ultimately, a constitutional right means nothing \nwithout the ability to exercise that right.\n  I am confident that the Supreme Court will reaffirm that women are \nconstitutionally protected to make their own healthcare decisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H993-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H993-H998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ISSUES OF THE DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n\n\n                    Honoring Major Shawn M. Campbell\n\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Marine Corps Major Shawn M. \nCampbell of College Station, Texas.\n  Major Campbell died on January 14, 2016, when he and 11 additional \nmarines were involved in a helicopter training accident off the coast \nof Hawaii's Oahu Island.\n  Major Campbell attended Klein High School in suburban Houston and \nwent on to graduate from Texas A University. Upon graduation, Major \nCampbell decided to follow his lifelong dream of becoming a pilot. He \naccepted his commission and began a career as a Marine Corps aviator. \nDuring his time in the Marine Corps, Shawn served four tours in the \nMiddle East, including one in Iraq.\n  After serving our country overseas, Major Campbell returned to the \nU.S., where he became a flying instructor at the Naval Air Station \nlocated in Pensacola, Florida. Major Campbell, along with his wife, \nKelli, and their children were later transferred to Marine Corps Air \nStation Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii in 2014. During his time stationed at the \nMarine Corps base, Shawn served as a CH-53E Super Stallion pilot with \nSquadron 463, Marine Aircraft Group 24.\n  Throughout his tenure, Major Campbell garnered numerous awards and \ndecorations for his bravery. These decorations include: the Air Medal \nwith strike/flight device, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation \nMedal, the Navy Unit Commendation, the National Defense Service Medal, \nthe Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and \nthe Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.\n  Madam Speaker, Major Campbell was a fearless leader and a decorated \nveteran. His selfless devotion to protect our country will be forever \nremembered. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Major Shawn \nCampbell. He will be forever remembered as an outstanding husband, \nfather, and marine. We thank him and his family for their service and \ntheir sacrifice for our country. His sacrifice truly reflects the words \nof Jesus in John 15:13: ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a \nman lay down his life for his friends.''\n  The loss of Major Campbell and his fellow marines serves as a \nreminder of the sacrifices the men and women of our Armed Forces make \neach day to preserve freedom for this great Nation. We are forever in \ndebt to these great individuals who serve our country.\n  As I close, I ask all Americans to continue to pray for our country \nduring these difficult times, for our military men and women who \nprotect us from external threats, and for our first responders who \nprotect us from threats here at home.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. He and \nI were at Texas A together in the Corps of Cadets, and I know he \ndidn't have to look down to read what John 15:13 was because that used \nto be a Campusology question that freshmen had to memorize.\n\n[[Page H994]]\n\n  The question was: What is the inscription on the Memorial Student \nCenter at Texas A?\n  The proper correct answer, succinct: The inscription on the Memorial \nStudent Center at Texas A is ``Greater love hath no man than this, \nthat a man lay down his life for his friends, John 15:13.''\n  It is also touching to me each time I come through the southern \nentrance of the Capitol, the main entrance for visitors coming into the \nCapitol--I guess more visitors come in through that entrance--\nimmediately as you pass through the metal detectors, up on the right is \na statue of a Catholic priest named Father Damien.\n  The statue is a bit strange in the way it is squared off, but there \nis nothing strange about the life that he lived. The fact that Hawaii \nwould pick as one of the two allowable statues it has, Father Damien to \nbe represented, I think, is most noble.\n  It also indicates, I think, that 50 years-plus ago, when Hawaii came \ninto the Union, at that time our Nation was still a Christian nation. \nOur motto still above the Speaker's head here, ``In God We Trust,'' was \nfront and center most everywhere. So it shouldn't have been a surprise \nthat Hawaii wanted to pay tribute for one of its two statues a man who \nlearned of lepers being sometimes just thrown off a passing ship if \nthey had leprosy. Sometimes they would dock and let them go to shore, \nbut there was nothing but squalor, as I understand, back in those days.\n  People knew that leprosy was contagious. It is terrible to think, but \nin the words of the poet, the inhumanity to man. But it was an island \nfull of lepers that knew they were going to die as their skin and parts \nrotted off.\n  Father Damien heard about the situation, went to the island knowing \nthat by going to that island he would indeed get leprosy. He prayed it \nwould be later rather than sooner so he could minister to all those \nhurting on the island. But he helped them set up a way of life, and \ninstead of just having hopeless, nonsocietal squalor to live in, he \nhelped them build a way of life, a sense of normality, a way in which \nthey could finish out their life with some element of peace.\n  I believe it was around 15 years or so before he got the leprosy that \neventually took him. On the plaque of Father Damien's statue, one of \nthe first you see when you come in our Capitol from the southern \nentrance, the words inscribed at the top of the plaque, ``Greater love \nhath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' \nThat is certainly what Father Damien did. That is certainly what our \nfellow Aggie, Major Shawn Campbell, did when he laid down his life for \nhis country.\n  With that background, we ought to approach most every issue that this \nFederal Government faces. We have an obligation to those who have gone \nbefore us and have laid down what Lincoln called the last full measure \nof devotion. They have given their lives that we might have a better \nlife.\n  How tragic it is that political correctness has so infiltrated and \noverwhelmed the United States of America, that when you study history, \nthe colleges are often described as the intelligentsia, the people who \nare well educated that really figured things out, who are open-minded, \nwhere they used to be the most open minded.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  When I attended Texas A, it was, if not the most conservative, one \nof the most conservative colleges, universities in America. I was proud \nto be there, proud to be in the Corps of Cadets, proud to have an Army \nscholarship that committed me to 4 years in the United States Army \nafter I graduated, proud to look forward to serving my country.\n  As conservative as we were, we were not afraid of inviting very \nliberal speakers, and we were not afraid of having debate with them, \nvery civilized debate.\n  I recall helping usher Ralph Nader around when he came to Texas A, \nas one of my friends was a host. That was no big deal. It was really an \nopportunity for a conservative like me and others to have a dialogue \nwith Ralph Nader.\n  It sometimes shocks people that a conservative like me can have some \nvery liberal friends, just like the great Antonin Scalia was very close \nfriends with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They had totally different views. He \nbelieved in upholding the letter of the law of the Constitution and she \ndidn't, but they were friends.\n  So you can have that friendship, but it is an embarrassment--should \nbe an embarrassment--to this Nation that so many who proclaimed in the \nsixties and seventies to be the most open-minded among us ended up \nbecoming professors at colleges and began to teach the teachers. Those \nteachers, in turn, went back and taught elementary school, middle \nschool, and high school.\n  Somehow, over the last 50 years, we have gone from a Nation that \nrecognizes that true conservatism is confident enough in itself that it \nis not afraid to have debate and dialogue and hear from all types of \nviewpoints.\n  Tragically, as the intelligentsia in America become more and more \nestablished in the universities, they have allowed these open-minded, \nbroad-minded liberals to have places of prominence in our institutions \nof higher learning, and somehow they have become the most close-minded \npeople in America. They don't want to hear from conservatives. They are \nembarrassed to have a conservative come speak.\n  It is rather tragic, because no longer are our universities, \ngenerally speaking, places where all types of thought are analyzed. \nThey are not taught all types of thought. They are given a very narrow \nversion. It is usually very critical of anyone who is conservative, \nanyone who believes the Constitution should mean what it says, anyone \nwho stands up for the Judeo-Christian principles on which this Nation \nwas founded.\n  One of the great things about being founded on Judeo-Christian \nprinciples has been that if true Christian principles are applied to \ngovernment, then anyone of any religion is free to practice that \nreligion or not practice that religion, unless the religion is actually \na religion of politics that dictates that their believers cannot follow \nthe letter of the law within the United States Constitution.\n  From this podium, I have spoken many times about the Holy Land \nFoundation trial in the United States District Court in the Northern \nDistrict of Texas. It was the largest prosecution regarding terrorism \nin our Nation's history.\n  The Holy Land Foundation was found to be a front organization for \nradical Islamists who were funneling money. They called themselves a \ncharity. Some would be funded to charities, some would be for the \nchildren, but they also funneled money to terrorist organizations that \nwere used to terrorize people here and abroad.\n  The Bush administration Justice Department, since President George W. \nBush did not have a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and allowed \nthe Justice Department to pursue any crime that they saw, any threat to \nAmerica--unlike the present day--they went after the Holy Land \nFoundation. They had evidence to show that the Holy Land Foundation and \nmany organizations and many leading people claiming the Muslim faith \nwere actually tied together and were coconspirators in funneling money \nto charities, for sure, but also to terrorist organizations.\n  As I understand from former members of the Justice Department who are \nstill friends, the strategy was to get convictions in that first \nmassive prosecution. I think there were over 100 counts of supporting \nterrorism. They were to get convictions there.\n  In the same case, having named many coconspirators who were not \nactually indicted, if they could get those convictions, as they knew \nthe evidence indicated they should, then they would go after the named \ncoconspirators who were unindicted at that point and go ahead and \nindict them and get prosecution and conviction of coconspirators.\n  Well, there were some names of groups and individuals in that \nprosecution named as coconspirators supporting terrorism who were \noffended. Perhaps they were more concerned with their public image of \nbeing charitable when, actually, they were being exposed through this \nprosecution by the evidence that existed that they were coconspirators \nin supporting terrorist groups and terrorist acts. They filed a motion \nto have their name struck as coconspirators in supporting terrorism.\n\n[[Page H995]]\n\n  One such group was CAIR, or the Council on American-Islamic \nRelations. People like Imam Magid, who has been president of the \nIslamic Society of North America, was also named as a coconspirator.\n  Anyway, they filed motions to have their names stricken as \ncoconspirators. There was an evidentiary hearing, evidence produced, \nand the United States district judge ruled in the case that there was \nplenty of evidence to support that those individuals named were indeed \ncoconspirators to fund terrorism.\n  Well, not happy with that, they appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. They said: Gee, we should have our name struck as being \ncoconspirators in supporting terrorism.\n  I have even read from the opinion of the United States Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals that ruled that not only is there evidence that these \nindividuals--like CAIR, the Islamic Society of North American--not only \nis there evidence, but there is actually substantial evidence that they \nhave been coconspirators in funding and supporting terrorism.\n  Well, I believe it was November 2008, right after Senator Barack \nObama was elected President, that the convictions were obtained in over \n100 counts. Before the conviction could become completely final, there \nwas a new administration coming in. We had a new Attorney General \ncoming in.\n  The new President and the new Attorney General, Eric Holder, had a \ndifferent agenda. They were not going to prosecute radical Islamist \nsupporters, people that funded radical Islam and their terrorist \nactivities. There would no longer be those prosecutions. So they were \ndropped. They were dropped.\n  None of those who were listed as coconspirators were going to be \nprosecuted by the Obama Justice Department--or, perhaps a better way of \nsaying it is the Obama-Holder ``just us'' department--because they \ndidn't prosecute. As the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated, \nthere was plenty of evidence to support that they were conspirators.\n  But if that were the end of the story, that would be bad enough. \nInstead of not prosecuting, this administration made the Council on \nAmerican-Islamic Relations, CAIR, one of the most influential \norganizations with a voice inside the White House. If they objected to \nanything, then the White House immediately flew into action and did \nwhatever CAIR--this named coconspirator of radical Islam, of terror--\nindicated by phone or otherwise, in person. Whatever they indicated was \noffensive to them as named coconspirators in supporting terrorism, \nwhatever offended them, this administration made sure it was blotted \nout, covered up, or stopped, whether it was a seminar or conference \nbeing given at Langley or an intelligence facility.\n\n  A 2-day conference for law enforcement on radical Islam that was \ngoing to be led by people who had spent their adult lives studying \nradical Islam and who knew the dangers and would warn of the dangers, \nCAIR finds out, they call the White House, and from what we understand, \nthat is what led the White House to call Langley and cancel the \nconference on radical Islam for law enforcement and come out with new \ndirectives.\n  In effect, it seemed like they were saying, unless CAIR approves of \nsomebody--these conspirators who support terrorism, according to the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals--unless this coconspirator that supports \nterrorism agrees to any comment about Islam, you can't make it, you \ncan't have it in training materials.\n  So then began a partnership between what were alleged to be \nsupporters of radical Islamic terrorism and the FBI. Actually, some of \nthat began during the Bush administration. But they had this \npartnership with many of the named coconspirators supporting radical \nIslamic terrorism. They are still partners with the President, with \nthis administration.\n  When I say ``coconspirator,'' I am referring to as named in the \npleadings in the prosecution in Federal court that were ruled on in the \ndistrict court, ruled on by the Court of Appeals, and they said, yes, \nthere is plenty of evidence to support that they have supported radical \nIslamic terrorism.\n  So those coconspirators have been a great help to this administration \nin advising them of things that offended them as, apparently, \ncoconspirators to support radical Islamic terrorism.\n  Some years back, when we found out the FBI training materials had \nbeen completely purged of any information that CAIR found \nobjectionable, we wanted to see those documents.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  But we were told that they had been classified. The documents, the \ntraining materials, that were cut from what FBI trainees could see, \nthey classified them because they didn't want the country to know how \nridiculous some of the things that were removed from the training \nmaterial were when trying to train people on what radical Islam was.\n  Because they are classified, I can't say specifically what training \nmaterials were removed. But I can make the global statement that, to \nme, if a student training to be an FBI agent is needing to learn about \nthe most radical enemy of the United States that has been--some of my \nMuslim friends in the Middle East and North Africa have said: They have \nbeen at war with you since 1979, and you are still helping them. We \ndon't get it.\n  Well, this administration not only helps those coconspirators, they \nlisten and are sensitive to anything the coconspirators supporting \nterrorism find to be troublesome.\n  But, to me, if you have, say, a verse from what they call the Holy \nKoran and you are showing FBI agents Scripture that a radical Islamic \nterrorist holds as Gospel and that the percentage of Muslims who have \ntaken this radical Islamic path utilized to help radicalize themselves \nand others, that would be something an FBI agent should know.\n  But, unfortunately, since CAIR objects to FBI trainees knowing verses \nfrom the Koran that have helped radicalize Muslims into becoming \nradical Islamic terrorists, it makes it tough to really be a well-\ninformed FBI agent.\n  Even if you are in the FBI and you happen to know some of those \nScriptures, even though they have been blotted out, hypothetically \nspeaking, from training materials, you know you have got to keep your \nmouth shut because anybody in the FBI, Justice Department, CIA, any of \nour intelligence agencies, that makes the political or occupational \nmistake in this administration of pointing out some truth about radical \nIslamic terrorism, their career will be over, as my friend--and I can \nnow call his name, since he has retired--after he knew so much, tried \nto warn so many about radical Islam, about groups within radical Islam, \nincluding the ones that conducted the terrorism murders in California, \ntried to warn, provided information.\n  But since his information was offensive to radical Islamic \nterrorists, then he had to be purged from Homeland Security. A man that \nhelped start Homeland Security, had been with them from the beginning, \nwho had won acclaim and notoriety within Homeland Security for \nidentifying hundreds of people with terrorist ties, became a problem.\n  I tried to work with him for a number of years. We couldn't get \nenough assistance. No assistance in the administration. We knew they \nwould come after him. So we were privately trying to help this would-be \nwhistleblower go through proper channels.\n  When Homeland Security and Congress recommended he go file an IG \ncomplaint, I knew it was a mistake. We should have taken action \nourselves. But he filed the IG complaint.\n  The IG's office in Homeland Security had already been condemned for \naltering an IG report in order to protect the administration. They were \ngoing to do an investigation on thousands of pages of records that \nlinked some people that advised this administration with terrorists and \nterrorist organizations? They deleted those thousands of pages?\n  I knew that, if he filed an IG complaint, they would come after him \nbecause the evidence was so damning for this administration that they \nwould do what they always do.\n  You don't go after the people that are conspiring to harm America. \nYou go after the whistleblower who has blown the whistle on your \ncallousness toward those who would hurt America. And they did, even \nhaving a grand jury empanelled to just harass and destroy the personal \nlives of him and his wife.\n\n[[Page H996]]\n\n  This man is a patriot. Phil Haney is a patriot. He should have been \ngetting all kinds of awards, not just one letter commending him for \nfinding all these terrorist ties. Instead, they go after him.\n  And the grand jury, after they have probed every orifice, \nfiguratively speaking, that they possibly could, couldn't come up with \nanything.\n  So then they put him in, basically, a closet, gave him no \nresponsibility, in essence, forcing him to go ahead and retire, which \nhe has.\n  This is no way to treat one of the most wonderful and intelligent \npatriots I have ever met. His wife ended up in the hospital during all \nthat harassment by Homeland Security and the Justice Department.\n  But that is what this administration does. If you are a \ncoconspirator, according to the courts, in supporting radical Islamic \nterrorism, then we want you as an adviser to this administration.\n  If you are going to blow the whistle, say, on potential perpetrators \nof the Boston massacre at the Marathon or the California terrorism that \ncould have been prevented had they properly followed up on the warnings \nfrom Philip Haney, you go after the heroes, go after the patriots, and \nallow the supporters, according to the courts, of radical Islamic \nterrorism to be your advisers.\n  So, with that background, Mr. Speaker, I see this article today. It \nwas published on 25 February 2016 by Allum Bokhari from Breitbart. The \ntitle is ``FBI Scrubs References to Islam from Anti-Radicalization Game \nAfter CAIR Complaints.''\n  Okay. So CAIR, this named coconspirator supporting radical Islam that \ntwo Federal courts said absolutely there is plenty of evidence to \nsupport that, not only does this administration not prosecute them, but \nthey have a wonderful office right down the street.\n  In fact, I saw some of them at a hearing this week that Chairman \nGoodlatte called in the Judiciary Committee. It was an excellent \nhearing exploring the naming of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist \nactivity.\n  So the Muslim Brotherhood, CAIR, I mean, you know, are two peas in a \npod. So of course CAIR is going to be there at the hearing, and they \nwere. One of them was kind enough to wave at me. Nice to be recognized.\n\n  So the article says: ``Earlier this month, the FBI launched Don't Be \nA Puppet, a browser-based video game designed to counter recruitment \npropaganda from violent extremists.''\n  We call them violent extremists because this administration will not \ncall them the radical Islamic terrorists that they are.\n  Our Muslim leader friends in the Middle East and in North Africa, not \nin our public meetings, but in the private meetings, are appalled that \nthis administration won't call it what it is because it makes it \ndifficult for peace-loving Muslims to say: This is a part of Islam we \nneed help stamping out. They can't say that when this administration is \nsaying it is actually not part of Islam.\n  So people can be comforted. The named coconspirators for radical \nIslamic terrorism objected to radical Islam being mentioned in this \ngame to try to stop radical Islamist converters or people being \nconverted. And so the FBI has now removed and replaced references to \nIslam and Islamic terrorism on the site.\n  ``The FBI originally intended to launch the site in November, but \nprogress was stalled by CAIR's complaints. At the time, the Islamic \nlobby complained that the Web site, which is targeted at young people \nat risk of extremist recruitment''--that is code for radical Islamic \nrecruitment--``would lead to the `stigmatization' and `bullying' of \nyoung Muslims. CAIR also contended that the Web site should instead \nfocus on rightwing extremists, which they argued were a greater threat \nto American youth.''\n  And parenthetically inserting here, of course, radical Islamists are \nnot a threat to America. Oh, yeah. They tried to blow up a plane on \nChristmas Day, the Christmas bomber, the underwear bomber, yeah, \nradical Islamist.\n  Oh, yeah. They were behind the bombing of Americans at the Boston \nMarathon. Oh, yeah. They killed all those people in San Bernardino.\n  And oh, yeah, our FBI Director says there are Islamic State cells and \ninvestigations in every State in the union, but since this \ncoconspirator to support radical Islam is objecting to using the term \n``Islam'' or ``radical Islam,'' we can't refer to that.\n  So we have to start talking about rightwing radicals, this Clinton-\nesque, rightwing conspiracy that we later found out actually was not a \nrightwing conspiracy at all. It was a relationship between a President \nand an intern.\n  And you can be sure your sins will find you out from the stains it \nleaves.\n  But the article goes on: ``The game still includes a scenario where \nplayers are invited to go on an `overseas mission'--but the character's \nArabic name has been replaced with a western-sounding one, (Sean S).''\n  Oh, my dear friend Sean Hannity's name is Sean. So it was nice of \nthem to put the initial S there after Sean so they wouldn't think of \nSean Hannity, the most popular Sean in America.\n  But how wonderful that this radical Islamic game is now using the \nname Sean. That is lovely.\n  Anyway, no longer radical Islamic name.\n  But the article says: ``The FBI also appears to have heeded CAIR's \nadvice to focus on rightwing extremists, with a new example featuring a \n`white supremacist rally' where players are told to commit violent acts \nin the name of white supremacy.\n  ``According to the IJ Review, `the new version of the game does not \nmention Islam, Muslims, or any particulars of Islamic ideology or \ntargets at all, aside from the usual disclaimers that ISIS does not \nrepresent mainstream Islam.' ''\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  ``While the FBI avoids mentioning the terrorist group at CAIR's \nbehest, the Islamic State remains among the largest terrorist hubs in \nthe world, with recent estimates from the U.S. intelligence community \nputting its number of foreign recruits at approximately 30,000.\n  ``Still, you never know, the FBI may be right to shift focus. Maybe \nanimal rights activists are planning to set up their own terrorist \nstate too?''\n  I hadn't thought about that. Maybe animal rights activists are out \nthere planning some massive international caliphate starting in Syria \nand Libya, and, boy, do they want Egypt back. That is why the Muslim \nBrotherhood is fighting so hard to overcome our friend. And when I say \n``our,'' I am not including the President. I know there is no love lost \nthere. Why? Because President el-Sisi there in Egypt is a Muslim who \nhas stood up to radical Islam. That does not endear him to this \nadministration.\n  So it is important to note where we are. I think it is also an \nindication as to why so many Americans are concerned about where our \ncountry is and how fundamentally it has been transformed for the worse. \nThere is more racial tension.\n  I understand Karl Rove was accused of doing some division politics \nwhere you find a group, divide the group against each other, and you \nknow the majority will be on your side. You create groups. But this \nadministration has been the master of division politics even though it \nhas created more racial strife than we have had since the sixties and \neven though we had a Nation that elected an African American President. \nI have talked probably to thousands of people who have said: Well, I \nvoted for President Obama because I wanted to be able to say that I \nvoted for the first African American President.\n  What happened to Martin Luther King's dream of a day in America when \nwe are judged by the content of our character, not the color of our \nskin? For heaven's sake, to elect a man because of his race is as \nracist as any of the wackos in America who indeed actually are racist. \nYou shouldn't be electing somebody because of the color of their skin. \nElect them because of who they are, what they believe, and whether they \nwill help the country. We have seen the divisions in this country.\n  We have seen more debt arise than was ever imaginable. How can a man \naccuse George W. Bush of being unpatriotic because in 2006, for \nheaven's sake, we had a $160 billion deficit, about $160 billion or so \nmore going out than we had coming in? That is un-American. That is \nunpatriotic. He is\n\n[[Page H997]]\n\naccusing George W. Bush. And what happens? He becomes President, and he \ndemands a $1.6 trillion deficit.\n  So if Bush were unpatriotic for having a budget that helped create \n$160 billion deficit--obviously, it is Congress that passes the \nultimate budget, with no thanks to the Senate. But I guess that makes \nit 10 times more unpatriotic for anyone who supports a budget that \ncreates 10 times more of a deficit.\n  It is interesting that Americans have gotten so upset in this \nelection cycle. Some are actually scared. Some of them reflect the \nopinion that I have mentioned that I heard from a senior gentleman from \nTogo, Africa, when I was visiting there in years past. Before I left, \nhe wanted to meet me and visit with me.\n  As he explained: ``We were so excited here when you elected your \nfirst Black President. But since he has been President, we have seen \nAmerica grow weaker and weaker. And please tell people in \nWashington''--so I keep telling people here, Mr. Speaker, I want them \nto know what he said. ``Since he has been President, we have seen \nAmerica grow weaker and weaker. And when America is weaker, we \nsuffer.''\n  They are Christians. They know where they are going when they die. \nBut he was making emphatically clear that, as America has gotten weaker \nand weaker in this administration and there is more domestic division \nin this country under this President, friends around the world are \nsuffering more than ever before. There are more Christians being \npersecuted than ever in history and more Jews being persecuted than \never in history.\n  Despite this administration's repeated statements about all of the \nhate crimes against Muslims, the FBI statistics do not, have not, and \nwill not bear that out. It is not Muslims in America that are the \nnumber one victims of hate crimes. Try looking at Jews. Try looking at \nothers, because it is not the Muslims.\n  So it begins to be a bit offensive as more Christians are being \npersecuted and killed in the world than ever at any time in our world \nhistory to continually defend those whom courts have said are \ncoconspirators in persecuting Christians and Jews. It is basically \nanathema to what America has been and thought in the past.\n  So as that has gone on and people have gotten so upset, it has been \namazing to see an ally in Congress, Ted Cruz, being attacked for being \nfor amnesty. I was here. I was thrilled when Ted Cruz got elected. I \nhad known him. I knew he was brilliant and I knew he was truthful, so I \nwas thrilled. A number of us would meet sometimes at his office, \nsometimes other places, trying to strategize: How do we stop the \nRepublican establishment's caving in and doing the will of the \nadministration to allow a massive amnesty?\n  We knew the administration was not enforcing the border properly. We \nknew that they were allowing people in in droves; and the more they \ncame in illegally, the more others heard that you can come in \nillegally. As one of the border patrolmen told me in the wee hours of \nthe morning:\n  We are called logistics by the drug cartels and the gangs in Mexico. \nAll they say they have to do is get people across the river and \nHomeland Security is logistics. We ship them anywhere they want to go.\n  There is a great deal of truth to that.\n  So it has been amazing to see this reinvention of what really \nhappened back in those days.\n  We had a fantastic election in Florida where our friend was elected \nthere, a Tea Party favorite. Thank goodness. We were so thrilled, \nbecause it meant because of his promises we had another ally in the \nSenate that would help us stop the Republican establishment's cave to \nthe Obama administration's desire for amnesty.\n  Chuck Schumer, for all he is, he actually can be quite persuasive. \nAnd John McCain, for all his efforts in 2007 that nearly cost him a \nchance to be the nominee so he could lose in defeat to the Democrats, \nhis push for amnesty in 2007 nearly kept him from being the nominee to \nlose in the general election. Gosh, if he had continued to push his \namnesty, he would not have gotten the nomination. Who knows? Maybe \nBarack Obama would not have won in 2008. It is interesting to think \nabout.\n  I was looking at this article by Sarah Rumpf back in January of 2015. \nShe had been asking about problems that I had, and I pointed out, I \nreferred back to broken promises by our Speaker and why we needed a new \nSpeaker, and it was the same Republican establishment problem we had \nhad.\n  As the article says, one of the biggest broken promises included \n``promising to `fight tooth and nail' against Obama's executive amnesty \norders, but then allowing the CR/Omnibus bill to proceed forward.''\n  But it wasn't just that. It was so much that had been going on for a \nnumber of years. So there was no one who felt more dejected than our \nlittle group that was gathering regularly trying to come up with ways \nto slow down the Gang of Eight bill because we knew that once this \nhandsome, young, articulate guy that had just been elected from Florida \nwas talked into being the leader on the bill--very clever getting him \nto be the leader on the bill--we knew it was going to be a very, very, \nvery difficult thing to stop.\n\n  Going back, here is an article from April 15 of 2013 by Byron York of \nthe Washington Examiner: ``A Look Deep Inside the Gang of Eight Bill--\nand How They'll Sell Immigration Reform to Conservatives.''\n  He points out regarding this Gang of Eight bill, he says: ``Of course \nsome in the GOP are still panicked by last November's election results \nand will be inclined to sign on to almost any deal. But many of the \nmore conservative Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill will have to be \nconvinced that the Gang's proposal is an acceptable way to go. It won't \nbe easy.''\n  Anyway, he points out that, ``Starting this week, with the release of \nthe bill, the Gang will launch an extensive public information \ncampaign''--with Senator Rubio leading--``lots of press releases, \nfrequently asked questions, and fact sheets specifically addressing the \nconcerns about reform that conservatives have raised in recent \nmonths.''\n  It also talks about, ``The GOP Gang''--the GOP Gang of Eight, he is \ntalking about--``members know full well that the Federal Government has \npromised all those measures and more over the years, and the border is \nstill not secure and businesses still hire illegal immigrants. For \nexample, Congress has passed multiple laws requiring entry-exit systems \nsimilar to what the Gang will propose, and the system has never been \nbuilt. So Gang members know that conservatives, at least, will be \nskeptical.\n  ``The answer the Gang hopes will reassure those skeptics is the \nconcept of triggers. They've set up three points at which the bill's \nrequirements will have to be met before the process''--of amnesty is \nwhat he is talking about--``can continue.''\n  But anyway, it goes on and discusses the Gang of Eight bill.\n  Americans had heard these promises before, going back to 1986 when a \nhero of mine and a hero of my friend Dana Rohrabacher, who was a former \nspeechwriter, got talked into signing off on an amnesty that turned \nCalifornia blue probably for the rest of my lifetime. That was a \nRepublican President that got tricked into doing that. They got the \namnesty, never got the enforcement. And that is what the Gang of Eight \nbill was going to do. Americans knew it, but we had to fight it like \ncrazy.\n  So anyway, I just find it interesting, as someone who met with \nSenator Cruz on a regular basis trying to strategize, my friend, Steve \nKing, and I met in his office sometimes about all of these efforts to \nstop this Gang of Eight bill that would have given amnesty.\n  Here is another, from June 11, 2013, ```Gang of Eight' Immigration \nBill Clears Senate Hurdle.'' I know Senator Cruz was doing all he could \nto stop it--greatly appreciated. Actually, if they hadn't slowed that \ndown, that gave us the ability to slow it down even further.\n  Here is an article from The Daily Signal by Amy Payne and Kelsey \nLucas, June 24--my anniversary--2013. It talked about that Gang of \nEight bill now has ``ballooned to 1,190 pages.'' That makes it what you \nwould call comprehensive.\n  As I pointed out to friends before, when you hear the words \n``comprehensive bill,'' the loose definition of a comprehensive bill in \nCongress is one in which some people want to hide\n\n[[Page H998]]\n\nthings that could never possibly get passed if people knew what they \nwere voting on. So it is comprehensive and massive so you can hide \nthose things that could never pass on their own if people knew what \nthey were voting on.\n  So it is amazing to see in politics how perception that is completely \nfalse can be considered true just because people are saying it. I know. \nI was here, and I am grateful that Ted Cruz got elected. Without his \nadvice, his meeting with us, encouraging, doing all he could in the \nSenate, I don't believe we would have stopped amnesty, and I don't \nbelieve this election would even be competitive. The Democratic nominee \nwould walk away with this thing had the Gang of Eight bill been passed \nas they wanted.\n  Mr. Speaker, might I inquire how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Young of Iowa). The gentleman from Texas \nhas 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. One other thing that has been really intriguing, Mr. \nSpeaker, this verse has been quoted time and time again in recent \nyears. I know there are people that freak out when I quote Bible verse \nbecause they had one of these liberal teachers that didn't teach them \nthe truth about American history and the fact that the Bible has been \nthe most quoted book--nothing even close--so many times more than any \nother book or any other author ever in American history. The Bible has \nbeen quoted on the House floor and Senate floor by Presidents more than \nany other book.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  The President says we are not a Christian Nation. I used to say I \nwon't debate that, and now I think he is right. But we were. We started \nout based on Judeo-Christian principles, so much so that a very \nthorough decision by the U.S. Supreme Court back in the late 1800s, \nwhen we had finally done the right thing and eliminated the scourge to \nthis Nation that had held this Nation back for many decades, called \nslavery, was finally ended.\n  The Supreme Court went through all of the foundings, the Founders, \nthe statements of the Founders, statements and founding documents, \nstatements of State constitutions, and concluded after all of the \nrecitation of evidence--130, 140 years later--they said: This is a \nChristian Nation. Well, it was back in the late 1800s.\n  It doesn't hurt to still quote scripture. We have other religions \nrepresented in the House--friends. You can be Muslim, Buddhist, \natheist, agnostic, whatever you want to be. I have got a number of \nreally wonderful Jewish friends in Congress. You can be whatever you \nwant to be because a government based on Judeo-Christian principles \nwill protect everyone's rights.\n  Islam will not protect rights like that. There is really not another \nreligion that, beliefs of which, will protect every religion, no \nreligion, equally. That is because we know. God gives us those choices. \nSo who are we to take them away?\n  Back in 2 Chronicles, the verse is very clear, and God was pointing \nthis out. I realize Moses--it is up there, the only full face profile \nhere in this room--was considered the greatest lawgiver of all times, \nalthough the Supreme Court last summer basically said: Forget what \nMoses said and God said. He didn't know what he was talking about. When \nJesus quoted Moses about marriage, he didn't know what he was talking \nabout. They were a bunch of fools. They didn't know. We are much \nsmarter than Moses and Jesus. Now our Supreme Court majority is our \nGod.\n  But 2 Chronicles 7:14: ``If my people who are called by my name \nhumble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, \nthen I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their \nland.''\n  I preached a sermon on that last summer entitled ``Humble or \nCrumble.'' We do need to humble ourselves as a Nation, but we don't \neven have to do it as a Nation. It makes clear it is not everybody. It \ndoesn't have to be everybody in America. Just those who are called by \nthe Lord's name. If you humble yourself, pray, see God's face, turn \nfrom your wicked ways: I will hear from heaven, I am going to heal your \nland. You will be blessed beyond.\n  I really think that after the Civil War and we finally ended the \nscourge of slavery, that is when we started being blessed beyond \nmeasure. So the 20th century was just absolutely incredible, and we \nbecame a superpower blessed beyond measure. When we became a \nsuperpower, of course, like so many times in history, nations that were \nbegun on the Judeo beliefs, once they turned from acknowledging God, \nthen God let them go.\n  That is why Christians had believed this was such an important verse. \nI have heard it thousands of times in recent years.\n  I just have to note, Mr. Speaker, it is interesting now that \nChristian leaders across the Nation have said: I think we are going to \nhave to change this. Let's have a new translation. How about if we say: \nIf my people are called by my name, we'll select a leader who says he \nhas never humbled himself, he has never asked forgiveness of God, if we \ncan just get a leader who will never humble himself, then God will hear \nthat from heaven and he will heal our land.\n  I want to close with these words from Francis Scott Key, April 14, \n1814. As a captive on a British ship and the British unmercifully \nbombed Fort McHenry, he didn't figure there was much left. When the \nmorning came and there was Old Glory, he penned The Star Spangled \nBanner.\n  I will close with the last verse, Mr. Speaker:\n  ``O! thus be it ever, when free men shall stand Between their loved \nhome and the war's desolation; Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the \nHeav'n-rescued land Praise the Pow'r that hath made, and preserved us \nas a Nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just; And this \nbe our motto, `In God is our trust!' And the star spangled banner in \ntriumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the \nbrave!''\n  May we remember those words.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/26/house-section/article/H998-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to an enrolled bill of the Senate \nof the following title:\n\n       S. 238.
