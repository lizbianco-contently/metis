Mr. Speaker, the war on coal is a \nreality in West Virginia.\n  Let me introduce to you Kevin Altice of Mount Hope. He describes \nhimself as a former coal miner. Why? Because he lost his job just a few \nmonths ago. He is now going back to school, but he worries about his \nfellow miners trying to find jobs.\n  Kevin is a West Virginia coal voice. Here is what he wrote to me:\n  ``A lot of coworkers have had to move out of State for employment, a \nsad trend that needs to stop.\n  ``Luckily, my wife is a schoolteacher, which helps on our income, but \nwe have seen how the downturn in the coal industry has even impacted \nour education system.\n  ``We, as West Virginians, are in dire times, and something needs done \nto protect our futures.''\n  That is Kevin's story.\n  As we work to diversify our State's economy, we cannot forget about \nproviding education and retraining for these miners. My bill, the \nAssisting America's Dislocated Miners Act, will help provide retraining \nopportunities for more miners like Kevin. Our coal miners are \nhardworking, determined, and proud to provide for their families. All \nthey need is a chance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1601-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, more than five decades have passed since we \nsigned the Equal Pay Act into law, but in 2016, women still make 79 \ncents to the dollar that their male counterparts make. And it is worse \nfor women of color. African American women earn 60 cents and Latinas \nearn 55 for every dollar earned by men.\n  The Joint Economic Committee, which I am proud to serve on, found \nthat women lose out on more than $500,000 throughout their career. And \nthis wage gap continues to hurt women when they retire. The median \nincome for women 65 and older is 44 percent less than that of men in \nthe same age group.\n  Every Congress, for nearly 20 years, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro has \nintroduced the Paycheck Fairness Act. I am thankful for her leadership, \nand I am proud to join her as a cosponsor of the bill, because I am not \ngoing to stand by while North Carolina women make just 82 cents for \nevery dollar earned by men.\n  Today on Equal Pay Day, I call on my colleagues to stop shortchanging \nwomen and our families. Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1601-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1601-H1602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE THUNDERRIDGE GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1\n\n[[Page H1602]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COFFMAN.

He \nis a devout Catholic who supports many projects in the Diocese of \nSavannah, not the least of which is his alma mater, Benedictine.\n  In 2012, Mr. Welch used a Super Bowl commercial to offer a reward for \ninformation regarding the unsolved murder of a volunteer firefighter. \nThe commercial led to the arrest and conviction of the killer. In the \nyears since, Mr. Welch has not wavered in his crusade against crime in \nour community.\n  More recently, Mr. Welch took up the cause of his beloved Bacon Park \nGolf Course, where he got his first job.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Indiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2512, which would add the \nZika\n\n[[Page H1603]]\n\nvirus to the FDA Priority Review Voucher program.\n  S. 2512 is companion legislation to H.R. 4400, authored by \nRepresentative Butterfield and myself.\n  Under the FDA Priority Review Voucher program, once a vaccine or \ntherapy for a disease on the FDA Priority Review Voucher program has \nbeen developed, the manufacturer of that product receives a voucher \nthat can be used to fast-track review by the FDA of another product in \nthe development pipeline. At zero cost to the taxpayer, this is a \nsignificant incentive for private industry to invest the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars and the many man-hours it takes to produce a \nvaccine or treatment.\n  In a world where we can travel across oceans in a matter of hours, an \noutbreak that begins on a different continent can arrive in the United \nStates in a very short period of time. As Americans travel to and from \nCentral and South America, we are beginning to see more Zika cases here \nat home.\n  This doesn't just affect citizens in tropical areas, but in places as \nfar north as Indiana as well. In my district, a nurse educator at \nIndiana Wesleyan University contracted the disease in January when she \ntraveled to Haiti to teach a seminar in transcultural nursing.\n  Most people don't experience symptoms if they contract the Zika \nvirus, but women who become pregnant or trying to become pregnant and \ntheir babies are at risk. For babies, that can include serious birth \ndefects that may lead to mental and physical disabilities. The threat \nis multi-generational, and we still don't know a lot about this \ndisease. We can't treat it right now and we can't prevent it right now. \nThat is a huge problem.\n  The Zika virus is not the only biological threat we face to our \npublic health and national security. Right now, despite the steps taken \nduring and after the Ebola epidemic, we remain largely reactionary in \nour response to pandemics and biological threats. We need to be more \nproactive in our response to all pathogens, like the Zika virus, that \nare a threat to our national security and the health of our citizens.\n  A more proactive approach would be to incentivize the development of \nvaccines and treatments through the FDA Priority Review Voucher \nprogram, known as PRV, before they reach the advanced stage of \ncontagion.\n  This past October, a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Panel on Biodefense \nreleased a report on America's vulnerabilities to a biological event. \nThe panel found that the underlying problem isn't a specific disease, \nbut our country's inability to mobilize quickly and effectively to \nidentify, contain, treat, and eliminate any kind of biological threat \nto people in the United States.\n  Incentivizing the research into a neglected tropical disease like \nZika is a necessary, but not final, step. Our work is not done. As we \nmove forward, we need to expand the PRV program to other items on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's Material Threat list. Doing so will \nput us on offense and better prepare us for the next outbreak, whatever \nit might be.\n  Today we have an opportunity to take meaningful action in a fight \nagainst this deadly disease. I applaud Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy \nfor recognizing the severity of the threat and allowing for this bill's \ntimely consideration.\n  I have welcomed the opportunity to have worked with Representative \nButterfield on this important issue, and Chairman Green and others on \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee who recognize that the Zika virus is \nof significant threat not only to people in other parts of the world, \nbut actually the people in the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on S. 2512, the Adding Zika Virus to the \nFDA Priority Review Voucher Program Act.\n  Representatives G.K. Butterfield and Susan Brooks led this \nlegislation in the House and members of our Energy and Commerce \nCommittee. I want to thank them for their commitment to mitigating the \nZika virus outbreak.\n  S. 2512 will add Zika virus to the list of qualified tropical \ndiseases under the Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher program, \nPRV.\n  Zika virus is among several recent and emerging global health threats \nthat remind us of the need for effective incentives for research and \ndevelopment of neglected tropical diseases, and for infectious diseases \nat large. Neglected tropical diseases, or NTDs, represent more than 10 \npercent of the global disease burden. However, only 4 percent of all \nnew drugs and vaccines approved across the globe in the next decade \nwere for NTDs.\n  The NTD Priority Review Voucher program was created by Congress in \n2007 to be a much-needed incentive for products that diagnose and treat \nsuch diseases for which market forces fall short.\n  The Adding Ebola to the FDA Priority Review Voucher Program, which \nwas signed into law in 2014 and was led by myself and Representative \nMarsha Blackburn, gave the FDA the authority to add diseases to the \nprogram by issuing an order. The agency has already used this authority \nto add Chagas to the program. While the program is successful, it could \nbe more so.\n  Currently, there is no requirement for a product to be novel or that \nit be made available and affordable for the patients whom awarded \nproducts are designed to help. It should be amended to strengthen its \neffectiveness. This can be done by adding a novelty requirement and an \naccess strategy requirement, like what is mandated under the Rare \nPediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program.\n\n  This legislation did not go through the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, so the opportunity to discuss the NTD PRV program was not \ntaken. I hope to work with my colleagues to incorporate amendments on \nfuture legislation that will improve the functioning of the program. \nDoing so will allow it to incentivize novel programs and ensure they \nare widely accessible to patients in need.\n  Improvements to the PRV program would be one important step toward \nensuring we have effective strategies to incentivize both research and \ndevelopment for NTDs. Broader changes are urgently needed to ensure the \nR system delivers new vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments to \npatients presenting and exposed to NTDs and resistant infections.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on additional mechanisms \nto ensure R for these emerging threats is successfully and properly \nincentivized. Doing so is necessary for the flourishment of biomedical \ninnovation in this space.\n  I fully agree with the bill sponsors that we need to do all we can to \nrespond to the Zika virus by facilitating the development of and access \nto medical products as quickly as possible.\n  The administration has asked Congress for $1.9 billion in emergency \nfunding to enhance our efforts to prepare and respond to the outbreak, \nboth around the world and here at home.\n  This legislation is arguably a step in the right direction, and I \nagain thank the sponsors for their commitment and leadership. However, \nthis bill far from renders the emergency supplemental funding request \nunnecessary. Dedicated funds, some of which will go towards medical \nproduct development to respond to the Zika virus, are essential to \nsustaining Health and Human Services' response efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to ask swiftly to approve emergency funding for \na robust Zika virus outbreak response.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), the \ncosponsor of the legislation, but also a member of our Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Green for yielding \ntime, and thank him for his extraordinary leadership not only on this \nbill, but on our committee as well. To my colleague Susan Brooks from \nIndiana, I thank the Congresswoman for all of her work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of adding the Zika virus to the \nFDA Tropical Disease Product Priority Review Voucher program. The bill \nwe are considering today is the Senate companion to my bill, H.R. 4400, \nwhich I introduced on February 1 of this year.\n\n[[Page H1604]]\n\n  Yesterday the White House and the CDC announced the dangers of the \nZika virus are ``scarier than we initially thought.'' The CDC estimates \nthat there are already hundreds of thousands of cases in the United \nStates and that the number is expected to grow as the summer nears.\n  The health consequences of the Zika virus infection are staggering. \nZika infections in pregnant women can result in serious birth defects, \nincluding microcephaly and neurological disorders in newborns. The \nvirus also has serious impacts on adults. This is a global public \nhealth emergency. We must act now to combat the spread of this deadly \nvirus.\n  My bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by 31 of our House colleagues, \nand the Senate companion cosponsored by 11 Senators, provides a pathway \nfor expediting treatments for Zika.\n  Supporting research and development in the U.S. to fight this will \nnot only benefit us here at home, but will also help hundreds of \nmillions of people around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support this legislation \nand other efforts, including authorizing additional emergency funding \nto combat this virus.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for his leadership on \nthis issue and for certainly bringing this to our attention as soon as \nit was brought to his attention that this needed to be resolved.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2512 to add the Zika virus \nto the list of tropical diseases under the FDA Priority Review Voucher \nprogram for tropical diseases.\n  While evidence of human infection by the Zika virus has been reported \nfor over 60 years, there has been little progress in the development of \ntreatment or vaccines. Existing incentives have been insufficient to \nencourage development of new and innovative treatments for the virus.\n  However, with the recent spread of the virus from South America to \nthe Caribbean and North America, the level of infection has reached \npandemic levels. Although the Zika virus may be rare in the United \nStates, the increase of airline transportation, immigration, and \ntourism only creates an environment for the Zika virus to be easily \ntransmitted.\n  S. 2512 would allow the FDA Priority Review Voucher program to work \nexactly as intended. It would add the Zika virus to the list of \ntropical diseases that are available under the voucher program.\n  This bill would ultimately accomplish two goals. First, it would \nprovide an incentive for drug developers in the form of fast-track \napproval of therapies to treat the Zika virus.\n\n  Second, it would create an avenue where treatments for the virus \nwould get to patients quicker and ultimately end this pandemic \noutbreak.\n  This legislation is vital to ensuring the health and safety of our \nNation. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have no other speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I would just like to point out that as recently as yesterday, Federal \nofficials have indicated that the mosquito that carries the Zika virus \nis actually anticipated to be in over 30 States at this point. \nOriginally, it was in 12 States, and now it is believed to be found in \n30 States in the United States.\n  This is an extremely serious problem, one in which I am pleased that \nthis House and this Chamber is paying attention to. I appreciate the \ngentleman from Georgia and his remarks.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of S. 2512, \nthe Adding Zika Virus to the FDA Priority Review Voucher Program Act.\n  This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to add the \nZika virus to the list of tropical diseases under the priority review \nvoucher program, which awards a voucher to the sponsor of a new drug or \nbiological product that is approved to prevent or treat a tropical \ndisease.\n  A voucher entitles the holder to have a future new drug or biological \nproduct application acted upon by the Food and Drug Administration \nwithin six months.\n  My support has been steadfast, since I signed a letter at the virus' \nonset, urging the FDA to quickly exercise the authority provided by \nCongress to add the Zika virus to the Neglected Tropical Disease list.\n  I thank local, state and national health care professionals, public \nservants and others who have instituted preventative measures to combat \nthe public health and safety threat that the Zika virus poses to our \nnation and our Western Hemisphere neighbors.\n  The Zika virus, spread primarily through mosquitos and first detected \ndecades ago in Uganda, has now begun to spread rapidly in South \nAmerica.\n  The recent outbreak has been linked with serious neurological \ndisorders and life-threatening birth defects.\n  As the Member of Congress representing the Eighteenth Congressional \nDistrict of Texas, centered in Houston, along the mainland United \nStates' Gulf Coast, I know first hand that Texans in particular are \namong the nation's most at-risk.\n  On March 10, 2015, I held a summit in Houston for the leading state \nand local experts in health, environmental control, and mosquito \neradicating fields who are challenged with protecting communities from \nthe Zika Virus to strategize and develop an action plan for the City \nand Harris County, Texas to reduce and control virus transmissions.\n  Houston and other cities in the Gulf Coast region, during the late \nspring and summer months, have tropical climates that support the \nbreeding habitats of Zika Virus carrying-mosquitoes.\n  In early March of this year, the Center for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) reported 153 laboratory-confirmed cases of the Zika \nvirus infection, among U.S. travelers between December 2015 and March \n9, 2016--today, the number of reported cases has grown to 346, many of \nwhich are in areas further north than the 12 originally expected \nvulnerable states.\n  The first confirmed cases of the Zika virus hit Houston in November \nof 2015, after the Harris County Public Health & Environmental Services \n(HCPHES) received confirmation from the CDC that the Zika virus was \nconfirmed in a traveler recently returning from Latin America.\n  Not long after, in January 15, 2016, the Centers for Disease Control \nissued a health advisory.\n  On January 26, 2016, President Obama called for the rapid development \nof tests, vaccines and treatments to fight the mosquito-transmitted \nvirus and insisted upon the need to develop vaccines and therapeutics.\n  We have known of the potential enormity of the Zika threat since \nJanuary 28, 2016, when the World Health Organization (WHO) reported \nthat it was ``spreading explosively'' throughout the Americas and was \nlikely to reach North America soon.\n  As of January 28, 2016, the American Congress of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) \npromulgated Practice Advisory guidance regarding the Zika virus and \npregnant women.\n  On February 1, 2016, the WHO announced an international public health \nemergency due to the recent cluster of neurological disorders and \nneonatal malformations reported throughout the Americas.\n  On February 3, 2016, the first local transmission of a Zika virus \ninfection was reported in the Caribbean, meaning that mosquitoes in the \narea were infected and began spreading the disease to people.\n  Additionally, the Pan American Health Organization reported 26 \ncountries and territories in the Americas exhibiting local \ntransmission.\n  On February 4, 2016, the CDC reported a case in Texas, my home state, \nof Zika's spread by sexual transmission.\n  The Zika virus is primarily transmitted via three types of \nmosquitoes--two of which are rampant in the Houston area.\n  The poor are an especially vulnerable population, living in a hot \nenvironment.\n  The Gulf Coast presents unique vulnerabilities impacting the spread \nof the Zika virus in Houston that are of the utmost concern, and a key \nmotivation for supporting today's legislation.\n  My foremost priority is to protect the health and safety of \nAmericans, especially those in Houston.\n  My city's people and their surrounding neighbors are living daily in \nextreme poverty--and now have to contend with this devastating disease.\n  We saw in Brazil that the poorest communities of their nation \nexperienced the worse Zika-plagued outcomes.\n  Environmental issues, such as discarded tires, furniture, and debris \nare part of the landscape of the Americans' lives we ought to be\n\n[[Page H1605]]\n\nsafeguarding--and are creating the perfect breeding conditions for Zika \nmosquitoes.\n  Amplifying the impact, the CDC reports that the virus is spread \nthrough sexual contact and advises special precautions for pregnant \nwomen.\n  The Zika virus can be spread from a pregnant woman to her fetus and \nhas been linked to a serious birth defect of the brain called \nmicrocephaly in the babies of mothers who were exposed to the Zika \nvirus while pregnant.\n  Exacerbating measures, expectant mothers may not know that Zika virus \nmosquitoes inhabit the areas in which they live, until they see the \nterrible birth defects associated with the disease, plaguing the late-\nterm-30-week ultrasound images of their unborn child's sonogram.\n  Other problems have been detected among fetuses and infants infected \nwith Zika virus before birth, such as absent or poorly developed brain \nstructures, eye defects, hearing deficits, and impaired growth.\n  About one in five people infected with the Zika virus become \nsymptomatic.\n  Characteristic clinical findings include acute onset of fever, \nmaculopapular rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis.\n  Today we are witnessing the spread of yet another tropical disease, \nthreatening the health of U.S. citizens, much like Ebola did during the \npast few years.\n  The WHO confirmed that as many as four million people could be \ninfected by the end of the year.\n  There is no treatment or cure for those infected by the Zika virus.\n  The WHO is concerned about this rapidly spreading disease due to the \nlack of immunity in newly affected areas, the wide geographical \ndistribution of infected mosquitos, and the absence of any vaccines, \ntreatments, or rapid diagnostic tests.\n  Given the lack of treatment available for the Zika virus, many \nsupported the critical need for the FDA to use its Congressionally \ngranted authority to add Zika to the list of Neglected Tropical \nDiseases eligible for the Priority Review Voucher program.\n  On February 22, 2016, President Obama asked Congress to consider an \nFY 2016 emergency supplemental appropriations request of approximately \n$1.9 billion to respond to the Zika virus, both domestically and \ninternationally.\n  In conjunction with today's bill's efforts, this funding would build \nupon ongoing preparation efforts and provide resources for the \nDepartments of Health and Human Services and State, as well as the U.S. \nAgency for International Development (USAID).\n  The collective goal of these efforts, as I see them, is to provide \nimmediate responsiveness to prepare for and prevent the spread of Zika \nvirus transmission;\n  Speed research, development, and procurement of vaccines, \ntherapeutics, and diagnostics; and\n  Enhance the ability of Zika-affected countries to better combat \nmosquitoes, control transmission, and support affected populations.\n  The necessity presents itself to fortify our domestic health system, \ndetect and respond to any potential Zika outbreaks at home, and to \nlimit the spread in other countries.\n  S. 2512 encourages the Federal Government to take a needed step, \naddressing the changing circumstances and emerging needs of populations \nexposed to the Zika virus.\n  The CDC and NIH said that the previously endemic Ebola Virus created \na template for Federal and State agencies that are currently attempting \nto address the Zika virus threat.\n  If nothing else, the Ebola crisis demonstrated the critical need to \ndevelop effective vaccines and treatments before an endemic outbreak \nbegins.\n  This simple action by the FDA, I hope, will spur the development of \nan effective vaccine or treatment combating the Zika virus, and as a \nresult save countless American lives.\n  This bill is a step toward providing the protections that should be \nguaranteed to every American.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S.2512, the Adding Zika \nVirus to the FDA Priority Review Voucher Program Act.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2512.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1605-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1605-H1610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1645\n              FINANCIAL INSTITUTION BANKRUPTCY ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 2947, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In 2008, our economy suffered one of the most significant financial \ncrises in history. In the midst of the crisis and in response to a fear \nthat some financial firms' failures could cause severe harm to the \noverall economy, the Federal Government provided extraordinary \ntaxpayer-funded assistance in order to prevent certain financial firms' \nfailures. In the ensuing years, experts from the financial, regulatory, \nlegal, and academic communities examined how best to prevent another \nsimilar crisis from occurring and how to eliminate the possibility of \nusing taxpayer moneys to bail out failing firms.\n  The Judiciary Committee has advanced the review of this issue with \nthe aim of crafting a solution that will better equip our bankruptcy \nlaws to resolve failing firms while also encouraging greater private \ncounterparty diligence in order to reduce the likelihood of another \nfinancial crisis. Among other things, this responded to provisions of \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which \ncalled for an examination of how to improve the Bankruptcy Code in this \narea.\n  Last Congress, after three hearings, the Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act, which is \nlegislation that improved the Bankruptcy Code to better facilitate the \nresolution of a financial firm. That legislation was the culmination of \na bipartisan process that solicited and incorporated the views of a \nwide range of leading experts and relevant regulators. The bill \nultimately passed the House by a voice vote under a suspension of the \nrules.\n  This Congress, Representative Trott reintroduced the Financial \nInstitution Bankruptcy Act as H.R. 2947. Following its introduction, \nthe Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law \nconducted a hearing on the bill. The hearing witnesses all supported \nthe legislation while providing recommendations for further refinements \nto the bill. Those recommendations were incorporated, and the Judiciary \nCommittee approved the legislation by a unanimous vote of 25-0.\n  The bill under consideration today is the product of a careful, \ndeliberate, and thorough process, and it reflects a diverse range of \nviews from a variety of interested parties. The Financial Institution \nBankruptcy Act makes several improvements to the Bankruptcy Code in \norder to enhance the prospect of the efficient resolution of a \nfinancial firm through the bankruptcy process.\n  The bill allows for the speedy transfer of a financial firm's \noperating assets over the course of a weekend. This quick transfer \nallows the financial firm to continue to operate in the normal course, \nwhich preserves the value of the enterprise for the creditors of the \nbankruptcy without there being any significant impact on the firm's \nemployees, suppliers, and customers.\n  The bill also requires expedited judicial review by a bankruptcy \njudge who has been randomly chosen from a pool of judges, who has been \ndesignated in advance, and who has been selected by the chief justice \nfor his experience, expertise, and willingness to preside over these \ncomplex cases. Furthermore, the legislation provides for key regulatory \ninput throughout the process.\n  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is a bipartisan, balanced \napproach that increases transparency and predictability in the \nresolution of a financial firm. Furthermore, it ensures that \nshareholders and creditors, not taxpayers, bear the losses related to \nthe failure of a financial company.\n  I am pleased that Ranking Member Conyers is a lead sponsor of this \nimportant legislation, and I thank him\n\n[[Page H1609]]\n\nand his staff for their efforts in developing this bill. I thank \nRepresentative Trott for introducing this important legislation, and I \nthank Chairman Marino of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial and Antitrust Law, who is one of the original sponsors of \nthe bill and who helped to usher the bill through the Judiciary \nCommittee. I also commend my colleague from Georgia, who is also \ninvolved in this work and who is the ranking member of that same \nsubcommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  H.R. 2947, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2016, amends \nthe Bankruptcy Code to establish a process for the expedited judicial \nresolution of large financial institutions in order to soften the \ndisruptive effects of their collapse.\n  As we all know, the Great Recession was triggered by the widespread \nissuance and limited regulation of high-risk and, possibly, fraudulent \nmortgage-backed securities. Fueled by adjustable rate and predatory \nsubprime mortgages, these securities were issued without regard to \ncareful underwriting standards, caused a housing bubble that trapped \ncountless homeowners in unaffordable mortgages, and led to a massive \nwave of foreclosures that resulted in the worst financial crisis since \nthe Great Depression. In the wake of this crisis, the President signed \nthe Dodd-Frank Act into law so as to provide comprehensive measures to \nreduce systemic risk through heightened financial stability \nrequirements for large financial institutions.\n  Among many other requirements, title I of Dodd-Frank requires that \ncertain large financial institutions have living wills to ensure a \nrapid and orderly resolution in the event of material distress or \nfailure. Title II of the law provides for an administrative process to \nwind down these institutions so as to avoid adverse effects on the \nentire financial system; but there is no such process under the current \nbankruptcy law.\n\n  I applaud Congressman Trott and the chairman of the full committee, \nChairman Goodlatte, for addressing this concern by offering this \nlegislation to revise the Bankruptcy Code in order to establish a \nspecialized form of bankruptcy relief that would facilitate the \nexpeditious resolution of large financial institutions and would \nminimize the disruptive impact of a company's collapse on the financial \nsystem. The legislation largely accomplishes this goal by establishing \na resolution process that authorizes a court to provide relief by \ntransferring a debtor's assets to a bridge company, under an expedited \ntimeline, while minimizing the adverse effects of the bankruptcy on the \nfinancial system.\n  While these aspects of the bill are commendable, I remain concerned, \nhowever, that this legislation lacks a funding mechanism that would \nallow the Federal Government to provide liquidity to the company, which \nis a key difference between an orderly resolution under Dodd-Frank and \nthe resolution contemplated by H.R. 2947.\n  In a typical bankruptcy case, the debtor's reorganization may be \nfunded by private parties or by the Federal Government, as illustrated \nby the General Motors bankruptcy. In many instances, liquidity provided \nby the U.S. Government to prevent the collapse of a financial \ninstitution has either returned a profit to the taxpayers or is likely \nto be repaid.\n  Leading bankruptcy experts have found that providing liquidity to \ndistressed financial institutions ``is essential to successfully \nresolving the firm without creating undue systemic risk.'' This \ncritical mechanism has prevented the collapses of several major \nfinancial institutions without cost to the taxpayer.\n  Lastly, I would caution against efforts to combine H.R. 2947 with \nlegislation that would strike title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. As the \nNational Bankruptcy Conference has observed, laws that are currently in \nplace, such as title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, should remain in effect \nbecause the ability of U.S. regulators to assume full control of the \nresolution process to elicit the cooperation from non-U.S. regulators \nis an essential insurance policy against systemic risk and potential \nconflict and dysfunction among the multinational components of these \ninstitutions. I would also note that title II of the Dodd-Frank Act \nwill serve as a valuable backstop to the bankruptcy process should this \nbill become law.\n  Notwithstanding these concerns, I thank, once again, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia, the gentleman from Michigan, and also my friend and \nchair of the relevant subcommittee, Tom Marino from Pennsylvania, for \ntheir leadership on this issue and for the bipartisan process in \ndeveloping this legislation. I also thank the Democratic and Republican \ncounsel of the Judiciary Committee, Susan Jensen and Anthony Grossi, \nfor their tireless work and substantive expertise in developing this \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as \nhe may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), the chief \nsponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. TROTT. I thank my colleagues Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member \nConyers, and my friend from Georgia for their support of this important \nlegislation. I also thank the other Members and the staff who have \nhelped shape this bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are frustrated with their \ngovernment. While families are working hard, are paying their taxes, \nand are doing their best to keep the American Dream alive, Washington \ndecides to spend money it doesn't have on problems it shouldn't solve. \nSuffice it to say, both parties have proven to be bad stewards of our \nNation's finances.\n  Many of us were disappointed to see $700 billion in taxpayer money \nspent on bailing out failed financial institutions in 2008. The \nAmerican people should not be on the hook for the failures of bad \nbusiness practices. The American people entrusted us with their tax \ndollars, and Washington used the money to bail out banks. We cannot let \nthis happen again. The legislation we are considering today is aimed at \nprotecting American taxpayers and at reducing the risk of another \ntaxpayer-funded bailout.\n  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act protects taxpayers by \nreforming the process of how failing banks go through bankruptcy \nproceedings. We have incorporated the recommendations of hearing \nwitnesses, regulators, and experts from four Judiciary Committee \nhearings over the past 2 years. This effort is, truly, the product of \nbipartisan work and compromise.\n  Under this bill, the process will be handled by an experienced \njudge--a judge who knows how to handle the complex reorganizations of \nfinancial institutions. It will also result in a transparent judicial \nprocess instead of there being a group of bank CEOs and regulators that \nmeets in a back room in order to decide how to save a failing bank. It \nwill ensure that shareholders and creditors are at risk when a \nfinancial institution fails, not the American taxpayer. Further, \ndecades of case law and precedent will ensure a fair result.\n  This bill is the kind of commonsense legislation that, I believe, \noffers important solutions, that protects the American people, and that \nis deserving of strong bipartisan support. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this effort. Let's pass this bill and move it to \nthe Senate for consideration.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I only have one speaker remaining, \nmyself, to close. So I am prepared to do that once the gentleman from \nGeorgia yields back.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues pass \nthis measure.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act \nis a necessary reform to ensure that taxpayers will not be called on to \nrescue the next failing financial firm. The legislation relies on \nlongstanding bankruptcy principles that will be applied in a \npredictable and transparent manner.\n  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is a bipartisan measure\n\n[[Page H1610]]\n\nthat enjoys broad support from outside experts. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of this important reform. I thank my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee for their bipartisan effort to produce this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2947, the \n``Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2016.'' for several reasons.\n  To begin with, the bill addresses a real need--recognized by \nregulatory agencies, bankruptcy experts, and the private sector--that \nthe bankruptcy law must be amended so that it can expeditiously restore \ntrust in the financial marketplace as soon as possible after the \ncollapse of a major financial institution.\n  As many of you may recall, the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 \ncaused a worldwide freeze on the availability of credit, which not only \naffected Wall Street, but Main Street as well.\n  Even after Lehman sought bankruptcy relief, the filing did not \nprevent the near collapse of our Nation's economy. The Lehman case \nrevealed that current bankruptcy law is ill-equipped to deal with \ncomplex financial institutions in economic distress.\n  H.R. 2947 addresses these shortcomings by establishing a specialized \nform of bankruptcy relief whereby the holding company of a large \nfinancial institution could expeditiously obtain such relief, while \nallowing its operating subsidiaries to function outside of bankruptcy.\n  Through this mechanism, the debtor's principal assets, such as its \nsecured property, financial contracts, and the stock of its \nsubsidiaries, would be transferred to a temporary ``bridge company,'' \nthat, in turn, would liquidate these assets for the benefit of \ncreditors under the supervision of a trustee.\n  This process should reduce the likelihood of disruption to the \nfinancial marketplace and avoid any worldwide freeze on the \navailability of credit.\n  Another reason why I support this bill is that it appropriately \nrecognizes the important role the Dodd-Frank Act has in the regulation \nof large financial institutions.\n  Without doubt, the Great Recession was a direct result of the \nregulatory equivalent of the Wild West.\n  In the absence of any meaningful regulation of the mortgage industry, \nlenders developed high risk subprime mortgages and used predatory \nmarketing tactics targeting the most vulnerable.\n  These doomed-to-fail mortgages were then securitized and sold to \nunsuspecting investors, including pension funds and school districts.\n  Millions of Americans were trapped in mortgages they could no longer \nafford. This resulted in causing vast waves of foreclosures, massive \nunemployment, and international economic upheaval.\n  The Dodd-Frank Act goes a long way toward reinvigorating a regulatory \nsystem that makes the financial marketplace more accountable, more \ntransparent, and more resilient.\n  And, H.R. 2947 will make the Dodd-Frank Act even more effective by \nensuring the bankruptcy law is better equipped to resolve these \ncompanies.\n  Finally, I am pleased that H.R. 2947 is the product of a very \ncollaborative, inclusive, and deliberative process.\n  A collaborative process--particularly with respect to complex \nlegislation with wide-ranging consequences--is essential. It should be \nthe norm, not the exception.\n  Accordingly, I commend Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte for his \nleadership in ensuring this collaborative process for H.R. 2947.\n  Nevertheless, while the bill is an excellent measure, it \nunfortunately does not include any provision allowing the federal \ngovernment to be a lender of last resort, a critical element that \nnearly every expert recognizes is necessary to ensure financial \nstability. This is a matter that at some point must be addressed.\n  Again, I want to acknowledge the excellent level of cooperation on \nboth sides of the aisle in producing the legislation that is pending \nbefore us today.\n  In closing, I appreciate that my Judiciary Committee colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle have come together to support H.R. 2947.\n  Nevertheless, I strongly encourage Chairman Goodlatte to consider \nother bankruptcy-related measures that my colleagues and I have \nintroduced this Congress dealing with equally important matters.\n  These measures include H.R. 97, the ``Protecting Employees and \nRetirees in Business Bankruptcies Act,'' which I introduced to help \nlevel the playing field for employees and pensioners in corporate \nbankruptcy cases.\n  I also would urge consideration of legislation, such as H.R. 1674, \nthe ``Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act,'' a bill sponsored \nby my colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee Steve Cohen, that would \nhelp relieve those who--through no fault of their own--become entrapped \nin unaffordable, predatory student loan obligations.\n  These measures also deserve to be considered prior to the close of \nthis Congress.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2947, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1610-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1610-H1612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PREVENTING CRIMES AGAINST VETERANS ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 4676, as amended, \ncurrently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 4676, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2016, was \nintroduced by Congressman Tom Rooney of Florida, a former member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and Congressman Ted Deutch of Florida, a current \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  This legislation fixes a loophole in Federal law and provides Federal \nprosecutors with an additional tool to go after criminals who seek to \ndefraud veterans.\n  In recent years, financial predators have increasingly targeted \nveterans, particularly elderly veterans in low-income housing, in an \neffort to defraud the veterans out of their Veterans Affairs benefits.\n  These criminals offer to help veterans with their cases, claim to get \ntheir benefits approved in record time, charge fees that are often in \nthe thousands of dollars, and then provide them with little or no \nassistance.\n  Under current law, many of these fraudsters would be vulnerable to \nprosecution under the mail or wire fraud statutes if they engage in \nthis sort of fraudulent scheme by calling a veteran on the phone, \nsending them an email, mailing them a letter, or otherwise using the \ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce to commit fraud.\n  However, increasingly these criminals are taking advantage of a \nloophole in Federal law by conducting in-person seminars or meeting in \nperson at a veteran's home or assisted living facility.\n\n[[Page H1611]]\n\n  In at least one recent example, a fraudster visited an assisted \nliving facility in Florida and asked the staff to round up all the \nveterans for a seminar. This sort of conduct--swindling an elderly \nveteran out of his or her benefits--is truly reprehensible and worthy \nof Congress' attention.\n  H.R. 4676, which has the support of the veterans service community, \naddresses this conduct. This vulnerable population has done its duty to \nprotect us from harm.\n  It is our duty to help protect them. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, \nsome people wonder all their lives if they have made a difference. \nVeterans don't have that problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and \nprotect our Nation's veterans.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I am pleased to support H.R. 4676, the Preventing Crimes Against \nVeterans Act of 2016, as amended. This legislation provides an \nimportant tool for Federal prosecutors to combat veterans' benefits \nfraud, a very despicable practice.\n  Because we honor their service and the sacrifices that they have \nmade, it is particularly important that we go above and beyond the call \nof duty to protect America's veterans from fraud and to ensure the \nintegrity of the system of benefits we provide to them.\n  Currently, there are about 21 million veterans of the United States \nmilitary, men and women who selflessly served our Nation in various \ntheaters of war, from the Second World War, Korea, and Vietnam to more \nrecent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, many of our \nveterans, as a result of their service, have physical and mental scars.\n  There are well over 1 million American veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities. The suicide rate among veterans is 300 percent \nabove the national average, and it is estimated that about 30 percent \nof all Vietnam veterans and 20 percent of veterans of the recent Middle \nEast conflicts suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder in a given \nyear.\n  In addition, veterans are more likely than nonveterans to become \nhomeless. They comprise 17 percent of our homeless population. On any \ngiven night, an estimated 50,000 veterans are sleeping on America's \nstreets.\n  In recognition of the extreme sacrifice by our veterans and the \nhardships many of them continue to face after completion of their \nmilitary service, it is our solemn duty and our obligation to provide \nto the best of our ability an appropriate measure of compensation for \nthem.\n  For instance, we provide disability payments to those with service-\nconnected disabilities. We provide pensions for veterans with limited \nincomes. We provide them with opportunities for education and training \nunder the GI Bill. And we also provide various life insurance benefits. \nThis is the least that we can do, and it is still not enough.\n  Unfortunately, there continues to be issues with the medical care we \nprovide our veterans and problems with some benefits never being \nprocessed and paid because of the loss of claims by the Veterans \nBenefits Administration.\n  H.R. 4676 would make it a crime to knowingly engage in any scheme to \ndefraud a veteran of his or her veteran's benefits or to knowingly \nengage in fraud in connection with obtaining veteran's benefits. Anyone \nconvicted of such crime could and should be fined, imprisoned, or \nsubjected to both penalties.\n  I note that the amended version of the bill we are considering today \nreflects an amendment offered in the Judiciary Committee markup by \nRanking Member John Conyers. The amendment, which was approved by voice \nvote, extends the bill's protections to fraud involving the benefits \nowed to the survivors and dependents due to the service of a veteran.\n\n  Those who defraud veterans or their surviving spouses or dependents \nendanger our system of veterans' benefits not only by harming the \nvictims, but also by diminishing the resources required to pay these \nclaims and fund the programs that are needed to help those who have \nserved their country.\n  Accordingly, I support H.R. 4676. I commend the bill's sponsors, \nRepresentative Tom Rooney and Representative Ted Deutch, both of \nFlorida, for their work on this important issue.\n  I thank the chairman for hastening the consideration of this very \nimportant piece of legislation by the full committee.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rooney), the chief sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I serve nearly 75,000 veterans in \nCongress, making Florida's 17th District one of the highest \nconcentrations of veterans in the whole Nation.\n  From helping veterans solve problems and process claims with the VA \nto working to fund veterans' benefits programs at levels deserving of \ntheir sacrifice, my duties to these 75,000 veterans is something that I \ntake very seriously. But my constituents are quick to let me know that \nI still have a lot more work to do to fix the system.\n  One particularly disturbing problem was brought to my attention by a \nnumber of veterans service organizations in my district.\n  Last year I started to hear stories about individuals advertising \nthemselves to veterans in my district, claiming that, for a hefty fee, \nwhich is illegal, they could expedite veterans' claims with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. The problem with that is they can't \nexpedite these claims.\n  One local Veteran Services Division explained to me at length how \nthese criminals are systematically targeting senior veterans in low-\nincome housing communities almost as a rule because those vets are most \nlikely to fall victim to their schemes.\n  Disturbingly, these guys will go into assisted living facilities and \n``round up all the veterans'' and coerce veterans to apply for \nveterans' benefits they don't qualify for and to sign contracts \nagreeing to pay them for services that they can never provide.\n  We all know that the claims process at the VA is far too slow and \ntakes far too long. My office works with veterans on a daily basis, as \ndo the other Members here, to try to assist them with their claims and \nexpedite the process when possible.\n  But when I hear that people are singling out veterans, targeting some \nof them based on their low income, and then earning a significant \nprofit off them, that just makes me sick.\n  As the law stands now, even though it is illegal for anyone who is \nnot an approved agent with the VA to charge a fee for helping a veteran \nwith a claim or an appeal, there is no criminal or financial penalty \nassociated with breaking this law.\n  Without a Federal criminal penalty, there is little deterring these \ndespicable people from defrauding a veteran for financial gain. The \nreality is this: It is happening in all of our districts and people are \ngetting away with it every day.\n  I refuse to let this continue unabated in my own backyard in this \ncountry, especially not to our veterans for whom I have so much \nrespect, as do we all.\n  So along with my neighbor and friend, Democratic Congressman Ted \nDeutch of south Florida, we introduced a bill to penalize people and \ncompanies making a living off of stealing from our veterans.\n  Our bill would give law enforcement and prosecutors the tools to \npenalize predators that are blatantly engaging in a scheme to defraud \nveterans, or their families, of his or her benefits by imposing a fine, \nimprisonment of up to 5 years, or both.\n  These criminals have to pay the price for their appalling actions. It \nis our duty in Congress to ensure that our Nation's heroes are \nprotected under every circumstance and aspect of the law. I am proud \nthat this bipartisan bill is on the floor today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Congressman Deutch, and the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee in support of this \nbill.\n  Each and every one of us owes our Nation's veterans the utmost \nrespect. Today we have the chance to bring justice to those veterans \nwho have fallen victim to the immoral schemes committed by some of the \nlowest forms of criminals in our country.\n\n[[Page H1612]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it warms my heart today to be a \npart of this body and to be a part of the movement of such important \nlegislation as this, which is to protect people who are very vulnerable \nto abuse. Without our action, it will just simply continue.\n  I want to once again applaud the efforts of Representative Tom Rooney \nand Representative Ted Deutch for bringing this legislation to us.\n  I look forward to its passage. I would recommend to all of my \ncolleagues that they join us and support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and Subcommittee on Crime Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, which reported this legislation, I rise in strong \nsupport of H.R. 4676 ``Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of \n2016'', a bill that provides an important additional tool for federal \nprosecutors to combat veterans' benefits fraud.\n  I support this legislation, because of the honorable sacrifices our \nveterans have made for us, it is particularly important that we protect \nthem from fraud and ensure the integrity of the system of benefits we \nprovide for them.\n  H.R. 4676 amends the federal criminal code to declare that any person \nwho knowingly engages in any scheme or artifice to defraud a veteran of \nveterans' benefits, or in connection with obtaining veteran's benefits \nfor that veteran, shall be fined, imprisoned not more than five years, \nor both.\n  Currently, there are approximately 21 million veterans of the United \nStates military living all across our country.\n  It is estimated that about 30 percent of all Vietnam veterans have \nhad post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and up to 20 percent of \nveterans serving in more recent conflicts in the Middle East are \nestimated to suffer from PTSD in a given year.\n  Given the extreme sacrifice by our veterans and the hardships many of \nthem continue to face after their military service, it is our duty to \nprovide, to the best of our ability, an appropriate measure of \ncompensation for them-particularly for those in need.\n  For instance, we provide disability payments to those with service-\nconnected disabilities, pensions for veterans with limited incomes, \neducation and training under the GI Bill, and also various life \ninsurance benefits.\n  Over 24,000 veterans reside in my 18th Congressional District and one \nof my top priorities is to fight for their benefits and to fight for \nthe rights of our most patriotic Americans.\n  Amending title 18, United States Code of H.R. 4676, provides an \nadditional tool to prevent certain frauds against veterans.\n  H.R. 4676 will ensure that prosecutors may bring criminal charges \nagainst those who knowingly defraud a veteran of their benefits or \nengage in fraud in connection with obtaining veterans' benefits.\n  476,515 veterans are living with PTSD, and need their benefits to \nprovide the top care for their disorder; it is criminal that some are \nleft untreated.\n  H.R. 4676 will bring justice to our veterans and shine a light on \nthose who are abusing the benefits given to veterans for defending our \ncountry.\n  Those who defraud veterans and the system of veterans' benefits harm \nthe victims and diminish resources required to pay the claims and fund \nthe programs that are needed to help those who have served their \ncountry.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4676.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4676, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1612-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1612-H1617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1715\n                    GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Global Food Security Act, H.R. 1567, authorizes a \ncomprehensive, strategic approach for U.S. foreign assistance to \ndeveloping countries to reduce poverty and hunger, achieve food \nsecurity and improved nutrition, promote inclusive, sustainable, \nagricultural-led economic growth, improve nutritional outcomes, \nespecially for women and children, and build resilience among \nvulnerable populations.\n  At its core, H.R. 1567 establishes a comprehensive global food \nsecurity strategy that includes eight mutually reinforcing policy \nobjectives and 15 specific goals and actions designed to develop and \nimplement a whole-of-government strategy.\n  Essential elements of the strategy include: benchmarks, timetables, \nperformance metrics, and monitoring and evaluation plans; clear and \ntransparent selection criteria for target countries; support of \ninclusive value-chain development with small-scale producers, \nespecially women; leverage of resources and expertise through \npartnerships with the private sector, farm organizations, cooperatives, \ncivil society, faith-based organizations, and agricultural research and \nacademic institutions; harnessing science, technology, and innovation \nfrom a myriad of sources, including the 24 Feed the Future innovation \nlabs; and support for improved nutrition for women and children, \nparticularly during the critical first thousand-day window until a \nchild reaches 2 years of age, and with a focus on reducing child \nstunting through nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs, \nincluding related water, sanitation, and hygiene programs.\n  Indeed, Mr. Speaker, there is perhaps no wiser and radically \ntransformative investment that we could make in the human person than \nto concentrate on ensuring that sufficient nutrition and health \nassistance is given during the first thousand days of life, a thousand \ndays that begins with conception, continues throughout pregnancy, \nincludes that milestone event called birth, and then finishes at \nroughly the second birthday of the child.\n  Children who do not receive adequate nutrition in utero are far more \nlikely to experience immune system deficiencies, making opportunistic \ninfections more debilitating, even fatal, and a large number of \nlifelong cognitive and physical deficiencies, such as stunting. UNICEF \nestimates that one in four children worldwide is stunted due to lack of \nadequate nutrition. By maximizing nutrition during the first thousand \ndays of life, we help ensure that the next 25,000 days or more in a \nperson's life are far more likely to be healthier and disease free.\n  One objective of H.R. 1567 is to graduate individuals and families \nand communities and nations from food aid dependency to self-\nsufficiency, leading to a likely reduction in emergency food assistance \nover time. That is both humane and a responsible stewardship of \ntaxpayer funds.\n  By statutorily authorizing this program, which had its roots in the \nBush administration and was formalized by the Obama administration, we \nare also statutorily enhancing congressional oversight by requiring the \nadministration to report to Congress. Thus, the bill requires rigorous \nmonitoring, evaluation, and congressional oversight of the global food \nsecurity strategy, and it mandates a comprehensive report to ensure \naccountability and effectiveness.\n  The approach we have taken in the Global Food Security Act is \nfiscally disciplined. There is no additional cost to the U.S. taxpayer. \nThis would authorize a straight-lining from 2015 and 2016. USAID will \nbe authorized, however, to do more by more effectively leveraging our \naid with that of other countries, the private sector, NGOs, and faith-\nbased organizations, whose great work on the ground in so many \ndifferent countries impacts so many lives.\n  As the prime sponsor of H.R. 1567, let me convey my very special \nthanks to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the prime \nDemocratic cosponsor, for her leadership, for her friendship, and for \nher support.\n  I am deeply grateful to the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and his \nextraordinary floor director, Kelly Dixon, for their pivotal support in \nthe last Congress and this one for the Global Food Security Act.\n  I would note parenthetically, if it passes today, this will be the \nsecond time in 2 years. The clock ran out on the bill in the Senate \nduring the last Congress.\n  I am grateful as well for the strong and abiding support of the \nchairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Ed Royce, and ranking \nmember, Eliot Engel. They have been tremendous.\n\n[[Page H1615]]\n\nThe Committee on Agriculture chairman, Mike Conaway, made several \nimportant policy revisions and has been personally involved in the \ndrafting of this bill, so I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nConaway), my good friend and very distinguished colleague, for his work \non this bill and his work on Agriculture in general. I thank him for \nthat leadership. And, of course, a heartfelt thanks to all the other \noriginal cosponsors: Mr. Fortenberry, Ms. Bass, Mr. Crenshaw, Ms. \nDeLauro, Mr. Reichert, Mr. Cicilline, Mr. Smith of Washington, and Mr. \nPaulsen.\n  Finally, a great big thanks to our professional staff members, who \nworked hard to bring this bill to the floor: Joan Condon and Doug \nAnderson at the Committee on Foreign Affairs; Scott Graves, Bart \nFischer, and Jackie Barber at the Committee on Agriculture; legislative \ncounsel Mark Synnes; Jenn Holcomb in Betty McCollum's office; Piero \nTozzi from my subcommittee; and my chief of staff, Mary Noonan. This is \ntruly a team effort. This will save lives and enhance everyone's life \naround the world who benefits from the program.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, Mr. Speaker, let me thank our chairman, Ed Royce, and his \nstaff for their hard work on the bill and for bringing it forward. I am \na big supporter of this bill, and I think this again shows our \ncommittee bipartisanship at its best.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Chris Smith and Congresswoman Betty \nMcCollum for authorizing this legislation, the Global Food Security \nAct, H.R. 1567.\n  Mr. Speaker, nearly 800 million people around the world go to bed \nhungry on a day-to-day basis. Malnutrition is responsible for nearly \nhalf of all deaths of children under 5 years old. This is just \nunconscionable. We cannot allow it to continue. Plain and simple, we \nneed to do more to help people feed themselves.\n  Beyond that, we need to get to the root causes that perpetuate cycles \nof poverty, hunger, and instability. This bill lays out clear \npriorities for American foreign assistance programs that reduce global \npoverty and hunger. We want to prioritize efforts that accelerate \nagriculture-led economic growth, enhance food and nutrition security, \nbuild resilience, create an environment for robust investment and \ntrade, and advance the range of economic, diplomatic, global health, \nand national security interests that are tied to food security.\n  This bill also authorizes funding for State Department and USAID \ninitiatives, including the administration's signature effort of Feed \nthe Future. This program has already delivered real results in fighting \nworld hunger, poverty, and malnutrition. Since 2010, Feed the Future \nhas worked with smallholder farmers in 19 countries to increase incomes \nand reduce hunger, poverty, and undernutrition.\n  Feed the Future has helped rural Cambodians start profitable fish \nfarming businesses, taught Guatemalan sharecroppers to grow more \nprofitable crops, and provided educational and national support to \nTanzanian mothers. There has been real progress in places like Ghana, \nwhich has reduced childhood stunting by 33 percent in just 6 years \nbetween 2008 and 2014. Incomes in Honduras increased 55 percent between \n2012 and 2014.\n  This isn't a pie-in-the-sky notion, Mr. Speaker. This is an \ninitiative that we are a part of that is getting real results for real \npeople. So let's continue to support it.\n  This bill is a real step toward our vision of a world without global \nhunger and malnutrition, and it supports critical U.S. foreign policy \nand national security interests. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), the chairman of the \nCommittee on Agriculture, who worked very closely with our committee \nand with me and with my staff on the bill and helped to ensure that it \ndid not have any unintended negative consequences for the domestic \nprograms within his committee's jurisdiction. I want to thank him again \nfor his great leadership.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Smith for yielding and \nthe other colleagues for the work they have done on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1567, the Global Food \nSecurity Act of 2016. With the world population rapidly increasing, \nparticularly in some of the most impoverished and food-insecure \nregions, it is of critical importance that the United States maintain \nits position as the world leader in the effort to alleviate global \nhunger and enhance food security.\n  The agricultural community is proud to have long played a crucial \nrole in this effort. We are eager to continue doing our part. As \nchairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, I vow to ensure that \nthe expertise of the agriculture community is fully leveraged in the \nglobal food security efforts that are moving forward.\n  To fulfill that promise, I have worked closely with the Committee on \nForeign Affairs to ensure that the bill before us today capitalizes on \nthe wealth of knowledge and expertise within the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture and amongst agricultural businesses, commodity groups, \nagricultural producers, agricultural research institutions, land grant \ncolleges and universities, and the agricultural extension system.\n  Beyond requiring collaboration with key agricultural stakeholders, \nthe bill will also improve the monitoring and reporting of the various \nprograms and funds counted toward the success of the current Feed the \nFuture initiative. USAID has been very vocal in its efforts to reduce \nand/or eliminate in-kind food assistance, yet it lauds the use of these \nvery programs in selling the success of Feed the Future. It is my hope \nthat the enhanced reporting accountability within the global food \nsecurity strategy will ensure that all food aid programs and means of \ndelivery are appropriately recognized for the role that they play in \nthe strategy's success.\n  Further, to ensure that this legislation does not provide USAID with \nunintended opportunity to overhaul time-tested food aid programs, the \nbill contains carefully crafted language protecting the funds and the \nauthorities of these existing programs. As I have pointed out time and \nagain, any changes should be explored in the context of future farm \nbill discussions.\n  I greatly appreciate Congressman Smith's open-minded approach to \nachieving common ground on this legislation as well as the cooperation \nand support from the various agricultural organizations, commodity \ngroups, and nongovernmental organizations, such as the ONE Campaign, \nwho have been engaged in this process. I look forward to maintaining \nand building upon these positive relations as we move forward and \ncarefully monitor the implementation of this strategy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), one of the authors of \nthis bill and someone who has worked so long on issues like these for \nso many, many years. A lot of this is really a result of her hard work \nthrough the years.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support for the \nGlobal Food Security Act, H.R. 1567. I want to especially thank \nCongressman Chris Smith for being a real, true partner on this bill and \nfor his work to advance global food security, which we both care about \nso very deeply.\n  This bill is an important bill with a goal everyone should support: \nhelping hardworking farmers grow the food they need to feed and support \ntheir families. As we have already heard, in the world's poorest \ncountries, nearly 800 million people are chronically hungry or \nmalnourished, and more than 150 million children under the age of 5 are \nstunted.\n  No parent should have to watch their child suffer or even die because \nthey don't have access to the nutritious food they need to survive. For \nchildren who somehow do survive, the lasting damage of not having \naccess to healthy food means that a child will not grow physically and \nmentally the way that they should, especially during the first\n\n[[Page H1616]]\n\nthousand days, and any damage that is done is permanent.\n  According to the World Bank, stunting ``means a child has failed to \ndevelop in full, and it is essentially irreversible, which means that \nthe child will have little hope of achieving [their] full potential.''\n  As a global community, we know that chronic malnutrition severely \nlimits a child's ability to grow, to learn, and to thrive. But it is \nnot just harmful for that child or the family, it undermines the \ndevelopment of an entire community and perpetuates the cycle of \npoverty. And all of this is completely preventable.\n  Working with small holder farmers, especially women, Feed the Future \nis helping to provide the tools, resources, education, and training \nthese farmers need to grow their way out of poverty and to improve \nnutrition and create new economic opportunities.\n  I have been fortunate enough to see the work USAID is doing around \nthe globe and to hear directly from women farmers about the difference \nit has made for themselves and their families. A mother can now feed \nher family better food, pay her children's school fees, invest in her \ncommunity, and become an entrepreneur herself.\n  These are success stories that happen when the United States makes \nsmart investments in global food security. These are the successes that \nwe must continue if we want to strengthen families, communities, and, \nyes, even our own national security.\n  Feed the Future does not work alone. It is partnering with private \nsector businesses, civil society, and universities. Bringing these \nsectors together with their specialized knowledge and expertise is not \nonly good for that farmer or local processor, but it builds new, stable \nmarkets in these communities.\n  Minnesota-based businesses Land O'Lakes, General Mills, and Cargill \nare already working with Feed the Future. General Mills CEO Ken Powell \nsaid, ``And we are hungry to help the farmer in Malawi who, by selling \nher crop, will generate the money needed to support her family and pay \nfor her children to go to school.''\n  Well, that truly sums it up. This is what this legislation is all \nabout: empowering women farmers to support and care for their families.\n  Once again, I want to thank Congressman Chris Smith for being a great \npartner on this journey. I would like to thank Chairman Royce and \nRanking Member Engel for helping to move this legislation forward, \nalong with Congresswoman Bass.\n  I also want to thank the staff--Piero, Jenn, Janice, and Joan--for \nall the work that they did to help get this bill to the floor today.\n  In December 2014, this House passed a similar version of this bill by \na voice vote, but the Senate failed to act. So today, once again, I \nurge my colleagues to support the Global Food Security Act.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a member of the \nForeign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, \nfor bringing this bill up today.\n  I rise in support of the Global Food Security Act, H.R. 1567. This \nbill reflects almost 2 years of work between the Agriculture Committee \nand the Foreign Affairs Committee, both of which I serve on.\n  This legislation is an important step in getting back to regular \norder and properly authorizing a program--which has essentially been on \nautopilot for the last 7 years--before funds are appropriated.\n  An important program such as this needs to be reexamined by Congress \nand duly authorized so that changes that need to be made can be made \nand to stop the terrible pattern of just appropriating money for \nprograms because the reauthorization is too difficult to work out.\n  The legislation demonstrates that this body is doing what we were \nsent up here to do: make the tough decisions and stop the cycle of \nthrowing good money after bad.\n  H.R. 1567 authorizes previously unauthorized money that is no higher \nthan what has been appropriated in the last 2 fiscal years.\n  Furthermore, through the hard work of both the Agriculture and \nForeign Affairs Committees, we have been able to eliminate duplicative \nspending and waste, strengthen congressional oversight while \ninstituting no new spending, and most importantly, begin weaning these \nnations off of U.S. foreign aid by including the private sector, \npromoting economic growth, and opening markets for U.S. trade and \ninvestment instead of just aid.\n  I think it is time to change our paradigm of giving aid to foreign \ngovernments and move from aid to trade. That way, we wean off the \nstructure we have done in the past.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1567 and show the rest of the \nworld that Congress is doing what it was meant to: making the hard \nchoices through negotiating and crafting legislation and programs that \nwill not irresponsibly waste taxpayer money and will encourage the best \nresults that will wean countries off of U.S. aid and onto U.S. trade.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you have heard from all our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, this is a good bill that deserves to be supported by \neveryone in the House.\n  Ending global hunger and malnutrition is an enormous challenge. There \nare nearly 800 million people facing chronic hunger and 3.1 million \nchild malnutrition deaths each year. Let me just say that again because \nit is shocking. There are 3.1 million child malnutrition deaths each \nyear. These are deaths of innocent children that we can save. They are \ndying if we do nothing.\n  So we must do more to achieve food and nutrition security. This bill \nis a step in the right direction, and I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I once again thank Chairman Royce, Mr. Smith, and Ms. McCollum for \ntheir hard work on this issue, and I urge, again, my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I want to thank Mr. Engel for his very kind remarks and for his \nstrong support for this legislation. This has been a great partnership \nwith Betty McCollum, and I know it will continue. Both of us--and \nothers, of course--are totally committed to ending chronic hunger and \nproviding self-sufficiency in countries where it is a matter of just \nconveying best practices and increasing the capabilities of people and \ntheir roads and bridges. It's all very much integrated. So I want to \nthank her for her leadership on this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Again, it bears saying over and over again that half of all deaths in \nchildren under 5 are attributable to undernutrition. Of course, for the \nothers who die, very often, malnutrition is a complicating factor and \nit allows, as I said earlier, opportunistic diseases to take hold and \nto cause havoc, if not death, to that child.\n  There are 161 million children stunted worldwide. I was actually in \nthe Central American country of Guatemala when they signed up for the \nFirst Thousand Days of Life. The new President has indicated when he \nwas here that it is a very, very important part of his program.\n  We see it all over Africa and Asia. If nutrition is provided, it does \nmitigate disease. It does, for many, mean that they have a chance at \nlife and that their immune systems are bolstered to the point where \nthey can resist multiple attacks of various diseases and then get into \nadolescence and, of course, into adulthood.\n  This is transformative. It is bipartisan. I also think it bears \nrepeating for my colleagues that this bill has been a long time in the \nmaking. As Betty McCollum said earlier, we passed it last Congress. And \nI guess, as I said earlier, the clock did run out. We did not get it up \nfor a vote in the Senate. God willing, this time it will be different.\n  We have had a dozen committee hearings. I have held many of them \nmyself in my Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Global Human \nRights. It has been a multi-year effort and a great deal of due \ndiligence and vetting has gone into the language. We worked, as I said \nearlier, very closely with Chairman Mike Conaway, and he had very, very \nimportant contributions to make. So this has been a great collaborative \neffort of our staff and members\n\n[[Page H1617]]\n\nof the Foreign Affairs, Appropriations, and the Agriculture Committees.\n  I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1567, the \nGlobal Food Security Act of 2015. As the world's population has \nincreased the demand for food has grown with it. Amidst a volatile oil \nmarket and impacts from extreme weather on major food-exporting \nindustries due to climate change, food prices have risen with the \nburden falling heavily on underdeveloped nations and their citizens. \nThe pressure is on our chamber to ensure that we live in a world where \nfood availability, regardless of droughts and transportation costs, is \nnot an option but a right.\n  Feed the Future, a U.S. Government Initiative, works hand-in-hand \nwith partner countries to develop agriculture sectors that help \ndomestic economies as well as the individuals in these places suffering \nfrom food shortages. The advanced approach by Feed the Future works to \nsolve the issue by addressing many of the concerns that face these \ncountries. Empowering women, embracing innovation between private \nsector and civil society, supporting food security, and creating cost-\neffective results that lead to sustainability for these partner \ncountries are just some of the goals of the Feed the Future program.\n  The Global Food Security Act of 2015 builds off this initiative by \nmaking it permanent and committing the United States to a solution \nregarding the growing food shortage epidemic. The Act improves upon \nexisting practices to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are effectively \napportioned while not adding to the debt. It also requires the \nAdministration to develop a comprehensive strategy to combat food \ninsecurity, malnutrition, and hunger and report it to Congress on a \nyearly basis.\n  I would like to close by saying that I am proud of our chamber for \ncoming together to ensure that the United States plays a key role in \ncombatting one of the largest developmental issues in the 21st century. \nI also want to thank my colleagues for understanding the importance of \na comprehensive approach that recognizes and promotes the involvement \nof women in agriculture while also promoting a sustainable future for \nour partner countries.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This is not the first time the First Congressional District \nof Tennessee has experienced tragedy in this manner, as Sergeant \nFrederick Greene was killed at Fort Hood, Texas, in the 2009 attack.\n  Justin Shults grew up in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where he was the \nvaledictorian of Gatlinburg-Pittman High. He graduated from Vanderbilt \nUniversity and received his MBA from the Owen School of Management, \nwhere he met Stephanie, his beautiful wife. They shared their love of \nadventure, which took them to Belgium for work. Justin's mom, Sheila, \nwas a single mom who worked hard to provide for three children. They \nare a loving, Christian family who ended each conversation by saying, \n``I love you,'' and those were the last words that Justin's mom said to \nhim.\n  I can only imagine the grief that accompanies losing your child in \nsuch a sudden and violent manner, and we all join in offering Justin \nand Stephanie's families our prayers and deepest sympathy.\n  The family wants to thank those who have called them from around the \nworld to offer their condolences. Indeed, we extend our condolences to \nall families who lost loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1620-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PAYING TRIBUTE TO THREE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES TO TERRORISM\n\n  (Mr. COOPER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, America and the Owen School of Management of \nVanderbilt University suffered three devastating losses just during the \nmonth of March.\n  The Shults family, which has already been mentioned, were a model \nAmerican couple, but the first victim of terrorism with ties to Owen \nSchool of Management was Taylor Force, a young man who was raised in \nLubbock, Texas, went to a military academy in New Mexico, was an Eagle \nScout, and then attended and graduated from West Point Academy, served \nin the U.S. Army, did two tours in the Middle East, emerged as a \ncaptain, and then chose the Owen School of Management at Vanderbilt for \nhis business education.\n  The young man was on a school trip to Tel Aviv in Israel, and he was \nmurdered in a random knife attack by a terrorist. It is hard to think \nof a sadder end for a great and promising young life.\n  The young Shults couple--my colleague Mr. Roe from Tennessee has \nalready mentioned them--outstanding young people, probably no finer \ncouple ever, and a couple with a sense of adventure. They went \nskydiving, they ran with the bulls in Pamplona, they saw the Eiffel \nTower, and then as they were saying good-bye to her mother at the \nairport, were killed in the terrorist attack.\n  So let us pay tribute to these three outstanding young people. Let's \nuse their lives as models, and let's not be daunted by terrorism. We \nhave to meet and beat this threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1620-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1620-H1621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR OF JUSTIN AND STEPHANIE SHULTS\n\n  (Mr. BARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BARR.

We will never forget this daughter of \nKentucky, her love of her family and her husband, and her sense of \nadventure, as she lived and worked in Europe.\n  We will never forget the anguish felt by Stephanie and Justin's \nfamilies as they searched for their children in the aftermath of the \nattack; we will never forget their grief when they learned what \nhappened; and we will never forget the ideology of evil and religious \nintolerance that is responsible for taking these two innocent Americans \nfrom us.\n  If the terrorists' objective was to undermine our country's will to \nfight extremism or to compel us to surrender our liberty to their \noppressive, totalitarian vision of the world, then it has failed. The \nterrorists' cowardly act only invigorates our Nation's resolve to \novercome and defeat this evil.\n  As we continue to pray for these families, I would like to ask \nCongressman Roe and Congressman Cooper to join me and for all of my \ncolleagues to stand and please join us in a moment of silence and \nprayer to honor these young American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1621-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY'S RESEARCH ON THE ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. GRAHAM.

At a very young age, John answered the patriotic call \nto join our proud Marine Corps, where he served for 23 years. During \nthat time, John fought in the Korean war and was promoted on the \nbattlefield from sergeant to lieutenant.\n  In 1971, after retiring from the military as a major, John moved to \nFlorida, where he began another successful career with the Miami-Dade \nPolice Department, where he served 26 years.\n  John was dedicated to his wife, Mary, a good friend with whom he \ncelebrated 50 years of marriage this past September, and he loved their \nthree sons and seven grandsons, three of whom continue John's legacy of \nservice in our military.\n  John Collins stayed engaged in good causes in our community, joining \nthe Veterans Committee in his hometown of Miami Lakes.

Mr. Speaker, today we mark Equal Pay Day, the day when \nwomen's wages finally catch up to what men were paid in the previous \nyear.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable that in the United States today, \nwomen earn on average 79 cents for every dollar that a man makes. For \nwomen of color, this gap is even wider, 61 cents for African American \nwomen and 55 cents for Latinas.\n  This pay gap is harming working families in every State, particularly \nharmful to the two-thirds of families where women are the primary \nbreadwinners. Lower paychecks mean less money for groceries, less money \nfor rent, less money for child care or other necessities. Mr. Speaker, \nthis has to change.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, \nwhich would make it easier for women to win pay discrimination cases \nand harder for companies to justify unequal salaries. I urge Republican \nleaders to bring this bill to the floor for a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1621-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n              CONGRATULATING VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY WILDCATS\n\n  (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 2016 NCAA \nMen's Basketball National Champions, the Villanova University Wildcats.\n  As head coach Jay Wright is fond of saying, Villanova basketball can \nbe defined in one word: attitude. I might say it is an infectious \nattitude. Over the course of a magical 3-week run in the NCAA \ntournament, the Wildcats showed why. It was a run that culminated in \none of, if not the greatest championship games in NCAA men's basketball \nhistory. It was a game that featured two intensely competitive teams, \ntwo of basketball's most talented coaches, and an ending for the ages.\n  Junior Kris Jenkins' championship-winning buzzer beater is the sort \nof moment that, for millions of kids across this country practicing in \nthe driveways or at their neighborhood parks, dreams are made of.\n  Villanova's program has a long and storied history of success, both \non the court and off, and in the classroom. It is a tradition of \nhumility, grace, and integrity that our entire region can be proud of. \nVillanova is not a large school, but it has built a world-class \nbasketball program deeply rooted in its values.\n  I congratulate National Coach of the Year Jay Wright, his players and \ntheir families, and the entire Villanova community on their victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1621-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1621-H1622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS.

My eldest daughter will be graduating with \nher master's degree next month. Ten days later, she will be giving \nbirth to her first child.\n  The point I am making is that women across America make 79 cents for \nevery dollar that a man makes for doing the same work. Minority women \nsuffer most when Congress is inactive about making the proper changes \nto create inequity in our country. Minority women earn as little as 55 \non the dollar when they perform the same work that a man does.\n  I pose this question to my colleagues: When we act to close the pay \ngap, who does this hurt?\n  And the answer is simple: No one is hurt.

The discussion at that meeting prompted the current Governor, \nAndrew Curtin, to sign a law naming James Worrall as the State's first \nCommissioner of Fisheries, creating what would become the Nation's \nsecond oldest fish or wildlife agency.\n  Since its founding 150 years ago, the PFBC has grown to employ more \nthan 400 people and operates on an annual budget of nearly $60 million \nfunded by anglers and boaters through license and registration fees, \namong other methods. The PFBC is responsible for policing 86,000 miles \nof Pennsylvania streams, nearly 4,000 lakes, more than 60 miles of Lake \nErie's shoreline, and around 400,000 acres of wetlands.\n  As an avid fisherman, I am proud of the work done by the Pennsylvania \nFish and Boat Commission in keeping our lakes and streams healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1622-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FUNDS FOR ZIKA VIRUS RESEARCH\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of March, I held a \nbriefing in Houston with leaders of the health community and our \nresearch community on the Zika virus. At that time, we had at least one \ncase diagnosed in the city of Houston.\n  Since that time, we have watched the Centers for Disease Control \ntravel to Puerto Rico, and we have seen the potential for a Zika \nepidemic in the United States, first starting in Florida and Texas. \nThere are conditions in our particular area that are susceptible to the \ntransmission of the Zika virus. Today, the Centers for Disease Control \nhas indicated it may be more dangerous than we ever would have \nexpected.\n  Over 2 months ago, I believe, the President submitted to Congress a \nrequest for $1.9 billion in an emergency supplemental. All of my \nconstituents in the health profession are begging for this supplemental \nto be passed.\n  Yesterday I sent out a statement asking for the Speaker and the \nmajority leader to bring the supplemental to the floor. It is an \nemergency.\n  Having gone through a number of epidemics in our community and in \nthis Nation, it is time that we put the American people's interests \nfirst. It is now the time, Mr. Speaker, to pass the emergency \nsupplemental and save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1622-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SOUTHWEST BORDER SECURITY\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the connection between \ndrug and human trafficking at the southwest border, where Mexican \ncartels control both. Last week I traveled to Texas and New Mexico to \nlearn more about this connection.\n  The President's disregard of our immigration laws is encouraging \npeople to risk their lives to enter the United States, enriching the \nsame cartels that smuggle deadly heroin. Last year in New Hampshire, my \nhome State, more than 400 Granite Staters died of a heroin or opiate \noverdose. There were nearly 50,000 in the United States last year.\n  That number is, unfortunately, trending upward, despite the best \nefforts of law enforcement. Border Patrol agents report that cartels \nare forcing illegal immigrants to carry heroin in exchange for \nprotection. Sanctuary cities serve as way stations in this drug trade.\n  A secure border is a humane border. The Southwest Border Security \nThreat Assessment Act would compel Homeland Security to develop a \nbetter plan. Border agents need more support, as do police, across New \nHampshire and this country, working to keep drugs off of our streets. \nEnforcing interior immigration laws would be an excellent first step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1622-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Equal \nPay Day to call for action to close that persistent wage gap that \noccurs in the workplace to the detriment of women.\n  My grandmother worked all of her life. I would see her leave in the \nmorning and go to the bus stop. She worked at a convalescent home where \nshe made 3 meals a day for 170 people. She worked 6 days a week. On \nSaturday, she would make an extra meal so they could serve it on \nSunday. On Sunday, she would take off work and go to church.\n  When my grandmother could no longer stand on her feet, she retired. \nShe retired on Social Security, which was $484 a month--just enough to \nlive at my mom's home in her retirement. She had no savings and no \npension. One of the reasons is because, even though women work very \nhard in this country, they don't get paid what their counterparts--the \nmales--do. And so women are twice as likely to retire in poverty.\n  When women succeed, America succeeds.

Mr. Speaker, in 1963, the Equal Pay Act was signed into \nlaw, making it illegal for an employer to pay women less than a man for \nthe same work. Yet the reality is today, over 50 years later, women are \nstill making less than men. This is unacceptable and something which we \nall have a stake in fixing.\n  Here in the House, we are working on putting forward new ideas and \nsolutions to empower women to fight for equal pay. We must also \ncontinue to encourage young girls to enter STEM and other higher-paying \nfields and to make sure they know they can be whatever they want to be.\n  Lastly, we must do a better job recognizing that caring for aging \nparents or children is a responsibility for women and men in our \nsociety.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been fighting my whole life for women's rights \nand equality. I know we still have work to do, and I am committed to \nmaking equal opportunity for women a reality. After all, this is \nAmerica, where we pick the best man for the job, even if it is a woman. \nAnd that means making sure she is getting paid what she deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1622-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1622-H1623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING RIBAULT HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  (Ms. BROWN of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the \nachievements of an individual who has shown his dedication to the \nfuture of our Nation through educating our youth.\n  John Cavanaugh attended Georgetown University, where he received his \nBachelor of Science in language and linguistics. He began his teaching \ncareer at Georgetown Preparatory School in 1973, and shortly thereafter \nmoved to the Congressional Schools of Virginia in 1976. He has shown an \nexemplary commitment to teaching over what has now become a 40-year \ncareer.\n  Over the years, Mr. Cavanaugh has taught Spanish, Latin, German, \nItalian, English as a second language, geography, world history, \nAmerican history, and government to thousands of students. Currently \nconcentrating on Latin and history, he has shown the same dedication to \nhis students since the first day he walked into the classroom 40 years \nago. His knowledge of American history is legendary, and he instills in \nhis students a strong desire to learn, while also encouraging them to \nexplore their own talents.\n  His hard work and passion for education has led him to his peers \nnominating him for the Washington Post's Teacher of the Year Award. He \nhas been described as an ``icon'' and ``shepherd'' by colleagues and \nstudents alike. His unwavering commitment to helping students thrive \nhas been demonstrated through his early morning review sessions and his \nadvisory role to the Yearbook Club and National Junior Honor Society.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to acknowledge Mr. Cavanaugh \nfor his achievements over these 40 years, and I wish him the best going \nforward. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for touching so \nmany lives as a first-class educator and for his dedication to our \nyouth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1623-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LEGISLATION TARGETING TRANSGENDER PEOPLE\n\n  (Mr. HONDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the hateful and \ndiscriminatory legislation targeting transgender people that is \nsweeping through State legislatures.\n  Right now, there is anti-transgender legislation pending before \nlegislatures in Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, South \nCarolina, Washington, and Tennessee.\n  Tomorrow, Tennessee lawmakers will vote in committee on House Bill \n2414, a bill that would require students to go into gender-specific \nbathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. Yet, \nTennessee is one of the few States that does not allow a transgender \nperson to change their birth certificate. It is ultimately a lose-lose \nfor transgender people.\n  This bill would cause very real emotional harm and put transgender \nyoung people in physical danger if they are required to use gender-\ninappropriate restrooms and locker rooms. These anti-transgender bills \nin the States are rooted in fear, animus, and deeply misguided notions \nabout who transgender people are.\n  I speak today as a Member of Congress and as a proud grandfather of a \ngranddaughter who is transgender. These laws do not make us safer. \nThese laws stoke misguided fears. They divide us.

That includes \ndozens in my Pennsylvania district, including Frank Mongiello and \nformer Naval Officer Matthew Bellina.\n  For those impacted by this disease, the toll is extraordinary, not \nonly on their own well-being, but on their family and their finances. \nThankfully for Matt and Frank, individuals like Jim Worthington and \nmembers of the Newtown Athletic Club have stepped up to offer emotional \nsupport and raised more than $200,000 for their cause.\n  While these actions show the commendable efforts of one community, \nthere is more that can be done on their behalf here in Washington.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of \nmy Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is the tale of two \ncities--not the tale about the cities, but about two examples of \nAmerica's great embarrassment and failure to treat a brain disease \ncalled mental illness, especially serious mental illness. It is also a \ntale of Congress' repeated failure to address this.\n  Despite the cries of millions of Americans to do something about it, \nwhat we here in Washington tend to do when we hear of another tragedy \nthat has occurred somewhere in the Nation, the tragedies we know by the \nnames of Sandy Hook Elementary School, or Columbine, or Aurora, \nColorado, or Tucson, or Santa Barbara, what Washington tends to do is \nwe have a moment of silence. But the people want and Members of \nCongress want moments of action, not moments of silence.\n  Let me elaborate on this tale. In this building, the U.S. Capitol, \nback in the 1990s, two police officers were killed when Russell Weston \ncame into the Capitol seeking a red crystal and ended up shooting these \npolice officers. Under his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, he was \npushed, with his delusions and hallucinations, to take action. It ended \nup in tragedy.\n  There was also recently, over the break, another man, Larry Russell \nDawson, who has been seen around this Capitol and has once, allegedly, \ndisrupted proceedings in this Chamber and, allegedly, also suffers from \nsome level of mental illness. When he was entering the Capitol Visitor \nCenter, a pistol was seen going through the x-ray. When he grabbed that \npistol, police officers shot and wounded him.\n  First of all, it is amazing to me that people did not die. We know \nthat the entrance to the Capitol Visitor Center is a highly secure \nenvironment with many, many Capitol Police officers. These brave men \nand women who put themselves between danger and Members of Congress and \nthe public showed tremendous restraint and judgment at that moment.\n  I might add that, many times, when a mentally ill person has a \nconflict, a violent conflict with a police officer, where they may be \nreaching into their jacket or may be pointing a pistol or approaching a \npolice officer with a knife, it is estimated between a quarter and a \nhalf of those mentally ill people involved in a police encounter end up \ndead. That is a few hundred each year.\n  Though that is the tale in Washington, D.C., why are we dealing with \nmental illness as a violent threat instead of in treatment? We deal \nwith it because, in this Nation, sadly, when someone with mental \nillness has reached that level or they become violent, we call the \npolice.\n  The rules are, which we will look at tonight: prevent people from \ngetting treatment; we do not have enough providers; we don't have \nenough places to put people, so we call the police.\n  Now, I should start off by saying the mentally ill are no more likely \nto be violent than the non-mentally ill; except when you look at those \nwith serious mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar, and other \nillnesses such as that, they are 16 times more likely to engage in an \nact of violence than someone who is in treatment.\n  Again, a person who is seriously mentally ill and not in treatment is \n16 times more likely to engage in an act of violence than someone who \nis in treatment.\n  On the West Coast, in Seattle, another tragedy was brewing. A man \nnamed Cody Miller climbed a tree, a giant sequoia tree in downtown \nSeattle, and it created something of a furor.\n  First, I want to read parts of an article that appeared in The New \nYork Times on March 29 that describe this to show you how out of touch \nwe are as a society when dealing with mental illness.\n  It said: ``For more than 24 hours last week, Cody Lee Miller perched \nin a giant sequoia in downtown Seattle, pelting people and cars with \npine cones and tearing off branches.''\n  Investigators were investigating how much it would cost, using some \n``complicated formula that goes far beyond the value of natural \nbeauty,'' the article said.\n  ``A Seattle tree expert . . . said Mr. Miller caused $7,800 in \ndamage, according to court documents released this week. Investigators \ntook into account the tree's age, its potential life span and how much \nof its lush foliage was denuded.\n\n  ``The formula, created by professional foresters, goes like this. The \ntrunk is 34 inches in diameter at breast height, an investigator's \nreport said. The tree has a `95 percent species rating,' a `100 percent \ncondition rating' and a 100 `percent location rating' . . . The \nsequoia's pre-damage value was put at $51,700. But after Mr. Miller's \narboreal escapade, the tree lost 15 percent of its value, the documents \nshow, and is now worth only $43,900 . . .`The damage to the tree was \nextensive,' the report said.\n  ``Mr. Miller was charged on Monday with first-degree malicious \nmischief and third-degree assault. He was also ordered to stay away \nfrom the tree by observing `no unwanted contact' ''--I repeat, ``by \nobserving `no unwanted contact' '' with the tree.\n  Now, the story goes on to describe trees and sequoias, but not until \nthe very end of the article it mentions Mr. Miller's mother, Lisa \nGossett. She said that she had not talked to her son for some 5 years. \nShe saw it on the news and she barely recognized him.\n  See, what was happening is Lisa Gossett and her daughter sat in their \nAlaska home watching this clip of the man perched in the tree. With \ntheir hearts broken, with tears streaming down their faces, Lisa and \nher daughter soon came to realize they were watching their son and \ntheir brother become the latest Internet mockery of a mentally ill \nperson.\n  You see, when Cody Lee Miller climbed this 80-foot tree and sat there \nfor 25 hours, he was sporting a bushy beard and ragged clothes, and \nmost Americans were amused by this and they called it #manintree. It \nwas an international viral story overnight. But this was no joke; this \nwas no prank. This was the culmination of untreated mental illness \nthat, once again, our society turned into a joke.\n  And we wonder why there is a stigma, when newspapers like The New \nYork Times write a mocking story like that towards a man who has a \ndisease. Would they have written an article like that if it was about \nsomeone with cancer or diabetes or AIDS or any other disease? My guess \nis no. But somehow, in our society, it is okay to mock a person who is \nsuffering from schizophrenia.\n\n[[Page H1625]]\n\n  When he was younger, he was clean-cut and rambunctious, loving and \nhappy. Those are the words his friends used to describe him. At a young \nage, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; \nhowever, other than excess energy, like any child, he didn't sport any \nbehavioral issues. But then, 6 years ago, his mother began to notice an \nunusual shift in her son's behavior as he grew increasingly paranoid.\n  Let me note here that serious mental illness, about 50 percent of the \ntime, emerges by age 14, and 75 percent of the time by age 24. It is \nvery, very difficult to predict; although, we have now indicated some \n108 genetic markers of schizophrenia and bipolar illness. Still, the \nissue is many parents have a loving and caring child, then something \nchanges.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  His behavior changed when Lisa would find knives stored under her \nson's pillow. And when confronting Cody about her discovery, he would \nsimply respond: It is just to keep us safe.\n  As time passed on, Cody's mental instability progressed. He refused \nto enter certain stores downtown. When making an exception, Cody would \ncover his face with a hood, convinced people were constantly staring at \nhim.\n  Following this enhanced paranoia came the emergence of night terrors \nand constant crying and shouting for his mother during the night. Cody \nwould shriek in fear of the ``evil presence'' surrounding him.\n  This worrisome behavior continued to escalate as Cody spiraled out of \ncontrol. He could be found walking down the street in high socks and \nclown glasses spreading deer bones on the road.\n  He hit a man with a flat tire and began to have dreams of killing his \ngrandmother, going so far as setting her wood shop on fire. At that \npoint, his grandmother said she could no longer handle him and sent him \nout.\n  He was caught in the revolving door of the United States' \nembarrassing and shamefully broken mental health system. He was \nconstantly shuffled between homelessness and incarceration.\n  Lisa pleaded for others to help her son and appealed to the Alaska's \nGovernor's office, mental health evaluators, and probation office for \nassistance.\n  But despite her efforts, Lisa's attempts to get her son proper \ntreatment seemed hopeless due to the bureaucratic morass that is our \nmental health care system, which is not really a system at all.\n  She was sidelined from helping her son due to the inefficient system \nand forced to sit by and watch as Cody eroded over time.\n  We pretend in our own deluded state that all the seriously mentally \nill are fully aware of their symptoms and welcome treatment. The fact \nis many don't.\n  Forty percent of individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder \ndon't even recognize that the delusions and hallucinations are not \nreal. This is a medical condition called anosognosia.\n  Anosognosia is also something you see in people with dementia or \nAlzheimer's or stroke. It is very real. The person is not aware of \ntheir own problem.\n  But somehow we come up with this anthropomorphism which says, well, \nthey can decide for themselves. They cannot decide for themselves when \nthey don't even know who they are, that they exist, or what planet they \nare on.\n  They see things differently. They hear things differently. They smell \nthings differently. They encode information differently into their \nbrain. They process it and recall it differently. So for us to say that \nthey just don't want treatment is a fool's errand on our part.\n  Can you imagine if we said that, again, to someone with cancer? ``You \ndon't understand your disease.'' Diabetic? ``We are going to dismiss \nyou.''\n  What if a person clutched his chest in a heart attack and laid \nunconscious in the street? Would we tell that person ``We are not going \nto help you until you wake up and tell us to treat you''?\n  Worse yet, will we say to that person ``We are not going to treat you \nuntil you are an imminent danger of killing yourself or killing someone \nelse''? No. But that is what we do with the mentally ill.\n  The Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations \nSubcommittee that I chair had a couple-year study paving the way for my \nbill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act.\n  With 187 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, my bipartisan \nmeasure addresses the shortage of psychiatric beds, clarifies HIPAA \nprivacy laws so families can be allowed to have some compassionate \ncommunication and be part of frontline care, and it helps patients get \ntreatment well before their illness spirals into crisis.\n  My legislation has been endorsed by dozens of publications and \nnewspapers, including The Washington Post, The Seattle Times, The San \nFrancisco Chronicle, The Wall Street Journal, and the Pittsburgh Post-\nGazette.\n  Each day I hear from countless families from across the country that \nwe are experiencing a mental health crisis, and they are counting on \nour efforts to bring positive changes to the mental health system. We \ncannot let these families down. Lives are depending upon it. We cannot \nwish this away, and denial is not a treatment.\n  But let me tell you what Americans have to say about this because, as \nwe are dealing with this issue, Americans are wondering why Congress is \nnot acting. Why is Congress being so passive? Why aren't we doing what \nwe need to do?\n  I want to tell you about a story that I posted on my Facebook page \nand this picture that I posted as well.\n  This is Cody Lee Miller in court. Look at his hair. Look at his \nbeard. This is a man that obviously has not been taking care of \nhimself.\n  He is in shackles on his ankles and his wrists, chained at his waist, \nand led by two police officers wearing their purple gloves so they are \nnot at risk of infection while a judge sits in the background. This is \na man who was diagnosed with schizophrenia being treated like a \ncriminal.\n  Now, I wrote on my post this: ``Friends, you really can't make this \nstuff up.''\n  A man who is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, #ManInTree, ``who \ndesperately needs psychiatric care is brought in shackles before a \njudge because he has been charged with first-degree malicious mischief \nand third-degree assault. What was the outcome? The judge ordered him \nto stay away from the tree, but he first needs to make his $50,000 \nbail.\n  ``Just look at this picture and tell me our mental health system \nisn't a mess. It is unbelievable. Recall that for 24 hours last week, \nCody Lee Miller remained atop a giant sequoia tree in downtown Seattle. \nSince that time, there has been a greater outpouring of concern over \nthe tree than the plight of this young man who is so clearly in the \nthroes of a psychotic break.''\n  I make reference here to that article from The New York Times being \nfar more concerned about the tree than a human being.\n\n  I wrote further: ``He is ordered to have `no unwanted contact' with a \nsequoia, yet no concern about getting him into treatment. Such a sad \nindictment against an abusive system that would order no contact with a \ntree, yet remains silent on getting the mentally ill into care.\n  ``Cody's mom talks about his downward spiral and has made it her \nmission to be a voice for families who desperately want to help their \nloved ones but are blocked by Federal and State laws that make it \nimpossible to help mentally ill family members. Meanwhile, Congress is \nstill stalling my Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. \n2646.''\n  This posting must have hit a nerve. Members of Congress follow \nFacebook pages and Twitter, and we have our social media. Many times \nwhen we post something we may hear from a few thousand people. As of a \nfew minutes ago, this posting has led to 1.8 million hits on my \nFacebook.\n  What is also compelling is, as sad as this story is about this man \ntreated like a prisoner, like a common criminal, instead of getting \ntreatment, are the heart-wrenching comments made by the families. I \nwant to read some of them to you. These are people from around the \nworld, really, who have commented on what is happening here.\n  Holly Huntley Perron wrote: ``I agree with Cody's mom. The real \nculprits are\n\n[[Page H1626]]\n\nthe State and Federal laws that prevent loved ones being able to help \nfamily members in trouble.''\n  By that I reference laws which say that, unless you are in imminent \ndanger of killing yourself or someone else, no one is going to force \nyou into treatment or laws that say, if this person says that they \ndon't want help, you can't make them get help, or if the person in the \nmidst of a delusion says: Don't tell my mother or my father because \nthey are a part of the CIA or they are a Martian and they are planting \nthoughts in my brain, the doctors cannot tell the family members when \nis the next appointment, what is the medication, what is the diagnosis, \nand how should they treat him. They may say to take him home when the \nfamily says: What should I do?\n  We have heard of cases where the doctor says: We can't tell you \nbecause he doesn't want us to. But the family says: But I am taking him \nhome. What should I do? We can't tell you.\n  One family member has said to the doctors: Let's just have a \nsupposition. Just pretend that there was a case where someone with \nschizophrenia is going to my house. What should I do? And they say: We \nare not going to tell you.\n  These go on to happen where family members may be in court pleading \nin tears with the judge: Tell me where my son is. Tell me where my \ndaughter is. Where is my father? My mother? My brother? My sister? Tell \nme so I can do something with them.\n  A caseworker may be sitting in the courtroom knowing full well where \nthe person is and knowing there are problems, but they say: I can't \ntell you.\n  Because we believe their delusions are a reality, that they somehow \nhave a right to be sick instead of a right to be well.\n  James Sobczak wrote: ``My guess is that he will get some mental \nhealth services in jail. Evaluate him and see if they can petition him \nto a psychiatric hospital. This is a process.''\n  Here is the problem. When we take the mentally ill people into jail, \n80 percent of them get no treatment. Eighty percent of people taken to \njail get no treatment.\n  And of those in jail, 40 to 60 percent of those in jail have some \nlevel of mental illness and many are severely mentally ill. What \nhappens instead is a person is 10 times more likely to be in jail than \nin a hospital if they are mentally ill.\n  Once there, they don't get treatment. They oftentimes are subjected \nto abuse by other prisoners. They may get in fights with prison guards \nand then charged with another crime.\n  Because of all these problems, a person with mental illness tends to \nserve a sentence four times longer for the same crime than a person \nwithout mental illness. When you discharge them, they don't get \ntreatment. So they get involved in this revolving door.\n  But why? Why, in heaven's name, is jail the right place to send \nsomeone with a brain disease? Why is it that Congress doesn't wake up?\n  Instead of passing so many silly bills all the time, we are willing \nto let people continue to die, by the way, at a rate of about 10 people \nan hour.\n  Last year in the United States 41,000 deaths by suicide, 45,000-plus \ndeaths by drug overdose, somewhere between 200 and 500 deaths of a \nmentally ill person confronting a police officer.\n  Thousands--and we don't even know accurately how many--are people who \nare homeless and die. One person in Los Angeles died every day who was \nhomeless. And about 200,000 of these homeless people are severely \nmentally ill people.\n  But we have gotten ourselves accustomed to stepping over them, to \nignoring them, and to treating them as an invisible class that doesn't \nexist and somehow saying that that is what they want to be when they \nare not even aware. We think it is comfortable for them to live in \nfilth and squalor.\n  If you add the numbers up, the total number of mentally ill who died \nlast year in this country, it is probably well over 85,000, maybe \n100,000, maybe 120,000.\n  I might add that even that lowest number is far greater than the \ntotal United States' combat deaths in the entire Korean war and Vietnam \nwar combined for the length of those wars.\n  In 1 year in America, that is how many died, and what we do here is \nwe throw them in jail or, quite frankly, many of them die in jail as \nwell.\n  Another comment. Jim Holden wrote: ``The `system' is the problem. We \ncan't help these people because `personal choice' is championed over \ntheir health and well-being. People on the streets need to be a danger \nto themselves or others before we can offer much-needed help. As a \nsocial worker I have always found this frustrating.''\n\n  Another woman, Jilly Aliska White, writes: ``My brother-in-law was \njust arrested for doing something during a psychotic break from his \ntextbook schizophrenia. My husband's mom thinks he is finally going to \nget the help he needs now that he is in the system. Yeah. Right. He is \nnot going to be any better off. They don't give a rat's when they can \njust shuffle him through the corrections system. It breaks my heart to \nexplain this to them but look at the track record of them `helping.' ''\n  Deb Smith writes:\n\n       Unfortunately, our jails and juvenile centers have become \n     mental health facilities. While a person has mental health \n     problems, they also may commit crimes for which they can be \n     arrested and held. This is a very difficult and often a very \n     dangerous situation for everyone involved. It is never as \n     simple as get them treatment, nor is it as simple as just set \n     them free if they commit a crime. The judge has to look at \n     all sides, including the safety of both sides, but for the \n     individual and the citizens in the community and what risk \n     the person may have of further harm to himself or others if \n     released.\n\n  Cindy Irvin writes: ``There is still a shame and embarrassment about \nmental illness that totally we don't understand. And then you have the \npeople who believe that mental illness is a myth. Until these attitudes \nchange--probably by some respected celebrity having a psychotic break--\nmental health care will stay in the shadows.''\n  Beverly Di Mele wrote: ``The problem is the mentally ill have rights, \nand if they choose not to seek treatment, they have that right. The \ntreatment given to them prior to 1970s was forced and inhumane. They \nwere locked up for decades, medicated, isolated, and restrained. This \ndoesn't happen much anymore, thank God. They had procedures done on \nthem like prefrontal lobotomies and were subjected to shock therapy. It \nwas cruel and unusual treatment for humans that didn't happen to see \nthe world as `normal' people did. How would you like to see this \ntreatment forced on your parent, child, or loved one?''\n  I agree with most of that. We don't want those treatments again, \nexcept, when she writes ``This doesn't happen much anymore, thank \nGod,'' she is wrong. We should never allow again to bring back our \nasylums with its horrendous treatment.\n  But we have gone from a time of 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds in \nthis country in the 1950s to less than 48,000 now. In the 1950s, the \npopulation of the United States was 150 million. Now it exceeds 316 \nmillion.\n  There are about 10 million people with severe mental illness, and 40 \npercent of them--4 million or so--don't have any treatment. And what \nhappens to them is they go to jail.\n  When we closed these asylums, people didn't all of a sudden get \nbetter. Some got better because of medication. But we traded that \npsychiatric hospital bed for the prison cell. We traded that \npsychiatric hospital bed for the emergency room gurney when a person is \ngiven a five-point tie-down and sedation.\n  We traded that psychiatric hospital bed for the streets and subway \ngrates for the homeless, and we traded that psych bed for the county \nmorgue where many of them die as paupers waiting to be claimed.\n  Lori Welander writes: ``I suffer from major depression and had to do \n10 days in jail. While there, they refused to give me my antidepressant \nmedications. This seems to be the norm in my county's jail. It is \npretty sad. This man needs people who care about humanity, not to be \ntreated like this.''\n  Rhoda Robinson Brown writes: ``How about when our addicts beg the \njudges for treatment and get put into prison for years? Most think at \nleast when they are in prison they won't be able to use drugs. Ask any \naddict that has been in county prison how easy it is to still get \ndrugs. You will have people say they don't want their tax money paying \nfor an addict's treatment. Don't they realize it costs more to keep \nthem\n\n[[Page H1627]]\n\nin prison for years? Our justice system is so broken.''\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Indeed, a study done in Arkansas for their legislature found that it \ncost 20 times more to put a person with mental illness in jail than in \nan outpatient treatment--20 times more.\n  Listen to this one. Sylvia Blanchard writes:\n\n       As the mother of a bipolar son, my heart goes out to his \n     family because there is no hurt that hurts as much as \n     watching someone you love have this happen in their own life. \n     My son passed away 3 years ago, and I still ache. I have a \n     child who is in the same situation. He needs mental help, \n     then he needs to get treatment to deal with issues in his \n     life that he ignores and uses drugs to hide from it. In and \n     out of jail almost each week. Nothing a parent can do when \n     it's an adult child. So sad for our system. All States need \n     to look at what Ohio Governor did with his State to turn \n     mental health and drug abuse around.\n\n  Heidi Meyer writes:\n\n       This all stems from a bigger problem in that there are too \n     few beds in mental health facilities for children. There is \n     nowhere to get help for them when they're young and it just \n     leads to messed up adults.\n\n  This is a problem caused by the Federal Government. I told you that \nwe have too few psychiatric beds. One of the biggest culprits of that \nis Medicaid. For people who are low-income between the ages of 22 and \n64, if you have a psychiatric problem--I can't make this nonsense up, \nit is true--a person cannot go to a private psychiatric hospital with \nmore than 16 beds.\n  So where do they go?\n  They put them in an emergency room, they put them in a general \nhospital psych bed, thinking they are going to save money.\n  But here is what happens. If a person is in a psychiatric hospital \nbed, it costs about $500 a day. If they go to an emergency room, it \ncould be $3,000 or $4,000 a day. If they go to a general hospital psych \nunit, it could be $1,000, $1,200, $1,400 a day.\n  The State of Missouri actually did a study on this and found it saved \n40 percent of Medicaid dollars by allowing people to go where the care \nis to a psychiatric hospital to understand that medications can work.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) on this issue of \nmedications to elaborate on this. Buddy Carter from the First District \nof Georgia, from Savannah, Georgia, knows well what medications can do \nwhen properly prescribed and properly followed to help treat someone.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman has stated, this is a serious problem. \nThis is a problem that I have dealt with as a professional pharmacist \nfor many years. I have dealt with it in my retail setting in my \npharmacies, as well as a consultant pharmacist in a long-term care \nfacility in skilled nursing homes. I have seen the advances that we \nhave made in medicine over the years. I have seen us go from only \nhaving the original antipsychotics, Haldol, which was always \naccompanied by a prescription for Cogentin to mask the side effects \nthat the Haldol was going to have. I have seen the evolution of the \natypical antipsychotics, which, while they do have some side effects \nthemselves, are nowhere near the side effects that the original \nantipsychotics had.\n  I do thank the gentleman for bringing this important issue to light, \nand I do have a few comments that I would like to make.\n  First of all, medication plays a major role in the treatment for many \nmental illnesses. With the growing burden of mental disorders \nworldwide, pharmacists are ideally positioned to play a greater role in \nsupporting people with a mental illness. There is a growing amount of \nevidence to show that pharmacist-delivered services in mental health \ncare help address the barriers that are hurdles for the broader mental \nhealthcare team.\n  Pharmacists have three roles they can play in helping our country \naddress the mental health crisis.\n  First, pharmacists can play a major role in the multi-disciplinary \nteams addressing health care and can support early detection of mental \nillness. With more pharmacists coming out of school with greater \nclinical experience, pharmacists can work in new roles, such as in case \nconferencing or collaborative drug therapy management.\n  These new roles would also benefit from increased pharmacist \ninvolvement, such as the early detection of mental health conditions, \ndevelopment of healthcare plans, and follow-up of people with mental \nhealth problems.\n  Secondly, pharmacists can play a role in supporting quality use of \nmedicines and medication review, strategies to improve medication \nadherence and antipsychotic polypharmacy, and shared decision making.\n  Pharmacists would have a large impact regarding medication review \nservices and other pharmacist-led interventions designed to reduce \ninappropriate use of psychotropic medicines and improve medication \nadherence.\n  Finally, pharmacists can help address barriers surrounding the \nimplementation of mental health pharmacy services with a focus on \norganizational culture and mental health stigma.\n  Over the years, the relation between the pharmacist and the physician \nhas become more collaborative and cooperative. With this new \nrelationship, pharmacists can work with physicians to develop \nstrategies to change the attitudes and stigma surrounding mental \nhealth.\n  As my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative Murphy, continues \nto fight for this cause, I hope he will consider me and the profession \nof pharmacy as a friend and collaborator so we can fight to end the \nmental health crisis in this country.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and \nfor bringing this most important subject to light.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nhis comments and his dedication to this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), \nwho has been absolutely steadfast in his compassion and caring for \nthis. Also, it shows a bipartisan nature of our legislation. He has \nbeen instrumental in helping me understand other aspects of this. We \nmade a number of modifications to this bill and will continue to work \non these issues together, so I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Murphy. I appreciate his \ncourtesy in permitting me to speak with him this evening.\n  The Sun is setting on our Nation's Capitol. Many of our colleagues \nhave returned to Washington, D.C. They are at dinner, they are with \ntheir families, they are meeting with their constituents. I appreciate \nhis being here on the floor this evening to highlight a critical area \nthat he has been so committed to and has worked on so hard because it \nis something that each and every American needs to address and needs to \nfocus on because we are all in this together.\n  I will say that earlier in my career as a child State legislator, I \nwas part of the deinstitutionalization movement. It made a lot of \nsense. As my friend has said, we have had over a half million \ninstitutional beds. Some of the conditions were not what they should \nhave been. Some of the treatment certainly is nothing that we would \naccept today.\n  The notion of allowing people to be helped in a deinstitutionalized \nsetting made sense for a lot of people. It is sad to say we didn't do a \ngood job of implementing it. The institutionalization worked if we were \nthere supporting the people who were deinstitutionalized with \nmedication, with counseling, and with housing. And sadly, when we hit \nsome choppy waters economically in my community and others around the \ncountry who followed what was in theory a good model, we found that \nthere were too many people out on their own.\n  Sadly, today, we can see evidence of the failure to do \ndeinstitutionalization right on the streets of virtually every \ncommunity large and small from coast to coast.\n  I appreciate his efforts to help refocus the Federal partnership. \nCertainly there is a role for State and local government, there is a \nrole for the private sector, and there is a role for individuals and \nfamilies. The Federal Government provides resources, provides a \nframework, provides a legal setting, and we need to make sure that the \nFederal framework reflects the lessons we have learned and the \nrealities today.\n  I have been pleased that he has been so patient with me and others \nwho\n\n[[Page H1628]]\n\nhave carried to him some of the questions and concerns that we have \npicked up from people in our communities who care about it. He has \ntackled an area that is complex, it is controversial, and there is room \nfor give and take. I feel in the hours and hours that we have talked \nabout this exchanging information, I have seen that he has done just \nthat. He has drilled down, he has listened, he has incorporated, he has \nasked more questions, and I appreciate that because I think he is \nestablishing a framework here with a number of our colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis that will enable this Congress to be able to make real \nprogress that is long overdue.\n  In my community, we are going to open a facility in September. We \ncall it the Unity Center. It is a collaboration between four major \nhospitals to have a place where we can take people with mental problems \nout of emergency rooms where they can't be appropriately treated and \nwhere it is costly. All we can do is stabilize them, and then turn them \nback out on the street until their condition deteriorates where they \npose a problem to themselves and others.\n  As he has referenced, too much of our mental health service in this \ncountry is to be found behind bars. That is not the appropriate \nsetting. It is not cost effective and it is not humane.\n  We are making a small step in our community where these institutions \nhave come together and have established a memorandum of understanding. \nThey realize they are still going to lose money, but they are not going \nto lose as much. They are going to be able to give better care to a \npopulation that is very much in need.\n  I am hopeful, Mr. Speaker, that we will be able to, as a result of \nthe work that he is doing with this legislation and others who he is \nworking with, that we will be able to focus that Federal partnership \nyet this year, to be able to have more assistance to our communities to \nmake sure that the Federal programs are tailored to the needs of today \nand the experience that we have acquired.\n  I am hopeful that we will be able to develop more tools for one of \nthe most important ingredients in this equation, and that is the \nfamilies who are too often prevented because of the regulatory \nframework we have. Some of this is understandable, but it shouldn't be \na barrier for families who, in some cases, are the only people who \nreally know the individual, who care about them, and who are equipped \nto be a vital partner with the mental health system.\n  I look forward to further progress. I look forward to bringing back \nto you more information from Portland, Oregon, where we are going to \nhave another round table discussion with concerned individuals in \ngovernment, in the medical profession, and advocacy groups to make sure \nthat the input from my community is completely reflected in this.\n  Let me just say how much I appreciate his time and his effort, being \na partner with him in this. I am looking forward to seeing the result \nbefore the final gavel comes down on this Congress.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nOregon, and truly my friend.\n  I think when people look at Congress and wonder if people can work on \nissues in a bipartisan way, I am sure if someone looked at our voting \nrecord on other issues, we would probably be a bit different. That is \nokay. What still stands is that we are able to come together with a \ncommon issue.\n  I have no idea if this man is Republican, Democrat, registered to \nvote, nor should that matter to us. I have never asked a patient in my \n40 years of practicing. I know he is the same way, too. We do this \nbecause compassion dictates. Sometimes we are our brother's keeper, and \nwe need to do the right things.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  I do value your input on this bill. We have made a number of \nmodifications. I know that, in committee, Democrats have offered \nseveral amendments which I want to incorporate and which look at \nspecific funding for a number of things. We need more psychiatrists and \npsychologists. We just have to have them. We have to put money into \nthat. We need more programs in there. We need to bolster community \nmental health services. We need to make sure that there is oversight \nover what States are doing with those dollars in order to make sure \nthey are putting dollars into effective programs and not into frivolous \nones. That is one of the roles Congress has is to be the watchdog over \nthat.\n  I am proud to say, in front of the Nation, that you have been awesome \nin this, and I want to continue to work with you. We will solve this \nwill issue.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. If the gentleman would yield, I just want to say that \none of the areas that is most contentious deals with when people, like \nthe gentleman that you have pictured behind you, are going to be \ncompelled to have treatment. You have been open to being able to refine \nthe protections to make sure--and this is something that varies across \nthe country--that under the auspices of your bill that we have \nappropriate safeguards to make sure that the rights of the individual \nare respected but that we acknowledge the fact that, in some cases, the \nright for people to self-destruct is illusory.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Exactly.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. It is dangerous to them; it is dangerous to society; \nand it is heartbreaking for their families.\n  I have appreciated our conversations on that, going back and forth, \nand what you have tried to do to be able to make sure that the balance \nis struck. I am confident, before we are through, that we can make sure \nthat the other areas that require that give-and-take can, in fact, be \nmet. I would like to thank you for allowing me to speak on behalf of \nit, and I look forward to the next steps.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, what the gentleman is referring to is also something \ncalled assisted outpatient treatment. That is a program whereby 45 \nStates and the District of Columbia--maybe 46 States now--have this. \nWhen people have a history of incarcerations, of arrests, of violence \nand when they are not in treatment, a judge protects their rights and \nmay review their cases in terms of saying they can be put in inpatient \ncare. If the judge says they do not meet the standard of imminent \ndanger of harming themselves or someone else, assisted outpatient \ntreatment is what may be warranted for them, which means the judge \nsimply says: You are going to stay and continue to take your \nmedication. You will continue to see your therapist and work on this.\n  That being the case, when New York State did this, it found a \nreduction in incarcerations and homelessness by some 70 percent. It was \npretty dramatic. It found satisfaction by over 80 percent, and it found \ncosts go down by 50 percent.\n  It is something on which we in Congress need to continue to work. We \ndid pass legislation, which puts the appropriations of $15 million to \nhelp States do that, but we have a long way to go. It is a long way to \ngo based upon what I said. I think it is 1,820,000 people so far who \nhave commented. They have seen this on my Facebook page and have \ncommented on it. I want to read some more comments--some heartbreaking \nlessons--people are making.\n  One is by the name of Kari Butler, who wrote on my Facebook page:\n\n       They are falling through the cracks. Easier to just put \n     them in jail with high bail. They do make medication for \n     people like him, my nephews, which is to say one is in jail \n     now since November--no release until August--mostly because \n     he didn't follow up like he was supposed to. The prosecutor \n     did a mental evaluation on him to see if he could withstand \n     court, and he concluded he could; but something is not right \n     here. He has assaulted officers and has been tased three \n     times and has not been affected. Five police officers, it \n     took, to get him into the back of a car. They tased him in \n     Walmart--once in front of the whole store.\n\n  On it goes. There are many people with mental illness out there.\n  This person writes:\n\n       I don't believe public servants have been trained properly \n     to treat mental illness. I don't know what to do to help \n     people who get the help they need to be productive.\n\n  One might say one of the aspects of our bill is to provide training \nfor police officers--what is called emergency treatment for them. When \npolice officers have been trained in that, we have actually seen--and \nthe police officers like this, too--that they can quickly identify, if \nthis is a mentally ill person\n\n[[Page H1629]]\n\nin crisis, what they can do to deescalate the situation and prevent it \nfrom becoming harmful or deadly.\n  Here is another point that has been written by Amethyst Lees:\n\n       First off, the health system is horrible, and I worked \n     inside a mental institution and saw firsthand what it is \n     like. Depending on where I was, the people were not getting \n     their needs met or were being ignored. I even saw an incident \n     where a man was waiting for 15 minutes for two staff members \n     to stop talking about football just to ask for some ice. He \n     never got his ice because he lashed out for being ignored, \n     and, of course, he was restrained in a chair for an hour for \n     getting angry.\n\n  Marianne Kernan writes with regard to Cody Miller:\n\n       Talk to him. Our mental health system is shameful. I know, \n     as I work daily with this population, many times, their \n     treatment is inhumane. Some with dementia or Alzheimer's \n     wouldn't be treated this way if they had a break with \n     reality. It is a sad commentary on our lack of knowledge \n     of dealing with serious mental illness.\n\n  Here are some more stories.\n  Angie Geyser writes:\n\n       My 13-year-old daughter, Morgan, was in police custody for \n     19 months before she finally received treatment for her \n     schizophrenia. We had to pursue a civil commitment to make it \n     happen. Now she is back in juvenile detention where she has \n     no access to the outdoors and is not allowed to have physical \n     contact with her family. The treatment of the seriously \n     mentally ill by the criminal justice system is appallingly \n     inhumane.\n\n  Frede Trenkle writes:\n\n       Two weeks ago, a stranger that I have been married to for \n     13 years came into my home, sprayed me with pepper spray, \n     took a knife out in front of my two kids, and threatened to \n     cut his throat. The police took him away and put him in a \n     mental health hold. I chose not to press charges and just \n     requested that he get help. This was his second hospital stay \n     in a month. The hold was supposed to be for 7 days. Four days \n     later, he got out, and I am sure because he had a plane \n     ticket out of the State. He convinced someone out there that \n     I was the threat. He denied ever having a knife. He \n     manipulated the system. I received abusive texts before I \n     changed my phone number and he sent terrible emails. I only \n     wish he could get the help he desperately needs wherever he \n     is, but because of the unchecked mental illness, I now have \n     two beautiful girls, without their father, and both needing \n     their own mental health counseling. How do we help our system \n     on all ends?\n\n  Another woman writes:\n\n       If you want people like this young man to get help, we all \n     need to be okay with paying more taxes and closing privatized \n     prisons. The prison system has become the dumping ground for \n     the pervasive mentally ill.\n\n  Another one writes:\n\n       My uncle has schizophrenia. He disappears for months at a \n     time. I worry constantly about him being hurt by law \n     enforcement. He was living 50 miles away, in the woods, on \n     his father's property, in a camper, and was threatened with a \n     gun by a neighbor because he was walking in the fields, \n     talking to things only he can see. The cops were called, and \n     they showed up with weapons drawn. Then they took him away \n     and locked him up for a month. He is only 32, but the police \n     assumed he was on drugs. He was having a psychotic episode. \n     There is not enough education in the judicial system about \n     mental illness, and innocent people are being killed through \n     the ignorance.\n\n  Another woman writes:\n\n       My question is this: As the mom, where should we direct the \n     young people with schizophrenia? Hospital care is effective, \n     but it seems to be temporary: 6 months in and 2 years out; \n     repeat. Has anyone found or used or heard of any successful \n     treatment going on at treatment facilities?\n\n  The answer is yes. Actually, one of the programs in H.R. 2646, the \nHelping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, is for something called \nRAISE, Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode. We have learned \nthat, since schizophrenia and bipolar illness and severe mental \nillnesses are emerging in adolescent and young adult years, if one gets \nto someone early, with a low dose of medication, with proper evidence-\nbased treatment, the prognosis is much, much better; but when we don't \ntreat someone, every time someone has what the lay public calls a \nnervous breakdown or a psychotic break--a crisis--we have to understand \nthat, over time, these lead to neurological damage. These are not \nharmless episodes. This is not just someone who gets upset. This is a \nreal psychiatric disorder that comes from the brain and leads to \nproblems, and that is why we see these problems grow.\n  Here is someone who doesn't quite understand the problem. A woman by \nthe name of Julie writes:\n\n       I am very much against the families of mentally ill \n     patients having the power to put their loved ones away \n     against a patient's will. Let the doctors determine if the \n     patient has a problem, not the family. Often, the family just \n     doesn't want to deal with the illness, so they want the \n     person to go away.\n\n  Someone by the name of Robin Duffey writes:\n\n       Julie, you don't know what you're talking about. There are \n     more of us that do care, but because of the mental health \n     laws, we are unable to make decisions for very sick family \n     members. People with schizophrenia don't realize they are \n     sick. They think their hallucinations are real, along with \n     the commanding voices they hear. So how can such an ill \n     person make a logical decision to get the help they need? The \n     answer is: they can't. The doctors have to follow the laws \n     that are in place, which is they cannot recommend committing \n     a person unless they are an immediate threat or danger to \n     someone or themselves. Yes, Julie. There are some families \n     that don't want to be bothered, but I was not one of them. I \n     highly recommend you to do research on the subject before you \n     spout your ideas. Read the Federal and State laws.\n\n  Indeed, that is what we are trying to do with H.R. 2646.\n  There are a couple of thousand more comments on my Facebook page, Mr. \nSpeaker, and I certainly ask people to go and read them. They are \nheartbreaking. They are horrifying. They are tragic. They are true. \nThey go on and on because our Nation refuses to acknowledge this.\n  Until we pass this bill and start making changes--we can predict it--\nin the time that I have been speaking here, there have been several \nmore suicides; there have been more homicides; there have been more \nmentally ill people whom we have abandoned; there have been people who \nhave had chronic illnesses and who have died, because the people with \nserious mental illness, for multiple reasons, tend to die 10 to 25 \nyears sooner than the rest of the population because of the fact that \n75 percent of those with mental illness have at least one chronic \nillness, 50 percent have at least two chronic illnesses, and a third \nhave at least three chronic illnesses. I mean things like heart \ndisease, lung disease, infectious disease, diabetes. They get sick and \nthey, oftentimes, are not treated. Many times, they don't seek \ntreatment. We let them go in this slow-motion death spiral and ignore \nthem.\n\n  We have closed the hospitals. We have put them in prisons. If they \nare out of control and if the police bring them to the emergency room \nand if there are no beds available, they tie them down to the gurney, \nwhere they may wait for days--or weeks, in some cases--where they are, \nperhaps, given some sedative--a chemical straightjacket, if you will--\nto calm them down. That is not treatment. That is abusive. That is our \nNation that is doing it, and Congress is culpable in this because we \nrefuse to act.\n  Once again, there will be a tragedy somewhere. I shudder to think--\nand I hope it is not anybody here who is injured--that, somewhere out \nin America today, this is going to happen. Once again, we will gather \nfor a moment of silence; the gavel will come down; and we will go back \nto our regular order of business. It is sad and it disgusts me, but \nthat is what we face: all of this closing of hospitals and not opening \nup community mental health; Medicaid's saying you can't see two doctors \nin the same day; Medicaid's saying you can't go to a hospital with more \nthan 16 beds; HHS' saying we can't tell parents anything, so they are \nleft in the dark; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, which funds programs that teach people to make \ncollages, to do interpretive dances, to get off their medication, to \nmake masks and other things that have nothing to do with serious mental \nillness.\n  We need to change the system, and that is what H.R. 2646 does. It \ntakes that office of SAMHSA and changes it so that the director of it \nis the Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. That \nperson needs to be a doctor or a psychiatrist who is trained, either an \nM.D. or an osteopath or a psychologist, but someone who understands the \nfield and not just someone who is saying: Well, let's just do these \nother ``feel good'' programs.\n  The city of New York just did this, too, where the mayor put up \nhundreds of millions of dollars for programs that were, supposedly, for \nthe mentally ill. They weren't for the mentally ill at all. They were \nprograms like parks and bike trails and ``feel good'' programs to\n\n[[Page H1630]]\n\nhelp people with sadness, not to deal with depression and serious \nmental illness.\n  How long can we continue to fool ourselves?\n  As for this whole idea that says ``leave it up to them if they want \nto choose; don't provide them the help; make it the most difficult for \nthose people who have the most difficulty,'' all of this, Mr. Speaker, \nis more commentary and evidence of the grand experiment of stopping all \ntreatment under the misguided, self-centered, and projected belief that \nall people who are mentally ill are fully capable of deciding their own \nfate and direction, regardless of their deficits and disease, and that \nthey have the right to self-decay and self-destruction, which overrides \ntheir right to be healthy. The most fundamental, dangerous, and \ndestructive hidden undercurrent of prejudice is the low expectation \nthat your disability is as good as it gets.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  The shift to consider changes in how we treat severe mental illness \nis the pendulum that needs to swing the other way. The grand experiment \nhas failed in closing down all the institutions and care and stopping \nall treatment and not allowing community mental health.\n  It is a principle that operated under the misguided, self-centered \nbelief that people are always fully capable of deciding their own fate, \nregardless of their deficits and disease, and the right to self-decay \nand self-destruction overrides this right to health.\n  In so doing, we have come to comfortably advocate our responsibility \nto action and live under this perverse redefinition that the most \ncompassionate compassion is to do nothing at all.\n  It further bolstered the most evil of prejudices that the person with \ndisabilities deserves no more than what they are. Under that approach, \nno dreams, no aspirations, no goals to be better can even exist.\n  Indeed, to help a person heal is a head-on collision with the bigoted \nbelief that the severely mentally ill have no right to be better than \nwhat they are and we have no obligation to help them.\n  This is the corrupt evil of the hands-off approach in the \nantitreatment model, and that perversion of thought is embedded in the \nglorification that to live a life of deterioration and paranoia and \nfilth and squalor and emotional torment trumps a healed brain and the \ntrue chance to choose a better life.\n  This is the movement of hatred and stigma toward the mentally ill \ndisguised as the right to let them be sick. That hatred may be embedded \nin our own anger, our own resentment, and one's own past experiences \nprojected as blame or misattribution of the lives of others or maybe \nour own fear and loathing of the mentally ill. Either way, the outcome \nis tragically the same.\n  So we can have more moments of silence or we can have times of \naction. I hope the Energy and Commerce Committee picks this up.\n  I hope that more Members of Congress will sign on as cosponsors of \nH.R. 2646, the Helping Families of Mental Health Crisis Act. The day \nthat bill signs into law, it will begin to save lives. It will begin to \nmake a difference in people's lives.\n  Of all the other things we do down the road here for images or to \npush polling--I can tell you this, that the polling on this bill is in \n70s and 80s. As politicians, we think, wow, if something polls at 55 \npercent, vote for it.\n  My concern is: Will America wake up and look toward Congress here and \nsay: When we had a chance to do something to save lives, did we act, or \nare we once again just caught up in moments of silence?\n  Thomas Jefferson said something along the lines of: ``Indeed I \ntremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and His justice \ncannot sleep forever.''\n  We are in that same position now. We can either have the courage to \nstand up, take action, and help the mentally ill or we can sit in \nsilence. I hope this Chamber soon takes up H.R. 2646, the Helping \nFamilies in Mental Health Crisis Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nH.R. 2646, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. Thank you \nto Congressman Tim Murphy for hosting this important special order to \ndiscuss our country's current mental health system.\n  For more than two years now, I have worked with Congressman Murphy on \nH.R. 2646, a bipartisan piece of legislation that has garnered support \nfrom patients, caregivers, psychiatrists, psychologists, law \nenforcement, and even editorial boards. As two of the few mental health \nproviders serving in Congress, our bill reflects not only what we have \nlearned in our own careers, but feedback from stakeholders, families, \norganizations, other members of Congress, and addresses many of the \npolicies that we can change now to help patients struggling with severe \nmental illness and substance use disorders.\n  An amended version of H.R. 2646 passed the Energy and Commerce \nSubcommittee on Health in November of 2015. Since then, there has been \nno action. I have continued to talk with members of my community about \nmental health issues and they demand action.\n  It is now April of 2016 and we must move forward on the issue of \nmental health. The American people expect, deserve, and demand it. H.R. \n2646 takes a strong step forward in mental health reform. As days pass \nwith no action, people are denied beds, denied care, and are floating \nthrough the pervasive cycle of mental illness without attention. \nEveryone deserves care. I truly hope that my colleagues will work with \nme to pass this bill for the sake of those who truly matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1630-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3340, \n  FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL REFORM ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR \nCONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3791, RAISING CONSOLIDATED ASSETS THRESHOLD UNDER \n              SMALL BANK HOLDING COMPANY POLICY STATEMENT\n\n  Mr. STIVERS (during the Special Order of Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania), \nfrom the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nGaramendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority \nleader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, my colleague just finished a very good \nrecitation of the problems of mental health. I am going to pick up \nanother piece of this issue which has to do with dementia and \nAlzheimer's, which I believe the gentleman spoke to very briefly during \nhis presentation.\n  I thank him for his concern and for the work that he has been doing \nthese many years on this profoundly important issue of brain health.\n  My role tonight will be kind of working off the previous presentation \nand taking it just a little bit in a slightly different direction, and \nit has to do with dementia and Alzheimer's, which is obviously a rather \nimportant issue.\n\n[[Page H1631]]\n\n  I want to just put up a couple of placards here to try to demonstrate \nthe overall nature of this problem. One way to look at it is just in \nterms of the numbers, and the numbers are staggering.\n  The number of people: Right now in America, there are about 5.1 \nmillion Americans with Alzheimer's. We expect that number to grow not \njust because the baby boomers are moving into their older years, but \nalso because of the growth of the population and the increasing \nincidence of Alzheimer's.\n  If you look at this chart, you can see it growing over the years so \nthat, in about 2050, we expect to have 13,800,000 Americans with \nAlzheimer's. It is not just an issue with individuals who are \nsuffering, whose lives are seriously disrupted. It is a serious issue \nfor the financing of this Nation.\n  If you look at this, you can see this line of growth in the number of \nAmericans with Alzheimer's and you can see the ever-rising cost. These \nare not inflated numbers. These are constant dollars over the years.\n  So when we reach 2050, not too many years from now, we are going to \nsee an extraordinary expense of nearly three-quarters of a trillion \ndollars annually spent with the Medicare-Medicaid budget.\n  Now, many, many people on this floor are concerned about deficits. We \nall are. The deficits are driven by many issues: the ever-increasing \ncost of programs, new programs, increasing military expenditures, the \ngrowth of Medicare, Social Security, and the like.\n  Well, Alzheimer's is the single biggest budget issue within all of \nthose programs. Under the Medicare-Medicaid programs, it is going to \nexplode--you can see what we are looking at here--from $153 billion in \n2015 to three-quarters of a trillion, $735 billion, in the year 2050. \nThis will bust the budget.\n  Many of the deficits that we are so concerned about, in fact, that \nare in play today, as this House has been unable with our Republican \nmajority to fashion a budget and all of the disruptions that that \ncreates and then the ongoing appropriation process, which is delayed \nand made rather confusing as a result of not having a budget--inherent \nin that debate is the ever-increasing cost of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Well, why is it increasing? Well, largely it is increasing because of \nthese types of illness, such as Alzheimer's. You can see here what we \nare looking at, almost a $30 billion increase in just the next 4 \nyears--or 3 years, actually.\n  So no wonder we are unable to get control of our budgets and our \nappropriations here when we are faced with this inexorable increase in \nan illness that affects every family in America.\n  It has affected my family. My mother-in-law spent the last 3 years of \nher life living with my wife Patty and I in our home where we took care \nof her. We were fortunate enough to be able to have a day nurse come \nin. But then in the early morning and on through the evening and night, \nmy wife and I were responsible for caring for my mother-in-law.\n  It was a duty that we found to be very worthwhile. It was a duty that \nbrought our family together in close relationship as we watched this \nillness take hold of a lovely lady, a very smart, very capable woman \nwho became ultimately an invalid and died of this disease.\n  It is not unique. Millions of families across this Nation are taking \ncare of their husband, wife, mother, father, and mother- or father-in-\nlaw as Alzheimer's creeps into their family's life.\n  Now, this problem can be addressed. We know there is a solution. This \nis not a hopeless case. Five years ago, if I were standing here, I \nwould probably say that this is simply hopeless and we are going to be \nfaced with these costs no matter what happens. That is not the case \ntoday, not at all, because today research is having an effect.\n  Let me show you what research has done on other illnesses that plague \nAmericans and, indeed, humans around the world:\n  Breast cancer: Well, we have had an enormous increase in breast \ncancer research. We have seen a 2 percent decline in the number of \ndeaths from breast cancer.\n  Similarly, we have looked at other cancers, like prostate cancer, and \nwe have seen an 11 percent decline in the deaths from prostate cancer.\n  Heart disease: There is an enormous amount of money going into heart \ndisease, less than for cancer, but, nonetheless, an enormous amount of \nmoney. We have seen a 14 percent decrease in deaths from heart disease \nas a result of treatments that are now available. Research money led to \nthose treatments.\n  Stroke: There is a 23 percent decline in the number of deaths from \nstrokes. Again, research money into heart disease, into diseases of the \ncirculatory system, have resulted in very, very significant decreases \nin the deaths.\n  HIV/AIDS: Dramatic. There has been an enormous amount of money spent \ninto research of HIV/AIDS. The result? There has been a 52 percent \ndecrease in the deaths from HIV/AIDS.\n  So we know that, if we spend money on research, we will see a decline \nin the death rate from those illnesses.\n  Alzheimer's disease: In 2015, we spent just over 20 percent of the \namount of money on researching Alzheimer's disease as we did on heart \ndisease and on cancer. So don't be surprised with this chart.\n  There is a 71 percent increase in the death rate from Alzheimer's. \nThere is a relationship here. There is a relationship between the \ninvestment that we make in research and the resultant increase or \ndecrease in the disease.\n  In the case of cancer of nearly all kinds, we have seen a significant \nand, in many cases, dramatic decline in the death rate from those \ncancers.\n  In the case of heart disease, similarly, money spent on research, on \nmore effective treatments, and on drug treatments has resulted in a \nvery significant decrease in strokes and other heart disease issues.\n  HIV/AIDS is the most dramatic where, again, research is leading to \nbetter lives, longer lives, less death and less cost.\n  Alzheimer's? No. No. In 2015, we spent just over $500 million.\n  Is there a lesson for us here? You bet there is. Here is the lesson: \nYou invest up front. You invest up front with research.\n  I want to thank the President. I want to thank the Members of \nCongress and the Senate, who, in this current year's appropriation, \n2016, have added another $300 million to the Alzheimer's research \nprogram.\n  Let me put another chart up here. Alzheimer's spending, research \nversus treatment: In 2015, Medicare and Medicaid will spend over 261 \ntimes as much on treatment as the NIH will spend on research toward a \ncure.\n  So, in 2015, a year ago, we spent $153 billion on treating--this is \nMedicare and Medicaid, not private insurance, not money out of \nindividual pockets--we spent $153 billion of your Federal tax money on \ncaring for Alzheimer's. That was 261 times the amount of money spent on \nresearch.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Now, let's see, let's be accurate here because we did have an \nincrease, as I just said. We have actually spent $936 million in 2016 \non Alzheimer's research. So this 261 times is significantly less now. \nBut we are not at the goal. We are not at the goal that we want to have \nin place for the treatment and the care of Alzheimer's.\n  The goal of the Alzheimer's Association is to raise the amount of \nresearch money to the level of about $1.5 billion. It is anticipated--\nand I will explain why this is a sound anticipation--it is anticipated \nthat if we were to be able to spend that amount of money in 2017, \nkeeping in mind that we are now just under a billion dollars for \nresearch, but if we bring it up another $500 million to $1.5 billion, \nif we were to do that, it is anticipated that by 2025--that is just 9 \nyears from now--we would see a dramatic change in the incidence of \nAlzheimer's.\n  Many people would not be suffering from it, and those who do would \nsee the onset of Alzheimer's pushed back into their later years so that \nthey would be able to live a better, more sound, mentally sound life \nand more productive life and, for the taxpayers of this Nation, a \nsignificantly reduced amount of Federal support through Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  How much does it amount to?\n  So if we spent that $936 million this year and in the next year ramp \nit up another 200 and in the following year another $300 million so \nthat we get to the goal of $1.5 billion of research in the years \nbetween now and 2020, we would see a dramatic reduction and a\n\n[[Page H1632]]\n\ndramatic improvement in the lives of Americans, much better lives.\n  If this were available to my mother-in-law, perhaps she would have \nbeen able to live another 2, 3, 5 years without the onset of \nAlzheimer's. And what would that mean to the quality of her life as \nwell as to her family's?\n  So let's assume that the research pushes back the onset of \nAlzheimer's by 5 years, so that in 2025 what would we see?\n  Well, for Medicare and Medicaid, we would see in the years 2025 to \n2030 a 121-billion-dollar reduction in the cost to Medicare and \nMedicaid to your taxpayer dollars, and from 2025 to 2030--that is 10 \nyears of the new treatments being in place--we would see a half-\ntrillion-dollar reduction in the cost of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Now, this isn't pie in the sky. This isn't just wishful, hopeful \nthinking and a prayer and a song. This is a real possibility. Those of \nyou who have been reading the press or listening to the television news \nprograms over the last year, you will note a significant change from \nhopelessness to hope. Yes, hope. There is real hope that we will be \nable to attack this debilitating dementia Alzheimer's, that we will be \nable to delay the onset and quite possibly stop it, to cure it.\n  Now, that may be off into the future, but we are now gaining an \nunderstanding because of the research that is being done on Alzheimer's \nand much of the research that was discussed earlier in the discussion \nof mental health programs and research that is going on by the United \nStates military as they attack the problem of post-traumatic stress and \nbrain damage from the men and women who have served in the recent wars.\n  All of that research is coming together with an understanding of how \nthe human brain works, what the elements are that cause the damage of \nmental health, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress, as well as \nbrain damage, perhaps for the football players in the NFL and beyond.\n  So here is what we are going to do. We are going to fight this year \nto increase this funding from beyond $236 million to just over $1 \nbillion. We know it is a tough budget year. We know that the \nRepublicans have been unable to even come to grips to put together a \nbudget, let alone increase the appropriations.\n  But where could money be better spent than on research that is \nactually moving forward toward an understanding of what Alzheimer's is \nand how the brain is attacked, how we can stall--not yet reverse, but \nstall the onset of the damage that occurs as a result of Alzheimer's.\n  We have seen it. You have seen the stories. We know that drug \ntreatments that were once thought to be ineffective, treatments that \nwere done in the mid-1990s didn't work, or so they thought. Then some \nstatisticians looked at those results of those drug trials and noticed \nsomething really important. They noticed that while the overall program \ndidn't seem to work, they noticed that there was a subset of patients \nwho were being treated by that drug, and they noticed that that subset \nwas the early onset of Alzheimer's, and what they noticed was that that \ndrug seemed to push back, seemed to hold steady that onset of \nAlzheimer's. Whoa, it was a eureka moment that maybe using drugs of \nthat type applied early in the process would result in the delay, the \narresting of the Alzheimer's onset.\n  That is what we are talking about here. If we are able to invest this \nmoney in research, we can see the probability that there are a series \nof drugs that do have an effect on the onset of Alzheimer's and seem to \ndelay that onset.\n  Each year that goes by, what is the effect for the individual, for \nthe family of the individual?\n  It means their life will be better. It means that the kind of stress, \nstrain, and financial cost that is put on a family with Alzheimer's \nwill be arrested. It will be delayed. Not 1 year, maybe 2 years, maybe \n3, maybe 5 years. And the cost is enormous.\n  As I said before, if we are able to do this increased research over \nthe next 3, 4, 5 years, working on those series of drugs that now seem \nto have an effect, we will be able in the years 2025 to 2030 to save \nyou, the taxpayers, and us, the appropriators of your tax money, over \n$120 billion in the years 2025 to the year 2030. In 5 years beyond \nthat, that 10-year period, a half trillion dollars.\n  So if you are worried about the deficit--and we all are--if you are \nworried about how we are going to put together a 5-year budget, which \nis what we do, then look at this investment. If you are worried about \nthe effect of Alzheimer's in your family or on yourself, there are 435 \nof us in this House and another 100 over in the Senate. Listen, one-\nthird of us are likely to die of Alzheimer's in the years ahead. So if \nyou don't care about the family, you don't care about Americans, care \nabout yourself. One-third of us are destined. If you happen to be a \nfemale, the odds are even greater.\n\n  So what is this all about?\n  Well, we are somehow grappling with the budget, the 5-year budget. We \ncan't seem to get it together. Enormous chaos on the side of my \nRepublican colleagues about how to do it. The appropriation process is \nunderway and totally stalled out until at least May 15.\n  There is a solution. A small investment, a very small investment, and \nthen we can look at the long-term deficit. Then we can be in a position \nto improve the lives of Americans.\n  Oh, by the way, the money is available. The money is available. In \nthe budget and in the appropriations we are putting together, we are \nramping up so that over the next 20 years, 25 years, we are going to \nspend a trillion dollars--a trillion dollars--on a brand-new nuclear \narms race. We are going to rebuild all of our nuclear bombs. We are \ngoing to develop new airplanes to deliver those bombs, new satellites, \nnew rockets, new cruise missiles, new submarines. A trillion dollars.\n  Well, I have got a better place to spend some of that money. I have \ngot a better place to spend it, where the lives of Americans will be \nsignificantly improved, where the stress on families throughout this \nnation will be less, where the budgets of this country will not be \nbusted, where this curve, where this curve will be flattened, where we \nwill not in the year 2050 spend over a trillion dollars a year, a \ntrillion dollars a year caring for people who have Alzheimer's. Three-\nquarters of that money is your tax money.\n  You can go back here, 2020, and start spending a couple of hundred \nmillion dollars, a couple of hundred million dollars on research, on \npromising treatments for Alzheimer's, and then beginning in 2025, watch \nthis curve begin to flatten out.\n  Now, for me and for many of us in this room, we are not going to be \nout here in 2025, but our children and grandchildren will be, and they \nwill be caring for us unless we begin to make these investments now in \nresearch.\n  So in the next couple of weeks, the men and women in purple will be \nhere in Washington, D.C., as they do every spring, advocating for \nAlzheimer's research, for the caregivers, and for the families, and we \nought to be paying attention.\n  The money is in the budget somewhere. All we need to do is to find \nit, move it from a few nuclear weapons over to research, delay the \nexpenditure of a new ballistic missile or intercontinental ballistic \nmissile, and spend it on something that affects every American every \nday of this year and every day of the years in the future, and that is \nAlzheimer's.\n  It is a good investment. It is an investment in the quality of life. \nIt is an investment in our effort to reduce the deficit, and it is an \ninvestment in America's future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1632-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. DeFazio (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \npersonal business in district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/house-section/article/H1632-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1632-H1633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI.
