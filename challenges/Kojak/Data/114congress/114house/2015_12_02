The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I have long championed the concept that \ntrade done right requires strong environmental protections as well as \nenforcement of those commitments.\n  Many of our most serious environmental challenges, from climate \nchange to deforestation to protecting the oceans from being strip-mined \nwith industrial fishing practices, can only succeed in the context of \nenforceable international agreements.\n  Democrats reached an accord with the Bush administration through the \nMay 10 Agreement, which is one tool. The 2008 Lacey Act amendments are \nanother. There are now a host of trade-related tools to fight some of \nthe most egregious environmental challenges.\n  In the Peru Free Trade Agreement, we were able to include an entire \nForest Annex that requires Peru to sustainably manage its forest \nresources and protect their forests, under penalty of law. The impact \nof those tools, however, is dependent on our willingness to use things \nlike the Peru Free Trade Agreement.\n  Recent events present a chance to put those tools to work to fight \nagainst illegal logging in Peru, a country where 60 percent of its land \nis in the Amazon rainforest, and estimates on the rate of illegal \nlogging in that area are as high as 80 percent.\n  Last week, over 70 shipping containers of what is suspected to be \nillegally harvested timber from Peru was stopped at the Port of \nHouston. This action was taken after we received compelling information \nfrom OSINFOR, Peru's independent body tasked with oversight of their \nforests and wildlife resources.\n  Troublingly, this shipment is linked to a company whose logging \npractices are already suspect, having been one of 10 companies whose \nexport documents were found fraudulent during Operation Amazonas 2014, \nan operation carried out in coordination with INTERPOL to investigate \nillegal logging in Peru.\n  While it appears as though the timber is under American control, the \nsame bad actor is once again conveying illegally harvested timber out \nof Peru's Amazon rainforest and to its borders for export.\n  Thanks to the courageous action of a handful of individuals at \nOSINFOR--again, Peru's independent agency tasked with overseeing that \ntheir timber laws are followed--a shipment of timber likely of illegal \norigin has been stopped at the border in Peru. As a result, \nunfortunately, these brave people are being threatened with bodily \ndamage or death.\n  Given the savage history of these criminals, no doubt lives are in \njeopardy. One only has to look last fall at how serious these threats \nwere when Edwin Chota, an environmental activist trying to end the \npractice of illegal logging, was murdered by criminals that lead such \nillegal activity. Just 3 days ago, OSINFOR's office was firebombed. \nThugs are threatening to storm government offices if OSINFOR does not \nease up and go quietly into the night.\n  Mr. Speaker, this morning, I urge my colleagues to insist that the \nadministration stand up to these criminals, these murderers, and that \nwe will not turn our back on the courageous individuals, but support \nthem in their efforts. We have the tools to do exactly that, thanks to \nthe Peru Free Trade Agreement, as well as the Lacey Act.\n  The shipment held in Houston should be thoroughly investigated and, \nif evidence permits, we should bring to bear the full weight of the \n2008 Lacey Act amendments by pursuing civil fines, forfeiture of timber \nand equipment, and criminal penalties, if supported by the evidence. \nAnd, frankly, also pushing back on Peru. The shipment held in Peru must \nalso be investigated and the bad actors brought to justice. The \nPeruvian Government should immediately make clear they stand behind \nOSINFOR as an independent oversight agency.\n  At a time when we will be considering the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nwhich has promising protections, it is more important than ever that \nthe administration make sure that they are not merely protections on \npaper, but protections backed by action. It is time to step up with \nrobust enforcement.\n\n[[Page H8864]]\n\n  If we are serious about combating climate change, we must not only \nhold ourselves accountable for following our carbon-cutting \ncommitments, but other countries as well. Peru, for example, has made \nprotection of the Amazon rainforest the centerpiece of its proposed \nclimate proposal.\n  When unsustainable logging practices contribute to 17 percent of \ntotal global carbon emissions annually, it is clear that progress \ncannot be made on this front and many others if we do not stand up and \nempower people in Peru and elsewhere who want to do the right thing and \nfight the illegal trade in timber. The administration has a perfect \nopportunity to show good faith by acting now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8864-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING CHEF TOM PRITCHARD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a veteran, a \nlegendary chef, and a man known as the godfather of the Tampa Bay \nhospitality industry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend to so many in the \nPinellas County and Tampa Bay community, Mr. Tom Pritchard, executive \nchef of the Bay Star Restaurant Group. Tom passed away this past week \nfollowing surgery to ease the effects of Parkinson's disease. He was 74 \nyears old.\n  Anyone who knew Tom will tell you that he was a storyteller who was \nlarger than life. He had his own unique sense of style and had a way of \nmaking anyone he met feel like they had known each other for decades.\n  Born in Rochester, New York, Tom's first restaurant job came at the \nage of 14, when he started work shucking oysters for the legendary Guy \nLombardo at his East Point House restaurant on Long Island.\n  After high school, Tom left home for college in Iowa before being \ndrafted by the U.S. Army in 1964. Tom was stationed in Germany for \nseveral years before being honorably discharged in 1967.\n  After serving his country, Tom continued to spend time abroad, living \nin London, Mexico, Morocco, Scotland, and owning restaurants in France \nand Spain. Eventually, he moved to Florida, and in the 1990s he \npartnered with Frank Chivas, a seafood broker who would become a dear \nand lasting friend of Tom's. The two would open Salt Rock Grill in \nIndian Shores. Under Tom's guidance and tutelage, Salt Rock's kitchen \nbecame a training ground for up-and-coming chefs.\n  Always quick to help others and share recipes, and with his inventive \napproach to cooking, Tom became a Florida food legend. One longtime \nfood critic wrote of Tom's generosity: `` `Mentor' is too trite a word \nfor what Tom Pritchard did for literally hundreds of people, young and \nold, in the kitchen.''\n  Tom would go on to oversee the kitchens at Island Way Grill and Rumba \nIsland Bar and Grill in Clearwater and Marlin Darlin in Belleair \nBluffs--along the way, always helping others. You see, it was Tom's \ngenerosity outside the kitchen that defined the man he was.\n  As one director of a Florida charity wrote this week, Tom set the \nplatinum standard for community support, underwriting substantial food \nand labor costs annually at benefits for numerous nonprofit \norganizations, like the Abilities Foundation, Clearwater for Youth, and \nthe Ryan Wells Foundation.\n  The Abilities Foundation alone raised $3.7 million from 25 years of \nwine and food tastings thanks to the help of Tom Pritchard and Frank \nChivas. Tom and Frank's mere presence at a fundraiser influenced the \nparticipation of countless sponsors and attendees.\n  Tom was always quick to lend his time and talents to benefit programs \nthat helped disabled and other individuals find jobs and live \nindependently. Mr. Speaker, let it be known to all that Tom Pritchard \ngave more than he took.\n  Tom was preceded in death by his father, Thomas Alden Pritchard, Sr.; \nmother, Ruth McCarthy Pritchard; brother, Jeffery Lloyd; and son, Adam \nD. Ostfeld, who also served his country in the Armed Forces. He is \nsurvived by his loving wife of 24 years, Jody D. Hale; her husband, \nDaniel Hale; sisters, Cynthia A. Tischer, Laurie N. Pritchard; and \nbrother, John C. Pritchard.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Pinellas County community, the Tampa Bay community, \nand our culinary and charitable communities throughout Florida lost a \ntreasure with the passing of chef Tom Pritchard.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in remembering his contributions and \nhis legacy of helping others and serving our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8864-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING WENDELL PHILLIPS ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PROGRAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute \nthe remarkable young men of Chicago's Wendell Phillips Academy High \nSchool football program, their parents, administrators, coaches, and \nteachers.\n  Last Friday, in a stunning 51-7 win against Belleville's Althoff High \nSchool, the Wildcats won the 4A title for Public League's first \nfootball State crown since the playoffs began in 1974, completing an \namazing 13-0 season. The 51 points scored by Phillips set a State title \ngame record.\n  The game featured record-shattering performances by a host of Wildcat \nplayers, including senior quarterback Quayvon Skanes, who rushed for \n141 yards and four touchdowns on 13 carries, passed for an additional \n44 yards and another touchdown--just to prove that he could throw the \nball. Quayvon is headed to the University of Connecticut next year.\n  Other thrilling performances included Kamari Mosby, who ran for 151 \nyards and a score; Qadeer Weatherly, who pulled in Quayvon's pass for a \n36-yard touchdown; Amir Watts, who returned an Althoff fumble for a 19-\nyard score; and a 21-yard field goal by Isaac Osei to demonstrate the \nWildcats' comprehensive offense.\n  The Phillips football program, the second largest in the Chicago \nPublic Schools, is a study of the potential and the problems of urban \neducation. With more than 90 student athletes, the varsity team is led \nby 19 seniors, all of whom are on track to graduate.\n  In an after-game interview with the Chicago Tribune, Phillips' Coach \nTroy McAllister noted: ``When we go to practice, we go with footballs. \nThere are no sleds, no chutes, no kicking nets, nothing like that. It \ngoes to what our coaches have done and what these young men can do.\n  ``We have five stipends for coaches. Everywhere else it is 10 to 14. \nThat makes a huge difference, but these young men have bought into what \nwe are trying to accomplish, and they have done something that nobody \nelse has done.''\n  These young men are not just athletes. They are also proud scholars \nand are members of a school which last year saw 100 percent of its \nseniors accepted to college, with more than $5 million in scholarships.\n  In his after-game interview, Principal Matt Sullivan summed it all \nup. He said: ``It is fantastic. We want to be the beacon, the shining \nbeacon in the Bronzeville community.''\n  Mr. Speaker, all of Chicago is thrilled and delighted by the \nperformance of this team. I offer my congratulations to their parents, \nadministrators, coaches, and teachers for going above and beyond the \ncall of duty. I extend my congratulations to each and every one of \nthose young men and wish for them continued success in everything they \nset out to do in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8864-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8864-H8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n  REAFFIRMING STATES' RIGHTS TO IMPOSE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Roskam) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I introduced H. Con. Res. 100, a \nbipartisan resolution that reaffirms the rights of the 50 States to \nmaintain economic sanctions against Iran.\n  The Iran Sanctions Act of 2010 encourages and authorizes States to \nmaintain such sanctions, which play a powerful role in preventing U.S. \ndollars from funding Iran's illicit activity, including its support for \nterrorism,\n\n[[Page H8865]]\n\nhuman rights violations, and imprisonment of innocent Americans.\n  Thirty States, to date, Mr. Speaker, have imposed sanctions against \nIran. Both Democrats and Republicans have worked at the State and local \nlevel to enact laws to ensure that State assets are not invested in and \nState contracts are not awarded to companies that do business with \nIran.\n  As long as Iran continues its outrageous activity abroad, it is our \nright and it is our duty to make sure that we are not complicit in \nfunding its terrorism, its human rights abuses, and its other activity \nthat is contrary to the U.S. national interests and global stability.\n  Now, there is some ambiguity and some confusion about State sanctions \nthat are authorized under the so-called Iran deal of this year. This \nlegislation clarifies, it puts an exclamation point, and it reaffirms \nthe legal right of States to maintain these sanctions as enacted into \nlaw under the 2010 statute until Iran ends its support of terrorism and \nreverses its abhorrent human rights violations.\n  Please join my colleagues Representative Ted Deutch of Florida, \nRepresentative Dan Lipinski of Illinois, Representative Mike Pompeo of \nKansas, Representative Brad Sherman of California, and Representative \nLee Zeldin of New York, along with me, in this effort to ensure that \nthe right of States to maintain these important sanctions against Iran \nprevails.\n  We can ensure that States have this right and this authority from \npreventing their resources from funding Iranian terrorism and human \nrights abuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8865-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     END HUNGER NOW--MONTE'S MARCH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the pleasure of taking \npart in Monte's March, an annual hunger walk in western Massachusetts. \nThe march started in 2010 and is named after its founder, Monte \nBelmonte, a local activist and WRSI The River radio host in \nNorthampton.\n  Over the course of 2 days, we walked 43 miles across western \nMassachusetts, from Springfield to Northampton to Greenfield, to raise \nawareness about the very real problem of hunger in our communities and \nhelp families in need this holiday season.\n  We had a great group walking with us this year, led by Monte, and \nincluding Andrew Morehouse, the executive director of the Food Bank of \nWestern Massachusetts, University of Massachusetts Amherst Chancellor \nKumble Subbaswamy, Northwestern District Attorney David Sullivan, and a \nhost of other local officials and community members.\n  I want to say a special thanks to my colleagues Congressmen Richie \nNeal and Joe Kennedy for joining us along the way and helping to \nsupport those in need.\n  Also joining us on that march were Sean Barry of Four Seasons Liquor \nin Hadley, Erika Cooper of Tea Guys in Whately, Ben Clark of Clarkdale \nFruit Farm in Deerfield, Natalie Blais of UMass Amherst, Steve Fendel \nfrom Gill, Marty Dagoberto, Dan Finn from Pioneer Valley Local First, \nChia Collins from Northampton, Kristen Elechko, Georgian and Rick \nKristek, and many, many, many more.\n  This year's walk was extra special for me because my son, Patrick, \nwalked the entire route with us both days.\n  Mr. Speaker, every day, 48 million Americans struggle with hunger, \nincluding 15.3 million children. We live in the richest country on \nEarth and have greater access to food than any previous generation, so \nthe fact that hunger continues to be so widespread in America is \nabsolutely stunning.\n  Monte's March was started in 2010 to do something about it. This \nyear's walk was the longest and biggest effort yet.\n  Bright and early last Monday morning, our group of walkers began our \nmarch in the Mason Square neighborhood of Springfield. The Mason Square \nneighborhood is one of those communities in western Massachusetts most \nin need, with so many families living in poverty and facing food \nhardship. In fact, childhood poverty rates have been as high as 59 \npercent in this area alone.\n  For these families, overcoming hunger is especially challenging \nbecause the neighborhood is a ``food desert,'' an area where affordable \nand healthy food, like fresh fruits and vegetables, are hard to come \nby. With no full-line supermarket within walking distance for residents \nto purchase food at affordable prices, we wanted to make sure that the \nMason Square neighborhood was front and center in this year's march.\n  It also gave us the opportunity to thank the Mason Square Health Task \nForce for their tireless efforts to address hunger and to show our deep \nappreciation to local feeding programs like St. John's Congregation \nChurch.\n  We then marched through Springfield, Chicopee, and Holyoke before \nfinishing day one in Northampton. Seventeen miles were behind us, with \nday two still to go.\n  We started on Tuesday morning walking through Northampton, then \nHadley, and then Amherst, where we stopped at the Amherst Survival \nCenter.\n  The Amherst Survival Center is an amazing place. Since 1976, they \nhave welcomed everyone who has come through their doors with open arms \nand a kind word. They help those who are struggling to meet their basic \nneeds. All of their services are free. They run a food pantry, \ncommunity meal program, drop-in health clinic, job-readiness workshops \nand job fairs, and a host of other important programs.\n  After our brief visit, it was back to the pavement, through \nSunderland and Deerfield, before finally ending in Greenfield.\n  We walked a total of 26 miles on day two. Along the way, we felt the \nincredible support of the western Massachusetts community. People \nstopped us along the way to add canned food and other donations to our \nshopping cart. They came out of their homes and their businesses and \nschools, or they stopped their cars along the side of the road to offer \nwords of encouragement.\n  Along the way, we helped raise more than $150,000 for The Food Bank \nof Western Massachusetts, which distributes hundreds of thousands of \npounds of food throughout the emergency feeding network in the region.\n  Mr. Speaker, by the end, we were sore and tired, but we were \nexhilarated by people's generosity and support. When you add it all up, \nthe outpouring of donations and support from our community will help \nprovide more than 450,000 meals to families in need.\n  The good news is that hunger is a solvable problem. We just need to \nmuster the political will to help more communities like these in \nMassachusetts and across the country.\n  There is not a single congressional district in the United States \nwhere hunger isn't an issue affecting the daily lives of kids, \nfamilies, seniors, or veterans. We all have a stake in this, and with \nstrong grassroots support from communities in all 50 States, just like \nthe ones we visited over 2 days, we have the power to make a real \ndifference and help the 48 million Americans struggling with hunger.\n  Mr. Speaker, during this holiday season, I urge my colleagues and all \nAmericans to remember those who are struggling with hunger. They are \nour neighbors or colleagues and our friends.\n  I want to thank everyone who supported this year's Monte's March and \nespecially want to thank the incredible community partners on the \nground for their tireless efforts day in and day out. You inspire us, \nand we thank you for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8865-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8865-H8866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FIXING AMERICA'S SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nFixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act. This critical \nlegislation will provide 5 years of fully paid-for transportation \nprojects across the Nation to repair our aging infrastructure.\n  The FAST Act makes important reforms to highway and vehicle safety \nand expands public transportation to make Federal investment more cost-\neffective. It also expands funding available for bridges and roads.\n  And, most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill was done through the \nregular order process, with transparent amendments considered and all \nMembers having their say.\n\n[[Page H8866]]\n\n  I would like to highlight several initiatives that are important to \nmy south Florida congressional district included in the FAST Act.\n  Language was included in this bill that I offered with Representative \nTitus to protect our seniors and pedestrians in congested traffic \nareas. While total traffic crash fatalities are down nearly 25 percent \nin the last decade, pedestrian deaths are up, hurting children and the \nelderly most.\n  This language will encourage States to adopt safe and adequate \naccommodation standards for roadways and sidewalks when developing \nfuture Federal projects.\n  Also included in the FAST Act is robust funding levels for University \nTransportation Center programs, with much-welcomed increases over the \nnext 5 years.\n  One hundred twenty-five universities across the country participate \nin the UTC program, conducting critical research to develop future \ntransportation technologies. Florida International University, in my \ndistrict, is a world-recognized leader in accelerated bridge \nconstruction, and I am proud to advocate for them and all the UTCs here \nin Congress.\n  I also introduced a bill earlier this month with Representative \nLipinski that was similar to this language and appreciate all the \nbipartisan support UTCs have received.\n  Lastly, I would like to thank Chairman Gibbs and Ranking Member \nNapolitano for their work in the creation of the Water Infrastructure \nFinance and Innovation Act, or WIFIA, in last year's WRRDA legislation. \nThis is a perfect example of good government and will be truly \nrevolutionary in addressing the dire water infrastructure needs \nthroughout the country.\n  I represent Miami-Dade County, one of the 10 largest water and sewer \ndepartments in the Nation, that services 2.3 million people daily. The \n14,000 miles of pipeline date back more than 40 years, and repairs are \nmuch-needed.\n  Included in the FAST Act was a fix to the WIFIA program to allow for \nthe use of tax-exempt municipal bonds in these infrastructure projects. \nEarlier in the year, I introduced a bill with bipartisan support that \nproposed this fix, and I am grateful it was included in the FAST Act to \nallow local governments the tools necessary to repair our water \nsystems.\n  Lastly, I would like to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member \nDeFazio and their Senate counterparts for all of their hard work in \ncrafting this important legislation. This final product embodies the \nessence of bipartisanship, and I am proud to serve on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n  I urge the House and Senate to pass the FAST Act to strengthen our \nNation's transportation networks. I know my neighbors in south Florida, \nespecially those living in Kendall and South Dade, will be very \ngrateful.\n\n\n  Seventh Annual Southeast Florida Regional Climate Leadership Summit\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give accolades \nto Monroe County and the city of Key West for holding their Seventh \nAnnual Southeast Florida Regional Climate Leadership Summit.\n  For 7 years, they have created a forum for people to come together \nand discuss the importance of mitigating the effects of climate change. \nI thank them for their continued efforts and for being leaders on this \ncritical issue that warrants serious attention.\n  Like me, they believe that humans are a contributing factor to \nclimate change and that our years of living irresponsibly have caught \nup with us, leaving a blemish on our planet. They have dedicated time \nto making a positive impact on our world, and I applaud them for their \nvaliant and enduring efforts to see this task through.\n  To all the attendees of the climate summit in beautiful Key West, \nthank you for your efforts to make the world a better place.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a student in \nHomestead, Florida, Mr. Nelson Sobrino, and congratulate him on his \nrecent election as student council president of Somerset City Arts \nConservatory.\n  President Nelson, who is 13 years old, ran on a platform of adding \nadditional school spirit days and helping the less fortunate with food \nduring the holiday season.\n  The story of President Nelson's path to success at such a young age \nhas a lot to admire. In first grade, he was diagnosed with autism. \nHowever, Nelson has overcome difficult odds and has not only been a \nvery successful student academically, winning awards like ``Reading \nPlus'' for Web-based comprehension program, but has excelled socially \nas well.\n  His teachers, parents, and fellow students have been a tremendous \nsupport network and have greatly contributed to President Nelson's \nsuccess.\n  So, President Nelson, I proudly recognize your leadership of the \nstudent body of Somerset City Arts and look forward to visiting with \nyou soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8866-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8866-H8867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Garamendi) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today, the world leaders, more than 100, \nare gathered in Paris to talk about an existential threat to all of us. \nThis is not just the Syria issue, it is not just Iraq, it is not just \nterrorism, but it is about this planet's ability to continue to sustain \nlife as we know it. It is about climate change.\n  Here in Washington, it is as though it is a different universe, not \nthe universe in which we live, but a completely different one.\n  What I want to do is to basically cover this issue today of climate \nchange. Let's start with the underlying problem, the emission of carbon \ninto our atmosphere.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  For thousands and thousands of years, the atmospheric carbon has \nremained below 300 parts per million. This little spike here at the \nend--this year we reached 400 parts per million, and the consensus of \nscientists around the world is that this level of carbon will \nsignificantly increase the ambient air temperature of the world and the \ntemperatures of the ocean, having a profound effect on the world's \nability to sustain itself, like the production of food.\n  The last 2 years--2014 and this year--are going to be the hottest \never recorded in recent centuries. What does that mean? Well, it means \nthat the ice in Greenland is rapidly melting, as it is in the Arctic \nOcean as well as Antarctic. Sea levels are rising and will continue to \nrise both because of the melting ice and the warmer temperature of the \nocean, which causes the water to expand.\n  All of this is a serious problem for us if we care about the \nproduction of food and if we care about our ability to survive. Here in \nWashington, yesterday, on the floor of this House of Representatives, \nit was a different universe.\n  It was not the universe in which we live. It was not the planet on \nwhich we live. It was some very, very strange place, because yesterday \nthe majority in the House of Representatives passed two pieces of \nlegislation that would wipe out the Clean Power Act, an effort by the \nadministration to reduce the production of coal energy here in the \nUnited States.\n  Now, there is a problem in the rest of the world with the use of \ncoal, and we still have that problem here in the United States.\n  In The Washington Post yesterday there was a picture of Beijing, \nChina. You couldn't even see across the street. The article goes on to \nsay that it is principally from the production of coal.\n  So while we have a chance here in the United States--and we have been \nat this for many years, reducing the effect of coal and the production \nof coal both in terms of pollution as well as in terms of its carbon \nemissions--the House of Representatives, the majority party, yesterday \nvoted to take not a step, but to take a whole mile backwards and \neliminate the ability and the effort of this Nation to continue to \nreduce our consumption of coal and the pollution that is caused from \nthere.\n  Not only that, Mr. Speaker, but today, maybe tomorrow, we will be \ntaking up H.R. 8, a bill that would again turn us away from the world\n\n[[Page H8867]]\n\nproblem and the solutions to it and to take a mighty step back into the \nlast century. H.R. 8 is said to be energy security. Well, it is the \nsecurity of the coal and oil industry to be sure, but not the security \nof our Nation's ability to survive in a climate-changed environment.\n  It does, in fact, increase the production and the use of coal. It \ndoes, in fact, allow for the export of oil. We want to be energy \nindependent, but this legislation would allow the export of oil without \nany regulation at all and without any consideration for the American \neconomy or the American automobile user.\n  We are going in the wrong direction here. We ought to recognize, as \n120 leaders in Paris are recognizing today, that we have a serious \nclimate problem. We must address it not with the policies that we are \nseeing here on the floor of the House of Representatives this week, in \ncomplete denial of what is happening around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to wake up. It is time for us to be \naware of what is happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8867-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARTYRDOM OF SR. \n    DOROTHY KAZEL, JEAN DONOVAN, SR. ITA FORD, AND SR. MAURA CLARKE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, with great solemnity and gratitude, \ntoday I wish to honor four grace-filled women. Each of them were called \nto live their faith in the nation that bears their Savior's name. Each \nworked tirelessly to bring hope, healing, and joy to the poor of El \nSalvador. Each were bound together in tragedy on December 2, 1980.\n  Maryknoll Sisters Ita Ford and Maura Clarke, Ursuline Sister Dorothy \nKazel, and a young woman named Jean Donovan each traveled different \npaths to El Salvador. In the words of Sister Dorothy, they were united \nby a powerful sense of responsibility to ``spread the Gospel to people \nwho needed help.''\n  They sought to bring peace and comfort to vulnerable persons caught \nin a maelstrom of political turmoil on the cusp of a brutal 12-year \ncivil war that followed the 1980 murder of newly beatified Archbishop \nOscar Romero, who was killed by an assassin's bullet as he said Mass.\n  Mr. Speaker, Sister Dorothy and Jean had each joined a mission team \nfrom the diocese of Cleveland, Ohio. Together they worked to ferry food \nand medical supplies to the sick and wounded, in whom they saw the face \nof Christ.\n  Sister Dorothy had been engaged, but postponed her marriage to test a \ncall to religious life. Jean Donovan wanted to get closer to Christ in \nthe poor, though her friends hoped that she would leave El Salvador.\n  Reunited with her fiance briefly to attend a friend's wedding in \nIreland, Jean actually chose to stay in El Salvador a little bit \nlonger. She was drawn by the beauty and warmth of the Salvadoran \npeople.\n  Sister Ita and Sister Maura, both from New York and born nearly 10 \nyears apart, had each sought a life of service through the Maryknoll \nreligious sisters. Their paths led through Chile and Nicaragua, \nrespectively, and ultimately to El Salvador, where they each responded \nto Archbishop Romero's call, a plea for help.\n  It has been said of Sister Ita that ``her twinkling eyes and her \nelfin grin would surface irrepressibly, even in the midst of poverty \nand sorrow.'' Sister Maura, for her part, ``was outstanding in her \ngenerosity, always saw the good in others, and could always make those \nwhose lives she touched feel loved.''\n  Mr. Speaker, all of these women could have left. Instead, they \nremained in El Salvador to be faithful. Sister Maura said, ``There is a \nreal peace here in spite of many frustrations and the terror around us. \nGod is very present in His seeming absence.''\n  They gave all that they had to the poor and homeless, whose \ndifficulties were compounded by the counterinsurgency that \nindiscriminately leveled many innocent lives in its crossfire.\n  Mr. Speaker, while in college myself, pondering the essence and \nmeaning of things, trying to figure out my own pathway, I heard the \nnews of these women's deaths. The rape and murder of these selfless \nwomen greatly disturbed me. I remember going to Mass and, overcoming my \nown hesitancy, offered a prayer for them during the community's Prayer \nof the Faithful.\n  The love that moved these four women to fly into the eye of the \nhurricane--because they could not bear to see vulnerable people suffer \nwithout recourse, without help--profoundly affected me and remains a \npart of my life today.\n  As a Member of the United States House of Representatives, I am \nhonored to laud the example of these exceptional heroines. Having met \nwith members of El Salvador's congress, I have witnessed firsthand now \nthe work of reconciliation that is going on, the healing of lives \nhaunted by painful memories.\n  When I first learned about the decades-long outpouring of love in \nservice, vigils, prayers, and charitable programs that were inspired by \nthe example of these courageous women, I felt moved to actually take \nsome small part in these celebrations, thus this talk today.\n  In recalling their noble sacrifice, it is my fervent hope that \nresponsible nations throughout this hemisphere will see in the lives of \nthese martyrs of El Salvador a path to genuine prosperity. We can honor \nthem fittingly by embracing the truly needy with integrity, peace, and \njustice, in genuine mutual solidarity as they live their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8867-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8867-H8868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING KENTUCKY GOVERNOR STEVE BESHEAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 61st Governor of \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, Steve Beshear, whose tenure as Governor \ncomes to a close this week.\n  Of his many significant accomplishments, none came easily or by \nhappenstance. In fact, national basketball championships for both the \nUniversities of Louisville and Kentucky notwithstanding, it is tough to \nthink of a less enviable time to walk into the Governor's mansion.\n  Within a year of his taking office, the global economy imploded, \ncreating the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes and leading to \nunemployment as high as 10.7 percent. The health of our State was \ndismal, with one in five Kentucky adults carrying no health insurance. \nMother Nature didn't do him any favors either. During one 11-month \nspan, three presidential disaster declarations were issued for \nLouisville alone.\n  To say you wouldn't want to be the Governor to face those challenges \nis an understatement. To say you want Steve Beshear to be your Governor \naddressing those challenges, well, that is just common sense.\n  Our recovery didn't just happen during the tenure of Steve Beshear. \nIt happened because of Steve Beshear. Because we had a Governor who \nwasn't concerned with what was popular or politically savvy, he was \ncommitted to doing what needed to be done.\n  He said no to the calls for European-style austerity and instead \ninvested in our Commonwealth--in our people, our infrastructure, and \nour education--giving Kentucky's economy an immediate jolt and keeping \nour communities and workforce competitive for the long haul.\n  The results speak for themselves. Today unemployment is half of what \nit was during the Great Recession, under 5 percent for the first time \nsince 2001. Site Selection magazine says there is no better State in \nthe Nation for economic development.\n  Companies are investing in Kentucky like never before, $3.7 billion \nin investment announced just last year. Kentucky is doing business like \nnever before, with exports of $27.5 billion last year, four times the \nnational average.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are building like we haven't done in a long time. \nWhen I say our infrastructure was crumbling, it is not hyperbole. \nBridges were literally falling down. Now they are going up. Leaders \nhave been talking about the need for a new Ohio River bridge in \nLouisville for nearly 50 years.\n  But Governor Beshear doesn't talk the talk. He walks the walk. I will \nbe proud to walk with him across the first of two new Ohio River \nbridges for the first time this weekend.\n  But it is his stands that he will be most remembered for. If you \nasked\n\n[[Page H8868]]\n\nhim, Steve will tell you he is just doing what is right. But that takes \ncourage. Thankfully, Kentucky's Governor has had no shortage of that.\n  He reinstated an executive order prohibiting LGBT discrimination \nagainst government workers, made Kentucky the first State in the Nation \nto adopt Common Core and the second to adopt New Generation Science \nStandards.\n  When it came to medical care, he absolutely refused to play politics \nwith the health of his State. He expanded Medicaid and led the creation \nof the Nation's most successful health exchange, Kynect, and reduced \nthe number of Kentuckians without health insurance from 20.4 percent to \n9 percent, the best improvement in the Nation.\n  In my district alone, the uninsured rate dropped 81 percent. For the \nfirst time, quality, affordable health insurance is a reality for \nhundreds of thousands of Kentuckians. It is thanks to Steve Beshear.\n  Of course, he has been working for the people of Kentucky since long \nbefore he was a Governor, and he never did it alone. Throughout his \ndecades of public service, he has depended on the strength of another \ngreat Kentucky leader, his wife and our first lady, Jane Beshear.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been honored to be Steve and Jane's ally these \npast 8 years and I have been lucky to have them as mine as we worked to \nrevitalize Louisville's manufacturing sector, address our community's \ninfrastructure needs, and make sure Kentucky children, veterans, and \nworking families are taken care of.\n  Over the past 30 years, Mr. Speaker, I have had the honor of calling \nSteve Beshear my Attorney General, my Lieutenant Governor, and now my \nGovernor. But, above all, I have been most proud to call him my friend.\n  In his first inaugural address in 2007, Governor Beshear noted that \nthe path of progress in Kentucky ``will involve new thinking and new \nideas. It will require cooperation and patience. And it will demand \ncourage.''\n  Steve, you successfully embraced those new ideas, you promoted \ncooperation and patience, and you had the courage not only to serve, \nbut to serve us well. I wish you the very best as you leave public \nservice.\n  I want to thank you, First Lady Jane Beshear, and your devoted staff \nfor doing the right thing on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky.\n  Mr. Speaker, Kentucky is a stronger, more prosperous, and a far \nhealthier place because of the dedication and the work of our Governor \nSteve Beshear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8868-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT MUST BE REAUTHORIZED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \n``yes'' on the Every Student Succeeds Act, which will reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way to rectifying the problems \nthat were created by No Child Left Behind. We have seen 14 years now of \nFederal encroachment on local schools, one-size-fits-all testing, and \nlocal school districts that are not allowed to apply local solutions to \nlocal problems.\n  Mr. Speaker, the version of ESEA that is coming to the floor later \ntoday will fix these problems. The bill will streamline the annual \nassessment process and will ensure that our teachers are not required \nto teach only the material that will be on these tests. It will remove \nthe high stakes from these assessments and will ensure that school \ndistricts have the local control over the assessment process.\n  More importantly, the bill will allow States to develop their own \nacademic content and achievement standards that are designed to suit \nthe needs of their students. Teachers and administrators will be given \nthe freedom to truly educate their students and will be able to \ninnovate and develop real solutions to their problems without fear of a \nbureaucrat in Washington looking over their shoulder.\n  Mr. Speaker, though I rise in support of this bill, I must say that I \nam disappointed that the final version to come out of conference did \nnot include the text of an amendment that I offered that was adopted in \nH.R. 5, the Student Success Act.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  My amendment would have forbidden States from requiring school \ndistricts to divert Federal education dollars away from the classroom \nand into State pension funds to pay off unfunded liabilities of the \npast.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the State government is presently \nrequiring school districts that choose to use Federal education dollars \nto pay teacher salaries to divert over one-third of their Federal \neducation dollars to the State's Teachers' Retirement System to cover \npast financial mismanagement. This amounts to a Federal bailout of \nState pension programs at the expense of schools and education. Mr. \nSpeaker, this only happens in Illinois.\n  So what does this mean for the 10th District of Illinois? In 2014, \nWheeling Community Consolidated School District 21 had to send over \n$140,000 to the State to cover past pension obligations. That is 35 \npercent of the $400,000 of total Federal dollars that came to Wheeling \nthat Wheeling spent on teachers. If Wheeling had only had to pay the \nnormal pension cost, the current pension obligation, it would have had \nto have contributed $32,000. That means that Wheeling was forced to \ndivert over $100,000 to the pension system to cover past pension \nobligations at the expense of teachers in the classroom. At $40,000 per \nyear, this would have enabled them to hire an additional 2\\1/2\\ \nteachers that could have been educating our children, reducing \nclassroom sizes, and making each of our students receive the individual \nattention that they need to succeed.\n  In Waukegan, Illinois, this problem is even worse. Waukegan spent \n$2.6 million in Federal education dollars on teachers and was forced to \ndivert over $900,000 annually to the State to cover past pension \nobligations. If the Dold amendment had been law, Waukegan would have \nhad an additional $700,000 to hire more teachers, or in the case of \nDistrict 60, they would have been able to offer full-day kindergarten. \nThat makes an enormous difference in children's lives--and parents' \nlives for that matter.\n  More tragically, because Illinois does not require the same kind of \ncontribution when teacher salaries are paid with State or local \ndollars, this policy is taking away Federal education dollars from our \nneediest and most vulnerable children, precisely the students that the \nESEA was intended to help.\n  Mr. Speaker, my amendment would have fixed this problem once and for \nall and would have ensured that education dollars intended for the \nstudents of Wheeling and Waukegan and everywhere else where Federal \ndollars can make a real difference in our children's lives would have \nactually gone to help these students.\n  I will continue to fight on this issue and will continue to work with \nmy colleagues to make sure that the Federal dollars that are given to \nschool districts are not diverted away from the neediest to cover up \nfinancial mistakes of the past.\n  Mr. Speaker, Every Student Succeeds Act is by no means a perfect \nbill, but it is a significant upgrade and a step forward that goes a \nlong way toward fixing the problems posed by No Child Left Behind.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill and ensure that our \nchildren's getting the education they deserve is something that we can \nall count on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8868-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8868-H8869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WAR ON COAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, as we hear talk of bills on the floor and \ninternational climate meetings with the world community, I want to \nbring to my colleagues' attention and to you, Mr. Speaker, the real \ndestruction that is going on in the fossil fuel areas of our Nation, \none that I represent, the Illinois coal basin.\n  I want to start by quoting the mayor of a town named Galatia in two \narticles from the paper called The Southern. In a November 5 article, \nhe basically says: ``Without the coal mines, we are going to be in dire \nstraits. That's all there is to it.''\n  The mayor is referring to what we have come to the floor numerous \ntimes to talk about, and you actually heard\n\n[[Page H8869]]\n\nit from my colleague today, the war on coal, the intent by this \nadministration to take coal out of the portfolio of electricity \ngeneration--and, really, any other fossil fuel they can get their hands \non, whether it be crude oil or whether they will then move to natural \ngas.\n  Later on, the mayor, in another article from the same paper, on \nNovember 12, says because the New Era Mine in Galatia is now going to \nclose, this closure, `` `It impacts everybody,' said David Harrawood, \nthe village's mayor. `It doesn't just impact coal miners. It impacts \ntrucking businesses, the stores, all their vendors. It's not just one \nsegment. Down here, we're all tied together.' ''\n  So that is the human toll of the war on coal. The human toll is lost \njobs, lost benefits, bankruptcies, which then creates a risk to the \npromised pension payments to the retirees. It becomes a loss of revenue \nto the taxing districts, to the counties, to the villages, to the first \nline responders, support for our schools. It dries up the ability for \nthe local grocery store to operate, the local hardware store, and it \nis, as the mayor has said, devastating to southern Illinois.\n  Now, when you hear the debate internationally, it is carbon dioxide, \nCO2. In fact, I always talk in the committee about then-\nSenator Obama and his quote to the San Francisco Chronicle, when he was \ninterviewed by the editorial board, when he was asked about climate and \nhis plan, and here is his quote. You can YouTube it. It is easily \naccessible. ``So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they \ncan; It's just that it will bankrupt them.''\n  That has been the plan since 2008. That has been the plan in the \nfirst 4 years of his administration, and that is what he is striving to \ndo, pushing with all his force to not only do here in the United \nStates, but do in an international venue. He is being successful, as we \nfind out in the announcement of the closure of the mine in Galatia.\n  The total number of coal mines opening each year has fallen to its \nlowest point in at least a decade. The total number of operating coal \nmines has hit its lowest point on record, according to the Energy \nInformation Administration, which has records back to 1923. At the \nbeginning of the Obama administration, over half the Nation's \nelectricity came from coal. That number is down to 38 percent as of \n2014.\n  Now remember, coal is the most efficient, the cheapest source of \nelectricity generation and creates a baseload capacity that is very \ncritical to keep the lights on. If you lose the baseload generation and \nyou rely on renewables, you really do risk keeping the lights on, and \nyou assure the Nation of higher costs of electricity.\n  So that is the war on coal, and that is kind of where we are right \nnow with the administration.\n  So what has been the response on the floor of the House? What have we \ndone? Well, fortunately, yesterday we took a parliamentary procedure \nand a process called the Congressional Review Act to address the \nability of the administration to try to promulgate regulations without \nthe authority of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8869-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Most important, I am worried that a terrorist could slip \nthrough, just like one of the terrorists involved in Paris.\n  But we also can't lose sight of another vulnerability, a geographical \nvulnerability, our southern border, because our border is not secure. \nThis President refuses to secure it.\n  Yesterday, I spoke with the director of the Texas Department of \nPublic Safety, Steve McCraw, and he made it very clear that we are \nseeing another surge at the border. We are seeing folks from Syria come \nacross. This is troubling and wrong.\n  The President must secure our border and protect our national \nsecurity. If he refuses, we in this Congress must stop him by any means \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8869-8", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NO POLICY RIDERS\n\n  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, weeks ago, this body avoided a government \nshutdown by passing the Bipartisan Budget Act. Now we have to pass an \nomnibus.\n  Unfortunately, many of our appropriations bills contain divisive \npolicy riders that threaten to create another partisan standoff. There \nis an appropriate time and place to debate these provisions: in the \nauthorizing committees.\n  It seems that some Members have learned nothing from the \nbrinksmanship that almost led to a government shutdown. It is hard \nenough to pass these measures without these divisive, controversial \nriders. We need to put the unnecessary fighting behind us.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Act represents a chance for us to return to \nreasonable compromises and regular order. I call upon my colleagues to \nfollow up on that accomplishment and pass a clean omnibus package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8869-9", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8869-H8870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.

Ezra was spending his gap year studying at a yeshiva \nin Israel and was one of the three people shot and killed last week by \na Palestinian terrorist.\n  The continued violent attacks targeting Israeli civilians are, \nwithout qualification or exception, acts of terror and deserve full \ncondemnation. Attacks on innocent civilians, whether they are American, \nIsraeli, or Palestinian, have zero justification, and our response to \nsuch terrorism cannot be silence.\n  My heart and prayers go out to the friends and family of Ezra, and we \nhonor those whose lives have been lost by such hateful actions.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in remembering the young life of Ezra \nSchwartz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8870-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE RECENT ATTACK IN COLORADO SPRINGS\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, a Planned Parenthood clinic \nin Colorado Springs became the target of the 351st mass shooting in the \nUnited States this year.\n  Three people were killed: an Iraq war veteran, a mother of two, and a \nlocal police officer. They are now among the more than 12,000 Americans \nwho have died in gun-related incidents since the start of the year.\n  The shooter in Colorado Springs is reported to have used a \nsemiautomatic, AK-47-style firearm, an assault weapon that has its \norigins in Stalin's Soviet Army.\n  This firearm and others like it are weapons of war, not tools for \nself-defense. They serve no purpose other than to kill. And we can no \nlonger permit the proliferation of and easy access to these weapons in \nthe United States.\n  That is why, in the coming weeks, I will be introducing legislation \nthat reauthorizes the Assault Weapons Ban. During the 10 years this ban \nwas in effect, localities reported as much as a 72-percent decline in \ngun crimes involving assault weapons.\n  Today, 59 percent of American voters support a ban on the purchase of \nsemiautomatic and assault weapons. The only thing that stands in the \nway is Congress' failure to act.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Displaced Jobs Relief Act of 2015, a bill I introduced \nyesterday to help small businesses that have been hurt by foreign \ncompetition.\n  As the Inland Empire of California fights back from the Great \nRecession, we need to make sure that we use every tool available to \nhelp our small businesses recover.\n  Small businesses were dealt heavy blows in the past decade, both from \nour weakened economy and from our flawed trade agreements. \nInternational trade plays an important role in our economy, but history \nhas taught us that not all agreements are fair. Sometimes they take a \ntoll on local businesses that don't have the ability to handle unfair \nforeign competition.\n  That is why I introduced this bill. Trade Adjustment Assistance has \nplayed a crucial role in retraining and placing Americans in good-\npaying jobs for generations. If we increase the availability of funds, \nwe can help protect hardworking Americans from losing business to \nunfair competition overseas.\n  My bill would increase the authorization for TAA for businesses up to \n$50 million for each fiscal year, beginning in 2016 and running through \n2021.\n  Historically, these programs have always authorized $50 million a \nyear, and, in fiscal year 2011, House Republicans cut the levels to $16 \nmillion, barely 30 percent of what funding was.\n  This is an important program that can help businesses in the Inland \nEmpire and across the Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support me \nand the Displaced Jobs Relief Act for 2015 for the sake of American \nworkers and businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8870-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8870-H8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE LIFE OF SHERIFF AL ST.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Chatham \nCounty Sheriff Al St. Lawrence.\n\n[[Page H8871]]\n\n  Last Tuesday, Sheriff St. Lawrence died after a long fight with \ncancer. He was 81 years old. He was a dedicated law enforcement \nprofessional for Chatham County for over 50 years, 23 of those years \nspent as sheriff.\n  A U.S. Air Force veteran, he joined the Chatham County Police \nDepartment in 1959, after leaving the service. He was appointed to the \nState Peace Officers Standards and Training Council twice. He was named \nPolice Chief of the Year three times during his tenure.\n  In 1992, he ran for sheriff and won, being reelected five times. In \nhis 20 years as sheriff, he oversaw numerous changes to the department, \nincluding the construction of a new jail.\n  He was a gentleman, a professional, and a mentor. He was a man of few \nwords and believed in personal responsibility. He loved the Sheriff's \nDepartment, and he loved the people that worked there.\n  I commend Sheriff Al St. Lawrence for years of service to his country \nand to the Chatham County Sheriff Department. We should all strive to \nachieve the success and admiration that Sheriff St. Lawrence achieved \nthrough his years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8871-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INJUSTICE FOR LAQUAN McDONALD\n\n  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, we have seen an uproar over the death of \nLaquan McDonald, and rightfully so. But, sadly, the injustice for \nLaquan goes much deeper.\n  Laquan McDonald suffered more tragedy in his short life than anyone \nshould have to bear. As a child, Laquan was abused at home. He was then \nhanded over to the Department of Children and Family Services, where he \nwas sexually molested, not just once but in two different foster homes.\n  At 17 years old, Laquan was shot 16 times by an on-duty police \nofficer. Even after death, the injustice continued. It took 400 days \nbefore the officer who shot Laquan faced charges.\n  We should all be ashamed at how our society failed Laquan McDonald.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues that Black lives \nmatter, that Laquan McDonald's life matters, and justice matters. We \nshould all be working to ensure that Laquan gets the justice that he \nhas been denied for so long and to end the cycle of poverty, abuse, and \ninjustice that shaped his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8871-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                           MEDICAL DEVICE TAX\n\n  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. STEFANIK.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss our country's \nongoing efforts in Afghanistan.\n  Over Thanksgiving, I had the honor to join five of our other \ncolleagues from the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for a trip to \nspend the holiday with our outstanding service men and women in Kabul, \nKandahar, and Bagram Air Force base.\n  Additionally, we received numerous briefings from senior military, \nState Department, and intelligence officials. We heard about the \nmultitude of challenges facing the young democracy in Afghanistan, \nranging from hard security challenges emanating from the Taliban, al \nQaeda, and even ISIL, to societal challenges in a country with 92 \npercent illiteracy.\n  This is now primarily an Afghan fight with just over 9,800 American \ntroops remaining in the country. However, the threat of international \nterrorism and the need to ensure that the country never again becomes a \nhaven for those seeking to target the United States means that we will \nneed to have a presence in Afghanistan for some time to come.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was encouraged by the dedication of the men and women \nin uniform who continue to demonstrate their commitment to our mission. \nI was also encouraged by the resolve\n\n[[Page H8872]]\n\ndemonstrated by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to reduce corruption and \nrebuild the economy.\n  Make no mistake, Afghanistan faces many challenges in the years \nahead. But with the help of the United States of America, the \ninternational community, the tenacity of the Afghan leaders, and some \ngood luck, the Afghan people can hope for peace and greater prosperity \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8872-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RULES OF ENGAGEMENT: NO CLIMATE CASUALTIES\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, bullet holes are still visible in the \nwalls of cafes, and the graves are fresh for those lives that were \nstolen by ISIS fighters in the streets of Paris. Meanwhile, the \nPresident is in Paris talking about his priority--the real threat--\nclimate change.\n  While America has been unable or unwilling to defeat ISIS, it has \nbeen front and center in the war on climate change. Former CIA Director \nMike Morrell said: ``And we didn't go after oil wells--actually hitting \noil wells that ISIS controls because we didn't want to do environmental \ndamage. . . .''\n  The President has decided that the threat to the environment is more \nserious to him than the threat of ISIS terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, oil funds ISIS' murderous reign of terror, but the \nPresident's new limited war doctrine has one rule of engagement: no \nclimate casualties.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for bombs to rain down over the ISIS war \nchest. Stop the flow of the blood oil. Not one more life should be lost \nbecause of a negligent and backwards strategy of a limited war based on \nclimate change, an environmental-waged war that promotes not harming \nthe environment over harming people.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8872-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Ms. ESTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House rose once again to \nobserve a moment of silence for victims of gun violence, this time for \nthe police officer, the veteran, and the mother of two who were gunned \ndown in Colorado Springs nearly 3 years after 20 schoolchildren and 6 \nbrave educators were shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School in \nmy district. It is time for moments of silence to end. It is time for \naction.\n  Gun violence is a public health crisis that deserves this House to \ntake action now. That is why we should establish a select committee on \ngun violence prevention.\n  We are all understandably concerned about terrorism; yet, this House \njust yesterday blocked action to prevent terrorists, those on the \nTerrorist Watchlist, from acquiring deadly weapons to kill Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for this House to truly honor victims of gun \nviolence. I invite my colleagues to join us next week for the 3rd \nAnnual National Vigil to Prevent Gun Violence on Wednesday, December 9. \nThe vigil will be held at St. Mark's Church on Capitol Hill.\n  Please come and join me.

Mr. Speaker, to realize their American Dream, \nmany Minnesotans rely on access to financial products like business \nloans and mortgages. Not only do these financial instruments benefit \nindividuals and families, but they help build healthy communities.\n  Unfortunately, in some rural and urban areas, outdated regulations \nthreaten the ability of our community banks to offer these important \nfinancial products.\n  Together with Congresswoman Gwen Moore, I have introduced legislation \nthat will address this problem. H.R. 4116 allows certain community \nbanks to trade large bank deposits over a secure network.\n  This will enable depositors to do business with local community banks \nwhile still maintaining FDIC insurance instead of seeing important and \nnecessary financial capital that could be used for local projects, \npurchases, and investment leave local communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is good for Minnesota. And please \nforgive my bias, but I happen to believe what is good for Minnesota is \ngood for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8872-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FIGHTING FOR WORKING AMERICANS\n\n  (Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are willing to shut down \ngovernment in a battle to protect riders that hurt working-class \nAmericans.\n  During these budget and appropriation debates, Republicans have \nfought tooth and nail to cut investments in important programs for \nworking families, yet they are willing to spend billions on tax \nexpenditures for wealthy corporations.\n  On top of that, Mr. Speaker, they want to add riders that gut \nconsumer protections, labor rights, environmental protections, and a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  A recent poll found that nearly seven in ten Americans agree with the \nfollowing statement: ``I feel angry because our political system seems \nto only be working for the insiders with money and power.''\n  As Members of Congress, I urge colleagues on all sides to come \ntogether and heed the American people's wishes and to put their \ninterests up front. We need to make sure that we can pass a budget bill \nthat isn't loaded up with policy riders and more things that would \nconfuse the basic issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot abide proposals attacking the National Labor \nRelations Board and a worker's right to organize.

Mr. Speaker, let's get our priorities straight when it \ncomes to American leadership. Rather than showing leadership in the \nfight against ISIS or reassuring our allies in this fight, our current \nadministration is still claiming that our greatest threat to national \nsecurity is, believe it or not, climate change.\n  I am all about science, but we need to be realistic as well. The \nbiggest threat, according to them, isn't radical Islam, Russia, Iran, \nor North Korea. It is a couple of degrees Fahrenheit over the next \ncentury or so.\n  And the remedy is costly. At a cost to whom? At a cost to hardworking \nAmericans. Their government mandates mean higher energy costs for \nfamilies, less energy reliability, higher manufacturing costs, and \nsmaller take-home paychecks.\n  I know that most Ohio families can't afford this, Mr. Speaker. Coal \nplants are already shutting down up and down the Ohio River, costing us \njobs and reliable energy. We need American leadership that is willing \nto lead the fight and defeat ISIS.\n  This week, the House voted to protect American families and consumers \nfrom the administration's price hikes.

Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attacks in Paris reminded us \nthat ISIS recruits fighters from across the globe and even here at \nhome. Already, the FBI has arrested over 60 Americans connected with \nISIS.\n  The terrorists who attacked Paris got their guns from the black \nmarket. But here in the United States, even suspected terrorists are \nallowed, under Federal law, to freely and legally buy assault weapons, \nbuy guns, and buy explosives.\n  The GAO reports that, in the last decade, suspects on the FBI's \nterrorist watch list attempted to buy guns and explosives over 2,200 \ntimes. And guess what; 91 percent of the time they succeeded.\n  Now, I know that the gun lobby opposes any effort to toughen \nbackground checks; but can we not, at the very least, agree that this \nis a matter of national security, that when the FBI has reasonable \nsuspicion that someone is connected to terror, we should stop him from \nbuying weapons of mass murder?\n  To any of my colleagues on the floor today, is there anyone in \nCongress who actually believes that you should be able to buy a gun \nwhile on the terrorist watch list? Is there anyone in America who \nbelieves that?\n  If you are on the terrorist watch list, you shouldn't buy a gun. Can \nthis body please take this meaningful step to protect American \nfamilies. Let's put it to a vote, and let's do it before we leave here \nfor the holidays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8873-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING OFFICER LLOYD REED\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS.

She was the first majority party African American candidate \nand the first Democratic woman to run for President. She was also a \nfounding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Congresswoman Chisholm--or Mrs. C, as we called her--was my mentor \nand role model. The course of my life changed, when I met Congresswoman \nShirley Chisholm, as a student in Mills College. At that time, I was \nthe Black Student Union president, and I had invited her to speak her \neloquent speech focused on the power of women and people of color to \nchange the world. As she said: If you don't have a seat at the table, \nbring a folding chair. She explained why it was important for everyone \nto get involved in the policymaking process, because too often the \nvoices of women and people of color are unheard.\n  I know that today many of us, including myself, would not be here. We \nwould not have the privilege to serve in this great body had it not \nbeen for Shirley Chisolm. She is truly deserving of our Nation's \nhighest honor.\n  I would also want to wish Mrs. C a very happy belated birthday.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's finalized Renewable Fuel Standard, \notherwise known as the RFS.\n  The biofuels industry has created good-paying, technical jobs in \nrural economies, helped lower gas prices for consumers, protected the \nenvironment, and reduced reliance on foreign oil.\n  On Monday of this week, the EPA finalized RFS levels for 2014, 2015, \nand 2016. While they are a slight improvement from the proposed rule, \nthey still fall short of congressional intent put into law in 2007. \nUnfortunately, this decision raises questions about the \nadministration's commitment to rural\n\n[[Page H8874]]\n\nAmerica and domestic biofuels. Despite public assurances to support the \nbiofuels economy, the EPA has done just the opposite.\n  The disconnect is startling. A reduction in RFS levels increases \nuncertainty and stifles investment in the advanced biofuels sector. We \nshould all be concerned by the precedent this decision sets for other \nrenewable energy sources. It allows the administration to ignore the \nfacts and the law in order to set a standard of its choosing.\n  The RFS is working. It is time the EPA started listening to the \npeople impacted by their rules and regulations.\n  I am committed to supporting the biofuels industry, its producers, \nits farmers, and its consumers, and to continue fighting against any \nattempts to undermine it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8874-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD SUCCEEDS ACT\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak today about what the \nHouse will face on educational changes in bringing forward S. 1177, the \nEvery Child Succeeds Act, which takes us away from No Child Left \nBehind.\n  I am very delighted that the Jackson Lee amendment offered during the \nHouse consideration of the bill dealing with bullying is now in this \nbill. It is now the law of the land once we pass it. It supports \naccountability-based programs and activities that are designed to \nenhance school safety, which may include research-based bullying \nprevention, cyberbullying prevention, disruption of recruitment \nactivity by groups or individuals involved in violent extremism, and \ngang prevention programs as well as intervention programs.\n  CNN had a report just last night, I believe, that talked about the \nextensiveness of cyberbullying. One in seven students in grades K-12 is \neither a bully or a victim of it; 90 percent of fourth to eighth grade \nstudents report being victims of bullying; 56 percent of students have \npersonally witnessed some type of bullying; 71 percent of students \nreport incidents of bullying as a problem; 15 percent of all students \nwho don't show up for school report they have been bullied; 1 out of 20 \nstudents has seen a student with a gun at a school; and 282,000 \nstudents are physically attacked in secondary schools each month. This \nis something that is a key part of education. To be in an education \nenvironment where you want to learn and where you are protected is key.\n  Let me ask everyone to support this legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of \nHoward Henderson, a man who was cherished by many throughout southern \nArizona.\n  Howard moved to Douglas, Arizona, in 1984, when he became the owner \nand president of KDAP-FM and KAPR-AM radio stations. He wasted no time \nmaking his mark, both on the air and in the community.\n  Howard hosted ``The Trading Post'' morning show, one of the most \npopular and listened-to shows in the area. He broadcasted over 1,000 \nhigh school games and supported community events, including serving on \nthe local fair board. His on-air personality and active presence in \nDouglas earned him the nickname, Mr. Wonderful.\n  I got to know Howard over recent years. Like many, I was touched by \nhis professionalism, his grace, and his dedication to the community.\n  On November 20, Howard passed away, after battling cancer, at the age \nof 65. We will miss hearing his voice on the airwaves and seeing his \nsmiling face around Douglas, but we will never forget his impact on \nsouthern Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8874-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8874-H8875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING JEFFERSON COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY JERROD RIGDON\n\n  (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. GRAHAM.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 542 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 542\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for further \n     consideration of the bill (H.R. 8) to modernize energy \n     infrastructure, build a 21st century energy and manufacturing \n     workforce, bolster America's energy security and diplomacy, \n     and promote energy efficiency and government accountability, \n     and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 542 provides for a rule to \ncontinue consideration of the comprehensive energy legislation on which \nthe House began its work yesterday.\n  The rule makes in order 38 amendments to be considered on the House \nfloor, 22 of which are sponsored by Democratic Members of the House, 12 \nof which are sponsored by Republicans, and 4 of which were submitted as \nbipartisan amendments.\n  Further, the minority will be afforded the standard motion to \nrecommit--a final opportunity to amend the bill prior to its passage.\n  H. Res. 542 further provides for a rule to consider the conference \nreport to S. 1177, the Student Success Act, which will move the \ncountry's education system beyond No Child Left Behind and return the \nresponsibility of educating our children to local and State \nauthorities, where it appropriately belongs.\n  As with all conference reports brought before the House, the rule \nprovides that debate on the measure will be conducted under the \nstanding rules of the House and will further provide for a motion to \nrecommit, allowing the minority yet another opportunity to amend the \nlegislation before its final passage.\n  The amendments that the Rules Committee made in order allow the House \nto weigh in on a number of important issues within the sphere of energy \npolicy, from crude oil exports, to the Federal Government's policy on \nfossil fuel usage, to siting and regulatory reforms at the Department \nof Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  I do wish to highlight an amendment that unfortunately was not made \nin order, one that I submitted to the Rules Committee, as well, during \nthe markup of H.R. 8 in Energy and Commerce.\n  It has become clear to me, having worked on the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee over the past 10 years, that the authority given to the \nDepartment of Energy to regulate and mandate efficiency standards in \nconsumer products was both initially misguided and ultimately has \nproven to be cumbersome and unworkable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have always been a strong believer in energy \nefficiency. However, government-mandated efficiency standards have \nproven to be the wrong approach.\n  For this reason, I submitted an amendment to repeal the Federal \nenergy conservation standards, which dictate how energy efficient \nconsumer products must be before they can be sold in the United States.\n  These mandates cover products from light bulbs--and, on this, we have \nsuccessfully blocked it due to overwhelming public outrage--to ceiling \nfans, to air conditioners, to heaters, to furnaces. The list goes on \nand on.\n  The Federal Government should not be setting these standards. \nCompanies and, more importantly, their customers should be the driving \nforce in this decision. This is about letting the free market drive \ninnovation and technological advances. The government should trust the \npeople to make the right decisions when it comes to the products that \nthey buy.\n  When the government sets the efficiency standard for a product, that \noften becomes the ceiling. When the market drives the standard, there \nis no limit to how fast and how aggressive manufacturers will \nultimately be when consumers demand more efficient and better products.\n  Mr. Speaker, government standards have proven to be unworkable. Every \nsingle time the Department of Energy proposes to set a new efficiency \nstandard for any product, manufacturers run to their Members of \nCongress, asking us to sign letters to the Department of Energy to \nimplore them not to set unworkable standards. It is a predictable \noccurrence for every rule.\n  Even in H.R. 8, we are conceding that the Department of Energy is \nmoving in the wrong direction with furnace standards, and Congress has \nto step in and mitigate. In fact, Congress should be getting out of the \nway of the relationship between companies and their customers.\n  How many times during the appropriations process are we asked to vote \non amendments blocking the Department of Energy from regulating \nconsumer products because the Federal Government does not understand \nhow to run a business? Instead of that approach, we should be removing \nthe Department of Energy's authority altogether.\n  The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution was meant as a \nlimitation on Federal power. The Framers intended that clause to be \nused to ensure that commerce could flow freely among the several \nStates. It was never intended to allow the Federal Government to \nmicromanage everyday consumer products.\n  If the clause were truly meant to be that expansive, then the 10th \nAmendment would be meaningless. There would be no authority left to \nreserve to the States. This view of the Commerce Clause was reaffirmed \nmost recently by\n\n[[Page H8876]]\n\nthe Supreme Court in the National Federation of Independent Business v. \nSebelius.\n  The Commerce Clause does not and cannot extend so far as to allow the \nFederal Government to regulate products that do not pose a risk to \nhealth or safety. There is a place for the FDA to regulate safe food \nand drugs and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to \nregulate the safety of cars on the roads, but to give the Federal \nGovernment the authority to regulate how efficient a product should be \nreally seems to cross a constitutional line.\n  Congress has already stepped in to block the Department of Energy \nfrom setting efficiency standards for light bulbs--not because Congress \ngained wisdom. It was because the American people understood clearly \nthat this was government overreach at its worst, and they demanded it \nbe fixed.\n  But the same can and should be said about every consumer product that \nthe Department of Energy has been given the authority to regulate in \nthe efficiency space. From light bulbs, to furnaces, to air \nconditioners, to ceiling fans, the Department of Energy should not be \ntelling manufacturers how to make their products.\n  I also want to say one thing about the amendment to H.R. 8 that was \nsubmitted by the Representative from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis), which was \nalso, unfortunately, not made in order.\n  This amendment was based, in part, on a series of GAO studies that I \nand Senator Markey had commissioned to study the Department of Energy's \nmanagement of uranium issues and its impact on the domestic uranium \nmining industry.\n  It is a critical issue for those of us from Western States. And it is \nmy hope, as this body continues to work to protect that industry from \nfurther legally suspect actions by the Department of Energy, that Mrs. \nLummis' wishes will be achieved.\n  The education conference report, known as the Every Student Succeeds \nAct, is a bipartisan compromise to reauthorize and reform our education \nsystem.\n  For the past 13 years, our students and our schools have been \nstruggling to meet the rigorous and often unrealistic demands of No \nChild Left Behind.\n  No Child Left Behind attempted to improve school accountability by \nconditioning increased funding on annual testing requirements and pass \nrates. One hundred percent of students were supposed to be proficient \nby 2014, with failing schools being required to restructure under \nFederal guidelines.\n  A vote against the Every Student Succeeds Act today is a vote to keep \nNo Child Left Behind in place, to keep the onerous average yearly \nprogress standards in place, and to keep the high-stakes testing in \nplace that so many of our constituents deplore.\n  This compromise, which was worked out in committee, is a vast \nimprovement. It is not a perfect bill by any stretch, but it is a vast \nimprovement. And, really, for the first time, it moves control back \ninto the hands of States and local districts, where it belongs.\n  It eliminates the waiver process by repealing the adequate yearly \nprogress Federal accountability system. For years, school boards in my \ndistrict have been requesting relief from having to obtain waivers from \nthe Department of Education.\n  This bill will allow local districts to set their own testing \nrequirements and standards to determine whether a student or a school \nis struggling as well as how to improve.\n  Common Core incentives are eliminated. Let me repeat that. Common \nCore incentives are eliminated.\n  The Federal Government created the Federal education regulations and \nmandated their adoption by withholding funds from schools. This \nintervention is another example of the Federal Government's prescribing \nits best practices over those schools and teachers who, every day, get \nup and go to work to do their best. They know their students. They know \nhow best to teach them. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, this \nstops.\n  This bill also provides States with new funding flexibility by \nallowing States to determine how to spend their Federal dollars--on \naverage, 7 percent per year. In my State, this is more than $225 \nmillion annually that the State will be able to allocate in the most \neffective and the most efficient way possible.\n  This bill is a 4-year authorization. That is an important point. \nRegardless of how you feel about the current administration, it will \nnot be the current administration in 4 years' time. That will allow the \nnext administration, whoever he or she may be, the opportunity to \nbetter evaluate education programs and, my hope is, to continue to \nreduce the Federal role for our students, schools, and teachers in \nTexas and throughout the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am glad the gentleman got to education. We heard 9 or 10 minutes \nabout this corporate welfare energy bill, which is not going anywhere, \nand it is the reason that I don't think there will be any Democrats \nsupporting this rule. But, yes, in this rule is also a wonderful \neducation bill that we are very excited about, and I think we have many \nDemocrats who will want to tell you about it here today. It is exciting \nto reach this point.\n  I share the frustration of teachers, of parents, of students across \nthe country with No Child Left Behind. I was on the State Board of \nEducation in Colorado from 2001 to 2007 when we implemented No Child \nLeft Behind. We saw many of the flaws at that time.\n  We knew the fallacy of the formula for adequate yearly progress, and \nit was set up in such a way that all schools would eventually fail. We \nsaw the rigid structure that could even inhibit State and district \ninnovation.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  I am proud to say today that the bill under this rule is a major step \nforward. For those who are thinking of opposing it, realize that, in \nopposing it, you are ensuring that No Child Left Behind will continue \nexactly as it is.\n  There is never a perfect alternative. I am sure, if each of us had \nthe opportunity to write our own education bill, we would have 435 \ndifferent bills.\n  What we have before us is a good, realistic compromise that can \nreplace No Child Left Behind with a new Federal education law. It is \nsomething that is long overdue for the kids of this country, something \nthat will be a boost in morale to teachers and educators in this \ncountry, and something that will encourage innovation at the State and \ndistrict level. I will talk about some of those provisions that do just \nthat.\n  Just a few weeks ago I met with some teachers and students at Rocky \nMountain High School in Fort Collins, Colorado. They expressed their \nfrustration with what has become everyday challenges in K-12 schools \nand how detached our No Child Left Behind law from 15 years ago is with \nthe realities of education today.\n  Teachers are spending less time teaching and more time administering \nhigh-stakes test or teaching of the test. Students are spending less \ntime learning. As a result, schools have less time to focus on teaching \nreal skills that students need to be ready for college or to be ready \nfor careers in technical education after high school.\n  Unfortunately, schools across my district and the country have been \nexperiencing the same frustrations as the teachers and students at \nRocky Mountain High who I met with a couple weeks ago.\n  These frustrations are in many ways the result of the outdated \neducation law, No Child Left Behind, which passed in 2001, which was \nwell intentioned, but imposed a one-size-fits-all accountability \nsystem, a flawed one at that, on a diverse set of States and districts \nacross our country.\n  That is why I am so excited to be here on the floor of the House with \nthe opportunity to speak about the new conference report, the new \nbipartisan, bicameral ESEA Reauthorization, the Every Student Succeeds \nAct, which passed 39-1 in our conference committee.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and \nthe other conferees in replacing No Child Left Behind with Every \nStudent Succeeds Act.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act is the result of years of work by both \nChambers. Former Ranking Member and former Chair George Miller, former \nRanking Member and Chair Buck McKeon, current Chair Mr. Kline, and\n\n[[Page H8877]]\n\nMr. Scott have worked tirelessly, along with their staffs, over years \nto be able to put together something that both Democrats and \nRepublicans can feel good about. Because guess what. We both care about \nkids. We both care about education. It is not a partisan issue.\n  Now, we might have our differences about how to improve our schools. \nLet's put all those good ideas on the table. And they were. And they \nwere voiced. We were able to build and improve deeply upon the highly \nflawed first version of this bill that the House passed, which would \nhave taken Federal dollars away from the poorest schools and given it \nto wealthier schools.\n  The House-passed bill would have completely failed students with \ndisabilities by allowing unlimited students to have no accountability \nby classifying them as students with disabilities for alternative \nassessments, sweeping under the rug the tremendous amount of progress \nthat students with disabilities have made since No Child Left Behind.\n  The first version of the bill didn't establish any accountability for \ngraduation or proficiency rates or any parameters for interventions to \nensure that we could improve struggling schools.\n  Now, when the Every Student Succeeds Act finally passed the House, it \nbarely passed. It passed in a purely partisan manner. No Democrats \nsupported the bill, and many Republicans didn't support the bill.\n  Now, the silver lining of that is that it allowed the process to move \nforward. I am proud to say, after months of hard work by the staff and \nthe chair and ranking member, the conference committee has succeeded in \nreporting out a bill that I believe is better than the Senate bill, \nbetter than the House bill, and certainly better than No Child Left \nBehind.\n  When the conferees met, several Members offered thoughtful amendments \nthat built upon and improved the conference framework even more. For \nexample, Mr. Messer offered an amendment that would allow funds to be \nused to educate teachers about best practices for student data privacy.\n  I offered a successful amendment that increases dual and concurrent \nenrollment opportunities for English language learners, something near \nand dear to my heart as the founder of the New America School charter \nschool network.\n  The conference committee took the framework and turned it into a \nrobust bill that replaces No Child Left Behind with a system that works \nbetter for students, for educators, for families, and for schools.\n  When ESEA was first passed in 1965, first and foremost, it was seen \nproperly as a critical piece of civil rights legislation. For the first \ntime, the Federal Government was making a commitment that every child, \nregardless of race, background, or ZIP Code, deserved a great education \nto prepare them for success.\n  Any reauthorization of ESEA needs to uphold that same commitment to \ncivil rights that was established in 1965. While the Every Student \nSucceeds Act isn't perfect, I believe that it upholds that commitment \nto civil rights that is such an important role for the Federal \nGovernment to play.\n  Most importantly, the Every Student Succeeds Act includes strong \naccountability provisions that ensure that underimproving schools are \nidentified and improved.\n  Now, title I in Every Student Succeeds Act has come a long way from \nthe original House bill. The number of Members in the House, including \nthose in the new Democratic coalition and the Tri-Caucus, demanded \nstronger accountability provisions in the conference report. I am very \nhappy to see that the conference report has delivered.\n  Specifically, the Every Student Succeeds Act maintains annual \nstatewide assessments, which gives States, districts, teachers, and \nparents valuable information about how students are performing and the \ntools they need to improve student performance. This data will be \nbroken down by subgroup, by race, by socioeconomic status, to ensure \nthat no students are swept under the rug.\n  This bill includes a clear framework for identifying consistently \nlow-performing schools and provides resources and ensures that States \nintervene to improve them. It fully maintains our promise to parents of \nstudents with disabilities, the promise that schools will be \naccountable to ensure that their child is learning and that the unique \nlearning needs of their children are met.\n  To be clear, these requirements are not the same top-down, one-size-\nfits-all accountability provisions of No Child Left Behind. The one-\nsize-fits-all formula of adequate yearly progress is rightfully gone. \nThe accountability provisions in Every Student Succeeds Act creates a \nframework for States as they create their own meaningful accountability \nplans.\n\n  This means that States can be flexible and innovative to create \nspecific policies that work for them. It is a challenge to States to \nrise to the occasion in meeting the learning needs of all students \nwhile maintaining those Federal rails to ensure that no child is left \nout.\n  This bill provides additional flexibility around testing by allowing \nhigh-quality, Federally recognized tests to also meet the annual \ntesting requirements in high school. In my district, high schoolers \ntake the Colorado State test, the ACT, and, if necessary, AP or IB \nexams. That is a lot of testing in the final years of high school.\n  This new flexibility would mean that a pending application that \nColorado has for the ACT to stand in place of the Colorado State test \nwould be specifically allowed in statute under this bill, and I \ncouldn't be more proud of that provision.\n  This bill also maintains strong support for high-quality charter \nschools, something that I have made a hallmark of my time here in \nCongress and have been a coauthor of bills that have passed this body \noverwhelmingly. That charter school language is reflected in this bill.\n  The language would improve charter school access and service for all \nstudents, give new and innovative charter schools those tools they need \nto meet their goal of serving at-risk and diverse students that ensure \nthat our limited Federal investment supports the replication and \nexpansion of high-quality, innovative charter schools.\n  Before I came to Congress, I founded two public charter school \nnetworks. I know the freedom to innovate and the flexibility to pursue \na unique mission within public education can help charter schools \nsucceed at the highest levels.\n  This bill also contains a commitment to education technology and \ninnovation. The Investing in Innovation program has also been one of my \ntop priorities in this bill.\n  In Colorado, the St. Vrain Valley School District, which I represent \na good portion of, received a $3.6 million innovation grant to expand \nprograms for at-risk kids in seven schools.\n  Because of that grant, St. Vrain was able to extend the school year \nat four elementary schools that serve at-risk kids, target math \nstudents at risk of failing at two middle schools that implement the \nSTEM Academy at Skyline High School. I couldn't be more proud of this \nprovision.\n  Now, this rule also has a corporate welfare giveaway to the oil and \ngas industry. Thankfully, they are two separate votes. So my colleagues \ncan vote against corporate welfare for the oil and gas industry, one of \nthe most profitable industries on the face of the planet, and vote for \nkids.\n  I do encourage my colleagues to vote against the rule, which has the \noil and gas corporate welfare bill. If it simply was a straight-up vote \non ESEA, I think my Democratic colleagues would join me in supporting \nthe rule. Unfortunately, it is not.\n  They stuck another bill in there that is an enormous multibillion-\ndollar giveaway to the most profitable industry on the face of the \nplanet, trying to preserve the fossil fuel industry rather than find a \npathway forward to transition toward a lower carbon emission future.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx), a valuable senior member of the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Dr. Burgess, for \nyielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a child, my family's home didn't have electricity or \nrunning\n\n[[Page H8878]]\n\nwater. My parents, while dedicated and hardworking, were poor, with \nlittle formal education.\n  Fortunately, I was pushed by the right people, teachers and \nadministrators, who wouldn't let me settle for less than my best. In \nthe mountains of North Carolina, I learned firsthand the power of \neducation and its vital role in the success of individual Americans.\n  Unfortunately, today's K-12 education system is failing our students. \nDecades of Washington's counterproductive mandates and the No Child \nLeft Behind law have resulted in stagnant student achievement, \ndisappointing graduation rates, and high school graduates entering \ncollege and the workforce without the knowledge and resources they need \nto succeed.\n  Parents and education leaders have lost much of their decisionmaking \nauthority to Washington bureaucrats, and the Secretary of Education has \nbullied States into adopting the Obama administration's pet policies.\n  The rule we are debating now would provide for consideration of a \nconference committee agreement, the Every Student Succeeds Act, \nreauthorizing and reforming the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nthat would allow Congress finally to replace the No Child Left Behind.\n  As a grandmother, educator, and former school board member, I know \nstudents are best served when teachers, parents, and administrators are \nthe driving force behind improving education. This agreement does just \nthat by reducing the Federal footprint in the Nation's classrooms and \nrestoring control to the people who know their students best.\n  The compromise Every Student Succeeds Act gets Washington out of the \nbusiness of running schools. It protects State and local autonomy by \nprohibiting the Secretary of Education from coercing States into \nadopting Common Core or punishing them for abandoning it.\n  It also would place unprecedented restrictions on the authority of \nthe Secretary of Education, preventing the Secretary from imposing new \nrequirements on States and school districts through executive fiat, as \nPresident Obama's Department of Education has done repeatedly over the \npast 3 years.\n  The proposal eliminates the burdensome one-size-fits-all \naccountability system that has done more to tie up States and school \ndistricts in red tape than to support local efforts to educate \nchildren. It also reduces the size of the Federal education bureaucracy \nby eliminating ineffective and duplicative Federal programs and \nrequiring the Secretary of Education to reduce the Department's \nworkforce accordingly.\n\n  If Congress were to fail to act, States would be forced to choose \nbetween the fundamentally flawed policies of No Child Left Behind, \nwhich double down on Federal programs, mandates, and spending, and the \nObama administration's controversial temporary conditional waiver \nscheme, which has imposed the administration's preferred policies and \nheightened the level of uncertainty shared by States and school \ndistricts. America's students deserve better.\n  That is why I am so pleased today's agreement gives States a better \nchance to succeed by getting Washington out of their way. Our work has \nbeen validated by The Wall Street Journal, which stated that the bill \nwould represent the largest evolution of Federal control to the States \nin a quarter century. It is far better than the status quo that would \ncontinue if nothing passes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Ms. FOXX. By reversing No Child Left Behind, one-size-fits-all \nmicromanagement of classrooms, Congress is giving parents, teachers, \nand local education leaders the tools they need to repair a broken \neducation system and help all children reach their potential. It is \ntime to get Washington out of the way.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying \nconference committee agreement, the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for yielding \nand for all of the work that he has put in on an important and \nnecessary advancement in our education system.\n  As he mentioned, the rule we are debating today also incorporates a \nrule for an energy bill that I wanted to address today because nowhere \nis the need for a comprehensive energy policy more critical than in my \nhome State of Massachusetts and the entire region of New England.\n  With recent announced closures of two plants in our region, one coal \nand one nuclear, we are facing the loss of over 2,000 megawatts of an \nalready antiquated, already overtaxed electric grid. That loss of \ncapacity is already causing the bills of our consumers to skyrocket \nthrough a quadrupling of our capacity rates, from $1 billion to over $4 \nbillion.\n  Those closures and subsequent rate increases underscore our need for \na roadmap that puts us on a path toward renewable energy while \nbalancing the reliability and affordability.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  The bill before us today does exactly the opposite. It reverses \ncourse and renews our investment in outdated energy resources while \nputting up roadblocks that will halt the innovation our energy \ninfrastructure so desperately needs.\n  In particular, I am very concerned with section 1110 of the bill, \nwhich would require regional grid operators to conduct a reliability \nanalysis each time a rate change is filed with the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  Unfortunately, reliability comes at a cost, and the analysis required \nby section 1110 fails to even consider its impact on ratepayers. It \nignores the concerns that I hear across my district every single day. \nRate increases mean families can't save, businesses can't grow, local \ntowns can't plan for the future.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment which would simply add ``at the \nlowest possible cost'' to the reliability analysis in section 1110. \nUnfortunately, it was not made in order. It was a simple amendment that \nwould have given much-needed direction and flexibility to each regional \noperator to determine what its reliability needs are and how much it is \ngoing to cost local ratepayers.\n  The reliability analysis is a clear benefit to fuel types that can be \nstored and ignores the realities and benefits of other sources of \nenergy, including renewables. The criteria required in this analysis \nfails to consider regional disparities, such as natural gas resources, \nlocal policies, and infrastructure.\n  If the majority is going to insist on a reliability analysis, at the \nvery least we should consider the impact the analysis would have on \nenergy costs to our constituents.\n  To say I am disappointed about what this bill has become would be a \ntremendous understatement. I hope today's vote will send a signal to \nthe majority that this version does not have a viable pathway forward \nand that our Caucus remains committed to working with them on a bill \nthat does.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).\n  Mr. BYRNE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Alabama State school board, \nformer chancellor of postsecondary education for the State of Alabama, \nand as a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, I am \nproud to support this rule and the underlying legislation.\n  For too long, our Nation's education system has failed under a heavy, \ntop-down system of mandates and requirements set by Washington \nbureaucrats and special interest groups.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act changes that by getting Washington out \nof the way and empowering our local teachers, principals, and \nadministrators. This legislation achieves these goals by reducing the \nFederal Government's role in K-12 education and restoring control over \neducation back to the States and local school districts, where it \nbelongs.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial board calls this legislation the \nlargest devolution of Federal control to the States in a quarter-\ncentury. National\n\n[[Page H8879]]\n\nJournal notes that the bill marks a rollback of Federal power, while \nPolitico points out that the bill cuts down on the number of education \nprograms.\n  I hear concerns often from my constituents in southwest Alabama about \nthe Common Core standards. Well, this bill expressly prohibits the \nSecretary of Education from influencing or coercing States into \nadopting Common Core. This bill makes clear that it is solely a State's \nresponsibility to set academic standards and pick assessments.\n  These restrictions on the Federal Secretary of Education are \nunprecedented and will end the Secretary's ability to influence \neducation policy through executive fiat and conditional waivers.\n  Some may wonder what the alternative is to this legislation, so let \nme tell you.\n  Without this bill, we will continue to allow the Obama administration \nand the Federal Government to dictate education policy to the States.\n  Without this bill, the Secretary of Education will continue to use \nFederal grants and money to coerce States into adopting certain \nacademic standards, like Common Core.\n  Without this bill, the Federal Department of Education will continue \nto operate more than 80 programs which are ineffective, duplicative, \nand unnecessary.\n  Without this bill, teachers will continue to have their hands tied by \npolicies and assessments put forward by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\n  Washington has no business telling our States and local school \ndistricts how to best run their schools. So let's pass the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act. Let's get Washington out of the way, and let's \nempower our local teachers, parents, and students.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for the \nranking member's intellect and integrity, as well as the chairman, in \nworking through this rule.\n  But it is simply disgraceful that while the President of the United \nStates, our President, was in Paris this week to unite the world \nagainst the growing threat of climate change, this House chose to take \nup this particular legislation that would undermine the transition to \ncleaner power sources.\n  These irresponsible bills put the American people at risk by exposing \nthem to the dangers of carbon pollution, further exacerbating the \nnegative impacts of climate change and putting our natural resources in \njeopardy.\n  While some of my friends choose to deny solid scientific evidence, \nmore than 12,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies are in agreement: \nClimate change is real, and humans are largely responsible by releasing \nlarge amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the \natmosphere from burning fossil fuels to produce energy.\n  But this is the most embarrassing part for our country: that this \nHouse is ignoring the scientific and national security community, which \nhas long recognized the national security threat climate change poses \nfor future generations.\n  The longer term consequences of failing to act to address climate \nchange may add further instability in regions that are already \nteetering on the edge of crisis. This could impair future access to \nfood and water, damage infrastructure or interrupt commercial activity, \nand increase competition and tension between countries vying for \nlimited resources.\n  Now, as this body chooses to ignore our military leaders, we are \nfaced with a choice. We can reject the continued calls to pull fossil \nfuels from the ground, or we can put our heads in the sand and pretend \neverything is fine, hunky-dory.\n  While I may not be a scientist or a military expert, I don't think it \nis difficult to walk and chew gum at the same time. We can listen to \nthe experts by investing our time and efforts in both short-term and \nlong-term policies to keep the public safe.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule \nand in support of both bills that this rule will bring to the floor.\n  I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me this time. I find \nmyself in very strong agreement with him on every point that he raised \nin his outstanding opening statement.\n  In regard to the energy efficiency bill, Mr. Speaker, unemployment is \na serious problem in this country, but we have much more \nunderemployment. We have ended up with the best educated waiters and \nwaitresses in the world, as many thousands of college graduates can't \nfind good jobs.\n  Our environmental rules and regulations and red tape have caused \nseveral million good jobs to go to other countries over the last 40 or \n50 years. We need more good jobs in this country, Mr. Speaker, and this \nenergy bill will help reduce this movement of jobs to other countries.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, I rise primarily today to speak in favor of the \nEvery Student Succeeds legislation.\n  In 2001, I was one of just 45 Members of the House who voted against \nthe No Child Left Behind Federal education law. Just 10 of those 45 \nremain in the House today: Republican Congressmen Sam Johnson, Walter \nJones, Joe Pitts, Dana Rohrabacher, Jim Sensenbrenner, Pete Sessions, \nand myself; and Democrats John Conyers, Bobby Scott, and Maxine Waters.\n  This turned out to be one of the most popular votes I ever cast, \nespecially with teachers.\n  I have spoken well over a thousand times in schools through the \nyears, and I voted against the bill in 2001 because I felt the \nteachers, principals, and parents in east Tennessee had enough common \nsense and intelligence to run their own schools and classrooms and \ndidn't need Washington bureaucrats telling them what to do.\n  The No Child Left Behind law was a great overreaction to failed \nschools in some of our Nation's biggest cities, and it needs to be \nreplaced. Today, I rise in support of the Every Student Succeeds Act so \nwe can leave behind the No Child Left Behind law.\n  As a previous speaker mentioned, the Wall Street Journal on Monday \npublished an editorial calling this bill ``a bipartisan compromise'' \nthat would be ``the largest devolution of Federal control . . . in a \nquarter-century.''\n  The paper pointed out that ``it's far better than the status quo \nwhich would continue if nothing passes,'' and described the bill as ``a \nrare opportunity for real reform.''\n  This bill should please many conservatives because it does away with \nthe Common Core mandate.\n  This legislation is an example of great work by my own Senator, \nconstituent, and friend, Senator Lamar Alexander. This bill is just one \nof many reasons why Senator Alexander is one of the most respected \nMembers of the other body, and I commend him for his efforts to improve \nour Nation's schools.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support these two bills that this rule \nbrings to the floor.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, this bill is missing a great opportunity \nwhere we have common ground on energy efficiency. Mr. Upton and Mr. \nWhitfield are great chairmen of the subcommittee and the standing \ncommittee and made an honest effort to try to include all of the \npossible things that we could do on energy efficiency, but we came up \nshort.\n  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy--and that is \nmade up of a lot of private sector companies that are trying to meet \nthe demand that their consumers, corporate consumers, and individuals \nhave to get more bang for their energy dollar by using less and saving \nmore--has said that this bill will not reduce energy consumption in the \nUnited States. It will increase it, at a cost of about $20 billion \nthrough 2040.\n  Why are we doing that? Energy efficiency is the area where we agree. \nThere is a lot of contentious debate about climate change; we are not \ngoing to resolve that today. But we have bipartisan agreement that we \nshould use less energy. It is good for our customers, and it is good \nfor the economy, and it is good for the environment. We came up short.\n\n[[Page H8880]]\n\n  Many of the costs in energy efficiency could be saved with building \ncodes language, which Mr. McKinley, an engineer on the Republican side, \nintroduced along with me. That is not in this bill.\n  There was a number of other bipartisan amendments that could have \nbeen offered. One by Mr. Kinzinger, the Smart Building Acceleration \nAct, should be in the bill. One by Mr. Reed, the Smart Manufacturing \nLeadership Act, should be in the bill.\n  So energy efficiency, that is the place we can work together, and it \nis the place where we save money by using less energy and improving our \neconomy and improving the environment as well.\n  The second area is the renewable fuel standards.\n  We have a huge debate in this Congress. If you are a corn farmer and \nyou are from that district, the renewable fuel standards work for you \nbecause it increases what you get for producing corn.\n  Everywhere else, you are getting hammered. The cost to farmers who \nhave to pay grain bills is higher. The cost to consumers who have to \nbuy food is higher. The cost to small engine owners who have to get \nmore repairs is higher. And it is bad for the environment.\n  That has been determined, I think, to be a well-intended flop.\n  Many of us had amendments that were going to let this Congress vote \non the renewable fuel standard. It was denied by the Committee on Rules \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office has said that if we actually \npassed an amendment eliminating the renewable fuel standards, drivers \nof pickup trucks and cars would get higher gas mileage, and, therefore, \nthere would be less revenue in the transportation bill from the gas \ntax, and we might have to pay more to farmers as a subsidy.\n  Now, what is going on here when we can't take a vote on a proposal \nthat would have the effect of saving the driving public money on gas?\n  You know, I am willing to take that vote. I am willing to take the \nheat for saving drivers in this country money because they can get \nbetter mileage without ethanol in the fuel.\n  Mr. Speaker, there has been a real effort here on the committee to \nmake progress. My goal is that we keep at it and try to improve this \nbill as it goes along the legislative path.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Ryan).\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, but \nI would like to speak on some of the positive benefits I see in the \neducation portion of this bill coming down the pike later on today.\n  First and foremost, I think we are learning a lot, Mr. Speaker, about \nwhat it really means to prepare young kids for an education today. And \nI believe the brain science that is unfolding in our country and the \nworld is helping us better understand exactly how young minds work and \nhow our own brains work. I think it is smart for us to send more power \nback to the local districts and then support programming that can help \nkids learn better.\n  A component of this bill, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment \ngrant program, allows for helping to educate well-rounded kids, allows \nus to focus on well-rounded education, focus on safe and healthy kids, \nand gives local school districts an opportunity to invest in programs \nlike the social and emotional learning programs that are going on \naround this country.\n  It is an interesting study. A meta-analysis done of about 213 \nprograms with 270,000 kids participating in social and emotional \nlearning programs saw an 11 percentile point increase in test scores. \nThat closes the achievement gap. We have seen a 10 percent increase in \nprosocial behavior, a 10 percent decrease in antisocial behavior, and a \n20 percent swing in the behavior of the kids.\n  We have great programs, like the MindUP program that Goldie Hawn \nstarted, having a tremendous impact around the country.\n  In my own congressional district, in Warren City Schools, we have the \nInner Resilience Social and Emotional Learning program. In one of our \nschools, we have seen a 60 percent reduction in out-of-school \nsuspensions. That is a 60 percent reduction.\n  And these programs are having significant benefits. If you look at \nthe qualities that a young person needs, I believe this bill helps us \nget back to redefining what the common core is. In my estimation, the \ncommon core is: Are we teaching kids mental discipline? the ability to \nbe aware? the ability to be focused? the ability to cultivate one of \nthe key components to a successful life, and that is the ability to \nregulate your own emotional state?\n  This comes well before science, technology, engineering, and math. \nTeaching these key, fundamental characteristics--mental discipline, \nphysical discipline, focus, concentration, self-regulation--are key \ncomponents before you even get to the academic side of things.\n  The other component in here is creating healthy schools. This gets \ninto the school lunches. This gets into the food that these kids eat. \nIf the student is not getting healthy foods, they are not going to be \nable to concentrate, they are not going to be able to have a high \nenergy level, they are not going to be able to do well academically.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. To me, self-regulation, awareness, attention, \nhealthy foods, and healthy environment are the building blocks before \nwe even get to the academic component of what happens in the classroom.\n  I want to thank the committees and the conference committee for \nputting this together and just recognize that I believe there is a new \nway of educating our kids emerging here. There is a new common core \ndeveloping, and that is the mental discipline and the physical health \nof our young people.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan legislation that would \nclose a loophole allowing suspected terrorists to legally buy guns. \nThis bill would bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those on the \nterrorist watch list.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we have before us today an education bill \nthat is a vast improvement over the status quo. I am proud to say it is \na result of the work product between Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether to finally replace an outdated educational law with one that \nmakes a lot more sense.\n  It maintains the original goal of ESEA from 1965--that is, to protect \nthe civil rights of all Americans, to ensure that no school district \ncan sweep under the rug or deny a quality education to any student \nbecause of their ethnicity or race or income status--and it allows \nStates and districts the flexibility to meet those needs. It allows \nStates and districts the flexibility to do something, but not the \nflexibility to do nothing. That is the fine line that Democrats and \nRepublicans have worked together to seek and have accomplished with \nthis bill.\n  Beginning in 2011, the Department of Education embarked on an \nunprecedented process of granting annual ESEA waivers to States and \nsome districts. Now, you have heard that waiver process blasted from \nthe other side. Absent that waiver process, under the formula of \nadequate yearly progress, nearly every State and district would have \nbeen labeled a failure. So I hope that my colleagues are grateful for a \nwaiver process that has succeeded in granting waivers not only to my \nhome State of Colorado, but to most States and districts across the \ncountry.\n  Now, of course, the waiver process opened up a Pandora's box. We can \nall agree it gave too much power to a single Federal agency. Not \nknowing who the next President is going to be, that should be something \nthat Democrats and Republicans are concerned about.\n  While President Obama and Secretary Duncan's use of the waiver \nprocess allowed States to get out from\n\n[[Page H8881]]\n\nunder a flawed law, we can't necessarily count on the next President to \nbe as generous with the waiver process in the No Child Left Behind, \nwhich is why it is completely appropriate and why you see so many \nDemocrats, Republicans, educators, and school board members lining up \nto say: You know what? We need better statutory guidance, and we need \nto eliminate the one flawed Federal measurement of adequate yearly \nprogress and replace it with an accountability system that works at the \nState and district level and maintains the Federal commitment to civil \nrights for all students.\n  Now, I personally agree with some of the reforms that resulted from \nthe ESEA waivers, but a complex annual waiver process is at the whim of \nwhoever the chief executive is at a certain time. It is not sound \npolicy over time to improve our public schools.\n  I am proud to say this bill, ESEA, has broad support from a diverse \ncoalition of stakeholders. It has support from superintendents, \nteachers, the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the \nNational Center for Learning Disabilities, the National Council of La \nRaza, Third Way, the STEM Education Coalition, the National Governors \nAssociation, and many others who are very well-regarded organizations \nthat support the bill. And just over the past few days, I have heard \nfrom constituents who support the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  I have spent most of my public career in education. I believe that \neducation is the single most powerful tool for creating opportunity, \nfor ending poverty, for lifting people into the middle class and \nbeyond.\n  I have served as chairman of the State Board of Education of \nColorado. I founded two charter schools. I served as superintendent of \na charter school, the New America School. During my time in Congress, I \nhave sat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. And on a \npersonal note, I have a preschool-age son.\n  Nothing could be more important for the future of our country than \nimproving our public schools. Education is important to me, just as it \nis important to thousands of families in my district and parents \neverywhere. The Every Student Succeeds Act is a good bill that will \nmove our education system forward.\n  I am proud to support the conference report, though, again, I am \nopposed to the rule and H.R. 8, the corporate welfare for the oil and \ngas industry bill, which was, unfortunately, put under the same rule as \nan education bill that I think many of us can agree on.\n  I want to talk about some of the specific language around charter \nschools that I worked hard to include in this bill.\n  I am proud to say that this version of the bill maintains strong \nFederal support for new and innovative charter schools as well as \nallowing for the replication and expansion of public charter school \nmodels that we know work for at-risk kids.\n  It is one of the great things about education. For every challenge we \nface, for every problem we see in public education, we also see an \nexample of what works: a great teacher in a classroom defying the odds \nby helping at-risk students achieve; a great school; a great principal; \na great site leader who has turned around a low-performing school, \nimproved graduation rates, and made sure that more kids have access to \ncollege.\n  These stories are a reality in districts like Denver Public Schools, \nJefferson County Public Schools, Boulder Valley School District, Poudre \nSchool District; and in districts across the country, there are \nexamples of what works and what doesn't work.\n  The truth is that the Federal Government and States need to ensure \nthat districts change what doesn't work, and one of the best ways to do \nthat is to take proven models of success and expand and replicate them. \nOne of those models that can work is public charter schools.\n  I am proud to say the public charter schools have been embraced in my \nhome State of Colorado. Denver Public Schools, which serves a high \npercentage of at-risk kids, has over 20 percent of their children \nchoosing to attend public charter schools. Our State also enjoys strong \nschool choice across all public schools and even between districts.\n  This bill improves upon the charter school language by allowing the \ngrants to be used for expanding and replicating successful models and \nupping the bar on authorizing practices and ensuring that quality \npublic charter schools are meeting the needs of learners across the \ncountry.\n  Many of these charter schools wouldn't get off the ground without \nthese Federal startup grants because they don't receive any public \nfunds or State funds--in my home State of Colorado, until June of the \nyear they open; in other States, it might be a little bit different. \nBut generally speaking, all of those planning costs and operating costs \nfor that year, until they open, are not compensated because they have \nno student enrollment at that point.\n  Believe me, it takes money to get public charter schools off the \nground. They raise money from philanthropy. Some school districts who \nwant more public charter schools help seed them, too. And the Federal \ninvestment, along with that, will help ensure that these great \neducators and great ideas have a chance to actually start a public \ncharter school that meets a real learning need in the community.\n  I couldn't be more proud that those priorities of the All-STAR Act \nand the charter school bill passed overwhelmingly by this body in two \ndifferent legislative sessions are reflected in this final bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous \nquestion, to vote ``no'' on the rule, to vote ``yes'' on the education \nbill, and to vote ``no'' on the corporate welfare for the oil and gas \nindustry bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of time \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 11\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for further consideration of two \nimportant bills affecting the future of this country: the country's \nenergy future and the future of education. They are important bills.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question, vote \n``yes'' on the rule, and vote ``yes'' on the underlying bills.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to S. 1177, which is \na sea change that moves the nation's education system away from ``No \nChild Left Behind.''\n  I thank Chairman Kline, Ranking Member Scott, and all the members of \nthe House and Senate Conference Committee for their work in bringing \nthe Every Child Succeeds Act.\n  As the founding member and Chair of the Congressional Children's \nCaucus, I am in support of this bill because it places the education of \nour nation's children first.\n  I am pleased that the Jackson Lee Amendment offered during the House \nconsideration of this bill intended to fight bullying in education \nsettings is included in S. 1177.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment supports accountability-based programs and \nactivities that are designed to enhance school safety, which may \ninclude research-based bullying prevention, cyberbullying prevention, \nand disruption of recruitment activity by groups or individuals \ninvolved in violent extremism, and gang prevention programs as well as \nintervention programs regarding bullying.\n  Statistics on Bully:\n  Consider the daily reality for too many of our children who are \nthreatened and hurt daily and will not tell adults about their pain or \nshame: 1 in 7 Students in Grades K-12 is either a bully or a victim of \nbullying. 90 percent of 4th to 8th Grade Students report being victims \nof bullying of some type. 56 percent of students have personally \nwitnessed some type of bullying at school. 71 percent of students \nreport incidents of bullying as a problem at their school. 15 percent \nof all students who don't show up for school reported being out of fear \nof being bullied while at school. 1 out of 20 students has seen a \nstudent with a gun at school. 282,000 students are physically attacked \nin secondary schools each month.\n  Consequences of bullying: 15 percent of all school absenteeism is \ndirectly related to fears of being bullied at school. According to \nbullying statistics, 1 out of every 10 students who drops out of school \ndoes so because of repeated bullying. Suicides linked to bullying are \nthe saddest statistic.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment also addresses growing concerns regarding \nviolent extremism and student social media use.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland\n\n[[Page H8882]]\n\nSecurity, and Investigations, as well as a Senior Member of the \nHomeland Security Committee, I believe that we must address emerging \nthreats where they are, and do so as early as possible.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act reflects the core principles for what \ntoday's children need to be prepared to succeed.\n  The bill includes support for students and schools in state \naccountability plans to create an opportunity for great transparency in \nmaking sure the classroom experiences of students will prepare them for \nhigher education or employment opportunities by: (1.) reducing the \namount of standardized testing in schools and decoupling high-stakes \ndecision making and statewide standardized tests; and, (2.) ensuring \nthat educators' voices are part of decision making at the federal, \nstate and local levels.\n  This year marks the 50th anniversary of Congress passing the landmark \nElementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).\n  It is appropriate that Congress is taking this important bipartisan \nstep in education reform that is drawing broad support from leading \norganizations, including the following: (1.) National Education \nAssociation; (2.) Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; (3.) National \nCouncil of La Raza; (4.) Teach for America; (5.) U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce; and (6.) Business Roundtable.\n  The bill before the House will move the nation toward an education \npolicy built for success from the classrooms to the workplace.\n  In 2011, the number of children enrolled in elementary, middle \nschools and high schools nationally is 54,876,000, which included \n38,716,000 in elementary schools and 16,160,000 in high schools.\n  Access to a great education is the best medicine for our nation's \ndisparities in our economic system and social justice challenges.\n  A major reason for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was the \nunanimous, landmark ruling of the United States Supreme Court in Brown \nv. Board of Education, in which the Supreme Court held that education \n``is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.''\n  A great education lifts all aspirations and opens doors of \nopportunity for every student in communities across the nation.\n  Today lifelong learning is an imperative for workers to remain \ncurrent and viable in the employment market place.\n  A great education today yield benefits far into the future as it \nproduces inventors, thinkers, artists, and leaders.\n  It is well past time to correct flaws in the ``No Child Left Behind'' \nlaw and focus on facilitating this growth and laying the foundation for \nstudent success.\n  According to a 2011 report by the Brookings Institution's \nMetropolitan Policy Program, ``The Hidden STEM Economy,'' 26 million \njobs, or 20 percent of all occupations, required knowledge in one or \nmore STEM areas.\n  The same report stressed that fully half of all STEM jobs available \nto workers without a 4 year degree and these jobs pay on average \n$53,000 a year, which is 10 percent higher than jobs with similar \neducation requirements.\n  The economy is changing rapidly and our education system needs the \nguidance and support provided by H.R. 1177.\n  I urge all members to join with me in voting in support of H.R. 1177.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 542 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on the adoption of the resolution, if \nordered, and the motion to instruct on H.R. 644.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 243, \nnays 177, not voting 13, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 653]\n\n

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 542, I call up \nthe conference report on the bill (S. 1177) to reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every \nchild achieves, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the \nconference report is considered read.\n  (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of \nNovember 30, 2015, at page H8444.)\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) and the gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Scott) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the conference report to accompany S. \n1177.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Minnesota?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in strong support of the conference report to accompany \nS. 1177, to be known as the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  After years of congressional delay and executive overreach, Congress \nis finally replacing No Child Left Behind. More importantly, we are \nreplacing the old approach to education with a new approach that will \nhelp every child in\n\n[[Page H8885]]\n\nevery school receive an excellent education.\n  For more than a decade, Washington has been micromanaging our \nclassrooms. Federal rules now dictate how States and local communities \nmeasure student achievement, fix broken schools, spend taxpayer \nresources, and hire and fire their teachers.\n  No Child Left Behind was based on good intentions, but it was also \nbased on the flawed premise that Washington knows what students need to \nsucceed in school.\n  And what do we have to show for it? Less than half of all fourth and \neighth graders are proficient in reading and math. An achievement gap \ncontinues to separate poor and minority students from their more \naffluent peers. In some neighborhoods, children are far more likely to \ndrop out of high school than earn a diploma.\n  Parents, teachers, superintendents, and other education leaders have \nbeen telling us for years that the top-down approach to education is \nnot working. Yet some still believe that more programs, more mandates, \nand more bureaucrats will help get this right. Well, those days will \nsoon be over.\n  Today, we turn the page on the failed status quo and turn over to our \nNation's parents and our State and local leaders the authority, \nflexibility, and certainty they need to deliver children an excellent \neducation.\n  We reached this moment because replacing No Child Left Behind has \nlong been a leading priority for House Republicans. For years, we have \nfought to improve K-12 education with three basic principles: reducing \nthe Federal role, restoring local control, and empowering parents. The \nfinal bill by the House and Senate conference committee reflects these \nprinciples.\n  The bill reduces the Federal role in K-12 education by repealing \ndozens of ineffective programs which place unprecedented restrictions \non the Secretary of Education; eliminating one-size-fits-all schemes \naround accountability and school improvement, ending the era of high-\nstakes testing; and preventing this administration and future \nadministrations from coercing or incentivizing States to adopt Common \nCore.\n  The bill restores local control by protecting the right of States to \nopt out of Federal education programs and by delivering new funding \nflexibility so taxpayer resources are better spent on local priorities.\n  The conference agreement also returns to States and school districts \nthe responsibility for accountability and school improvement. A set of \nbroad parameters will help taxpayers know that their money is being \nwell spent while ensuring State and local leaders have the authority \nnecessary to run their schools.\n  The bill also empowers parents by providing moms and dads with the \ninformation they need to hold their schools accountable. The conference \nagreement strengthens school choice by reforming programs that affect \ncharter schools and magnet schools, and it prevents any Federal \ninterference with our Nation's private schools and home schools.\n  Reducing the Federal role, restoring local control, empowering \nparents--these are the principles we have fought for because these are \nthe principles that will help give every child a shot at a quality \neducation.\n\n  Now, let me be clear. This is not a perfect bill. To make progress, \nyou find common ground. But make no mistake, we compromised on the \ndetail, but we did not compromise on the principles.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of waiting for us to \nreplace a flawed education law. They are tired of the Federal \nintrusion, of the conditional waivers, and of the Federal coercion. \nMost importantly, they are tired of seeing their kids being trapped in \nfailing schools.\n  Let's do the job we were sent here to do. Let's replace No Child Left \nBehind with new policies that are based on principles we believe in.\n  For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nconference agreement.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am honored to endorse the conference report on S. 1177, the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act.\n  We have certainly come a long way since we were on the floor debating \nH.R. 5, the Student Success Act, earlier this year. I had sincere \nobjections to much that was found in H.R. 5, but thanks to the \ncommitment to work together to try to fashion a decent bill with \nChairman Kline and our counterparts in the Senate, Senator Alexander \nand Senator Murray, along with the many long nights from our respective \nstaffs, we found a way to produce a conference report that balances the \ndesire for more localized decisionmaking with the need for Federal \noversight to ensure equity for underserved students.\n  This conference report is the embodiment of what we can do when we \nwork together in Washington--a workable compromise that does not force \neither side to desert its core beliefs.\n  Mr. Speaker, the modern Federal role in elementary and secondary \neducation began with the promise in Brown v. Board of Education when a \nunanimous Supreme Court held that, in 1954, ``it is doubtful that any \nchild may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the \nopportunity of an education'' and that ``such an opportunity is a right \nwhich must be made available to all on equal terms.''\n  Yet, despite the Brown decision, our education system has remained \nfundamentally unequal. That inequality is virtually guaranteed by the \nfact that we fund education basically by the real estate tax, \nguaranteeing that wealthier areas will have more funds than low-income \nareas.\n  Across the Nation, gaps in equity persist. These gaps made it \nimpossible to realize the opportunity of an education to all on equal \nterms because too many schools lacked the basic resources necessary for \nsuccess. Too many schools failed children year after year.\n  And these gaps disproportionately affected the politically \ndisconnected: those in poverty, racial minorities, students with \ndisabilities, and English language learners. This was unacceptable.\n  In 1965, Congress addressed the inequality by passing the first \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, which provided Federal \nmoney to address--and I quote from the original bill--``the special \neducational needs of children of low-income families and the impact \nthat concentrations of low-income families have on the ability of local \neducational agencies to support adequate educational programs.''\n  Simply put, Congress acknowledged that the right to an education is a \ncivil right that knows no State boundaries and that the Federal \nGovernment has a role to ensure that all States are fulfilling their \npromises for all of America's children.\n  The current iteration of the ESEA, No Child Left Behind, has run its \ncourse. It is so broken that the administration currently offers over \n40 States waivers from its most unworkable provisions. This has not \nonly created a great amount of uncertainty for students, parents, \neducators, and communities, but it has also resulted in uneven \nprotections for underserved students and a lack of transparency for our \ncommunities.\n  This conference report improves upon both the current law and the \nwaivers, lives up to the promises of Brown and the intent of the \noriginal ESEA, and addresses the key challenges of No Child Left \nBehind.\n  First, the Every Student Succeeds Act maintains high standards for \nall children but allows States to determine those standards in a way \nthat requires those standards to be aligned with college readiness.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act requires States to put in place \nassessment, accountability, and improvement policies that will close \nthe achievement gap but with locally designed, evidence-based \nstrategies that meet the unique needs of students and schools.\n  The conference report requires the transparent reporting of data to \nensure that schools are responsible for not only the achievement of all \nof their students but also for the equitable allocation of resources to \nsupport student learning.\n  The conference report helps States and school districts reduce the \noveruse of exclusionary policies by allowing the existing funding to be \nused for the Youth PROMISE plans, which is an\n\n[[Page H8886]]\n\nissue I have been working on for many years.\n  Youth PROMISE plans are comprehensive, evidence-based plans that are \ndesigned to address neighborhoods with significant crime, teen \npregnancy, and other problems, and they are designed to reinvest \nsavings generated by those plans to keep the plans working in the \nfuture.\n  The conference report recognizes the importance of early learning, a \npriority of both red and blue States alike, by authorizing a program to \nassist States in improving the coordination, quality, improvement, and \naccess to pre-K.\n  Most importantly, while many of these new systems will be created by \nthe States, under the conference report, the Federal Government \nmaintains the ability to make sure that States and localities are \nliving up to their commitments--that all students are being counted and \nthat schools are being held accountable for their achievement.\n  While this conference report is not the bill that I would have \nwritten alone--or that any Member would have written alone, for that \nmatter--I have no doubt that this bipartisan conference report will \nmake a positive difference in the lives of our Nation's children and \nwill live up to the goal of the original ESEA: making an opportunity \nfor an education available to all on equal terms. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Rokita), the chairman of the Early Childhood, Elementary, \nand Secondary Education Subcommittee.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I recognize Chairman Kline especially for \nthe work he has done over a long period of time, 7 years or so, \nbringing this House, this Congress, to where we are today. It truly is \nleadership at its best.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's face it. No Child Left Behind's high-stakes \ntesting, which requires every child to be caught up to grade level \nwithin 1 year, is simply unworkable, as well-intentioned as it may have \nbeen.\n  Currently, the Secretary of Education, through waivers, can run \nschools by executive fiat, imposing requirements on State testing \nstandards and conditioning receipt of Federal funds on adopting Common \nCore standards.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  It's time for a positive change, and that change is the Every Student \nSucceeds Act. This bill, as pointed out here, as The Wall Street \nJournal puts it, is the largest transfer of Federal control, Mr. \nSpeaker, to the States in 25 years, where this authority and \nopportunity frankly belongs.\n  This bill empowers States, and it ends the federally mandated high-\nstakes testing, which is the core, which is the heart of No Child Left \nBehind, which is causing all the stress that we see from our teachers, \nour school administrators, our parents, and especially our students. If \nit produced the results that we intended, maybe that is one thing. But \nall it is producing is stress and an unworkable situation.\n  The people who best know how to test, how long to test, what to test, \net cetera, et cetera, are our parents, our teachers, our voters, our \ntaxpayers, our local school administrators. Let them have this \nresponsibility back.\n  It provides flexibility so voters and taxpayers, through their \nlocally elected officials, can decide for themselves what success looks \nlike. It recognizes that, when it comes to determining academic \nstandards, States, school administrators, and parents know what is \nbest.\n  It is time we put our children first so we can compete in a global, \n21st-century world and win again. It is time we trust parents, \nteachers, and local education leaders more than we trust Federal \nbureaucrats in Washington, D.C. This bill is a huge step in that \ndirection.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support it.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge), who is the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee that reported this bill.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I thank both the chair and ranking member for their leadership. It \nhas been a privilege to work on this with both of you.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my strong support for the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is \nlong overdue. For years, our Nation's students, their parents, and \nteachers have implored Congress to address the flaws in No Child Left \nBehind.\n  Today we finally have a bill that addresses many of the most \ndifficult issues. Though not perfect, this bill is a significant \nimprovement over No Child Left Behind.\n  Education is our Nation's great equalizer. Education opens the doors \nof opportunity to all of our Nation's children. This year we \ncommemorated the 50th anniversary of President Johnson signing the \noriginal ESEA.\n  Fifty years ago, as part of the Great Society legislation, we passed \nESEA as a civil rights law that affirmed the right of every child to a \nquality education. It further underscored the belief that poverty \nshould not be an obstacle to student success.\n  The bill before us protects title I funding, ensures equitable \nallocation of resources to schools. It recognizes the importance of \nafterschool education and maintains subgroup disaggregation of data for \nreporting.\n  Further, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants program \nis formula based and distributes dollars that fill resource and \nopportunity gaps based on the need and population.\n  While ESSA does give States and local districts more flexibility, it \ndoes not absolve the Federal Government of its responsibility to \nprotect the civil rights of underserved students. Make no mistake. The \nDepartment of Education maintains its authority to oversee \nimplementation of the law and take action against States and districts \nthat aren't honoring the civil rights legacy of the ESEA.\n  It was my goal that the final bill provide equal educational \nopportunities for all children, regardless of race, ethnicity, income, \nlanguage, or disability. I believe the Every Student Succeeds Act \nachieves this goal by striking a balance in the best interest of all of \nour Nation's students.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), a member of the Early Childhood, \nElementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee of the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Kline for \nthe opportunity to voice my support for this comprehensive overhaul of \nNo Child Left Behind, which has been a long time in the making.\n  As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I can \nattest to this conference report being the product of many years of \nhard work. I am happy to have been a conferee for the Every Student \nSucceeds Act, which, through a bipartisan agreement, provides more \nflexibility for our States, school districts, educators, parents, and \nstudents.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act will establish a more appropriate \nFederal role in education by ending the era of mandated high-stakes \ntesting, limiting the power of the Secretary of Education to dictate \ncookie-cutter standards, repealing dozens of ineffective and \nduplicative programs, and ensuring resources are delivered to where \nthey are most effective and necessary.\n  I am especially grateful to the conferees for their adoption of an \namendment that will instruct the Department of Education to finally \nstudy the fairness of the current title I formulas used to offset the \neffects of poverty upon young learners.\n  ESEA, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, was created to \nprovide each student an equal opportunity under the law. But, \nunfortunately, we are still not targeting those areas with the highest \nconcentration of poverty.\n  I am hopeful that we can continue to embrace the spirit of ESEA and \nensure that we are always working in the direction of providing great \neducational opportunities for all children.\n  I want to thank my friend, my colleague, and my chairman, John Kline, \nfor his leadership to accomplish this historical education reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.\n\n[[Page H8887]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this \nlegislation. It has been 13 long years since ESEA was rewritten. As we \nhave heard from prior speakers, there are many problems that have been \nidentified with No Child Left Behind, which we have heard from across \nthe board in terms of parents, educators, administrators, and in terms \nof the need to update and revise this legislation.\n  What we also know is that the American economy has changed over the \nlast 13 years and so has the world economy. One of the biggest problems \nthat employers have today is the lack of individuals with degrees in \nscience, technology, engineering, and math, STEM technology.\n  The good news is that this bill upgrades the K-12 system to give kids \nthe tools that they are going to need to succeed with these jobs, which \nnow are growing three times as fast as non-STEM jobs. The good news is \nit provides incomes twice as large as non-STEM jobs.\n\n  So what the bill does is it creates a STEM master teacher core, \nprovides professional development training to STEM educators, greater \naccess for thousands of school districts to Federal funding to support \nSTEM programs, including partnerships with nonprofits.\n  It encourages alternative certification programs to allow more STEM \nteachers to come from industry and will retain and provide promising \nSTEM teachers with differential pay. This is what our school systems \nneed and this is what our kids need to have the tools to succeed in the \nfuture.\n  It is a great achievement that the chairman and the ranking member \ndefied all the conventional wisdom to get this bill to move forward. It \nis almost like Pope Francis created some aura that you capitalized on. \nI mean that sincerely.\n  This is an incredible achievement to break through the barriers that \nhave prevented us from coming together as an institution to really fix \nwhat in many respects is the most important issue, which is creating a \nfuture for the kids and our grandchildren.\n  I urge strong support of this legislation.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from \nConnecticut for mentioning Pope Francis and not mentioning ladies \nbasketball.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the \nchair of the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee of \nthe Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for doing the Herculean work on this bill, Every Student \nSucceeds Act, and the conference report. Many, many, many hours and \nmany Congresses could not make this happen. They did. My hat is off to \nthem.\n  When I go home to Tennessee and talk to the teachers, students, \nadministrators, and the parents, what do I hear? There is too much \nFederal control, too many forms to fill out, we are teaching to the \ntest, the students are frustrated, the teachers are frustrated.\n  Just go sit in front of a group of teachers and ask them: Would you \nbe a teacher again? I promise you that over half of them will hold up \ntheir hand and say: No. I wouldn't be a teacher again.\n  That is terrible. We have to make an environment where the educators \nare enjoying what they do.\n  For the most part, I think teachers have one of the most important \njobs in this country. I am a product of the public education system, 23 \nyears. If I hadn't had great teachers, I would not have had the \nopportunity to be a doctor and I wouldn't have had the opportunity to \nserve in the U.S. Congress. So I am forever grateful.\n  What do we do? What do they say? They say: Look, this adequate yearly \nprogress we are being judged on, these tests, as far as our students \nmoving along, the Common Core--I hear that all the time at home--we \ndon't need a national school board telling us what to teach in our \ncommunity.\n  We heard them. Both sides of the aisle heard them and said: Okay. \nWhat we will do is we will push that control back down to the local \nlevel and you decide what is your curriculum, but you are going to be \nheld accountable for how your student outcomes are. If you have \nstudents and minorities, we will be able to ferret those out and \nimprove those students' outcomes.\n  We have eliminated or altered 49 different programs into a \nflexibility grant that will make it easier for the administrators to \nrun their school systems. I think the main thing we want to do at the \nend of the day is that we want to create an environment where our \nstudents have the best opportunity in the world to achieve because they \nare now competing on a world basis.\n  For that reason, I think this bill does that. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for this.\n  I am proud to stand on the House floor today in support of the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act. Everywhere I go in my district, I hear from \nteachers, parents, administrators and students, who all tell me that we \nneed to return control to the local level. Just as a one-size-fits-all \napproach doesn't work for health care reform, it will not work for \neducation. Each state, school district and student are different, and \nlocal administrators, teachers and parents--not the federal \ngovernment--should make decisions based on what's best for their \nstudents.\n  There are a lot of good reasons for conservatives to support this \nbill, because on virtually every account it reduces the federal \ngovernment's ability to control state and local education. This bill \nreplaces the national accountability system with a state-led one, \nensuring local leaders' voice is heard. It also eliminates duplicative, \nexpensive and unnecessary programs and replaces them with a Local \nAcademic Flexible Grant, providing funding for school systems to better \nserve and support their students.\n  Perhaps most importantly, conservatives can feel good about \nsupporting this because of how far it goes in stopping the federal \ngovernment's intrusion into academic standards and curriculum, and in \nparticular the adoption of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. \nWhile these standards were developed in a process that began as a \nstate-led initiative, in recent years concern has increased as the \nDepartment of Education has been coercing states into adopting these \nstandards as a condition of getting education waivers and grants. The \nbill would take away the Department's ability to require Common Core as \na condition of federal grants, which ensures the decision on whether or \nnot to adopt Common Core will truly be left up to the states--as it \nshould be. If you claim to be concerned about or opposed to Common \nCore, then you must support this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, a lot of people ask me, why does it matter whether we \nagree on education policy? Well, on my way home after work just the \nother evening, I met a boy at the grocery stow who was looking for some \nitems on the shelves. He asked me for help in locating crushed \npineapples because he told me he couldn't read the words. So I helped \nhim and we found the crushed pineapples. But it hit me--this is why we \nwant to invest in education. We have to have a system that ensures that \nboy and thousands of other kids just like him are given the opportunity \nto succeed in life, and that starts with a good education. We have a \ngreat opportunity to start helping that child by agreeing to this bill, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that happen.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), a former educator herself.\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act. I want to thank Chairmen Alexander and Kline and \nRanking Members Murray and Scott for their yearlong work on this bill.\n  At its heart, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is a civil \nrights law based on a simple, yet powerful, promise made to all \nAmerican children. It is a promise that, no matter where you live, what \nyou look like, or what resources you have, you deserve a quality \neducation.\n  Unfortunately, No Child Left Behind's one-size-fits-all approach \nderailed the fulfillment of this promise by creating an untenable \nenvironment of excessive, high-stakes testing that undermines \neducators' ability to serve their students.\n  While not perfect, the Every Student Succeeds Act is a substantial \nimprovement that takes us one step closer to delivering on the promise \nof a quality education.\n  ESSA will provide schools with the resources and guidelines they need \nto deliver on this promise by directing resources to the children most \nin need and allowing school districts the flexibility to use title IV \nfunds in a way that best works for their students.\n\n[[Page H8888]]\n\n  As someone who has dedicated my life to dropout prevention, I am \noverjoyed to see this bill includes my amendment allowing title IV \nfunds to be used for dropout prevention and reentry programs. But this \nis just the first step for our children.\n  It is the champions of our children's education--the teachers, the \nparents, the principals, and the mentors--who will create an \nenvironment of learning. That environment will ensure that our \nchildren's hearts and minds are positively shaped by our collective \nwisdom, our support, and our love.\n  I want to thank the teachers and parents across our Nation and \nespecially in Florida for their work and commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report and stand \nunited for a single purpose: our children.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie), a member of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act.\n  As a father of three children who have attended public schools, I \nknow the importance of allowing those who know our students best to be \nthe decisionmakers.\n  I want to thank everybody who is involved in educating our children. \nMy wife and I certainly appreciate those who have sacrificed so much \ntime to take care of our children.\n  Since coming to Congress, I have heard from parents, teachers, school \nboard members, and school leaders that No Child Left Behind is not \nproducing the results our children need.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  States and local school districts need flexibility to deliver a \nquality education to our students. This agreement does just that. It \ngets the Federal Government out of our classrooms and puts the \ndecisionmaking back in the hands of our State and local leaders.\n  This agreement prevents the Secretary from legislating through \nexecutive fiat. It prohibits the Secretary from adding new requirements \nthrough regulations and from adding new requirements as a condition of \napproval of a State plan.\n  As a Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and \na conferee on this agreement, I am pleased with the determination of my \ncolleagues in this Congress to move beyond the failed policies of No \nChild Left Behind. Our children deserve a quality education, and this \nbill is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the chairman and the ranking member \nand those in the Senate for all their hard work. I know the staff from \nboth sides, people that we get to work with every day who work hard for \nthe people of this country and who have worked hard for our children. I \nappreciate the hard work they have done in bringing this agreement to \nwhere we are today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference agreement.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a former public schoolteacher for 24 years, I am \nproud to rise in support of this bill, which will improve our schools, \noffer more support to teachers, and, most importantly, provide more \nstudents the education they deserve.\n  Having served in the classroom during the implementation of No Child \nLeft Behind, I can say without hesitation that our current education \nsystem needs a reset.\n  While well-intentioned, No Child Left Behind created a punitive \napproach to education policy that punishes underperforming schools \ninstead of helping them to improve. That rigid, test-driven approach to \naccountability, combined with heavyhanded intervention from the Federal \nGovernment, has failed to close the achievement gaps in our country.\n  This reauthorization replaces our test-and-punish system with a more \nflexible test-and-reveal approach that returns decisionmaking to States \nand school districts. It will empower educators who best understand \ntheir students' needs to develop new ways to meet local challenges.\n  I am also pleased this bill increases overall education funding and \nensures States are maintaining their investments in schools.\n  As a teacher, I might not give this bill an A-plus, but it is a solid \nbipartisan compromise, and it is an overdue replacement for a status \nquo that we all know is unacceptable. For that reason, I give this bill \na passing grade.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Messer), another member of the committee.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I have not heard from one parent, student, \nor teacher who likes No Child Left Behind. Despite what may have been \nthe best of intentions, its one-size-fits-all mandates led to Federal \nGovernment micromanagement in the classroom, overtested kids, and \nanxiety-ridden teachers, but, sadly, no significant improvement in \nstudent outcomes.\n  That is why virtually everyone wants to repeal No Child Left Behind. \nToday we have an opportunity to do just that by supporting the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act. It is a new approach to the Federal role in \neducation. If you read it, there is a lot to like in the bill.\n  By voting for this bill, we can end Federal Common Core mandates and \nstop the march towards a Federal curriculum. We can end high-stakes \ntesting and abolish the unworkable adequate yearly progress metrics. \nBest of all, we can give power over education back to the people we \ntrust: the parents, the teachers, and the local school administrators \nwho are best positioned to make good decisions for our kids.\n  Access to a quality education is the gateway to opportunity in modern \nAmerica. We still have a long way to go before we can make sure every \nchild has that kind of access, but the Every Student Succeeds Act is a \nbig step in the right direction.\n  I urge my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank Mr. Scott for yielding. I want to thank Mr. Kline, \nthe chairman of the committee, and Ranking Member Scott for their work \non this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, Frederick Douglass was born a slave on the Eastern Shore \nof Maryland. He became one of the great leaders in our country. \nObviously, he worked hard with Abraham Lincoln to see the issuing of \nthe Emancipation Proclamation. He said this: ``It is easier to build \nstrong children than to repair broken men.''\n  This bill is about investment in the future, investment in children. \nInvesting in elementary and secondary education is one of the most \nconsequential acts we will undertake in this House. The impact of our \ninvestments in education will be felt long after we are gone. It will \nhave a significant bearing on the future well-being of our economy and \nour democracy.\n  I want to thank Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott, as well as \nSenators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, the chair and ranking member \nof the Senate HELP Committee, for their extraordinary efforts on this \nbill.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. We worked together. Frankly, we had a \nlittle trouble working together here, but they worked together there, \nand then we worked together here. It is turning out well.\n  My friend indicated that he would not give this bill an A-plus. I was \ntrying to reflect on any bill that I have ever voted on that I would \ngive an A-plus to. It is not a perfect bill, but it represents a \nreasonable compromise that will strengthen elementary and secondary \neducation in this country, provide certainty going forward, and help \nprepare the next generation of students--no matter who they are, how \nthey learn, or where they live--for success in college, in their \ncareers, in their vocations, and as future innovators and entrepreneurs \nin our economy.\n\n  I am particularly proud--and I thank Mr. Scott, and I thank also the \ntwo Senate leaders, as well as Mr. Kline--that this conference report \nincludes the Full-Service Community Schools program, which I have \nchampioned for several years.\n  My wife, Judy, was an early childhood educator and administrator in \nPrince George's County, Maryland. She\n\n[[Page H8889]]\n\ndied over 18 years ago. It is from her, however, that I first learned \nof the potential of full-service community schools, and our State has \nvery successfully created a network of schools using this integrated \napproach named in her memory.\n  There will be 52 Judy Centers around our State for 3- and 4-year-\nolds. Some of them are privately funded, they are so popular, some \npublicly funded, and some in partnership. These Judy Centers enable \nlow-income families with very young children to access a range of \ncritical services all in one place. When starting kindergarten, \nchildren whose families participated in Judy Center programs performed \nbetter than those whose families did not.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Dold). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds \nto the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. Judy Centers are helping to close that gap.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill because it is \na step forward. It is an indication, as well, that we can work in a \nbipartisan fashion to the benefit of the people we represent. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this conference report.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo), a member of the committee.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support \nof the Every Student Succeeds Act. I want to thank my colleagues on the \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce for their tireless efforts to \nimprove K-12 education for all students, especially Chairman Kline, \nChairman Rokita, and Ranking Members Scott and Fudge.\n  Throughout this process, we have identified the successes and \nfailures of No Child Left Behind. This agreement allows us to capture \nthe spirit of that last ESEA reauthorization: education is the great \ncivil rights issue of our time, and every child in this country can \nlearn, no matter the color of their skin, the ZIP Code they live in, \nthe language their parents speak, or their income level.\n  We also learned from the failures of No Child Left Behind that led to \nan overly rigid, one-size-fits-all accountability system, inevitably \ngiving the Federal Government an outsized role in public education. \nThat is why the legislation before us today returns decisionmaking \nauthority to States and local school districts, empowering communities \nand giving America's teachers the respect they deserve.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill we are considering today \nincludes my amendment, which will ensure that children learning English \nare counted without being counted out, and that the teachers and \nschools who serve them are given more time to help these students \nsucceed.\n  As a former member of the Miami-Dade County School Board, I am proud \nto have been a part of this process as a conferee. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in favor of this bipartisan compromise. This agreement promotes \nschool choice, empowers local leaders, and, most importantly, puts \nchildren, not Washington bureaucrats, at the center of America's \neducation system.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, could you advise us how much time \nis still available on both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 13\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Minnesota has 14\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, the students, educators, parents, and \nschool board members I have spoken with over the years have been \nwaiting for this day, and I am glad we are finally reaching agreement \non a new education law, and we are going to leave behind No Child Left \nBehind.\n  It was a well-intentioned law. Its goal was to create more equitable \neducation for children across the country, but it resulted in too much \nemphasis on one-size-fits-all mandates and interventions, and the \nadequate yearly progress requirements caused too much focus on high-\nstakes testing. Change is long overdue.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act returns flexibility to States and \nschool districts to design interventions that address the specific \nneeds of their schools. Importantly, it has States use multiple \nmeasures of academic progress in their accountability systems so no \nschools will be punished for the performance of students on a single \nexam. They can focus on addressing resource inequalities and improving \nschool climate and delivering access to advanced coursework and rich \ncurricula.\n  After hearing frequent concerns from students and teachers about the \nneed for fewer, better assessments, I am pleased that the Every Student \nSucceeds Act includes a bipartisan provision I authored with \nCongressman Ryan Costello to help school districts eliminate \nunnecessary testing.\n  The bill also improves STEM learning by encouraging the incorporation \nof art, music, and design. A well-rounded education that teaches our \nstudents to think creatively is good for their futures and good for the \ninnovation economy.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act has States set high standards for \nstudents. It requires States and school districts to intervene in \nschools where students have poor academic outcomes and where subgroups \nof students, such as English learners, low-income students, or students \nof color, lag behind their peers.\n  The law we are voting on today is true to the legacy of the original \nElementary and Secondary Education Act and its goal of closing \nachievement gaps and promoting equitable opportunities and outcomes for \nstudents.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Kline and Chairman Alexander and \nRanking Members Scott and Murray and their very hardworking staffs for \ntheir commitment to this bipartisan accomplishment.\n  I support the Every Student Succeeds Act and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, in an effort to balance the speakers on each \nside, I will reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman not only \nfor yielding, but for his and Chairman Kline's hard work on this bill.\n  I rise today in support of the Every Student Succeeds Act. Defending \npublic education is one of the reasons that I came to Congress. For \nyears, we have witnessed a negative impact on public education, from \nunderfunding our schools to stripping teachers of their rights to \ncollectively bargain for fair pay and conditions, like in my home State \nof Wisconsin.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  At the same time, punitive policies which limit teachers' and \nadministrators' abilities to manage their classrooms have further \nhampered student achievement. It is past time we renew the promise of \nan ESEA which has students' best interests at heart.\n  I meet with teachers and administrators from Wisconsin's Second \nCongressional District regularly and was stunned when I was told that \none-third of a school's staff turned over last year because schools \nlack the financial support and autonomy they need to give students the \neducational experience they deserve. Teachers are being asked to do \nmore with less, and it is coming at the expense of our kids' education.\n  While this bill is not perfect, I am pleased that we are finally \ndiscussing a bill today that aims to put students first and trusts our \nteachers, who dedicate their careers to education. This bill trusts and \nempowers teachers to ensure their voices are heard on the Federal, \nState, and local level, while increasing teacher quality and \nprofessional development and reducing the burden of testing in schools.\n  These are good improvements, Mr. Speaker, good for our Nation's \nchildren. And that is why I support this bill.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Bishop), another member of the committee.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I would too like to voice my \nappreciation to Chairman Kline and the ranking member for their hard \nwork on this legislation.\n  I am a father of three children in the K-12 education system in my \nhometown. And I think all of us would agree\n\n[[Page H8890]]\n\nhere that we have a moral obligation to ensure the best possible \neducational environment for our children.\n  Unfortunately, the past 25 years have seen student achievement \nactually go down. We can blame that on a lot of things. There is plenty \nof blame to go around. But the best question that we can ask today is: \nWhat is Congress going to do about it?\n  And the answer, I believe, begins with the Every Student Succeeds \nAct. It is a bipartisan bill that helps to limit the role of Federal \nbureaucrats, restore local control, and empower parents.\n  The Wall Street Journal has called this ``the largest shift of \nFederal control to the States in a quarter-century.'' And they are \nprecisely correct. It gives more flexibility back to local school \ndistricts and gives States the right to set their own standards. So if \na State wants out of Common Core, they would have the option to do \nthat.\n  What is more, parents can get information on local school performance \nso they can do what is best for their children. And when it comes to \nholding schools accountable, State and local leaders will get that \nresponsibility back, as they should.\n  But, above all, this bill replaces the No Child Left Behind Act. I \nthink we can all agree that our current system is broken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. So let's make a difference here today and \nadopt a smart public policy. Do it for our children. Make sure that \nthey have an excellent education.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Every Student Succeeds \nAct.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Kline and \nRanking Member Scott for their leadership on this bill and for proving \nthat Congress can listen to our educators, administrators, and \ncommunities and put the needs of our students first.\n  We all know that a great country deserves great schools. And I am \npleased to join champions of education in both Chambers, both sides of \nthe aisle, in supporting this blueprint for schools that invites every \nchild to participate, no matter a child's income, race, ZIP Code, or \ndisability.\n  This bill helps fulfill the unrealized promise of No Child Left \nBehind by protecting resources for schools in underserved communities. \nIt provides accountability and equality of access while reducing \nreliance on high-stakes tests. It creates opportunities for our most \nvulnerable students--homeless and foster youth--who have suffered abuse \nand those who have experienced trauma. And, for the first time, we have \na bill that invests in early learning through Preschool Development \nGrants.\n  This legislation brings us closer to ensuring that every child gets a \nfair shot at their dream.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work and commitment to our country's \nchildren and to our economic future.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).\n  Ms. ADAMS. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \nplayed a major role in ensuring all students have access to quality \neducation. Because of this legislation, over the past 50 years, we have \nmade remarkable progress in closing the achievement gap that plagues \nmany low-income students. However, we still have a lot of work to do.\n  The last reauthorization, No Child Left Behind, was signed into law \nin 2002 and hasn't been updated since. In that time, we have seen many \nchanges in our education system and the needs of our students and \neducators, in addition to the unintended consequences of No Child Left \nBehind.\n  So I am proud today that we are finally moving forward with a \nbipartisan bill that keeps the best interests of American students and \neducators in mind. The Every Student Succeeds Act is a true embodiment \nof what a stronger reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nshould look like.\n  This legislation upholds the key principles of equal access to \neducation for all, rich or poor, and upholds accountability systems \nthat ensure success. From promoting access to early education to \nsupporting our neediest students and our teachers and investing in STEM \neducation, this legislation puts our students first and helps to close \nachievement gaps.\n  Our children are our future. Educating them shouldn't be a Democrat \nor a Republican issue. So I urge all of my colleagues to support our \nstudents by supporting this critical bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the chairman as well as the ranking member for \ntheir hard work on this bill. Thank you for getting us to this \nimportant day.\n  Today, I rise in support of the Every Student Succeeds Act. This \nbicameral legislation improves K-12 education by repealing No Child \nLeft Behind and scales back Washington's role in education by restoring \nauthority to those who know our students best.\n  As we have seen, the current top-down approach is not working. The \narms of Washington have extended far too long into the classroom. We \nneed a change; American students deserve a change. And the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act is a powerful step forward in reforming our \neducational system.\n  This legislation stops Federal micromanagement of local schools, gets \nrid of unnecessary programs, downsizes the Federal education \nbureaucracy, places new restrictions on the authority of the Secretary \nof Education, and, most importantly, restores control back to the local \nlevel, letting States and school districts address the needs of our \nstudents.\n  Teachers, school officials, and parents have an ear to the ground \neach day. They know what our schoolchildren need to succeed. This is \nwhat I hear every time I am in the district. Washington bureaucrats do \nnot belong in the classroom.\n  I am proud to support this legislation that gives students the tools \nthey need for a successful future. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' \non the conference report.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 7 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Minnesota has 11\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to say what a pleasure it is to be here to \nsupport the Every Student Succeeds Act, having spent much of my first \nyear in the district going to school districts and schools.\n  And I will be able to go back in the coming weeks and say that we \nhave this bipartisan compromise through the hard work of Chairman Kline \nand Ranking Member Scott and Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member \nMurray. So I congratulate and thank them for their hard work.\n  I am also pleased to see that a number of priorities I share with my \nDemocratic and Republican colleagues were included in the final version \nof the landmark bill.\n  The conference report for Every Student Succeeds Act sets national \neducation standards that ensure all American students, regardless of \ngeography, socioeconomic status, race, or gender, receive a quality \neducation.\n  Included in the bill are several measures that I am proud to have \nworked on with colleagues which are meant to protect students. I am \npleased that a number of them, such as promoting efficient and \neffective Head Start programs, protecting student athletes from \nconcussions, and providing students with academic and extracurricular \nsupport beyond the normal school day, which we know is important, were \nincluded.\n  While the concussion-related provisions of the bill are an important \nfirst step, it does not go far enough to combat the devastating \nphysical and neurological impacts of brain injuries like those we \nrecently heard about sustained by Hall of Fame football player Frank \nGifford. There is a demonstrated need for increased vigilance and \nimproved education on this important\n\n[[Page H8891]]\n\ntopic, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on this and \nother issues.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member, and I \nurge all my colleagues to support this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, when ESEA was first signed in 1965, it was a \ncritical piece of civil rights legislation. In fact, when President \nLyndon Johnson signed the bill, he said it bridges the gap between \nhelplessness and hope for millions of students affected by it.\n  The bill before us today maintains President Johnson's commitment to \nthe achievement of every child, regardless of race, socioeconomic \nbackground, or ZIP Code.\n  Many of my colleagues have talked about the new flexibility provided \nin the bill. Well, that is true, but it is flexibility to meet the \nlearning needs of every kid, not the flexibility to fail.\n  Flexibility does not mean freedom from responsibility. States are \naccountable for the achievement of each and every child under this \nbill, and I am confident that President Obama wouldn't sign any bill \nthat doesn't maintain strong civil rights protections. And I would \nnever support a bill that would allow students to be swept under the \nrug.\n  This bill upholds the spirit of the original Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. I am proud to support it today and support innovative \nsolutions to improve the opportunities for learning that every child in \nour country has.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, a lot has been said about the work being done in this \ncommittee. I think it is important to point out that the chair and I \ndidn't do all this work. His staff, Senator Murray's staff, and Senator \nAlexander's staff worked hard.\n  I would like to read the names of some of the members of my staff \nthat worked on this legislation, starting with Denise Forte, Brian \nKennedy, Jacque Chevalier, Helen Pajcic, Christian Haines, Kevin \nMcDermott, Alex Payne, Kiara Pesante, Arika Trim, Rayna Reid, Michael \nTaylor, Austin Barbera, and Veronique Pluviose.\n  Also, House Legislation Council staff Anna Shpak, Susan Fleishman, \nand Brendan Gallagher worked hard on this legislation; and \nCongressional Research Service staff Becky Skinner and Jody Feder.\n  I would like to mention those names as hardworking members that have \nbrought about all of this bipartisan cooperation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Democratic \nleader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his \nextraordinary leadership as the new ranking member on the Education and \nthe Workforce Committee, bringing with him all of his commitment to \neducation in our country as well as his knowledge of the connection of \nyoung people to our justice system and how to provide opportunities for \nthem in the safest possible way. I thank Mr. Scott for his great \nleadership.\n  We are all very, very proud of you. I know your predecessor in this \nrole, Mr. George Miller, would be as well.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  I thank you, Chairman Kline, for your leadership as well and for \nenabling this bipartisan legislation to come to the floor. I salute the \nchairman and ranking member in the Senate as well.\n  Fifty years ago our Nation took a bold and historic step forward for \neducational opportunity, for the strength of our economy, and for the \nhealth of our democracy, which is based on an informed electorate, \nenacting the ESEA.\n  Today the Elementary and Secondary Education Act stands as one of the \nlandmark victories in both the struggle for civil rights and the War on \nPoverty.\n  At the bill signing in 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson, himself a \nformer teacher, explained: ``No law I have signed or will ever sign \nmeans more to the future of America.'' President Johnson added: \n``Education is the only valid passport from poverty.''\n  In addition to what it returns to the individual and enables that \nperson to reach his or her aspirations, education brings much to our \neconomy. In fact, nothing brings more to the Treasury of our country \nthan investments in education, from early childhood education, K-12, \nwhich we are addressing today, higher education, postsecondary \neducation, lifetime learning.\n  Indeed, the ESEA's commitment to expanding education access, \nespecially to our most vulnerable students, has proven essential to \nbridging the gap between poverty and possibility for generations of \nAmericans.\n  Yet, for the first time in our Nation's history, more than half of \nthe students attending public school live in poverty. To close the \nopportunity gap, we must close the education gap that limits the future \nof so many children and communities.\n  Today we are thankful to be passing a bipartisan agreement that will \nstrengthen the education of all of our children. It helps States to \nimprove low-performing schools and empowers teachers and administrators \nwith better training and support.\n  It targets funding to the most at-risk and needy students, with \nenhanced title I investments. It provides vital resources for English \nlanguage learners and homeless youth.\n  It amplifies the voices of educators and parents, what we have always \nwanted, schools, a place where children can learn, teachers can teach, \nand parents can participate. It replaces high-stakes testing with State \nand local district flexibility.\n  We are bolstering our commitment to strong STEM, arts, and early \neducation for children in every ZIP code.\n  In our area and other parts of the country, we call STEM STEAM, \nScience, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics, all of that \nreinforced in this legislation.\n  With these improvements in the ESEA authorization before us, it is no \nwonder that this agreement is supported by a far-ranging coalition, \nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the \nNational Governors Association, the Leadership Conference of Civil and \nHuman Rights, AFT and NEA, two leading teachers unions, the National \nCenter for Learning Disabilities, and many more.\n  We all agree that education is a national security issue. President \nEisenhower taught us that. It is also an economic issue. It is one of \nthe most pressing civil rights issues of our time.\n  With this legislation, we help ensure that access to high-quality \neducation is the right of every student.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this strong bipartisan \nreauthorization of the historic ESEA, the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  Once again I thank the distinguished chairman, Mr. Kline, and our \nranking member, of whom we are very, very, proud as well, Mr. Scott.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  As has already been pointed out, this bill does not include \neverything everybody wanted. But the civil rights and education \ncommunity both support the legislation because of the significant civil \nrights implications in the bill. This will go a long way in giving \nequal opportunity in education.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a long list of education and \ncivil rights organizations that have endorsed the bill.\n\n                      ESSA Endorsement Master List\n\n       Alliance for Excellent Education (AEE), American Federation \n     of School Administrators (AFSA), American Federation of \n     Teachers (AFT), American Library Association (ALA), \n     Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), \n     Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD), \n     Business Roundtable (BRT), Business Civil Rights Coalition, \n     California Children's Advocacy Coalition, Chiefs for Change \n     (C4C), Communities in Schools (CIS), Consortium for Citizens \n     with Disabilities (CCD), Cooperative Council for Oklahoma \n     School Administration (CCOSA), Council for Exceptional \n     Children\n\n[[Page H8892]]\n\n     (CEC), Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), \n     Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA), Council of \n     the Great City Schools (CGCS), Democrats for Education Reform \n     (DFER), Easter Seals, Education Trust.\n       Grantmakers in the Arts (GIRTS), Interstate Migrant \n     Education Council (IMEC), Knowledge Alliance (KA), Los \n     Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), Magnet Schools of \n     America (MSA), National Alliance for Public Charter Schools \n     (NAPCS), National Association of Charter School Authorizers \n     (NACSA), National Association of Councils on Developmental \n     Disabilities (NACDD), National Association of Elementary \n     School Principals (NAESP), National Association of Federally \n     Impacted Schools (NAFIS), National Association of School \n     Psychologists (NASP), National Association of Secondary \n     School Principals (NASSP), National Association of State \n     Boards of Education (NASBE), National Center for Learning \n     Disabilities (NCLD), National Center for Special Education in \n     Charter Schools (NCSECS), National Center for Technological \n     Literacy (NCTL), National Council of La Raza (NCLR), National \n     Council of State Legislatures (NCSL), National Disability \n     Rights Network (NDRN), National Education Association (NEA).\n       National Governors Association (NGA), National PTA, \n     National School Boards Association (NSBA), PACER Center, \n     Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA), STEM \n     Education Coalition, Teach For America (TFA), The Leadership \n     Conference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCHR), The School \n     Superintendents Association (AASA), Union of Orthodox Jewish \n     Congregations of America (OU), US Chamber of Commerce, United \n     Way Worldwide.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for his \ncooperation and hard work, and I urge our Members to support the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to start by thanking my colleagues on the committee in the \nHouse and in the Senate, particularly the Ranking Member, Mr. Scott, \nSenators Alexander and Murray, and their staffs. We would absolutely \nnot be here today without their hard work.\n  Today is a big day. We have an important opportunity to approve a \nbill that will replace No Child Left Behind with new policies that \nreduce the Federal role, restore local control, and empower parents, \nthree principles that will help every child in every school receive a \nquality education.\n  This effort began in earnest almost 5 years ago. It was February 10, \n2011, when the Education and the Workforce Committee held its first \nhearing under the new Republican majority to examine the challenges and \nopportunities facing K-12 classrooms.\n  Since that first hearing, we have held dozens of hearings and \nmultiple markups and spent many hours on the floor considering \namendments and debating competing ideas for improving education. All of \nthose efforts are reflected in the final bill we have today.\n  Behind all of that hard work was a team of dedicated staff. They put \nin long hours and sacrificed a great deal to draft the House and Senate \nproposals, move them through our respective committees and chambers, \nand then went to work developing this bipartisan, bicameral bill we are \ndiscussing today.\n  My friend and colleague, the ranking member, Mr. Scott, talked about \nmembers of his staff and what a fantastic job they have done, and I \nknow from many reports that they put in an awful lot of hours.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, this process has been underway for so long that \nsome staff who started this journey with us have now moved on to other \nendeavors: former staffers, including James Bergeron, Alex Sollberger, \nCasey Buboltz, Heather Couri, Dan Shorts, Matt Frame, Angelyn Shapiro, \nand Barrett Karr.\n  And then there are those who are with us today and many who have been \na part of this effort from the beginning. I wish I had time to \nrecognize everybody, but I have a few minutes and am going to recognize \nquite a few of them: Republican staff members on our committee, \nincluding Janelle Belland, Krisann Pearce, Lauren Aronson, Dominique \nMcKay, Lauren Reddington, Sheariah Yousefi, James Forester, Kathlyn \nEhl, Leslie Tatum, Mandy Schaumburg, Brian Newell.\n  Of course, I would like to recognize the Republican Staff Director, \nJuliane Sullivan, who always leads the team with patience, skill, and \ndetermination; Amy Jones, our education policy staff director, who was \na firm, yet fair, negotiator throughout the entire process.\n  And last, but certainly not least, our senior education policy \nadvisor is Brad Thomas, sitting here patiently beside me today. \nAccording to our most recent estimates, Brad has spent more than 60 \nstraight days here at the office working out the details of this final \nbill. We could not have done it without his knowledge, expertise, and \ndedication.\n  Brad, we are grateful for your service.\n  Again, because of the hard work of both Republican and Democrat staff \non the Education and the Workforce Committee, as well as the staff of \nSenators Murray and Alexander, we will soon have a new education law \nthat helps every child in every school receive an excellent education.\n  I would remind all of my colleagues that, when we come in to vote a \nlittle later this afternoon, it is a binary choice. You can vote for \nthis new direction, give our children a better opportunity, or you can \nvote to keep No Child Left Behind the law of the land. It is an either-\nor choice.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the conference report to \naccompany S. 1177.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I support the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act. It preserves critical civil rights protections \nfor students, maintains the historic commitment to low-income children \nand communities, and strikes a delicate balance between federal \naccountability and state flexibility to meet local needs. I thank \nRanking Member Bobby Scott and Chairman Kline--as well as the former \nCommittee leaders George Miller and Buck McKeon--for their leadership. \nThis is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill. It represents an \nimprovement over the current waiver process and over the outdated, one-\nsize-fits-all, punitive No Child Left Behind law. I especially am proud \nthat the bill includes multiple provisions that I have championed for \nyears.\n  Foremost, the bill maintains federal accountability in public \neducation. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act at its heart is a \ncivil rights law, and, as such, it is essential that the federal \ngovernment provide oversight to ensure equal educational opportunity \nunder the law. Although the bill transfers considerable power to the \nstates to oversee their improvement and limits some Secretarial \nauthority, it requires states to take action in every school in which \nany group of students is consistently underperforming under the state's \naccountability system, in all high school dropout factories where one-\nthird or more of students fail to graduate, and in the lowest-\nperforming 5 percent of schools.\n  The bill enhances transparency into the educational success of \nvulnerable students. Many years ago, I wanted to know how African \nAmerican boys were doing in school only to learn that we did not know \nbecause we did not collect student data in a way to answer that \nquestion. I have fought to change this because we cannot develop \neducational interventions to help students--especially vulnerable \nstudents--if we lack a clear understanding of how various groups of \nstudents are learning. This bill requires reporting of outcomes and \nindicators by important student characteristics to inform our \nunderstanding of student learning and direct interventions.\n  Further, the bill adds to the our understanding of student \nexperiences by including critical information about discipline \npractices, including rate of suspensions, expulsions, referrals to law \nenforcement, and school-related arrests. Given that African Americans--\nespecially African-American boys--disproportionately experience harsh \ndiscipline that contributes to the school-to-prison pipeline, clear \ninformation about actual practice is key. Importantly, the bill also \ndiscourages the overuse of exclusionary and dangerous discipline \npractices by requiring state plans to describe how they will improve \nlearning by decreasing such practices. Similarly, the Every Student \nSucceeds Act promises to improve the school environment for students by \ndecreasing bullying. For over a decade I have led a bill to direct \ngreater federal resources to promote bullying-free learning \nenvironments. In addition to requiring states and districts to report \nincidents of discipline, bullying, and harassment, the bill provides \nfunding for states and localities to implement evidenced-based positive \nbehavioral interventions and supports and other successful approaches \nthat improve behavior, reduce harsh discipline, and decrease bullying \nand harassment so that teachers can teach and students can learn.\n  The bill addresses key educational challenges for foster youth for \nwhich I have advocated, including: ensuring that foster youth can \nremain in their current school when they enter care or change \nplacements when doing so is in their best interest; allowing immediate \nenrollment in a new school, prompt access to\n\n[[Page H8893]]\n\neducational records, and assistance in transferring and recovering \ncredits to remain on track for graduation; assuring a point of contact \nfor foster youth within the education system when such a contact exists \nin the corresponding child welfare agency; requiring school districts \nand child welfare agencies to work together to ensure funding for \ntransportation exists to allow students to remain in their schools of \norigin and to remove negative effects of unreliable transportation; and \nmandating that the Department of Education and Health and Human \nServices report on the progress made in and remaining barriers to \naddressing educational stability. Further, the bill requires states and \nlocalities to report on the student outcomes of foster youth and \nhomeless youth to better understand their educational attainment.\n  The bill provides critical protections for students with disabilities \nthat I have promoted, such as advancing high learning standards for \nstudents with the most significant disabilities. It caps the use of \nalternative, less-rigorous tests for students with the most significant \ncognitive disabilities at one percent of all students and prohibits \nstates from counting lesser credentials as a regular high school \ndiploma.\n  The bill does many additional important things. It invests in \nteachers by improving professional supports, recognizing that states \nand localities are better-suited to implement teacher evaluations than \nfederal officials, and requiring collaboration with teachers and the \nprohibition on overturning existing collective bargaining agreements if \nstates voluntarily develop teacher evaluation programs. It helps \nimprove equitable distribution of resources among school districts, \npromotes responsible testing policies that reduce over-testing and \ndiscourage the use of tests for high-stakes decisions, expands early \nchildhood education, increases federal investment in education, and \nmaintains the historic and necessary state financial commitment to \neducation.\n  This bill does raise concerns and the need for vigilance. With the \ngreater responsibility given to states, there is a heightened need for \nmonitoring by the federal government, advocates, and the civil rights \ncommunity to ensure that critical supports go to the schools and \nstudents in need to close achievement gaps and improve learning.\n  This is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill that advances \neducational opportunity. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nits passage.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I am honored today to support the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act.\n  This bipartisan bill will end the unworkable, one-size-fits all No \nChild Left Behind Act and give control of our kids' education back to \nour states, local school districts, teachers, and parents. I have \nalways believed that educational decisions are best left to the people \nwho are closest to the students, and that means moving power out of \nWashington, D.C. and back into our own communities.\n  It restores state and local control by allowing states to opt out of \nfederal education programs, protecting states' abilities to control \ntheir own standards and assessments, and providing school districts \nwith more funding flexibility.\n  It empowers parents by preventing federal interference in private and \nhome schools, promoting school choice by strengthening charter and \nmagnet schools, and allowing funds in eligible school districts to \nfollow students to the schools they actually attend.\n  And, it includes unprecedented restrictions on the Secretary of \nEducation's authority, and prevents the federal government from \nrequiring or coercing states to adopt the Common Core curriculum.\n  Most importantly, it reauthorizes the 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters (21st CCLC) program as a separate and directed federal funding \nstream under Title IV.\n  The 21st CCLC program is the only federal funding source for our \nnation's afterschool programs, which students and working families \nacross America rely on each and every day. In my district in \nPennsylvania, the program provides 49 percent of total funding for \nSHINE, or ``Schools and Homes In Education,'' a successful afterschool \neducational program in Carbon and Luzerne counties.\n  I have worked on SHINE for many years back home with my friend, state \nSenator John Yudichak--a Democrat--because helping our kids succeed \nshould always be a bipartisan cause. And, we have succeeded in making \nit one today.\n  Afterschool programs like SHINE are known to improve academic \nachievement, increase school attendance, and engage families in \neducation. They also keep our kids safe resulting in lower incidences \nof drug-use and violence.\n  Where I'm from in Pennsylvania, this is extremely important. Gangs \nhave become a big and persistent problem in some of our neighborhoods.\n  In the end, this is truly a banner day for the school children of \nnortheastern Pennsylvania and across the country. SHINE and countless \nother afterschool programs have touched so many families and given kids \neducation opportunities they otherwise would not have had.\n  I know these programs help families and I can assure my constituents \nthat I will continue to advocate and support afterschool programs here \nin Congress both now and in the future.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my \nsupport for the Every Student Succeeds Act. This bill is a much-needed \nimprovement to No Child Left Behind (NCLB). The fundamental purpose of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was created to ensure \nthat disadvantaged children are provided a high-quality education that \nallows them to compete on a level playing field with their more-\nadvantaged peers. I believe this bill is a step in the right direction.\n  I believe No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is flawed and must be reformed. \nReauthorization presents a tremendous opportunity to make much-needed \nimprovements and brings our education system into the 21st century.\n  For too many years, Congress has stalled in updating the standards \nfor our nation's students. I applaud the efforts of this body for \nworking across the aisle to make sure that every student has the tools \nthey need to succeed.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act strengthens critical programs and uses \nfunds for the promotion of innovation, increased access to STEM \neducation, arts education, literacy, community involvement in schools, \nteacher quality, and other important programs.\n  This conference authorizes the Preschool Development Grants program \nthat will supplement existing funds to improve coordination, quality \nand access for early childhood education.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Every Student Succeeds Act and \nsupport reauthorization that restores our nation's commitment to \nproviding equal opportunity for all students regardless of their \nbackground and protect our country's students including the most \nvulnerable, which was the intention of this landmark civil rights law.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Every Student \nSucceeds Act to finally address serious flaws in federal education law \nand reject the old ``one-size-fits-all'' approach while continuing to \nhold states and schools accountable for the learning of every child. I \nthank Ranking Member Bobby Scott for his tireless efforts to support \nstudents in underserved communities and close the achievement gap.\n  Today's bill provides needed flexibility in the classroom while \nmaintaining ``guardrails'' to make sure that all students have the \nopportunity to succeed. It scales back the singular focus on high-\nstakes testing with a broader and more representative accountability \nsystem that will help identify and address gaps. It includes evidence-\nbased interventions for schools where students aren't learning or \naren't graduating. And it targets resources to the students who need \nthem most.\n  The bill allows for funding for critical supports, including mental \nhealth, drug and violence prevention, and Youth PROMISE plans. There \nare resources for a well-rounded education, including arts, geography, \nhistory, and foreign language. Dedicated funding is preserved for \nPromise Neighborhoods and Full-Service Community Schools to coordinate \nservices for children and families, and for afterschool programs to \nprovide out-of-school time opportunities. It will be critical to \nprovide adequate funding for these priorities through the \nappropriations process.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act includes important funding for early \nchildhood education programs that help provide a strong start for \nchildren. I strongly support efforts to provide universal pre-K, and \ntoday's bill is a good step to improving coordination of early learning \nopportunities. Today's bill is not perfect, but it is a strong \ncompromise and a critical improvement over current law. As Congress has \nworked to rewrite this law, I am grateful to the teachers, parents, \nadministrators, school board members, students, and many others in \nMaryland schools who have shared their experiences and input with me. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with them to ensure that this \nlegislation is implemented and funded in a way that works for our \nschools and students.\n  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act (ESSA), a reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. The ESEA was a landmark civil \nrights bill that boosted the academic achievement of low-income and \nminority students, and I am pleased to see its much-needed \nreauthorization, following its previous reauthorization in the 2001 No \nChild Left Behind Act. I must acknowledge, however, that the ESSA is \nnot a perfect bill. For example, this bill does not require student \ndata to be disaggregated for Asian American and Pacific Islander \nsubgroups, and does not require states to act if federal resources are \ngiven inequitably to schools.\n\n[[Page H8894]]\n\n  However, the bill is a significant improvement over the No Child Left \nBehind Act and the ESEA reauthorization that passed out of the House \nearlier this year. For example, I was heartened to see that the bill \nincludes academic standards that will prepare students for college and \ncareers, requirements for states to intervene in schools in need of \ngovernment support, removal of No Child Left Behind's most punitive \nprovisions, and increased monitoring, regulation, and focus on the \nunique needs of English Language Learners. These provisions are \ncritical to helping underserved students achieve academic and lifelong \nsuccess.\n  I was also pleased to see that the ESSA includes strong language to \naddress violence in our schools and communities. For example, it \nmaintains dedicated funding for afterschool programs and makes violence \nprevention and trauma support efforts eligible for federal funds, \nprovisions which Congresswoman Karen Bass and I urged in a letter to \neducation leaders last month.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to stand in support of this bipartisan \nlegislation in order to improve the quality of education received by \nour country's most vulnerable students.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer the following Joint \nStatement of Legislative Intent on the Conference Report to accompany \nS. 1177, the Every Student Succeeds Act, on behalf of myself and Mr. \nJohn Kline, Chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee.\n\n\nJoint Statement of Legislative Intent on Conference Report to accompany \n                S. 1177, the Every Student Succeeds Act\n\n       Like our colleagues, we support this conference report \n     because we believe states and school districts should be left \n     to set their own education priorities. The House-passed bill \n     included strong prohibitions that clearly did just that. The \n     conference report maintains strong, unprecedented \n     prohibitions on the Secretary of Education. For example,\n       Section 1111(e) clearly states the Secretary may not add \n     any requirements or criteria outside the scope of this act, \n     and further says the Secretary may not ``be in excess of \n     statutory authority given to the Secretary.'' This section \n     goes on to lay out specific terms the Secretary cannot \n     prescribe, sets clear limits on the guidance the Secretary \n     may offer, and also clearly states that the Secretary is \n     prohibited from defining terms that are inconsistent with or \n     outside the scope of this Act.\n       Then there are provisions in Titles I and VIII that ensure \n     standards and curriculum are left to the discretion of states \n     without federal control or mandates, and the same is true for \n     assessments.\n       Finally, the conference report also includes a Sense of \n     Congress that states and local educational agencies retain \n     the right and responsibility of determining educational \n     curriculum, programs of instruction, and assessments.\n\n  The conference report makes it clear the Secretary is not to put any \nundue limits on the ability of states to determine their accountability \nsystems, their standards, or what tests they give their students. The \nclear intent and legislative language of this report devolves authority \nover education decisions back to the states and severely limits the \nSecretary's ability to interfere in any way.\n  Ensuring a limited role for the U.S. Secretary of Education was a \ncritically important priority throughout the reauthorization process \nand this agreement meets that priority.\n  For example, the Secretary may not limit the ability of states to \ndetermine how the measures of student performance are weighted within \nstate accountability systems. The Secretary also cannot prescribe \nschool support and improvement strategies, or any aspect of a state's \nteacher evaluation system, or the methodology used to differentiate \nschools in a state.\n  Also, the Secretary may not create new policy by creatively defining \nterms in the law. Let us say definitively, as the Chairman of the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee and Subcommittee Chairman of the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction, this new law reins in the Secretary and \nensures state and local education officials make the decisions about \ntheir schools under this new law.\n  Over the past few years, the Secretary has exceeded his authority by \nplacing conditions on waivers to states and local educational agencies. \nThe conference report prevents the Secretary from applying any new \nconditions on waivers or the state plans required in the law by \nincluding language that clearly states the Secretary may not add any \nnew conditions for the approval of waivers or state plans that are \noutside the scope of the law. In plain English, this means if the law \ndoes not give the Secretary the authority to require something, then he \nmay not unilaterally create an ability to do that.\n  We are glad to be able to support a bill that will return control to \nstates, where it should always be, and appreciate the strong support of \ncolleagues as well.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on the conference report.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. KLINE.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes a number of provisions, some of \nwhich have already been enacted into law, and makes technical and \nconforming changes to the reported text of H.R. 8, H.R. 2295, and H.R. \n2358. So the overall bill, I would say, H.R. 8, is a broad, bipartisan \nbill. It seeks to maximize America's energy potential, and it seeks to \nupdate and modernize outdated policies rooted in an era of energy \nscarcity to reflect today's era of energy abundance. I think that this \nis a good amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, how in the world did we get to this point? How did we \nget to the point of the majority party bringing forth this highly \npartisan, backwards-looking, does-more-harm-than-good so-called energy \nbill after all the time and all the effort that was put forth by both \nsides to come up with a bipartisan compromise?\n  Mr. Chairman, after working together for the majority of this year, \nliterally moments before the full Energy and Commerce Committee was set \nto mark up this bill, the rug was pulled out from under the minority \nside, and the Republicans turned their collective back on the \nlegislative compromise.\n  We were informed that the majority had reneged on its prior \ncommitments, and what was initially supposed to be an infrastructure \nbill would contain no actual funding for any infrastructure projects--\nnot one red cent.\n  In addition to reneging on a promise to fund a grid modernization \nprogram and a pipeline replacement program that would have benefited \nlow-income consumers, the majority has also stripped the one provision \nof the bill that received widespread praise and support from both sides \nof the aisle.\n  The 21st Century Workforce title that my office had authored has been \nstripped from this awful excuse for a comprehensive energy bill.\n  It would seem, Mr. Chairman, that all of the care and support that my \nRepublican colleagues professed to have for helping minorities, women, \nand veterans find good-paying energy jobs and careers has somehow not \nonly dissipated, but has totally disappeared.\n  It would appear, Mr. Chairman, that due to the apathy and \nindifference of a few highly privileged desk jockey elitists from the \nHeritage Foundation, helping to improve the plight of millions of \ndisadvantaged Americans who have been historically underserved and \nunderemployed within the energy sector is now considered to be, to use \ntheir very words, ``wasteful, ineffective, and inefficient.''\n  So, what we are left, Mr. Chairman, with is this: What aspects of \nthis bill can we take back to our constituents? What aspects of this \nbill can we tell our constituents with a straight face will help them \nimprove their lives?\n  All this bill does, Mr. Chairman, is attempt to strip away oversight \nand roll back regulations in order to help industry game the system and \nincrease its profit at the expense of the American people. Mr. \nChairman, this bill is a sham, and it will actually take the Nation's \nenergy policy backwards, all the way back.\n  Mr. Chairman, the 21st Century Workforce amendment represented a win \nfor industry, a win for our communities, and a win for Americans all. \nDeleting this very provision that was unanimously approved in committee \nspeaks volumes about the majority's commitment to minorities, to women, \nand to veterans. This bill, H.R. 8, leaves women behind, it leaves \nminorities behind, it leaves veterans behind, it leaves low-income \ncommunities behind, and it leaves America behind.\n  Mr. Chairman, for this reason, I oppose the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I ask for a favorable vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Tonko\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 5, through page 10, line 3, strike section \n     1101.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Tonko) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply strikes section 1101 of the \nunderlying bill. The section is a solution in search of a problem. The \nsection's purported goal is to reinforce the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission's role as the lead agency for siting interstate natural gas \npipelines; however, I do not think there is any doubt over FERC's role \nin pipeline siting approval.\n  In reality, this section is designed to further expedite permitting \nfor natural gas pipelines. But there is very little evidence that this \nprocess needs expediting, which ultimately would restrict States and \nother Federal agencies' ability to review projects and the public's \nability to comment on them.\n  Mr. Chairman, the GAO looked at the approval process for pipelines by \nFERC and found 95 percent are approved within 2 years. When it takes \nlonger, it is because the project is large or controversial due to \ntaking of private property, traversing State or Federal land, or \nrequiring placement of compression stations and other operation \nequipment in an area close to existing infrastructure or communities.\n  Even the industry agrees that pipeline approvals are happening. In \nOctober, Pipelines Digest, an industry publication, wrote:\n\n       Through April 30 of this year, FERC certified and placed in \n     service almost twice as many natural gas projects and more \n     than doubled the miles of pipeline that were put in service \n     and certified through the same date in 2014.\n\n  We are building new pipelines. There is no problem that needs fixing. \nSo what evidence is there that the certification process needs to be \nfurther tilted in favor of pipeline companies at the expense of \nenvironmental review and public comment? I would say there isn't any. \nYet, Mr. Chairman, this section would require FERC to decide on a \npipeline application within 90 days after the Commission issues its \nfinal environmental document, regardless of the complexity of the \napplication.\n  It would also allow FERC to consider environmental data collected by \naerial or other remote surveys instead of onsite inspections. This \nwould enable pipeline companies to circumvent property owners' rights \nwhen surveying land, all in hopes of speeding up projects.\n  The siting of natural gas pipelines is complicated and can be \ncontroversial. I know this well since there are a number of projects \ncurrently being developed in or near the district I represent. I hear \nfrom my constituents about these projects regularly. They are very \nconcerned, and they feel like they are being left out of this process. \nThey are concerned about the safety and about the noise, air, and water \npollution from the construction and operation of the pipeline's \nassociated facilities. The pipeline companies do not have a problem. \nThe public does.\n  We know that these types of projects, no matter how beneficial to the \npublic interest, can be controversial. Someone is always unhappy about \nthe selected route or placement of these facilities. But we need to do \na better job of bringing the public along, and these provisions do the \nopposite.\n  Mr. Chairman, the public has a right to be part of large projects \nthat impact their communities. Does that take extra time? Yes. Is it \nless convenient for the company? Yes. But these pipelines will be in \nservice for many decades. If it is worth doing, it is worth\n\n[[Page H8924]]\n\ndoing right. So I see no reason why we should be expediting projects if \nwe cannot be sure they can be built in a safe and environmentally \nfriendly manner.\n  We need to ensure State and Federal regulators are given the time \nneeded to carefully review applications for the construction of natural \ngas pipelines and to ensure that the landowners and the general public \nhave the ability to participate meaningfully in the siting process. \nThis section undermines that process.\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from \nNew Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) for a brief statement.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New \nYork for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Tonko amendment and \nstrongly urge its adoption.\n  Section 1101 of this misguided energy bill includes a critical \nprovision that I would like to highlight. This language would allow big \nenergy companies to use aerial and remote surveying to circumvent key \nFERC environmental reviews.\n  This troubling provision flies in the face of the rights of local \ngovernments and even private landowners to make decisions about the use \nof their own property. This provision allows Big Energy to bypass more \ncomprehensive and appropriate on-the-ground surveys to assess the \nenvironmental impacts of energy infrastructure.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is one such project that New Jerseyans know all \ntoo well--the PennEast pipeline. PennEast is the proposed 108-mile \nnatural gas pipeline that would run from Pennsylvania, across the \nDelaware River, and terminate in Hopewell Township in my district. If \nbuilt, this pipeline would threaten some of the most environmentally \nsensitive areas in the Delaware River Basin, farmland, watersheds, and \nuninterrupted natural areas.\n  Virtually every local government along the PennEast route has \nofficially lodged their opposition or disapproval. Concerned citizens \nhave packed scoping meetings to make their voices heard to stop this \npipeline. These are diverse communities across two States represented \nby Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. Areas I represent, \nlike Mercer County and Hopewell, and scores of private property owners \nhave exercised their right to deny PennEast access to their property to \ncarry out their surveys.\n  Mr. Chairman, my constituents sent me to Congress to fight for the \nenvironment and to stand up against ill-conceived projects such as this \none.\n  Mr. TONKO. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. Section 1101 makes important \nimprovements to FERC's process for reviewing interstate natural gas \npipelines.\n  As we all know, the demand for natural gas is growing, which requires \nnew and modernized pipeline infrastructure. It has got to happen.\n  Unfortunately, the permitting process is becoming increasingly \ncomplex and challenging. Rate hikes hit the families and businesses \nthat can least afford it the hardest, the most vulnerable. So we have \nworked very diligently to find some agreement on this provision. We \nhave held hearings, received technical assistance from FERC, and \naccepted many of their recommendations.\n  Section 1101 would authorize concurrent permitting reviews, require \nmore transparency through the process, and allow for the use of new \nsurvey technology for citing pipelines.\n  Just yesterday, Mr. Chairman, in a hearing before the House Energy \nand Commerce Committee, FERC Chairman Bay acknowledged the need for new \npipeline capacity and signaled his support for the enhanced \ntransparency provisions and the regulatory dashboard that is required \nby section 1101.\n  So this amendment, if passed, would strike a commonsense approach to \nintroduce greater public transparency and accountability for Federal \nand State permitting agencies, and therefore I would ask for a ``no'' \nvote on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 12, line 23, insert ``and energy storage'' after \n     ``infrastructure''.\n       Page 13, line 19, insert ``the energy storage industry,'' \n     after ``natural gas industry,''.\n       Page 14, line 1, insert ``, the energy storage industry,'' \n     after ``States''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment to the North American Energy \nSecurity and Infrastructure Act will directly enhance reliable energy \nsecurity when our communities are most vulnerable during natural \ndisasters. My amendment simply adds energy storage as a form of energy \nthat the Department of Energy should consider to improve emergency \npreparedness.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  The bill in its current form only addresses the need to have \nresilient oil and natural gas infrastructure, which we certainly should \nall support.\n  Energy storage encompasses technologies capable of storing previously \ngenerated electric energy and releasing that energy at a later time. It \ncan include various types of batteries, capacitors, fuel cells, and \nmore and has the potential to improve electric power grids, enable \ngrowth in renewable electricity generation, and provide alternatives to \noil-based fuels in the Nation's transportation sector.\n  Grid-level energy storage is on track to reach 40 gigawatts in \ncapacity by 2022, a hundredfold increase from 2013.\n  And natural disasters are becoming more and more common. Over the \nlast 4 years, the Federal Government has spent more than $136 billion \non relief for hurricanes, tornados, droughts, wildfires, and other \nweather-related events.\n  We know that for every dollar we invest in preparedness and \nresiliency we save $4 in cleanup and restoration, not to mention the \nlives that would be saved--something we cannot put a dollar value on.\n  Building up community resiliency by including energy storage in \npreparation plans will save lives and save money.\n  In San Diego, our utilities, including SDG, are testing and \ndeveloping energy storage to accommodate renewable energy, which makes \nup 33 percent of its power.\n  Our school districts, including Poway Unified School District, are \nadding large-scale battery storage to their campuses that go beyond \nCalifornia's energy efficiency guidelines to save money as heat waves \nand temperatures continue to spike.\n  And our companies and universities, including UCSD, are part of the \nCalifornia State public-private partnership, CalCharge, that is \ndeveloping the next generation of energy storage.\n  Ensuring that we are better able to withstand extreme weather events \nwith added energy storage is just common sense. Including energy \nstorage in this bill is a smart, forward-thinking step to equip States \nand localities with the tools they need both in advance and in the \naftermath of natural disasters.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n\n[[Page H8925]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Womack). The gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment. I think that it is \na good amendment. It includes energy storage as a form of energy that \nDOE should consider to enhance emergency preparedness for energy supply \ndisruptions during natural disasters.\n  It improves the bill, and I compliment the gentleman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman.\n  Thank you for your very hard work on this bill. I appreciate your \nconsideration on inclusion of my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Franks) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I want first to thank the \nchairman of the Rules Committee, Mr. Sessions, for making this \namendment in order, along with his committee members.\n  And I want to sincerely thank the chairman of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, Mr. Upton, for his support for the amendment and also just \nfor the entire effort on his part in other committees of jurisdiction \nto move this underlying and critically important bill forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, our national security and the reliability of our \nelectric grid are inextricably related. Without the grid, \ntelecommunications no longer operate, transportation of every kind is \nprofoundly affected, sewage and water treatment facilities stop, and a \nsafe and continuous food supply is interrupted.\n  Contemporary society, Mr. Chairman, is not structured nor does it \nhave the means to provide for the needs of nearly 300 million Americans \nwithout electricity. The current strategy for recovery from a failure \nof the electric grid leaves us ill-prepared to respond effectively to a \nsignificant manmade or naturally occurring electromagnetic pulse event \nthat would potentially result in damage to vast numbers of the critical \nelectric grid components nearly simultaneously or over an unprecedented \ngeographic scale.\n  Mr. Chairman, the negative impacts on U.S. electric infrastructure \nare potentially catastrophic in a major EMP or severe space weather \nevent unless practical steps are taken to provide protection for \ncritical elements of the electric system.\n  Nearly a dozen studies, including those by DOD, DOE, the Army War \nCollege, the National Academy of Sciences, and the bipartisan \nElectromagnetic Pulse Commission have all\n\n[[Page H8926]]\n\ncome to the same conclusion: The United States bulk power grid is \ncritically vulnerable to severe space weather and electromagnetic \npulse, and this represents a profound danger to this Nation.\n  We have now spent billions of dollars hardening our critical defense \nassets against electromagnetic pulse. However, the Department of \nDefense depends upon the unprotected civilian grid within the continual \nUnited States for 99 percent of their electricity needs without which \nthey cannot effect their mission.\n  Some of America's most enlightened national security experts, as well \nas many of our enemies or potential enemies, consider a well-executed \nweaponized electromagnetic pulse against America to be a ``kill shot'' \nagainst America.\n  It is astonishing that our civilian grid remains fundamentally \nunprotected against a severe EMP, and for it to remain so is an open \ninvitation to our enemies to exploit this dangerous vulnerability.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment amends section 215 of the Federal Power \nAct by creating a protocol for cooperation between industry and \ngovernment in the development, promulgation, and implementation of \nstandards and processes that are necessary to address the current \nshortcomings and vulnerabilities of the electric grid from a major EMP \nevent.\n  This base bill does indeed provide for such protocols for the \nprotection of the grid but only in a ``grid security emergency,'' \ndefined in the bill as the actual occurrence of the EMP event or the \nimminent danger of one, and only after the President issues a written \ndirective declaring such an emergency.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is akin to having a parachute that opens on \nimpact. The nature of this threat is such that if there is a true \nemergency it may be too late to effectively respond. My amendment is \ncritical because it proactively encourages cooperation on a solution to \nour vulnerability before it is deemed an emergency.\n  Mr. Chairman, finally, I would just say that we live in a time where \nthe vulnerabilities to our electric grid, our most critical \ninfrastructure, are big enough to be seen and still small enough to be \naddressed. This is our moment.\n  I appeal to my colleagues to support this vital amendment to protect \nAmericans and our national security from this dangerous threat.\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. I would just say to the gentleman, I agree with what you \nhave to say, that the electromagnetic pulse, EMP, and geomagnetic \ndisturbances really do pose a real threat to the grid.\n  I think your amendment is constructive. It moves the bill forward. I \nhave a few small concerns, but it is a good amendment, and I certainly \nintend to vote for it.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the chairman more than I know how to \nsay, and I hope that it comes to fruition as it should.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Illinois is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, this amendment aims to address the threat of \nelectromagnetic pulses and geomagnetic storms on the Nation's electric \ngrid.\n  While I agree that we should protect our Nation's electric grid, I \ndon't agree that we should only focus on these high-impact, low-\nfrequency events. There are many other threats, Mr. Chairman, to the \ngrid that deserve just as much focus.\n  The Franks amendment may undermine current FERC authority in the \nprocess for developing consistent technical standards for grid security \nalready in place under Federal law.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Poliquin\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 45, line 8, insert ``(which may not be required to be \n     for a period longer than one year)'' after ``contractual \n     obligations''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Maine (Mr. Poliquin) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maine.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the great State of Maine is blessed with natural \nresources. We have 3,000 miles of breathtaking coastline. We have \nhealthy fisheries. We have an abundance of inland waterways, rivers, \nstreams, lakes, and ponds, and we have an abundance of water as a \nresult. We have potatoes and broccoli in our farming communities, and \nour landscape is dotted with small organic farms that continue to grow. \nAnd, most importantly, or as importantly, Maine is right in the middle \nof the country's wood basket.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, when you cut a strand of trees, one can leave \nbehind the branches and the bark for that matter to decompose and \nbecome part of the carbon cycle, or that bark and branches and chips \ncan be collected and transported to paper mills to burn energy or to \nburn to create energy to run the machinery to create paper, or they can \nbe trucked to power plants to produce electricity.\n  Now, when this happens, it is the same carbon footprint if that \nbiomass decays on the forest floor or if it is burned in a paper mill \nor an electric generating station.\n  This creates jobs, Mr. Chairman, for loggers and truckers, and also \nwe help fuel our State economy and our Nation's economy by using this \nrenewable, green, abundant, safe, homegrown biomass.\n  Many States, Mr. Chairman, have shifted away from foreign importation \nof oil for all kinds of reasons, not the least of which is national \nsecurity. And, today, throughout our country, we are using more natural \ngas and oil developed here in our country, in America--also nuclear \npower, hydro, and biomass.\n  Today, Mr. Chairman, Federal regulations allow electric utilities to \ndetermine the reliability of the source of fuel they are burning to \ncreate electricity. Part of that reliability equation is the length of \na contract to deliver that fuel source to the power plant.\n  If the reliability of that fuel source is not up to snuff, then that \nfuel source would result in electricity generated by that power plant \nnot having full access to the power grid and not being able to sell its \nproduct, electricity, to the economy.\n  Some sources of fuel, like coal, for example, Mr. Chairman, are \nusually sold in 2- or 3-year contracts. The reason for that is because \ncoal today is mostly used to generate electricity.\n  However, biomass is different. We can use branches and wood chips and \nbark and biomass that includes other organic materials to create \npellets that are burned in wood stoves or to create mulch that \ngardeners use or also to create plywood and other materials. As a \nresult, Mr. Chairman, biomass as a fuel source is usually sold in 1-\nyear increments.\n  This bill, H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and \nInfrastructure Act, where I am offering an amendment, Mr. Chairman, is \na small technical amendment but a very important one, because what it \ndoes is it puts all fuel sources on a level playing field, able to \ncompete in the market, such that biomass--a green, renewable, \nenvironmentally friendly, homegrown source of fuel for our electric \ngenerators--is not penalized.\n  This is good for the economy, Mr. Chairman. It is good for job \ncreation. It strengthens our national security because it diversifies \nthe fuel sources that we need to fuel and power our electric generators \nthat are used in creating jobs and creating products throughout our \ncountry.\n  As a result, Mr. Chairman, I ask everybody in this Chamber, \nRepublicans\n\n[[Page H8927]]\n\nand Democrats, today to support this commonsense amendment to help our \nState, to help our country, to help our economy, and to help our \nfamilies live better lives.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say to my colleagues that \nthis amendment clarifies that electric plants can be considered \nreliable without having to enter into supply contracts that are greater \nthan a year.\n  I think that it is a good amendment, and we are willing to accept it.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Maine's amendment adds \nfurther specificity to the criteria defining fuel certainty, one of the \nthree requirements that defines reliable generation in section 1107 of \nthe bill.\n  The amendment to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, or \nPURPA, is already too prescriptive, in my view. The amendments in this \nlegislation to capacity markets under the Federal Power Act in section \n1110 and to PURPA in section 1107 are an attempt at micromanaging grid \ndecisions.\n  I am not certain what the gentleman from Maine's amendment would be \nother than to ensure that no electric generation facility need enter \ninto a contract with a fuel supplier that was any longer than 1 year.\n  I realize some problems have arisen in the New England capacity \nmarket, but I doubt this is the best way to address those problems.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Veasey\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 58, after line 22, insert the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       (C) Additional report.--The Secretary of Energy shall \n     transmit to Congress a report on the potential commercial use \n     of carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies \n     (including enhanced oil recovery), its potential effects on \n     the economy and gross domestic product (GDP), and its \n     contributions to the United States greenhouse gas emission \n     reduction goals if widely utilized at major carbon dioxide-\n     emitting power plants.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Veasey) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer an amendment that \nwould require the Department of Energy to submit a report to Congress \nrelated to carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration, known as \nCCUS technologies.\n  This report would explore the potential effects that the commercial \nutilization of CCUS technologies would have on the Nation's economy and \nour gross domestic product. It would also examine what these \ntechnologies could contribute to our efforts to reach our greenhouse \ngas emission reduction goals.\n  My amendment is intended to supplement the CCUS evaluation report \nthat is required by the underlying legislation. I am confident that \nthis study's finding will provide concrete evidence that CCUS \nrepresents a way to benefit the economy and the environment while \nmeeting our Nation's energy needs.\n  CCUS is a combination of technologies that allows industries to \ncapture carbon, or CO2, emissions for transport or storage \nbefore they are emitted into the atmosphere. These technologies have \nthe potential to allow for the continued use of industries while \ndecreasing the amount of CO2 released into the environment.\n  America's recent energy boom has shown us that fossil fuels will \ncontinue to make up a sizable portion of our Nation's energy portfolio. \nSo, as we continue to pursue an all-of-the-above energy policy, we must \nalso be sure that we use these resources in an environmentally \nresponsible fashion. Carbon capture technologies do achieve that goal. \nThat is evident in the wide range of support it receives from industry \nas well as from environmental groups.\n  However, though much is understood about the various aspects of CCUS, \ncommercial or large-scale deployment has not been achieved, and that is \nfor a variety of different reasons. The absence of commercial projects \nhas led to a fractured understanding of its widespread economic and \nenvironmental benefits.\n  So it is important for us to understand the potential economic \nbenefits CCUS could hold for consumers and stakeholders if we continue \nto urge the Department of Energy to increase its investments in the \nresearch and development of these technologies.\n  The results of this study would also provide industry stakeholders \nand likely investors with concrete data to make those economic \ndecisions.\n  Finally, as America continues to participate in the global effort to \naddress climate change, we must also understand what CCUS can \ncontribute to our emission reduction goals. By considering long-term \nclimate mitigation needs, this study could provide reason for the \nDepartment of Energy to continue to support CCUS technologies even if a \nDOE-supported project does not immediately succeed.\n  These technologies have a variety of possible applications, from oil \nrecovery and so on, and it is time that we really understood how a \nlarge-scale deployment of this technology would benefit our country. So \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. But I support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the Department of Energy to \nsubmit a report to Congress on the potential effects that the \ncommercial utilization of carbon capture and sequestration could have \non the economy, energy infrastructure, and greenhouse gas emission \ngoals.\n  I support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. McKinley\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       In subtitle A of title I, add at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 1111. ETHANE STORAGE STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary \n     of Commerce, in consultation with other relevant agencies and \n     stakeholders, shall conduct a study on the feasibility of \n     establishing an ethane storage and distribution hub in the \n     United States.\n       (b) Contents.--The study conducted under subsection (a) \n     shall include--\n       (1) an examination of--\n       (A) potential locations;\n       (B) economic feasibility;\n       (C) economic benefits;\n       (D) geological storage capacity capabilities;\n       (E) above ground storage capabilities;\n       (F) infrastructure needs; and\n       (G) other markets and trading hubs, particularly related to \n     ethane; and\n       (2) identification of potential additional benefits to \n     energy security.\n       (c) Publication of Results.--Not later than 2 years after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretaries of Energy \n     and Commerce shall publish the results of the study conducted \n     under subsection (a) on the websites of the Departments of \n     Energy and Commerce, respectively, and shall submit such \n     results to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House \n     of Representatives and the Committees on Energy and Natural \n     Resources and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate.\n\n\n[[Page H8928]]\n\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I applaud the work of Chairman Upton and \nhis staff in their bringing this crucial energy bill to the floor, and \nI want to thank them for that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which directs the \nDepartment of Energy and the Department of Commerce to conduct a study \non the feasibility of establishing one or more ethane storage and \ndistribution hubs in the United States. This study will also examine \nthe potential benefits that an ethane storage hub would have on our \nNation's energy security.\n  The extraction of natural gas from shale gas formations has increased \ndramatically over the last 15 years, and ethane is the largest \ncomponent of that shale gas. Most of the ethane production is used in \nthe petrochemical sector in order to make ethylene, a major component \nused in the feedstock for manufacturing.\n  Yet, while the ethane supply continues to grow, the lack of \ninfrastructure and storage inhibits its potential for America's \nmanufacturing economy. Establishing ethane storage and distribution \nhubs could bring about new markets for these stranded liquids and allow \nAmerica's shale formations to achieve their full potential as critical \nnational energy assets.\n  A revamped storage and distribution infrastructure will make our \neconomy less vulnerable to potential unanticipated disruptions and will \nreduce transportation costs.\n  Furthermore, the results of this study and decentralization of ethane \nactivity could encourage investment in manufacturing and the expansion \nof the petrochemical industry all across America.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for a \nstudy.\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. McKINLEY. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a good amendment. It \ndirects the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce, in \nconsultation with other relevant agencies and stakeholders, to conduct \na study on the feasibility of establishing an ethane storage and \ndistribution hub in the U.S.\n  The gentleman and I have talked about it over the last number of \nmonths. I think it is a good amendment, and it adds to the bill, so I \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n       Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mrs. Ellmers of North Carolina\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support \nof this bipartisan amendment.\n  I join my colleague, Congressman Jerry McNerney of California. \nTogether, we chair the Grid Innovation Caucus with the belief that we \nneed to have a bold and ambitious vision for modernizing our Nation's \nelectric grid.\n  Our current electric infrastructure resembles that of the original \ngrid built over 100 years ago. New technology has given us the \nopportunity to transform a 20th century grid into a 21st century grid, \nand my home State of North Carolina is helping to lead the way. In \nfact, North Carolina is the second-leading State in grid innovation \ntechnology development behind California.\n  There is a need to bring our electric grid and the entire electric \nsystem up to date in order to meet the changing demands of our digital \neconomy. This amendment is simply a statement of policy and a blueprint \nfor what we want our future grid to consist of and how we want it to \nperform. By adopting this amendment, we begin to develop a concrete \nplan to further secure our grid.\n  This is a conversation that needs to happen now, and this energy \npackage moves the debate forward. Technology has given us the ability \nto further secure our grid from physical and cyber threats as well as \nincrease the efficiency, reliability, and redundancy of this vital \ncomponent.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcNerney).\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from North Carolina \nfor yielding and for her work on the Grid Innovation Caucus, which is \none example of bipartisan cooperation for the good of the Nation.\n  I also join my colleague Mrs. Ellmers in offering this bipartisan\n\n[[Page H8929]]\n\namendment, which would establish a statement on grid modernization \npolicy. This will establish a clear vision to achieve the future grid.\n  The grid is the core of our Nation's effort to transition to clean \nenergy sources. That said, our current electric grid has much the same \ntechnology that was in place for the last 100 years. We need to improve \nand upgrade the grid to meet the 21st century demands and the demands \nof the digital economy.\n  The future grid must be reliable, secure, resilient, and affordable \nwhile integrating a range of resources and devices, including \nintermittent renewable energy, storage, and electric vehicles.\n  Having a national grid modernization policy, or vision, will help \nachieve these objectives while maintaining the secure, safe, reliable, \nand affordable power for which our Nation is known.\n  I thank my colleague, who is the cochair of the Grid Innovation \nCaucus, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I congratulate \nthe two on its being a bipartisan amendment. This makes a strong policy \non grid modernization. I appreciate their work, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n\n        Amendment No. 9, as Modified, Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I offer amendment No. 9, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be modified in the form I have placed at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment, as \nmodified, and report the modification.\n  The text of the amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. GRID RESILIENCE REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to the Congress a \n     report on methods to increase electric grid resilience with \n     respect to all threats, including cyber attacks, vandalism, \n     terrorism, and severe weather.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me express my appreciation to Chairman Upton and \nRanking Member Pallone and the Rules Committee for allowing this \namendment to come to the floor. Let me thank Chairman Sessions and \nRanking Member Slaughter of the Rules Committee as well.\n  As I begin, let me acknowledge that I think we have a collective \ncommitment and need to continue to assess the electric grid. According \nto a Department of Energy report on the economic benefits of increasing \nthe electric grid resilience, the electric grid in the State of Texas \nis highly vulnerable to severe weather, cyber attacks, vandalism, and \nterrorism. Mr. Chairman, Texas is only an example.\n  I hold in my hand a letter from the Senate Committee on Veteran \nAffairs & Military Installations that has come to my attention and the \nHouse Committee on Defense and Veterans' Affairs to take note of the \nvulnerability. I use this letter from the State to only say that other \nStates are in the same category.\n  That is why the Jackson Lee amendment is very relevant, because it \nrequires a report to be promulgated upon our Nation's preparedness for \nchallenges in energy as it pertains to cyber attacks, vandalism, \nterrorism, and severe weather.\n  I sit on the Homeland Security Committee's Cybersecurity, \nInfrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies Subcommittee, and \nwe see every day vulnerabilities to the cybersecurity or the \ninfrastructure. The importance of this amendment was underscored, as I \nindicated, in a letter that I received.\n  My amendment offers the option of the utilization of geothermal \npower, in addition to other renewable strategies, to address some of \nthe energy insecurities faced by this Nation. In today's world of \nnatural and manmade disasters in the energy sector, seeking and \nimplementing complementary alternative measures, such as that proposed \nin my amendment, will help address some of the insecurity issues \ntriggered by these disasters.\n  The natural disasters suffered in many of our home States, whether it \nis tornados or hurricanes, we know that the grid is an important \nsurvival asset for the Nation.\n  According to the DOE report, the average yearly cost of power outages \nfrom severe weather in the U.S. is between $18 billion to $33 billion. \nCold weather in a number of States caused two emergencies that knocked \nout 9,355 megawatts.\n  These events warn us that key infrastructure facilities along the \nGulf Coast and many other places continue to stress our grid. Thus, \nthis amendment seeks to facilitate the United States' exploration of \npossibilities, strategies, and utilities of promoting energy \ninfrastructure.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in ensuring through this report \nthat we are in front of it, if we can be, to strengthen our electric \ngrid, to look for alternatives, to be ahead of cybersecurity attacks, \nvandalism, weather conditions, and assure the American public that they \ndo have a resilient system that will last during times of great \ndisaster.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Upton and \nRanking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American \nenergy infrastructure development, security, independence and economic \ngrowth.\n  I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and \nthe members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee \nAmendment Number 9.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich provides:\n\n\n                         GRID RESILIENCE REPORT\n\n  Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a report on methods to \nincrease electric grid resilience with respect to all threats, \nincluding cyber attacks, vandalism, terrorism, and severe weather.\n  According to a Department of Energy Report on the Economic Benefits \nof Increasing Electric Grid Resilience, the electrical grid in the \nstate of Texas is highly vulnerable to severe weather, cyber attacks, \nvandalism and terrorism.\n  This is why Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 is very relevant because \nit requires a report to be promulgated on our nation's preparedness for \nchallenges in energy, as pertains to cyber attacks, vandalism, \nterrorism and severe weather.\n  The importance of this Amendment was underscored in a letter \naddressed to me and other members of the Texas Delegation from the \nTexas Senate Veterans Affairs and Military Installations Committee and \nthe Texas House Defense and Veteran's Affairs Committee.\n  My Amendment offers the option of the utilization of geothermal power \nin addition to other renewable strategies to address some of the energy \ninsecurities faced by my home state of Texas and by our nation as a \nwhole.\n  Across the nation from New Orleans to Georgia to New Jersey, we have \nall seen the devastation natural and man made disasters have wrought on \nthe livelihood of Americans.\n  In today's world of natural and man-made disasters in the energy \nsector, seeking and implementing complementary alternative measures \nsuch as that proposed in my Amendment will help address some of the \ninsecurity issues triggered by these disasters.\n  The natural disaster suffered in my home state of Texas is an example \nthat underscores the imperative of a well informed report corroborated \nby data and facts.\n  Here are the recent facts: According to a DOE report, the average \nyearly cost of power outages from severe weather in the U.S. is between \n$18-$33 billion; Cold weather in Texas caused a level two emergency \nthat knocked out 9,355 MW of power that drastically increased wholesale \nelectricity prices 100 times the normal rate in January 2014;\n\n[[Page H8930]]\n\nAdditionally, in 2014 alone, there were approximately eight major power \noutages in the Corpus Christi area, three of which affected nearby Navy \nbases.\n  These events warn us that key infrastructure facilities along the \ngulf coast operate 24/7 365 days a year, with ongoing powerful power \ndemands, and there is a need for enormous and capable energy security \ninfrastructures, prepared to handle natural and man-made disasters.\n  Thus, this Amendment seeks to facilitate the United State's \nexploration of the possibilities, strategies and the utility of \npromoting energy infrastructures.\n  Indeed, part of what I hope will be the result of the report \nrequested by my Amendment are the timelines, actions and plans for \nbolstering energy security and infrastructure development in our \nnation.\n  Already we can see some of the potential dividends of investing in \ninfrastructures that foster the utilization of our geothermal resources \nto promote energy security and efficiency.\n  A prime example is my home state of Texas.\n  Indeed, according to reports, Texas' geothermal resources can \ncomplement both off-site wind and solar projects and leverage the \nearth's constant heat in gulf coast pressurized zones and eliminate \ndependency on external fuel sources.\n  For example, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) \npublished a study in 2012 that determined a minimum of 2,500 Megawatts \nto the power of 3 (MW3) of geothermal potential within the \ngulf coast region.\n  For those of us in the Gulf Coast, our geothermal can serve as an \nunlimited resource which can provide relief to facilities in need of \nclean, stable power and set a new standard for sustainability.\n  Additionally, geothermal resource can be instrumental in fostering \nour nation's renewable energy, while adding military value to our \ndefense installations.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me and support \nJackson Lee Amendment Number 9.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I supported the amendment before it was \nrevised. I support the amendment as revised.\n  This amendment directs the Secretary of Energy to submit to the House \nand Senate Energy Committees a report on methods to increase electric \ngrid resilience with respect to all threats, including cyber attacks, \nvandalism, terrorism, and severe weather. Actually, as amended, it \nrequires it submit to the Congress versus the specific committees.\n  I think it is a fine amendment, and I support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone).\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I want to also lend my support to the \nlegislation on grid resiliency. I think it is very important. I \nappreciate the gentlewoman putting it forward.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record this letter \nfrom the Senate Committee on Veteran Affairs & Military Installations \nof the State of Texas and the House Committee on Defense and Veterans' \nAffairs.\n         Senate Committee on Veteran Affairs & Military \n           Installations and House Committee on Defense and \n           Veterans' Affairs,\n                                                November 12, 2015.\n       Dear Honorable Jackson Lee: On behalf of the Texas Senate \n     Committee on Veteran Affairs and Military Installations and \n     the House Committee on Defense and Veterans' Affairs, we are \n     writing to ask for your support for the development of \n     geothermal energy along the Gulf Coast to provide onsite \n     power and increased energy independence to critical \n     infrastructure facilities that include Military bases such as \n     Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi, Naval Air Station \n     Kingsville, and the Ports of Corpus Christi and Brownsville.\n       The August 2013 Report of Economic Benefits of Increasing \n     Electric Grid Resilience authored by the Department of Energy \n     determined that in addition to cyber-attacks, vandalism, and \n     terrorism, the electrical grid is highly vulnerable to severe \n     weather. The average yearly cost of power outages from severe \n     weather in the U.S. is between $18-$33 billion. Cold weather \n     in Texas caused a level two emergency that knocked out 9,355 \n     MW of power that drastically increased wholesale electricity \n     prices 100 times the normal rate in January 2014. \n     Additionally in 2014, there were approximately eight major \n     power outages in the Corpus Christi area, three of which \n     affected the nearby Navy bases. Key infrastructure facilities \n     along the gulf coast operate 24/7/365 and their ongoing power \n     demands are enormous; however, the need for cleaner and more \n     cost effective renewables is also increasing.\n       The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), who \n     supports the military's renewable energy goal, published a \n     study in April 2012 that determined a minimum of 2,500 MW of \n     geothermal power potential within the gulf coast region and \n     more recent review by geothermal energy developers have \n     doubled that estimate. Our committees were briefed recently \n     on a conceptual plan to generate as much as 10MW of \n     geothermal power within a 2-acre area at NAS Corpus Christi \n     and up to 5MW at NAS Kingsville. The Corpus Christi Army \n     Depot who is a tenant on NAS Corpus Christi is also \n     considering a plan through its Energy Service Company (ESCO) \n     to utilize geothermal power with a MicroGrid on-site to \n     enhance its energy security in case of power outage. This \n     MicroGrid would complement other off-site renewable power \n     sent from the local grid.\n       From a regulatory stand-point, the Energy Act of 2005, \n     Presidential Executive Orders 13423 and 13513, and the \n     Department of the Navy's own Renewable Energy Security Goals \n     established by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus in October 2012 are \n     some of the other drivers that are encouraging the military's \n     use of any geographically available onsite renewable sources \n     by 2015 and 2020 respectively. The Navy's 2012 report only \n     considered 1.2MW Solar PV for on-site generation at NAS \n     Corpus Christi; however we understand their renewable energy \n     team has acknowledged Geothermal is an option that has still \n     not been implemented.\n       Texas' Geothermal resources can complement both off-site \n     wind and solar projects and leverage the earth's constant \n     heat in gulf coast geopressured zones and eliminate \n     dependency on external fuel sources. This unlimited resource \n     will provide relief to facilities in need of clean, stable \n     power and set a new standard for sustainability while \n     fostering renewable energy growth in Texas and adding \n     military value to our defense installations.\n       As Chairs of the Texas military affairs committees, we ask \n     for your support and advocacy of this approach to military \n     leaders in Washington D.C. It will improve military value for \n     our defense installations, create new jobs in the energy \n     sector, and benefit the State of Texas as a whole. If you \n     would like more information on the potential projects in \n     Texas, please feel free to contact staff of either Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator Donna Campbell, Chair,\n       Senate Veteran Affairs & Military Installations Committee.\n     Representative Susan L. King, Chair,\n       House Defense & Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by simply saying I \nthank both Mr. Upton and Mr. Pallone for joining in the unanimous \nconsent to revise the amendment simply to say that this report on \nincreasing methods to increase the electric grid resilience with \nrespect to all threats, including cyber attacks, vandalism, terrorism, \nsevere weather, will go to the Congress. I thank them very much.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, \noffered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Kildee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. GAO REPORT ON IMPROVING NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.\n\n       The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct \n     a study of ways in which the capabilities of the National \n     Response Center could be improved.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chair, the National Response Center is a joint \noperation between the U.S. Coast Guard, the EPA, and other agencies. It \nis the sole Federal point of contact for reporting hazardous substance \nreleases and oil spills.\n\n[[Page H8931]]\n\n  Essentially, it is our Nation's 911 for dangerous spills, staffed by \nthe Coast Guard 24 hours a day, passing on reports to relevant national \nresponse teams.\n  Those teams then go to the site of a spill, assess the situation, \ndetermine the best way to mitigate exposure, and quickly clean up the \nspill. Often it is the Coast Guard being called upon to clean up a \nspill when it involves surface water.\n  Back in March I visited a Coast Guard station in my district to learn \nmore about their operations. While I was there, we talked quite a bit \nabout a serious deficiency in their capabilities, a deficiency that \ncame to light during one of the greatest environmental disasters that \nour State has faced, and the chairman is quite aware of this.\n  In 2010, there was a large spill on the Kalamazoo River. It was the \nlargest inland oil spill in the history of the U.S., in fact. The Coast \nGuard was called upon to help with those cleanup efforts.\n  When they arrived, however, they learned that the equipment that they \nhad brought to the spill was for one type of oil--the oil that they \nbelieved to have been involved in this particular incident--but the oil \nin the Kalamazoo River was an entirely different type and consistency \nthan what they had expected, and it required a different cleanup \nmethod.\n  Valuable time was lost as the Coast Guard actually had to return back \nto their station, hours away, to get the right equipment. Meanwhile, \nthis spill continued into this river.\n  The terrible scope of the spill could have been much more easily \nmitigated had the National Response Center possessed the basic \ninformation regarding the contents of that particular pipeline so they \ncould pass the information on to the Coast Guard to address the spill \nwhen it occurred.\n  Currently, these response teams are often flying blind as they head \nout to spills. Without this important information, the likelihood of \nmuch more serious damage, such as what we saw in 2010 in the Kalamazoo \nRiver, is much higher.\n  So I have been talking with lots of folks, including the people \nwithin the Coast Guard, about ways to improve their ability to address \nand respond to this type of spill.\n  The amendment that I have offered would simply require the GAO to \nconduct a study of ways in which the capabilities of the National \nResponse Center could be improved, including providing additional \ninformation on the contents of these pipelines.\n  It would be an independent study that could then guide policymakers \nin improving the National Response Center, providing them the tools \nthey need in the 21st century.\n  The National Response Center receives over 6,000 calls per year \nacross the country on all different sorts of spills. Giving the \nNational Response Center the tools they need in order to respond to \nthese incidents as quickly as possible with the right information is \ncritical not only to protecting public health, but in preventing long-\nterm damage to the environment.\n  Of course, coming from Michigan--in the district that I represent, \nthe Great Lakes, I have 77 miles of shoreline--we are particularly \nconcerned about surface water spills, and this information is \nabsolutely critical. Forty million people depend on the Great Lakes for \ndrinking water. We want to ensure that those who are charged with \nresponding to accidents, such as the one we saw in Michigan, have all \nthe information and tools available to them.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I support the amendment. I want to say to my \nfriend from the great State of Michigan that this is obviously an issue \nthat is close to both of our hearts.\n  I want to go back. When I was first elected a few years ago, one of \nthe first bills that I saw enacted into law was an oil spill response \nteam for the Great Lakes. It was actually a visit, I think, now to your \ndistrict, Bay City, back then, which had a fairly significant oil \nspill. We found out that the Coast Guard was totally unprepared. My \namendment was added, I want to say, to a highway bill to get it done.\n  When we had the oil spill on the Kalamazoo River in Calhoun County a \nfew years ago, we looked at that. We actually passed the Upton-\nDingell--not the Debbie Dingell, but the John Dingell--bill on pipeline \nsafety, which I want to say passed this body with more than 400 votes.\n  It did a lot of good things, including one that was very important, \nwhich was, when there is an oil spill, it had to be reported to PHMSA \nwithin an hour versus on a timely basis. That was a big change.\n  Now that we expect the passage tomorrow of the highway bill, Chairman \nShuster and myself will be working again to reauthorize the pipeline \nsafety bill. I am led to believe that we will be prepared to start \nearly next year to bring a bill to the floor. I look forward to your \nsupport.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Anything that we can do to improve the current system is a good \nthing, which is why I strongly support your amendment today.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank the chairman for his \ngood work on this. I look forward to working with him again on \nadditional pipeline safety measures as they come to the floor. I \nappreciate his support for my amendment.\n  I believe in quitting while I am ahead. With that, unless the ranking \nmember would like time, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 11 will \nnot be offered.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 118, line 2, insert ``transportation,'' after \n     ``distribution,''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Garamendi) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I am trying to figure out who would be \nopposed to this amendment, so maybe I will just talk my few minutes and \ngo from there.\n  The bill deals with energy, and I am trying to figure out, let's see, \nenergy that goes along in wires would be electrical energy. If it is \ncoal, it is probably on a truck or a train. If it is oil or gas, it is \non a pipeline or maybe in a truck, maybe in a boat or barge.\n  But this bill doesn't speak to the transportation of energy, so this \namendment is extraordinarily important because it really says that, if \nyou are going to study energy, you better study how you are going to \nget it to wherever it needs to go. This amendment, being such an \nimportant amendment, and so long--let's see, transportation. Wow, not \neven 15 letters. That is all it does. It simply adds the word \n``transportation'' to the study section of this bill, requiring the \nDepartment of Energy, as it studies energy, to study how it gets from \nhere to there. That is it.\n  Now, I can go on for another 4 minutes or so, but after doing so, it \nwon't make any difference because we really need to study energy and \nfigure out how it gets to where it needs to go. That is the amendment. \nAdd the word ``transportation'' in it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition but speak in \nsupport of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment adds inclusion of the energy \ntransportation to the list of considerations for the energy security\n\n[[Page H8932]]\n\nvaluation report. Section 3002 requires the Secretary of Energy to \nestablish transparent and uniform procedures and criteria to ensure \nthat energy-related actions that significantly affect the supply, \ndistribution, or use of energy are evaluated with respect to their \npotential impact on energy security, including their impact on the \nconsumer and the economy and energy supply and diversity.\n  I think it is a good amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I came in prepared for a brawl, and all \nI get is acceptance of an amendment. I think I will go with that and \nsay thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the extraordinary wisdom that \napparently we both seem to have.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. McKinley\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 3007. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR ENERGY EXPORT FACILITIES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any \n     other provision of this Act and any amendment made by this \n     Act, to the extent that the National Environmental Policy Act \n     of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) applies to the issuance of a \n     permit for the construction, operation, or maintenance of a \n     facility for the export of bulk commodities, no such permit \n     may be denied until each applicable Federal agency has \n     completed all reviews required for the facility under such \n     Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, again, I applaud the committee, and \nparticularly the staff, for the hard work they have done in putting \ntogether this comprehensive piece of legislation on energy. It has been \nlong overdue to have that energy bill, so I am delighted it is here on \nthe floor.\n  I rise today in support of an amendment which is cosponsored by my \ncolleague from Montana, Congressman Zinke. This amendment will ensure \nthat no permit for a coal export facility can be denied until all \nreviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act, known as \nNEPA, have been completed.\n  The NEPA review process is critical to ensure that the communities \ncan provide input on any proposed project, and it allows the developer \nthe opportunity to work with the citizens of a community and the \nregulatory agency to address any concerns that may arise. Denying a \npermit request for a coal export facility before the NEPA process is \ncomplete would send a precedent that indicates that those voices of \naffected parties don't matter and diminish the value of the NEPA \nprocess.\n  This amendment will ensure that a regulatory agency must first take \ninto consideration the merits of the project, voices of the people, \ntheir thoughts, concerns, and the findings of the NEPA report before \nacting on a permit and simply not advancing an anticoal ideology.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, time after time, Democratic Members have \ncome to the floor to strike bad NEPA language from bills, only to be \nvoted down by Republicans who use streamlining as a euphemism for \nletting polluters do whatever they want. Now they expect us to believe \nthat they are sincere about keeping NEPA strong in one perverse \nscenario in which they think it could help them. Well, I don't think \nthat passes the smell test. What is more, the amendment undermines the \ntreaty rights of the Lummi Nation and jeopardizes the sovereignty of \nall tribes with rights to natural resources.\n  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we will be here on the House floor to vote on \nthe conference report for a highway bill which includes, over the \nopposition of many Democrats, sweeping exemptions from the requirements \nof the National Environmental Policy Act. I have no doubt that both of \nthe sponsors of this amendment support those exemptions and will vote \nto pass the bill without a second thought about the fact that it short-\ncircuits NEPA review for many, many infrastructure projects.\n  I am shocked to see them standing here with straight faces arguing \nthat, when it benefits them and their friends in the coal industry, the \nNEPA process should be thorough and complete. It is a level of audacity \nthat I think is almost laughable.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this damaging and disingenuous \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, to clarify, this amendment does not violate \ntreaty rights, and to suggest it does is disingenuous and false.\n  This is about fairness. It is not about two tribes. It is about \nfairness of a process. It would be unprecedented for the Army Corps of \nEngineers to bypass the EIS to make a decision, and that is what this \namendment does.\n  It is not about coal. It is not about commodities, nor is it about \ntreaty rights because, quite frankly, the Crow Tribe in Montana has \ntreaty rights, too. This is not to pit one poor nation against a rich \nnation. It is about simple fairness.\n  It would be unprecedented for the Army Corps of Engineers or any \ngovernment body to give judgment before the process is complete, and \nthat is what we are asking for. The EIS is the process that needs to be \ndone.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Gene Green of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 3007.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Gene Green) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of an amendment that would create \nregulatory certainty with our neighbors, Canada and Mexico.\n  The Presidential permitting process dates back many administrations. \nBeginning in the administration of Ulysses S. Grant, the executive \nbranch has taken steps to ensure our cross-border infrastructure \nbetween Canada and Mexico was constructed.\n  These past administrations and, indeed, the current administration \nhave been forced to use executive orders because Congress has failed to \nact. Congress has a duty to regulate the commerce of the United States, \nand cross-border energy infrastructure projects fall well within that \nspace.\n  We need to create a system with our neighbors, Mexico and Canada, to \ntruly create a North American energy market, and that is what this \namendment would do. We can't build infrastructure in this country or in \nthis continent based on who sits in the White House.\n  There are 11 cross-border projects awaiting a decision now by the \nDepartment of State and the President, including electricity wires and \nwater pipelines.\n  It is Congress' responsibility to create regulatory rules by which \ninfrastructure is constructed. As a reminder of this, tomorrow we will \npass the conference report to the FAST Act. The FAST Act is a multiyear \ntransportation bill that shows our determination to build \ninfrastructure for the 21st century. Now we must build on that success \nand focus on our energy infrastructure.\n  This amendment would create a regulatory process at the Department of \nState, Department of Energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to permit cross-border infrastructure. This is no different \nthan building roads, bridges, or railways.\n  The Department of Transportation coordinates with Federal, State, and \nlocal agencies to ensure the project is completed and the environment \nprotected. We will do the same thing with pipes and wires. We need to \nbuild electric transmission lines and pipelines to move resources from \nwhere they are to where they are needed.\n  The amendment complies with the National Environmental Policy Act and \nrequires a full environmental review of any cross-border facility, \nincluding analysis of the climate change impacts. The entire length of \nthe pipeline or electric transmission line will be reviewed for \nenvironmental impacts.\n  This amendment is about the future and how to meet the 21st century \ndemands that our country needs. We should embrace the changes taking \nplace in North America and harmonize our policies with those of our \nneighbors both to the north and south.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes an end run around the \nNational Environmental Policy Act. The amendment would simply eliminate \nany meaningful review of the environmental impact of large trans-\nboundary infrastructure projects by redefining and significantly \nnarrowing the scope of NEPA's environmental review.\n  While a traditional NEPA review looks at the impacts of an entire \nproject, this amendment restricts NEPA review only to that small \nportion that physically crosses the border, and that defies common \nsense. We are talking about massive projects that are more than just at \nborder crossing.\n  When we approve a trans-boundary pipeline or transmission line, we \nare approving multibillion-dollar infrastructures that may stretch \nhundreds of miles and will last for decades. They cross through private \nproperty, water bodies, farms, sensitive lands, and over aquifers. They \ncarry substances that can catch fire or spill and pollute the \nenvironment, and they have profound implications for climate change.\n  To understand the potential environmental impact of an energy \nproject, we need to look at the project as a whole.\n\n[[Page H8934]]\n\nTo ignore the potential environmental or safety risks for every part of \nthe project except the tiny sliver of land at the national boundary \nmakes no sense.\n  Imagine going to the doctor if you are feeling sick, and the doctor \ngives you a clean bill of health after looking only at your elbow. That \nis what this amendment does by redefining the scope of NEPA's inquiry \nto only encompass the step across the border. It makes the process of \nenvironmental review essentially meaningless, and no meaningful review \nmeans no opportunity to mitigate potential harm to public health, \npublic safety, or the environment.\n  Mr. Chairman, NEPA provides policymakers with a critical tool to \nunderstand potential impacts and consider lower impact alternatives. \nNEPA doesn't dictate the outcome or, by itself, impose any constraints \non projects.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Fundamentally, it requires us to look before we leap, and that is \njust basic common sense. We should not be punching loopholes in this \nlaw.\n  But the amendment doesn't just stop there. It also creates a \nrebuttable presumption that every cross-border project is in the public \ninterest, tipping the scale in favor of their approval. And that is a \nsubtle but significant change. Coupled with the small portion of \nprojects being reviewed, the amendment makes it virtually impossible to \never prove that a project is not in the public interest.\n  Proponents of this amendment argue that a new process is necessary \nfor reviewing and approving cross-border projects, but if Congress is \ngoing to establish new permitting rules through legislation, it should \ndo so in a thoughtful and balanced way. Instead, this amendment creates \na process that rubber stamps projects and eliminates meaningful \nenvironmental review and public participation.\n  Frankly, this amendment is just another attempt to bring \nTransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline back from the grave. The President \nhas already rejected their application, and we have wasted enough time \non this Canadian pipe dream.\n  The Keystone XL pipeline is a lose-lose proposition for energy \nsecurity, a lose-lose for safe climate and a healthy environment. And \nwe shouldn't be trying to create a weaker approval process to provide a \nnew pathway for its approval.\n  Adoption of this amendment will undoubtedly benefit TransCanada and \nother multinational oil companies but will not help the American people \nthat we are here to represent.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, my good friend from New Jersey \nis actually incorrect. This amendment passed the House last session and \ndidn't pass in the Senate. But it does have the NEPA process \nthroughout, whether it is a pipeline or transmission line, from \nliterally not just the border but also to the destination.\n  And it is not just Keystone. We have natural gas pipelines being \nbuilt from Texas to Mexico. Twenty years from now, we will need those \npipelines reversed to bring natural gas from Mexico to my chemical \nindustries. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nUpton), the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, the Green amendment is very similar to the \nbill that I introduced last Congress and, as we know, did pass the \nHouse with some bipartisan support.\n  This amendment establishes a straightforward and predictable \nprocedure to permit cross-border pipelines and electric transmission \nfacilities.\n  It is not Keystone. We are over that battle. It is time to move \nbeyond that. But we want certainty in these things.\n  This is an important amendment. In order for the U.S. to fully \nbenefit from our energy abundance, we have to encourage rather than \nobstruct trade with our good neighbors, particularly the Canadians, as \nwell as the Mexicans--an energy policy that works.\n  Let's do this. The amendment is a good one.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I just want to encourage \nMembers to support the amendment. We need to bring our country and our \ntrading partners on the north and south border together on energy \nissues. I encourage an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 15 will \nnot be offered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mr. Takano\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 133, after line 19, insert the following new section \n     (and redesignate the subsequent sections accordingly):\n\n     SEC. 4114. BATTERY STORAGE REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Comptroller General shall transmit to Congress a \n     report on the potential of battery energy storage that \n     answers the following questions:\n       (1) How do existing Federal standards impact the \n     development and deployment of battery storage systems?\n       (2) What are the benefits of using existing battery storage \n     technology, and what challenges exist to their widespread \n     use? What are some examples of existing battery storage \n     projects providing these benefits?\n       (3) What potential impact could large-scale battery storage \n     and behind-the-meter battery storage have on renewable energy \n     utilization?\n       (4) What is the potential of battery technology for grid-\n     scale use nationwide? What is the potential impact of battery \n     technology on the national grid capabilities?\n       (5) How much economic activity associated with large-scale \n     and behind-the-meter battery storage technology is located in \n     the United States? How many jobs do these industries account \n     for?\n       (6) What policies other than the Renewable Energy \n     Investment Tax Credit have research and available data shown \n     to promote renewable energy use and storage technology \n     deployment by State and local governments or private end-\n     users?\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bipartisan \namendment which brings us one step closer to realizing the enormous \npotential of battery energy storage.\n  This technology is capable of transforming our energy landscape by \nstoring power in times of excess production and releasing power in \ntimes of excess demand. It can make our grid more reliable and secure. \nIt can save consumers money by replacing costly gas-powered peaker \nstations.\n  And, perhaps most importantly, it is compatible with any source of \nenergy. Its compatibility with multiple power sources means we aren't \npicking winners and losers. Rather, we are increasing our capacity to \nuse all sources of energy.\n  Battery energy storage is particularly promising in its ability to \nunlock the power of renewables, leading to a cleaner, more sustainable \nenergy portfolio.\n  Even as the cost of renewable energy sources drops closer to that of \nfossil fuels, the viability of wind and solar power is limited by \ninconsistency. Put simply, the wind doesn't always blow and the sun \ndoesn't always shine. Battery energy storage offers a solution to this \nchallenge.\n  This week at the climate summit in Paris, we have heard about the \nimportance of innovation in reaching our environmental goals. Battery \nstorage is exactly the type of revolutionary technology that will help \nget us there, creating new jobs and economic growth in the process.\n\n[[Page H8935]]\n\n  A GAO report on large-scale battery storage will help us make \ninformed decisions about accelerating its growth while signaling our \ncommitment to supporting the next chapter in America's energy \ninfrastructure.\n  I am thankful to be joined by Mr. Collins of New York as well as my \ngood friend Mr. Honda of California.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. Although am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment.\n  I would note Mr. Collins is a member of our committee. He is a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  It is a good amendment. It needs to be included as part of this. I \nwould urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. I thank the chairman for supporting this bipartisan \namendment. I am honored to have that support. I encourage its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 17 Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike page 147, line 9, through page 149, line 6.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment preserves section 433.\n  H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act, \ndeliberately removes the energy usage goals for Federal buildings.\n  In 2007, under the Energy Independence and Security Act, our last \nenergy infrastructure overhaul bill, a provision was included that set \na goal for new Federal buildings to have net-zero energy usage by 2030. \nThis naturally also meant the Federal Government would have a \ncorresponding goal of reducing fossil-fuel-generated electricity \nconsumption in its buildings.\n  This provision was forward-thinking. The Federal Government will lead \nby example in the transition to less-polluting buildings and show what \nthe next generation of infrastructure should look like.\n  Now is not the time to roll back this goal and abandon our \nleadership. When people mention how H.R. 8 would take us back to a 19th \ncentury economy, this is one clear example they can point to.\n  Commercial and residential buildings account for 39 percent of the \nNation's carbon emissions. To ignore this source of pollution at a time \nwhen we are trying to keep temperatures from rising less than 2 degrees \ncentigrade isn't just negligent, it ignores our responsibility to be a \ngood steward of the Earth and leave it in good condition for \ngenerations to come.\n  With the Federal Government as the largest consumer of energy in the \nU.S., we must be the leader. This effort is under attack because of \noutdated feasibility concerns--concerns which have already been \naddressed. Last year, the Department of Energy proposed a rule that \ncharts a path forward to reach the 2030 goal that is both technically \npossible and plausible.\n  I also want to address some myths about section 433. Some have \ncharacterized it as ``a ban on the Federal Government using energy from \nfossil fuel,'' but the law does no such thing. In fact, at no point \ndoes this provision in the current law require zero fossil fuel use for \nany building designed or renovated before 2030.\n  And despite objections from my friends at the American Gas \nAssociation, the Department of Energy actually proposed carve-outs for \nonsite natural gas usage in highly efficient combined heat and power \nsystems. Natural gas may actually be an important part of the solution \nof getting to net-zero energy usage.\n  Requiring Federal buildings to meet aggressive energy targets not \nonly reduces taxpayer costs through energy savings, it also reduces our \ndependence on foreign oil and leverages the government's large \npurchasing power to bring new technologies and materials to the \nmarketplace. If we eliminate section 433, it could cost American \nconsumers $700 million in savings over the next 25 years.\n  According to the American Institute of Architects, not only are the \ncurrent targets achievable, but some buildings are already meeting the \n2030 goals right now. The EU has adopted a similar goal but with a \nshorter time horizon.\n  Mr. Chair, during my 4 years in Switzerland, we cut the carbon \nfootprint of the U.S. Embassy in half and reduced the carbon footprint \nof our home to zero.\n  In 2013, Walgreens opened a net-zero energy retail space in Evanston, \nIllinois. In 2015, a True Value hardware store was the first net-zero \nretail store in New York State.\n  Within the Federal Government, our military has also taken a lead on \nthis important effort and used the goal as a means to reduce costs and \nincrease energy security. From 2007 to 2013, the Federal Government \nreduced its annual energy usage by 7 percent while we continue to grow.\n  We must continue to encourage these energy reduction efforts. We \nlearned a long time ago in business that if we don't have a goal we \nnever get there. We have to have a target that we can all work to meet.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to reinstate the energy \nusage goals for Federal buildings.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, with all due regard to the gentleman who \nis offering this amendment, I rise to oppose the amendment, which would \nreinstate the provisions of section 433 which prohibit the use of \nfossil fuels in new and modified Federal buildings after the year 2030.\n  Now, it is true that the Department of Energy is trying to thread a \nneedle through regulations that might allow fossil fuels to be used in \nnew and modified Federal buildings after 2030. But we know the reality \nis that every environmental group in the country will file a lawsuit \nagainst that regulation when it comes out if it is interpreted in any \nway that fossil fuels might be used.\n  I am really shocked that people would be opposed to our wanting to \nuse fossil fuels after the year 2030. We are not mandating that they be \nused, but everyone that comes to this floor, and particularly President \nObama when he goes anywhere, talk about an all-of-the-above energy \npolicy, and yet the 2007 Energy Policy Act prohibits fossil fuel use in \nnew and modified Federal buildings after the year 2030.\n  Our base bill does not mandate the use. It simply says, basically, \nthat the government will be able to do it if it is necessary. So why \nshould the Federal Government not allow the opportunity to use any \nfossil fuel after 2030?\n  We already have a Federal debt approaching $20 trillion. Natural gas \nprices are pretty low right now, but let's say they go up. Let's say \nthat renewables go up, that for some reason maybe using coal is more \neconomical, and using a ultra-supercritical facility.\n  We know that the President does not want to build any new coal-\npowered plants because regulations now prohibit that. We think it is \nimportant that we have an all-of-the-above energy policy. Our base bill \nallows that even in government buildings.\n  And so, for that reason, I would respectfully oppose the gentleman's \namendment and ask that Members vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H8936]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD.

Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 18 Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 1 of subtitle A of title IV, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REPORT ON ENERGY SAVINGS AND GREENHOUSE GAS \n                   EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM CONVERSION OF CAPTURED \n                   METHANE TO ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy, in \n     consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and relevant \n     stakeholders, shall submit to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the \n     impact of captured methane converted for energy and power \n     generation on Federal lands, Federal buildings, and relevant \n     municipalities that use such generation, and the return on \n     investment and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of \n     utilizing such power generation.\n       (b) Contents.--The report shall include--\n       (1) a summary of energy performance and savings resulting \n     from the utilization of such power generation, including \n     short-term and long-term (20 years) projections of such \n     savings; and\n       (2) an analysis of the reduction in greenhouse emissions \n     resulting from the utilization of such power generation.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment to the North American Security \nand Infrastructure Act requires the Secretary of Energy to submit a \nreport to Congress on the impact of captured methane converted for \nenergy and power generation on Federal lands, buildings, and relevant \nmunicipalities.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  The report would include a summary of energy performance and savings \nfrom using this power generation source and an analysis of the \nreduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n  In my district in San Diego, we are putting innovative solutions to \nwork to reduce methane emissions and create energy at the same time. At \nthe Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant, methane is collected and \nfuels two continuously running generators. Using the methane produced \nonsite, the wastewater treatment plant has not only become energy self-\nsufficient, but is also able to sell excess power that it generates to \nthe local energy grid, enhancing grid reliability and energy \nefficiency.\n  Another positive example of converting captured methane to energy is \nat landfills. In the United States, we have over 1,900 landfills, and \nthey are the third largest source of methane emissions in the United \nStates. This pollution threatens air quality and the public health of \ncommunities located close to the landfills themselves.\n  In San Diego, the Miramar Landfill spans over 1,500 acres and has \nbeen operating since 1959. Some years ago, the city, the Navy, and the \nprivate sector worked together and installed a methane-capture and \nenergy conversion plant to supply the neighboring Marine Corps Air \nStation Miramar with 13.4 megawatts of energy. This plant supplies half \nof the base's energy, allowing it to operate as a 911 base in case of \nan emergency or power outage. The technology also reduced the emission \nof pollutants from the Miramar Landfill by 75 percent.\n  My amendment will simply assess how capturing methane and using it to \ngenerate energy reduces emissions, puts America on the path to a lower \ncarbon, renewable energy future, and shares best practices among \nfacilities that might be able to participate. So I ask my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, even though I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Again, I support the amendment. We have no objection to \nthe amendment. I think that it is worthwhile, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERS. Again, I thank the chairman very much for his hard work \nand for his willingness to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 19 Offered by Ms. Schakowsky\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 4125.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would preserve an existing \nconsumer right that has been on the books for many years, but section \n4125 of this legislation would prevent consumers from pursuing breach \nof warranty claims against product manufacturers that inaccurately \nclaim Energy Star compliance. As I said, in doing so, it would \neliminate an existing consumer right.\n  While I see no justification for this change, I see the motive. The \nAssociation of Home Appliance Manufacturers, which represents 95 \npercent of U.S. home appliances and has endorsed this provision, wants \nto avoid liability.\n  Consumers pay a premium for Energy Star products. But they don't pay \nextra because they have a sense of charity; they do it because they \nhave been promised the Energy Star appliances will enable reduced \nenergy usage and lower operation costs. In fact, Energy Star products \npromise a 10 to 25 percent energy efficiency improvement as compared to \nFederal minimum standards. So when a manufacturer falsely claims to be \nEnergy Star compliant, consumers are left with a more expensive product \nwithout any of the promised benefits. It amounts, really, to fraud.\n  In the past, manufacturers--including AHAM, the association, members \nSamsung, LG, and Whirlpool--have falsely claimed that their products \nmeet Energy Star specifications. Consumers have mobilized to be \ncompensated for those false claims, and they deserve that right. My \namendment would enable them to retain it.\n  AHAM claims that my amendment would ``discourage robust \nparticipation'' in the Energy Star program. And frankly, I don't see \nthat as a problem. If manufacturers can't stand by their claims of \nEnergy Star compliance, then they shouldn't participate in the program.\n  Those manufacturers that continue to make Energy Star products will \nreap the rewards, including higher consumer demand and bigger profits, \nand that is a win for consumers, honest manufacturers, and the Energy \nStar program.\n  So I ask my colleagues, please, to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \nto strike section 4125 of the bill, which is language that \nRepresentative Welch and I have coauthored over the past two Congresses \nwith bipartisan support. It was developed with a cross section of \ninterests, including efficiency and consumer advocates, manufacturers, \nand the EPA.\n\n[[Page H8937]]\n\n  By rejecting this amendment and keeping our language, we have an \nopportunity to encourage manufacturers to continue participation in the \nEnergy Star program.\n  Energy Star is a highly successful, voluntary program. Consumers, \nmanufacturers, and the government all win under Energy Star. The \nprogram was designed to be low-cost and low-compliance to incentivize \nparticipation by manufacturers, and the language included in this bill \nis needed to continue to incentivize participation.\n  For a product to be branded with the Energy Star logo, it must meet \ncertain energy-saving guidelines. Manufacturers who choose to \nparticipate in this voluntary program make the necessary investments \nneeded to increase the energy efficiency of their products.\n  In order to ensure their products maintain the required levels of \nefficiency, the Department of Energy performs off-the-shelf testing. If \na product fails to meet the standard, that product is disqualified and \nthen publicly listed on the Energy Star Web site. Immediately following \na product's disqualification listing, the manufacturer and the EPA will \nthen work to resolve the cause for disqualification.\n  It is important to note that our language does not prevent lawsuits \nfrom being filed; it just requires that a suit be filed before a \nproduct is disqualified from Energy Star.\n  If a product has been disqualified from the program by EPA, the EPA \nis best positioned to determine consumer impact and if such impact \nrequires any action on the part of the manufacturer.\n  The EPA process is swift compared to legal proceedings, which could \ntake years. If the focus is really on consumer reimbursement, shouldn't \nthose fighting for consumer rights prefer the EPA disqualification \nprocess over class action litigation?\n  In the EPA disqualification process, the entire reimbursement goes to \nthe consumer, versus a legal proceeding, where legal fees can consume \nlarge amounts of the award.\n  Energy Star has promoted economic expansion and job growth for \nparticipating manufacturers across the Nation. In defeating this \namendment, we have an opportunity to continue to encourage \nparticipation by manufacturers instead of discouraging participation.\n  This section has the support of the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, and the Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would ask to reject the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, all this would be fine if it weren't \nthe case that we have members of the Association of Home Appliance \nManufacturers that actually have falsely claimed that their products \nmeet Energy Star specifications. And nothing in the remedy actually \nsays that the consumer will have the right to reclaim their money that \nthey spent on the washer or the dryer or the appliance that was bought \nbecause they thought that they would both save energy and, over time, \nthat they would save money as well.\n  As I said earlier, this rule, this law, has been in place for many \nyears. It does not interfere with the fact that this is a voluntary \nprogram, that the companies decide if they want to participate in \nEnergy Star to be an Energy Star product, but it does say they have to \nkeep their promise. And they have to keep their promise not just to the \nEPA or to some regulatory framework; they have to keep their promise to \nthe individual consumer who has actually laid out the bucks to buy that \nproduct.\n  This provides an opportunity for that consumer to be able to reclaim \na product if it is found not to meet the Energy Star promise that they \nmade of 10 to 25 percent energy efficiency improvements.\n  So it seems to me, why would this body go about the business of \ntaking away a consumer right? I thought we were supposed to be in the \nbusiness of trying to figure out how we are going to adequately protect \nconsumers not in the generic sense, but in the individual sense. That \nis the kind of protection that we have had, and that is the kind of \nprotection I believe that we should maintain; and this section, put in \nat the behest of the industry, makes no sense. I think it weights \ntoward the manufacturers and away from the consumers something that we \nall want to achieve, which is more energy efficiency.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed, as someone who has been a \nconsumer advocate for a very long time in many ways, especially in \nterms of truth in products, truth in labeling, that we ought to be able \nto rely on that Energy Star label to know that it is going to give us \nthe energy efficiency that we paid for and that, if it doesn't, we do \nhave a remedy. Those remedies tend to make the manufacturers even more \nhonest. I hope we will get some support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, again, I would urge defeat of the amendment \nbecause we want to make sure that manufacturers are still encouraged to \nparticipate in the Energy Star program, which has been highly \nsuccessful.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LATTA.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 2 of subtitle A of title IV, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 4128. ENERGY SAVINGS FROM LUBRICATING OIL.\n\n       Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     Director of Management and Budget, shall--\n       (1) review and update the report prepared pursuant to \n     section 1838 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005;\n       (2) after consultation with relevant Federal, State, and \n     local agencies and affected industry and stakeholder groups, \n     update data that was used in preparing that report; and\n       (3) prepare and submit to Congress a coordinated Federal \n     strategy to increase the beneficial reuse of used lubricating \n     oil, that--\n       (A) is consistent with national policy as established \n     pursuant to section 2 of the Used Oil Recycling Act of 1980 \n     (Public Law 96-463); and\n       (B) addresses measures needed to--\n       (i) increase the responsible collection of used oil;\n       (ii) disseminate public information concerning sustainable \n     reuse options for used oil; and\n       (iii) promote sustainable reuse of used oil by Federal \n     agencies, recipients of Federal grant funds, entities \n     contracting with the Federal Government, and the general \n     public.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman \nfrom Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. It calls on the Department of Energy, working together \nwith the Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Management \nand Budget, to take another look at what is now 20-year-old data about \nhow used oil is managed in the United States and to develop \ncomprehensive strategies to increase recycling used oil as part of a \nnational strategy to save energy and reduce pollution.\n  Right now, there are options for disposal of motor oil commonly used \nin trucks and cars. The worst option is for that oil to be simply \ndiscarded, leading to contaminants polluting our air and water. If \nproperly collected, the oil can be burned once for use as low-cost \nfuel.\n\n[[Page H8938]]\n\n  However, the best option uses modern technology which now exists to \ncollect and sustainably recycle used oil. These refining techniques can \nnow produce a product that is the quality equivalent to fresh virgin \nbase oils. So this option also maximizes the benefits by conserving \nmost of the energy needed to make oil while cutting emissions of carbon \nand other harmful pollutants.\n  Re-refining can turn what used to be a waste product into an \ninfinitely renewable resource. And not only does this re-refined oil \nmeet government and industry specifications, but it is also cost-\ncompetitive, reduces waste, and reduces emissions.\n  Earlier studies done by DOE as well as our national labs show that \nused motor oil is a valuable and reusable energy resource.\n  As the motor sports capital of the world--Indianapolis, that is--it \nis no surprise that Indiana has traditionally been a leader in \nrecycling and re-refining oil. We have two major used oil refineries in \nIndiana employing almost 1,000 people, and our State has a proud \ntradition of utilizing this product and promoting its technology.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Re-refined oil is already being actively used by DOD and other \nFederal agencies, public and commercial fleets, and average consumers \nwith great success. However, far too little of our used oil is recycled \nin this way. So my amendment is intended to increase conservation and \nsustainable reuse.\n  The last major Federal study was called for in the Energy Policy Act \nof 2005. That study was issued in 2006, but relied on data that was \nthen 10 years old. Now that data is 20 years old.\n  My amendment will require the DOE to update that data so that we know \nhow much oil is available and how much is actually being reused and re-\nrefined. Data from 20 years ago showed that the United States was well \nbehind other developed and even some developing countries in terms of \nsustainable reuse.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment will also provide for the development of \npolicies that can significantly increase both the collection rate and \nsustainable reuse of this valuable resource\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Upton).\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment calls on the Department of \nEnergy to review and update the data use for a 9-year-old Federal study \non oil recycling. It is a good amendment. It promotes recycling of used \nlubricating oil to save energy, minimize disposal into landfills, and \nimproves public information concerning sustainable reuse options.\n  It is a good amendment. I would like to see it adopted.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Upton) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I won't take the full 5 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, I offer this in lieu of Mrs. Ellmers. It is a simple, \ntechnical fix to DOE's external power supply rule. I am not aware of \nany opposition.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support \nof this bipartisan and commonsense amendment that would provide \ncertainty to manufacturers and resolve this DOE rule.\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues DeGette, Pompeo and Dent for \nworking with me on this issue.\n  This problem stems from an overly broad interpretation of a provision \nwithin the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in which Congress directed DOE to \nset energy efficiency standards for External Power Supplies.\n  DOE is now attempting to regulate a product that was not in the \nmarketplace at the time Congress directed the department to set \nExternal Power Supple Standards.\n  Because of DOE's interpretation, other products--such as LED Drivers \nnot intended for regulation--are now a facing regulation under the EPS \nrule.\n  This problem is, sadly, just another example of DOE expanding the \nscope of their rulemakings and capturing products that were not \nintended by Congress.\n  Thankfully, my amendment resolves the problem for this technology and \nprevents it from being included in other broad rulemakings.\n  The lighting industry is already strenuously regulated for energy \nefficiency, accounting for 20 percent of DOE's total efficiency \nregulations.\n  Regulations like this have had a negative impact of 750 million \ndollars to U.S. lighting manufacturers.\n  This regulation will only stifle innovation, ultimately leading to \nless energy efficient products and higher energy prices for consumers.\n  Manufacturers cannot operate in an uncertain marketplace and without \nCongressional action, this rule will unintentionally threaten thousands \nof jobs.\n  In North Carolina alone this industry provides over 3,000 jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 22 Offered by Mr. Tonko\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE AND STATE ENERGY \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Reauthorization of Weatherization Assistance Program.--\n     Section 422 of the Energy Conservation and Production Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6872) is amended by striking ``appropriated--'' and \n     all that follows through the period at the end and inserting \n     ``appropriated $450,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2016 \n     through 2020.''.\n\n[[Page H8939]]\n\n       (b) Reauthorization of State Energy Programs.--Section \n     365(f) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6325(f)) is amended by striking ``$125,000,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 2007 through 2012'' and inserting ``$75,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2020''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Tonko) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment reauthorizes two existing \nprograms, the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy \nProgram.\n  Both of these programs have been operating successfully for many \nyears. The Federal dollars delivered through these programs leverage \nadditional funding from our States and the private sector. These \nprograms address real problems. They are effective, and they create and \nsustain jobs.\n  As we heard during debate yesterday, H.R. 8 does very little to \nadvance energy efficiency, an issue that has enjoyed strong, bipartisan \nsupport in the past. In fact, some provisions are more likely to be a \nsetback to efficiency standards. While this bill contains plenty of \nbenefits for energy suppliers, there is very little in there designed \nto address the needs of average Americans.\n  The Weatherization Assistance Program supports State-based programs \nto improve the energy efficiency of the homes of low-income families. \nThe Department of Energy provides grants to the States, United States \nterritories, and tribal governments to deliver these services through \nlocal weatherization agencies. The weatherization measures used include \nair sealing, wall and attic insulation, duct sealing, and furnace \nrepair and replacement.\n  Mr. Chairman, the benefits of weatherization are well known and \nresult in a reduced energy bill for many years into the future. \nInsulating our walls and our roofs, for example, can provide savings \nfor the lifetime of a house. Other measures, such as making heating or \ncooling equipment more efficient, can provide savings for more than a \ndecade.\n  Since 1976, the Weatherization Assistance Program has helped improve \nthe lives of more than 7 million families by reducing their electricity \nbills. The program provides energy efficiency services to thousands of \nhomes every year, reducing average costs by more than $400 per \nhousehold in annual utility bills.\n  Investments in energy efficiency pay for themselves over time, but \nthe up-front costs can be significant, and when a family's budget is \nseverely limited, those costs are simply too high.\n  The Weatherization Assistance Program helps those in our communities \nwho do not have the financial resources to make energy efficiency \ninvestments on their own. That includes our elderly, our disabled, and \nour low-income families.\n  These vulnerable households are often on fixed incomes and are the \nmost susceptible to volatile changes in electricity prices. They are \nparticularly vulnerable to spikes in electricity bills during heat \nwaves or cold weather due to poor insulation or inefficient appliances.\n  A sudden increase in expenses is difficult to manage for many of our \nfamilies. Low-income families already spend a disproportionate amount \nof their income on energy costs.\n  Mr. Chairman, the State Energy Program provides funding to the States \nto support the work of their energy offices. It ensures that each State \nwill have basic funding available to support its programs.\n  These offices play a role in helping States define the least costly \nways to meet State goals for energy efficiency, for air quality, for \nfuel diversity, and for energy security.\n  According to a study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the State \nEnergy Program often leverages, for every 1 Federal dollar, $10.71 in \nState and private funds. That is a great return on investment.\n  Congress reauthorized these programs back in 2007 for a 5-year period \nat about $1 billion per year for Weatherization and $125 million per \nyear for the State Energy Program.\n  My amendment authorizes the Weatherization Assistance Program for \nanother 5 years, but at lower levels--$450 million per year--and the \nState Energy Program is authorized for 5 years at $75 million per year.\n  These are robust authorization levels for certain. While I believe \nthese programs should be appropriated even more funding, this amendment \nauthorizes them at lower levels to be more in tune with today's fiscal \nconstraints.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment and to help \nto extend the benefits of energy efficiency to our families so that \nmore families can be supported by local jobs, businesses, and certainly \ncontractors that do this extremely important work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I do so to oppose the amendment because, as \nwe all know, this amendment reauthorizes the Federal Weatherization \nAssistance Program at $2.2 billion through 2020 and the State Energy \nProgram at $375 million through 2020.\n  But our feeling is that it is not needed because the Department of \nEnergy's Weatherization Assistance Program is already extremely well \nfunded.\n  I support weatherization, as I think most of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle do, but Congress has been funding the program at or \nnear the Department's requested levels.\n  So this is, in essence, billions above in new spending on an existing \nprogram that the Department of Energy has not requested.\n  I would note that the 2009 stimulus bill included an extra $5 billion \nto the Department of Energy for weatherization, roughly 17 times what \nwas originally appropriated for that year.\n  Furthermore, using experiments considered the gold standard for \nevidence, researchers from UC Berkeley, MIT, and the University of \nChicago recently released a report on a first-of-its-kind field test of \nthe Federal Weatherization Assistance Program.\n  The study found that the costs of energy efficiency investments were \nabout double the actual savings, that model-projected savings are 2\\1/\n2\\ times the actual savings, and that, even when accounting for the \nbroader societal benefits of energy efficiency investments, the costs \nwill substantially outweigh the benefits. The average rate of return is \na minus 9\\1/2\\ percent annually.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, the overall legislation today that is before us is \nextremely specific in authorizing budget-neutral spending for energy \nsecurity efforts only. Authorizing additional money--beyond requested \namounts--as this Weatherization amendment does, does not have the \noffset.\n  Therefore, I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, certainly the numbers here speak to the most vulnerable \nin our society. There are waiting lists that I know exist in States. \nThere are more things we can do for energy efficiency's sake for our \nmost stressed family budgets.\n  This is a situation where energy costs, as a wedge of the pie for our \npoor families for their household budgets, is far greater a slice than \nit is for the average residents of this country. This is a hardhearted \napproach taken to our elderly, to our low-income families, and to the \ndisabled.\n  Also, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that our goal here should be to \nbe as resourceful as possible with our energy mix across this country. \nAnytime we can reduce consumption we are doing a big thing for all \nratepayers. The statements show a missing of the focus that is needed.\n  Finally, to the study, it was a one-State, one-utility study. It was \nnot peer reviewed. It was flawed. It did not really suggest to show the \nreal issues out there for this program.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. TONKO.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida (Ms. Castor) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, my amendment focuses on thermal \nenergy and combined heat power, which are essential to a smart energy \nfuture for our country, but they are often overlooked components of our \nnational energy supply.\n  In the United States, up to 36 percent of the total energy produced \nis lost from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings in the \nform of waste heat. My amendment will help industry, universities, \nhospitals, and others capture that waste heat and use renewables for \nheating, cooling, and power generation.\n  Now, I want to read the definition of what is included in renewables \nso that everyone is aware: biomass, geothermal, hydropower, landfill \ngas, municipal solid waste, ocean energy, organic waste, photosynthetic \nprocesses, photovoltaic energy, solar energy, and wind.\n  What is happening across America are businesses and nonprofits are \ngetting really smart about this wasted energy and they are putting it \nback into their facilities to save energy and save money.\n  The overall resilience and cost savings that can be achieved through \ncombined heat and power and distributed energy systems is proven every \nday, but it was especially proven during Superstorm Sandy and other \nnatural disasters.\n  During Superstorm Sandy, businesses and nonprofits, such as hospitals \nand universities, were able to keep the lights on and actually had heat \nand water in the aftermath of the storm because they have these self-\ncontained, energy-efficient waste heat projects.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have also heard testimony in the Energy and Power \nSubcommittee extensively on the importance in the future of these \nsmaller, distributed, locally based energy systems.\n  I have also seen it in my hometown in Tampa, where St. Joseph's \nHospital burns the medical waste, turns it into waste heat, and they \nare now saving $200,000 a year on their energy bills where they can \nkeep the lights on. They don't have to pay that out to the power \ncompany. That can go back into the care of patients.\n  Mr. Chairman, what my amendment proposes to do is to help overcome \nthe financing hurdles that will be key in implementing this highly \nefficient and resilient energy infrastructure.\n  My amendment would establish an initiative to provide cost-shared \nfunding for technical assistance for feasibility studies and \nengineering, and it would enable qualifying energy infrastructure \nprojects to access lower interest debt financing through a loan \nguarantee program.\n  Industrial competitiveness will be enhanced because these businesses \nwill be able to develop new revenue streams, reduce energy costs, \nreduce emissions, and enhance energy supply resiliency.\n  We have got to plan ahead here in America. We have got to be smarter. \nAccording to a joint DOE and EPA study, roughly 65 gigawatts of \ntechnical potential remain in the Nation's hospitals, universities, \nwastewater treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  My amendment will help to reduce the up-front capital cost of \ninstalling these locally based energy-efficient systems. These systems \nhave proven themselves, and we should encourage them.\n  So I respectfully request that the House act with an eye towards the \nfuture. Take this modest but very important step to help unleash \nAmerican innovation. We know how to do this. We\n\n[[Page H8942]]\n\ncan do this. Let's give our businesses, our universities, and hospitals \nan incentive to put waste energy to work and at the same time save some \nmoney.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote on my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would establish a DOE loan \nprogram to support distributed generation. While I support some of the \ngoals in this amendment--distributed generation, microgrids, combined \nheat and power--I cannot support a new loan guarantee program given the \nfailures this administration has had in issuing loans. I remember one \ncalled Solyndra a long time ago.\n  In any event, this amendment is too broad. Locally grown energy may \nmake some sense in some circumstances but not in others. There are \noften economic reasons to use nonlocal energy sources and to use them \non a larger scale than distributed generation.\n  Moreover, this provision is duplicative of other DOE programs as well \nas tax incentives and State programs that encourage the use of \ndistributed renewable energy.\n  Circumstances do vary across regions, so States should decide whether \nand how to encourage distributed generation. The Federal Government \nshouldn't be picking winners and losers.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for \nsupporting some of the goals contained in the amendment.\n  This is not an open-ended loan program. This is very modest, only \nauthorized for $250 million. The appropriators will probably scale that \nback.\n  But what it does is it allows our hospitals, universities, and other \nindustrial users across the country some upfront technical assistance \nthat will save them a lot of money and a lot of energy on the down \nside. This modest investment will have a great payoff for taxpayers and \nfor industrial users, our hospitals, and universities.\n  I have seen it work right in my district. I know it worked during \nSuperstorm Sandy. We have to think with an eye to the future and act \nthat way.\n  I request an ``aye'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 24 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No 24 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       In subtitle A of title IV, add at the end the following new \n     chapter:\n\n              CHAPTER 8--SURFACE ESTATE OWNER NOTIFICATION\n\n     SEC. 4181. SURFACE ESTATE OWNER NOTIFICATION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n       (1) notify surface estate owners and all owners of land \n     located within 1 mile of a proposed oil or gas lease tract in \n     writing at least 45 days in advance of lease sales;\n       (2) within 10 working days after a lease is issued, notify \n     surface estate owners and all owners of land located within 1 \n     mile of a lease tract, regarding the identity of the lessee;\n       (3) notify surface estate owners and all owners of land \n     located within 1 mile of a lease tract in writing within 10 \n     working days concerning any subsequent decisions regarding \n     the lease, such as modifying or waiving stipulations and \n     approving rights-of-way; and\n       (4) notify surface estate owners and all owners of land \n     located within 1 mile of a lease tract, within 5 business \n     days after issuance of a drilling permit under a lease.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I want to explain how in many States, \nincluding my home State of Colorado, landowners--if you live in a home, \nyou own your property, you bought it--you are not necessarily and in \nmost cases, in fact, you are not also the owner of the minerals beneath \nyour land. That is called a split estate.\n  Many, in fact most, surface estates in my State were split from their \nsubsurface or mineral rights--severed. And Congress rewrote the rules \nof the Homestead Act to maintain ownership over minerals even as they \ngave away western lands for development.\n  So, again, what that means is we have suburban subdevelopments, \npeople's homes--people live in their homes--and the Federal Government \nowns the mineral rights under those homes. Along with that comes the \nright to extract those minerals.\n  Unfortunately, what fails to be present in the Homestead Act is \nprotections and notification requirements for the people who live \nthere, the homeowners. So, in some cases, in Colorado and elsewhere, \nlandholders and homeowners don't even know that there has been a lease \nor a drill permit on their land where they own the surface rights.\n  Literally, one day an oil company can drive up to the property and \nconstruct a horizontal drill in the middle of your backyard without \nnotification. So you can imagine the result--harm and loss of cattle or \ncrops, infrastructure on the property--not knowing what is occurring.\n  And, really, it has been amazing to see the ability of the extraction \nindustry to operate without having to address the legitimate concerns \nof surface owners.\n  Now, my bill doesn't change all of that, and, frankly, I would like \nto go a lot further and will in other legislative efforts. This \namendment is really a commonsense effort that is a critical first step \nto right those wrongs.\n  It would simply require that the BLM notify a landowner sitting above \nmineral rights that they plan to put out for bid, award, lease, or sale \na drilling permit on that land.\n  The BLM will argue that there are notification requirements. What \nthat means is it might be posted on a Web site or in the Federal \nRegister. Well, I guarantee you that Mr. or Mrs. Smith in a suburban \nsubdevelopment are not eagerly checking the Federal Register every day. \nThey are not even generally aware that there are mineral rights under \ntheir property, nor should they have to be. They should simply get a \nletter in the mail saying what is happening if and when there is going \nto be mineral development on their property.\n  And I think that is a simple, commonsense step that would protect \nAmerican taxpayers from undue, unreasonable burdens placed upon them \nand protect property rights. I really hope it is not controversial and \nthat we can adopt this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I want to let my colleague from Colorado \nknow that this is an unnecessary amendment, so I would ask Members to \noppose it.\n  There already is a lot of built-in notification that does take place. \nI don't know if my colleague is aware of this or not, but when an \nexpression of interest for leasing is made, the BLM requires that all \nof the surface owners, wherever this expression of interest for leasing \napplies to, are notified by mail.\n  Secondly, before a permit is issued, there is another notification to \nthe surface owners of wherever that lease is located.\n  Thirdly, under the NEPA process, before the leases are even issued, \nthe public is notified. I know this amendment talks about notifying \neveryone within 1 mile. The public notification is a lot broader than \njust 1 mile, so, actually, current law does more than what this \namendment calls for.\n  But there are two different steps, in addition to the public notice, \nwhere the\n\n[[Page H8943]]\n\nsurface landowner actually is notified by mail by a good faith effort \nrequired by the Bureau of Land Management for Federal lands.\n  On top of all that, Mr. Chairman, I ask opposition for this amendment \nbecause it is poorly written. It is ambiguous as to whether it is only \napplying to Federal lands or is broader and would include tribal lands, \nprivate lands, and things way out of the jurisdiction of the Bureau of \nLand Management.\n  But, in any case, even if it would just apply to the Federal lands, \nit is unnecessary. Because of the different steps that are required \nunder the language of this amendment, it would add a lot of paperwork \nand red tape and really not accomplish anything more than what is \nalready clearly accomplished two or three times under existing law.\n  For all those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I ask that we oppose this \namendment. I know it is well-intentioned, but the law already takes \ncare of this. This amendment, besides being poorly written, would add a \nlot of time and paperwork and red tape to the process right now.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I wish that this amendment weren't \nnecessary. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of homeowners in \nColorado who fail to be notified by the BLM.\n  Now, there is a good faith effort requirement, but there is no system \nin place to ensure that the person gets a notification. So, in effect, \nwhat happens is the agency will sign off, ``We made a good faith \neffort, couldn't find who the property owner was,'' and it is posted in \nthe Federal Register or in a newspaper in an ad that the homeowner is \nextremely unlikely to ever see.\n  What we are simply saying is have a step to implement this directive \nthat already exists. Give this meaning; give this teeth. Make sure that \nhomeowners are actually notified in the mail, that there is an effort \nto actually find out who they are, and not just a bureaucratic signoff \nthat we don't know who they are and, therefore, they are never going to \nfind out until trucks drive onto their property.\n  It is a real problem, and there is a real simple, commonsense \nsolution. I urge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, just to finish this, I would say that this \nis an unnecessary amendment because there are already two, if not \nthree, different times that the notice to the surface owner already \ntakes place: once to the public at large, twice to the surface owner in \nparticular.\n  Secondly, this is poorly written. I am afraid that it does not just \nrefer strictly to Federal lands that the BLM controls, but this could \napply to tribal lands and private lands. So it makes a mess in that \nregard.\n  And, thirdly, it goes 1 mile away. The current law does refer to the \nsurface owner and accomplishes the things that the proponent of the \namendment wants to accomplish, so it is unnecessary.\n  For those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to this amendment.\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I respect my good friend and colleague from \nColorado.\n  Part of the goal of this amendment is to ensure that the full area of \ndisruption receives notification. So where you have a suburban \nsubdevelopment, it is one thing for the owner under which the activity \nis occurring to get notice.\n  But keep in mind the activity also has an impact certainly within a \nmile radius of that activity in terms of loud noises, trucks, et \ncetera. Families may choose to leave town; others may choose to stick \nit out and make sure they are prepared for whatever activity will \noccur, when it occurs.\n  But, clearly, if there are notification aspects in the current law, \nwhich there are, they are insufficient, because I come before you \ntelling you that there are homeowners in Colorado who have no prior \nword of extraction activity on their land until, literally, they see it \noccurring. They see trucks, they see people. They go out, they say, \n``What are you doing?'' and they say, ``We are getting ready to \ndrill.''\n  This happens in my State. This amendment would make sure that, more \nthan a good faith effort that is simply signed off on by some \nbureaucrat and therefore waived, there is a real effort of \nimplementation. We give full rulemaking authority to the BLM to \nactually come up with a system for notifying homeowners and adjacent \nproperty owners about extraction work that is occurring for the mineral \nrights that occur under where they live.\n  I hope that this is a basis of common sense from which we can build a \nconcept of homeowner protections and surface owner rights to balance \nthe rights that the mineral owners have. Certainly, transparency and \nnotification is a simple one and an easy one for the BLM to implement. \nThat is all the amendment would do.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy \n     production, establishing the United States as the world's \n     leading oil producer.\n       (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur \n     domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help \n     maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that \n     is essential to national defense, and generate State and \n     Federal revenues.\n       (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter \n     of energy has the potential to transform the security \n     environment around the world, notably in Europe and the \n     Middle East.\n       (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of \n     more United States oil in the market will offer more secure \n     supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic \n     alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political \n     weapon.\n       (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element \n     of our military's strategic sealift and global response \n     capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United \n     States crews will be available to support the United States \n     military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and \n     is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current \n     and projected sealift requirements for the United States.\n       (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor \n     base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew \n     the United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, \n     as well as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace \n     and war.\n       (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over \n     the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy \n     technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, \n     reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national \n     security.\n\n     SEC. 7002. REPEAL.\n\n       Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of \n     contents of that Act are repealed.\n\n     SEC. 7003. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the \n     efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, \n     marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, \n     including fossil fuels, no official of the Federal Government \n     shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of \n     crude oil.\n\n     SEC. 7004. STUDIES.\n\n       (a) Greenhouse Gas Emissions.--Not later than 120 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Energy shall conduct, and transmit to the Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate the \n     results of, a study on the net greenhouse gas emissions that \n     will result from the repeal of the crude oil export ban under \n     section 7002.\n       (b) Crude Oil Export Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Department of Commerce, in \n     consultation with the Department of Energy, and other \n     departments as appropriate, shall conduct a study of the \n     State and national implications of lifting the crude oil \n     export ban with respect to consumers and the economy.\n       (2) Contents.--The study conducted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include an analysis of--\n\n[[Page H8944]]\n\n       (A) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on the economy of the United States;\n       (B) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on consumers, taking into account impacts on energy prices;\n       (C) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on domestic manufacturing, taking into account impacts on \n     employment; and\n       (D) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on the refining sector, taking into account impacts on \n     employment.\n       (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Industry and \n     Security shall submit to Congress a report containing the \n     results of the study conducted under paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 7005. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       Nothing in this title limits the authority of the President \n     under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies \n     Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), part B of title II of the \n     Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.), \n     the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.), or \n     any other provision of law that imposes sanctions on a \n     foreign person or foreign government (including any provision \n     of law that prohibits or restricts United States persons from \n     engaging in a transaction with a sanctioned person or \n     government), including a foreign government that is \n     designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, to prohibit \n     exports.\n\n     SEC. 7006. PARTNERSHIPS WITH MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Department of Energy shall continue to \n     develop and broaden partnerships with minority serving \n     institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) \n     and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in \n     the areas of oil and gas exploration, production, midstream, \n     and refining.\n       (b) Public-private Partnerships.--The Department of Energy \n     shall encourage public-private partnerships between the \n     energy sector and minority serving institutions, including \n     Hispanic Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges \n     and Universities.\n\n     SEC. 7007. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the \n     impact of lifting the oil export ban under this title as it \n     relates to promoting United States energy and national \n     security.\n\n     SEC. 7008. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how \n     lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create \n     opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, \n     while promoting energy and national security.\n\n     SEC. 7009. PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED \n                   PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS \n                   TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the \n     export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and \n     petrochemical products by or through any entity or person, \n     wherever located, subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States to any entity or person located in, subject to the \n     jurisdiction of, or sponsored by the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Barton) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nMr. Cuellar, Mr. Flores, Mr. Conaway, and Mr. McCaul.\n  This amendment is almost identical to H.R. 702, which passed the \nHouse floor on a strong bipartisan basis several months ago with 261 \nvotes, I believe, in favor of it.\n  This is necessary because, while we had hoped that H.R. 702 would be \nbrought up in the other body as a stand-alone bill, it doesn't appear \nthat is going to happen this session, so we want to try to put this on \nanother vehicle that the Senate may yet bring up.\n  I will also point out that there are a number of larger bills in \nplay, and there is a possibility we will try to attach it to those \nalso.\n  In any event, this amendment is true to the bill that was brought up \non the House floor. It is identical, with two exceptions:\n  One, it does not have the maritime provision to provide some \nadditional funding for our maritime merchant marine fleet because that \nwas not germane--not because we don't support it, but it was not \ngermane.\n  And, two, we had a requirement that we do a study of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. That is no longer necessary because that part of the \nbill has become law.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Other than that, all of the amendments that were offered and accepted \non both sides are in this amendment that is before us today.\n  We are the third largest oil producer in the world. We have the \ncapability to significantly increase our production, but under current \nlaw, Mr. Chairman, that is not possible because it is prohibited by a \nlaw that was passed in 1975. The gist of this bill is that it would \nrepeal that ban and allow American crude oil to be put out on the world \nmarket, just like our refined oil products are today.\n  I ask everybody who voted for it before to vote for it again, and for \nthose of you who didn't see the light the last time, we are going to \ngive you a second chance tonight to vote for it.\n  I want to see if there is anybody willing to stand up and be in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, ever since I got involved in public \npolicy, which was about 40 years ago, this Nation has been crying for \nenergy independence.\n  I remember my very first campaign in 1974, during the oil energy \ncrisis, when there was all around the world no oil available and no gas \navailable, and we wanted to be energy independent. We are actually \ngetting close to it; although, we continue to import 25 percent of our \ncrude oil, but maybe we are on the cusp of being energy independent.\n  So what does Big Oil want to do? It is not good enough that they \nshould be the wealthiest of all corporations in America and the world. \nThey want to take our precious and almost energy independent oil and \nexport it.\n  Where is it going to go? Where is the market? China, for sure, wants \noil. They are going to need to double their import of oil. So where is \nBig Oil going to go with our precious natural resource that we have for \nat least the last 40 years been trying to use to achieve energy \nindependence?\n  Why would my good friend from Texas give away to Big Oil our energy \nindependence? Why would we do that?\n  By the way, the 1975 law does not prohibit. It puts the hand of the \ngovernment--the President and the Secretary of Commerce--on the spigot, \nand if it is not in America's interest to export, they can shut the \nspigot down. There is no such protection in this. The only hand on the \nspigot for the export of oil is Big Oil. There is $30 billion a year of \nadditional revenue for Big Oil--as if they don't already have enough.\n  What about the rest of the Nation? Shouldn't this natural resource \nasset of America's be shared? It could be. Control the spigot to the \nbenefit of the people at the gas pump. My farmers need chemicals and \nfertilizer coming from the oil industry. They need the pipes--they need \nall of the material--and they need the diesel. Oh, we can forget about \nthe farmers. After all, Big Oil wants to ship our precious natural \nresource--oil--overseas, probably to China.\n  So why don't we put a control on this, and if it is not in the public \ninterest, don't do it? $8.7 billion of refining infrastructure will not \nbe built as a result of this export. Whose jobs are those? They are the \nAmerican middle class', which, apparently, all of us want to protect \nand enhance. Those are middle class jobs. $8.7 billion of \ninfrastructure is not going to be built in our refineries.\n  This is not a big deal. After all, Big Oil wants it. It is no big \ndeal that we would take, as we move towards energy independence, the \none product that is available that could diminish the 25 percent oil we \ncurrently import. No. We are simply going to ship it offshore. For \nwhose benefit? Are the American mariners going to benefit from that? \nNo. Are the American shipbuilders going to benefit from that? No, not \nat all. Who is going to benefit? Some in the oil patch will benefit for \nsure, and, certainly, the Big Oil companies will benefit; but will the \nAmerican consumer at the gasoline pump benefit?\n  I have seen the studies. You can design a study that will show it, \nbut it\n\n[[Page H8945]]\n\nmeans nothing. Remember this: $30 billion of oil a year is going to \nleave this country. For whose benefit? For Big Oil? It is not for the \nperson at the gas pump. It is not for the farmer who is buying the \ndiesel. It is not for the farmer who wants to buy the fertilizer. Give \nit away. Let them have it--as if they don't already have enough. For a \ncentury, Big Oil has been subsidized by the American public. Enough \nalready.\n  I don't think this is a good idea. I don't think it is a good idea to \ntake our crude oil and allow it to be shipped overseas with absolutely \nno restrictions whatsoever. You want a strong vote on this? Then make \nit a strong ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. I will put the gentleman from California down as being \nundecided on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from College Station, \nTexas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment, \nwhich would strengthen our Nation's energy, its security, its jobs, and \nits economy.\n  We have heard some interesting rhetoric tonight, but here are the \nfacts. This amendment results in five key benefits to our country:\n  First, it benefits the American consumer with resulting overall lower \nenergy prices. This particularly benefits lower-income and lower \nmiddle-income Americans, providing greater economic security for those \nhard-working families;\n  Two, it benefits American producers and allows them to further \nreinvest in our domestic energy infrastructure, furthering our energy \nsecurity and good-paying American jobs. Most of those companies are \nsmall, independent oil and gas companies, not the major companies that \nwere just talked about;\n  Three, it benefits our geopolitical standing and strengthens ties \nwith our global friends and allies, and it hurts those countries like \nRussia, Iran, and Venezuela, which are opposed to American interests;\n  Four, it benefits the downstream refining community as lower prices \nwill stimulate volume demand for their refined products. This gives \nthem more financial capital to hire skilled American workers and to \nreinvest in their operations;\n  Five, it helps cure our trade imbalances.\n  These are five critical reasons as to why everybody wins if we lift \nthe ban.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Barton for his work on this \nimportant amendment. I also thank the chairman for his support.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the amendment and the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 1\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from California has yielded back the \nbalance of his time.\n\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I \ndon't see any other speakers on our side.\n  Let me simply say that this amendment is about jobs for America. \nThere is only one commodity that we prohibit, by law, from being \nexported, and it is crude oil. We don't prohibit cotton; we don't \nprohibit corn; we don't prohibit ethanol; we don't prohibit \nautomobiles; we don't prohibit video games or movies. We only prohibit \ncrude oil. That is number one.\n  Number two, since the oil prices have precipitously fallen in the \nlast 13 or 14 months, we have lost over 250,000 jobs in the United \nStates. Those aren't just oil patch jobs. Those are truck driver jobs; \nthey are warehouse jobs; they are computer programmer jobs; they are \nrestaurant jobs. You name it; those are real jobs. It is estimated, Mr. \nChairman, that we are losing as many as 1,000 jobs a week right now. If \nwe repeal this antiquated law, we can put some of those people back to \nwork.\n  We can put American-made oil in the world marketplace. It makes no \nsense to let Iran export oil, but we can't let American oil be put on \nthe world market. We don't know who is going to buy the oil, but we do \nknow that the money we will receive from it is going to come back to \nthe United States. It is going to create jobs, and it is going to help \nour economy. It is going to be good for every American in every State \nof the 50 States in the Union. Vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-359 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. Upton of Michigan.\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Tonko of New York.\n  Amendment No. 14 by Mr. Gene Green of Texas.\n  Amendment No. 17 by Mr. Beyer of Virginia.\n  Amendment No. 19 by Ms. Schakowsky of Illinois.\n  Amendment No. 22 by Mr. Tonko of New York.\n  Amendment No. 23 by Ms. Castor of Florida.\n  Amendment No. 24 by Mr. Polis of Colorado.\n  Amendment No. 25 by Mr. Barton of Texas.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Upton\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan \n(Mr. Upton) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which \nthe ayes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 26 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                        TITLE __--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. ____. VOLUNTARY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OUTSIDE RIGHTS-OF-\n                   WAY.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Secretary of the Interior or the \n     Secretary of Agriculture may authorize an owner or operator \n     of an electric transmission or distribution facility to \n     manage vegetation selectively within 150 feet of the exterior \n     boundary of the right-of-way near structures for selective \n     thinning and fuel reduction.\n       (b) Status of Removed Vegetation.--Any vegetation removed \n     pursuant to this section shall be the property of the United \n     States and not available for sale by the owner or operator.\n       (c) Limitation on Liability.--An owner or operator of an \n     electric transmission or distribution facility shall not be \n     held liable for wildlife damage, loss, or injury, including \n     the cost of fire suppression, resulting from activities \n     carried out pursuant to subsection (a) except in the case of \n     harm resulting from the owner or operator's gross negligence \n     or criminal misconduct.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom North Dakota (Mr. Cramer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Madam Chair, this amendment simply authorizes the \nvoluntary--and I stress voluntary--vegetation management within 150 \nfeet of the exterior boundary of the right-of-way near structures on \nU.S. Forest Service land.\n  As a former energy regulator and a utility commissioner, I know there \nare many threats to power lines running across this country. Most of \nthe time, this comes down to vegetation, as odd as it might seem, but \nespecially in areas where there are a lot of trees and that are remote \nareas hard to get to.\n  Off-right-of-way vegetation management on these lands are the \nresponsibility of the United States Forest Service. But for any number \nof reasons, they aren't conducting this critical work to ensure the \nreliability of our electricity.\n  Utility companies don't want to do the work off their right-of-way \ndue to the lack of clarity in their legal liability or a strict \nliability standard. This amendment provides that legal certainty and \nholds utilities accountable for gross negligence or criminal \nmisconduct.\n  Lastly, Madam Chair, it is important to note that this amendment \ndemonstrates that this is not--and I stress is not--a backdoor to \nlogging and prevents the sale of the vegetation by the utility and \nclarifies it shall be the property of the United States.\n  Madam Chair, I would also emphasize that the Edison Electric \nInstitute and the American Public Power Association support this \namendment.\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CRAMER. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I want to stress that this authorizes \nvoluntary vegetation management within 150 feet of the exterior \nboundary of the right-of-way, prevents the sale of vegetation, and \nlimits legal liability. I think it is a good amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, the manager's amendment to H.R. 8 already \nincludes a provision which would hand over management of vast swaths of \nU.S. public lands to private corporations and other utility providers \nunder the guise of preventing forest fires.\n  This provision was inserted in the dead of night, and the full House \nwon't get to vote on it. This is a terrible way to treat our public \nlands.\n  As if this weren't enough, this amendment would go even further, \nallowing electric utilities to clear-cut a football field-length swath \nof national forest adjacent to transmission rights-of-way.\n  It would also shift liability for fire damage caused by transmission \ninfrastructure from the utilities to the American taxpayers, and that \nis just not right.\n  The Forest Service and the BLM are already working with utilities to \nimprove right-of-way maintenance, and both agencies testified before \nthe Natural Resources Committee that prior agency approval is not \nnecessary for emergency vegetation maintenance work.\n  Mr. Huffman offered a commonsense amendment at markup which would \nhave required proactive planning by utilities in coordination with land \nmanagers to identify and address potential fire threats, but every \nRepublican voted against it. Instead, they are supporting legislation \nwhich would lead to less responsible stewardship of the American \npeople's forests.\n  According to the National Interagency Fire Center, power lines were \nresponsible for causing only 0.03 percent of forest fires in past 5 \nyears.\n  Madam Chair, if Republicans were serious about preventing and \nfighting forest fires, they would work with us to adequately fund the \nForest Service and fix the problem of fire borrowing, which last year \nburned up 52 percent of the agency's budget.\n  But this isn't about solving a problem. This is about control. It is \nregrettable that House Republicans seek to give away the people's land \nto private interests. It is outrageous that this would happen.\n  Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Madam Chair, I just want to correct a couple of the \nstatements made sincerely by the opposition to this. I want to be clear \nthat the cost of this is borne not by the taxpayers, but by the \nutilities themselves. The reason that they are not able to do it now, \nof course, is because of a lack of clarity and the liability. So this \nsimply clears that part of it up.\n  Again, I want to get back to I was a regulator for nearly 10 years. \nSome people may remember not so many years ago a major rolling brownout \nthat led to blackouts in the northeastern part of this country.\n  All of that was caused by trees growing into transmission lines. It \nhas a cascading effect. And, yes, if it is a large forest, those trees \ngrowing into transmission lines can also create forest fires.\n  This is a very basic approach. Most of the arguments that the \ngentleman raised are to the underlying bill, not to this amendment. \nThis amendment is very straightforward.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Dakota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 27 Offered by Mr. Duffy\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 27 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n                        TITLE VII--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 7001.

Madam Chair, today I rise to talk about a commonsense \namendment, an amendment that takes aim at excessive bureaucratic \nrulemaking at the EPA.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  The EPA has long been known to issue onerous and costly rules with \nlittle regard to the impact on American businesses and the families who \nrun those businesses.\n  According to some estimates, 17 of the EPA's major rules implemented \nbetween 2000 and 2013 have imposed an annual economic impact of $90 \nbillion--a $90 billion annual impact per year, which means real jobs \nand a real impact on our economy.\n  Adding to the frustration, the EPA often ignores longstanding \nexecutive orders that require them to improve their own regulatory \ncoordination planning and reviews. These executive orders were issued \nunder the Clinton and Obama administrations, two administrations that \nhave a very positive outlook towards the EPA. By no stretch of the \nimagination do we consider them conservatives.\n  These orders require departments, but not independent regulatory \nagencies like the EPA, to follow certain guidelines when it comes to \nmajor rules that would have a dramatic impact on State, local, or \ntribal government, or private sector expenditures in the aggregate of \nmore than $100 million a year. So those are big rules that have big \nimpacts.\n  The mercury rule put forward by the EPA is a prime example of that. \nIt was going to cost $10 billion. This summer, the U.S. Supreme Court \nstruck down that rule because the EPA unreasonably failed to consider \nthe cost. My amendment would require the EPA to actually follow \nexisting requirements to improve regulatory planning, coordination, and \nreviews.\n  American families and businesses can't afford the EPA to continue \nwith duplicative and overreaching regulations. The EPA should have to \nfollow the same rules that other departments in American government \nmust follow.\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. DUFFY. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. I just want to say to the Chair and colleagues, this \namendment requires the EPA to satisfy regulatory planning review \nrequirements established by both the Clinton and Obama administrations.\n  I think the amendment is a good one, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment \nwhich would require EPA to satisfy within 30 days certain regulatory \nrequirements included in three executive orders in two sections of the \nU.S. Code. This amendment is a solution in search of a problem.\n  EPA, in carrying out its responsibilities to write regulations as \nrequired by various statutes--for example, the Clean Air Act and the \nClean Water Act--already complies with the EPA's specific \nresponsibilities included in the three executive orders and two \nsections cited in this amendment.\n  I say ``EPA'' specifically because some of these laws and executive \norders impose ongoing obligations on these agencies and place \nresponsibility on parties other than the EPA--for example, the Vice \nPresident and the Administrator of the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget. In such \ncases, it will not be possible for EPA to ``ensure that the \nrequirements of subsection (b) are satisfied,'' as the amendment \nrequires.\n  In addition, some matters, such as the publication of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Agenda in the Federal Register, as cited in section 602 of \ntitle 5 of the U.S. Code, are handled by the General Services \nAdministration on behalf of other Federal agencies and are therefore \nsimilarly outside of the EPA's control.\n  Moreover, Madam Chair, this amendment has the potential to lead to \nconfusion in the future because it requires the EPA also to satisfy \nrequirements in any successor executive orders that may establish \nrequirements applicable to the uniform reporting of regulatory and \nderegulatory agendas.\n  What happens if these successor executive orders are not consistent \nwith the current ones? Then we have a situation where EPA is forced to \ncomply with competing executive orders, leading to unnecessary \nconfusion.\n  Let's avoid this possibility by defeating this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Madam Chair, some of my friends across the aisle's \narguments are: Don't let the people know. Let's not be transparent. \nLet's have the EPA implement rules with no comment, no transparency, \nand no input from the American people.\n  That is not what our Founders envisioned. They envisioned a form of \ngovernment where it was transparent and we all had a say in the \nprocess. These aren't radical ideas. This is common sense.\n  Listen, a quote: ``Regulations shall be adopted through a process \nthat involves public participation.'' That wasn't from Ronald Reagan or \nGeorge Bush. That was Barack Obama.\n  ``Each agency, where feasible and appropriate, shall seek the views \nof those who are likely to be affected.'' Not Ronald Reagan, not George \nBush, but Barack Obama.\n  This stuff makes sense. Open the process up, let the American people \nsee the impact and the rules that are being proposed, just like in \nevery other government agency. The EPA shouldn't get special treatment.\n  Transparency, good government, American involvement from the people \nin the process is what this amendment is about. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support good government and a great amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, let me just say that this process with the \nEPA is very transparent, they do consider costs, and I disagree with \nthe gentleman.\n  I urge opposition to this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 28 Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 28 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n                        TITLE VII--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 7001. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Covered civil action.--The term ``covered civil \n     action'' means a civil action containing a claim under \n     section 702 of title 5, United States Code, regarding agency \n     action (as defined for the purposes of that section) \n     affecting a covered energy project on Federal land.\n       (2) Covered energy project.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``covered energy project'' \n     means--\n       (i) the leasing of Federal land for the exploration, \n     development, production, processing, or transmission of oil, \n     natural gas, coal, geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, solar, \n     or any other source of energy; and\n       (ii) any action under the lease.\n       (B) Exclusion.--The term ``covered energy project'' does \n     not include any dispute between the parties to a lease \n     regarding the obligations under the lease, including any \n     alleged breach of the lease.\n\n     SEC. 7002. EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR CERTAIN CIVIL ACTIONS RELATING \n                   TO COVERED ENERGY PROJECTS.\n\n       Venue for any covered civil action shall lie in the United \n     States district court in which the covered energy project or \n     lease exists or is proposed.\n\n     SEC. 7003. TIMELY FILING.\n\n       To ensure timely redress by the courts, a covered civil \n     action shall be filed not later\n\n[[Page H8955]]\n\n     than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of \n     the final Federal agency action to which the covered civil \n     action relates.\n\n     SEC. 7004. EXPEDITION IN HEARING AND DETERMINING THE ACTION.\n\n       The court shall endeavor to hear and determine any covered \n     civil action as expeditiously as practicable.\n\n     SEC. 7005. LIMITATION ON INJUNCTION AND PROSPECTIVE RELIEF.\n\n       (a) In General.--In a covered civil action, a court shall \n     not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court \n     finds that the relief--\n       (1) is narrowly drawn;\n       (2) extends no further than necessary to correct the \n     violation of a legal requirement; and\n       (3) is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the \n     violation.\n       (b) Duration.--\n       (1) In general.--A court shall limit the duration of \n     preliminary injunctions to halt covered energy projects to \n     not more than 60 days, unless the court finds clear reasons \n     to extend the injunction.\n       (2) Administration.--In the case of an extension, the \n     extension shall--\n       (A) only be in 30-day increments; and\n       (B) require action by the court to renew the injunction.\n       (a) In General.--Sections 504 of title 5 and 2412 of title \n     28, United States Code (commonly known as the ``Equal Access \n     to Justice Act''), shall not apply to a covered civil action.\n       (b) Court Costs.--A party to a covered civil action shall \n     not receive payment from the Federal Government for the \n     attorneys' fees, expenses, or other court costs incurred by \n     the party.\n\n     SEC. 7006. LEGAL STANDING.\n\n       A challenger that files an appeal with the Department of \n     the Interior Board of Land Appeals shall meet the same \n     standing requirements as a challenger before a United States \n     district court.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment \nto H.R. 8. The Gosar-Bridenstine-Yoho amendment ensures timely review \nfor legal challenges of energy projects and limits attorneys' fees for \nsuch challenges in order to discourage frivolous lawsuits and foster \nAmerican energy production.\n  This amendment will streamline the process and encourage production \nof natural gas, hydropower, clean coal, geothermal, solar, oil, \nbiomass, and all other sources of energy that are produced on Federal \nlands.\n  Specifically, this amendment requires that U.S. district courts hear \nand determine covered civil action challenges as expeditiously as \npractical and that all covered actions be filed within 90 days of the \nfinal Federal agency action.\n  This amendment is a responsible, commonsense step that a government \naccountable to the people should take to show proper stewardship of the \npublic's dollar, time, and resources. If you support transparency and \ncutting red tape that is holding up energy development, then you should \nsupport this amendment.\n  Just this week, the House passed legislation unanimously in the form \nof H.R. 3279, the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act. This \nbipartisan bill tracks how much money is paid out under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act, EAJA, and from which agencies. This legislation \nwas necessary because, while Congress used to track such information, \nthese practices were stopped in 1995.\n  The Gosar-Bridenstine-Yoho amendment improves on this excellent \nbipartisan work by limiting attorney fees and frivolous lawsuits \nagainst covered energy products, including renewables.\n  While no one knows the exact cost of EAJA payouts, as they have \noccurred untracked and in the dark for 20 years, the Government \nAccountability Office last reported in 2009 that special interest \nWashington, D.C., lawyers were billing the Federal Government at \nexorbitant rates, as high as $750 an hour.\n  It seems only appropriate that H.R. 3279 should be signed into law, \nthose reporting requirements should kick in, and our amendment should \nbe adopted before the Federal Government squanders more taxpayer money \npaying out D.C. trial attorneys who specialize in holding up American \nenergy production.\n  House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop supports our commonsense \namendment.\n  Our amendment is endorsed by the Americans for Limited Government; \nthe American Petroleum Institute; Anglers United, Inc.; Arizona \nBuilders Alliance; the Arizona Farm Bureau; Arizona Liberty; Arizona \nPork Council; AZ BASS Nation; the Bass Federation; Concerned Citizens \nfor America; Gavel Resources; Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative \nAssociation; the Rural Public Lands County Council; Shake, Rattle and \nTroll Radio; Sulfur Springs Valley Electric Cooperative; the Yuma \nCounty Chamber of Commerce; and countless citizens around the country \nwho are tired of red tape and bureaucracy holding up American energy \nproduction.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member for their tireless efforts on \nthe North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act, and I \nstrongly support H.R. 8.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gosar-Bridenstine-Yoho amendment.\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GOSAR. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for the amendment.\n  We have talked to the Natural Resources Committee staff. Obviously, \nthat is something that Chairman Bishop supports.\n  This amendment does ensure the timely review for legal challenges of \nenergy projects. It is a worthy amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the \namendment to H.R. 8.\n  This amendment is another example of pro-corporate, anti-\nenvironmental legislation designed by large corporations to restrict \naccess to the courts for the average citizen.\n  The Gosar amendment ignores separation of powers by telling the \nFederal courts how to do their job, restricting the type of relief a \ncourt can grant, and penalizing successful challenges brought under the \nEqual Access to Justice Act. This, in turn, limits access to legal \nrelief for those challenging government decisions.\n  Let's say you are a farmer or a rancher or a landowner and you live \nadjacent to Federal land that is being leased out to an energy company \nfor fracking and you are worried about what is going to happen to your \ndrinking water, you are worried about the price of your house, and you \nare worried about the health of your children. Well, this amendment \nwill greatly interfere with your ability to challenge the decision of \nthe Federal agency granting the permit. It will tie the hands of the \ncourts in terms of deciding the case in a fair and just way.\n  For nearly 70 years, the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, has \nserved as the foundation for administrative agency action and ensures \nthat agency action taking place in the rulemaking process is fair, \nefficient, and flexible enough to accommodate the myriad of agency \nactions it governs along with the challenges of daily life.\n  Judicial review of agency action is a hallmark of the APA, and it is \ncritical to ensuring that government action does not harm or adversely \naffect the public. The Gosar amendment would discard decades of wisdom \nand jurisprudence preserving the right of judicial review.\n  First, it would reduce the statute of limitations for judicial review \nof agency action under the APA to 90 days. This is down from 6 years \nfor most claims brought against the United States in cases involving \nonshore and offshore energy leasing, development, and transmission on \nFederal lands.\n  This razor-thin window for review would effectively immunize \ngovernment action involving energy projects from public accountability, \nallowing those agencies to opt out of our civil justice system.\n  Second, the amendment limits a judicial stay of final agency action \nby requiring courts to only consider whether relief would be the least \nintrusive or narrowly drawn relief possible to correct a violation.\n  Courts, however, typically consider other things, such as where the \npublic\n\n[[Page H8956]]\n\ninterest lies. This sweeping limitation would dramatically interfere \nwith the courts' ability to provide relief, tilting the outcome against \nthe public interest.\n  Lastly, this amendment slams the door to the courthouse by \nprohibiting access to funds under the Equal Access to Justice Act. By \nenacting the Equal Access to Justice Act, Congress recognized that \nindividuals and organizations should not be deterred from challenging \nunjustified governmental action simply because it costs too much.\n  For three decades, veterans, seniors, persons with disabilities, \nsmall businesses, and nonprofit organizations from across the \nideological spectrum have relied upon the Equal Access to Justice Act \nto challenge illegal government action. This amendment would cripple \nthe rights of those concerned or opposed to an energy project by \npreventing those who cannot afford to litigate a case against a big \ncorporation from recovering fees, expenses, and court costs when they \nwin.\n  It is time for this Congress to stand up for everyday Americans. I \nurge my colleagues to stand for the rights of the individual and local \ncommunities and oppose this misguided amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, this amendment is simple. Either you are with \nAmerican energy producers, or you are with overpaid, high-priced \nWashington, D.C., attorneys and extremist special interest groups that \nare holding up American energy production.\n  This amendment still allows the public to seek assistance in Federal \ncourt and actually encourages that an up-or-down review of their legal \nchallenges occur in a more timely manner.\n  This amendment does not affect NEPA or environmental requirements \nwhatsoever. All American energy producers will still have to go through \nthe full environmental review and permitting process. As I mentioned \nearlier with regard to previous amendments, that process takes an \naverage of 1,709 days to complete, and it allows public input from all \nAmericans.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, you are with American people--\nfarmers, ranchers, landowners, just regular, ordinary people--or you \nare with the Big Business corporations that are seeking to rape and \npillage, on occasion, the land without any drawback of having to be \ntaken into the courthouse to deal with what they have done or with what \nthey are about to do.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, as I stated earlier, the amendment encourages \nan all-of-the-above energy strategy and has specific language that \nensures the amendment applies to solar, natural gas, hydropower, clean \ncoal, geothermal, oil, biomass, and any other source of energy that is \nproduced on Federal lands. It actually embraces and supports those \nfolks out there in America; so I ask all of our folks to vote for the \nGosar-Bridenstine-Yoho amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 29 Offered by Mr. Upton\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 29 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, as the designee of Evan Jenkins, I offer \namendment No. 29.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  December 2, 2015, on page H8956, the following appeared: Mr. \nUPTON. Madam Chair, I offer Evan Jenkins amendment No. 29.\n  \n  The online version should be corrected to read: Mr. UPTON. Madam \nChair, as the designee of Evan Jenkins, I offer amendment No. 29.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n                        TITLE VII--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 7001. STUDY TO IDENTIFY LEGAL AND REGULATORY BARRIERS \n                   THAT DELAY, PROHIBIT, OR IMPEDE THE EXPORT OF \n                   NATURAL ENERGY RESOURCES.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall jointly transmit to the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House \n     of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the Senate, the results of a study to--\n       (1) identify legal and regulatory barriers that delay, \n     prohibit, or impede the export of natural energy resources, \n     including government and technical (physical or market) \n     barriers that hinder coal, natural gas, oil, and other energy \n     exports; and\n       (2) estimate the economic impacts of such barriers.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Upton) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, this amendment requires the Department of \nEnergy and the Department of Commerce to conduct a study regarding the \nlegal and regulatory barriers that delay, prohibit, or impede the \nexport of natural energy resources.\n  This amendment instructs the Department of Energy and the Department \nof Commerce to conduct this study to figure out which regulatory \nbarriers may be prohibiting, delaying, or hindering the export of \nAmerica's natural resources, like coal and natural gas, which come in \nthe form of permitting requirements, the threat of litigation, \nregulatory red tape, market forces, and more.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, \nwhich would require the Department of Energy and the Department of \nCommerce to conduct a study on the legal and regulatory provisions that \ndelay or prohibit the export of natural energy resources.\n  This is another example, Madam Chair, of an amendment in search of a \nproblem. The majority is, once again, making hyperbolic claims about \nthe Federal Government blocking energy exports, but this is simply not \ntrue.\n  To cite the example of LNG exports, the Department of Energy \ncurrently conducts a public interest review of all applications to \nexport LNG to a country without a free trade agreement with the United \nStates. The DOE has established a record of acting expeditiously, and \nit has acted on all applications that have completed the NEPA process. \nTo date, the DOE has approved nine final authorizations on seven \nprojects. So, to imply there is a barrier in this case is simply not \ntrue.\n  Further, any so-called barrier usually has a specific purpose: for \nexample, taking the time to ensure that public health is protected, \nthat safety and environmental concerns are adequately evaluated, that \nthe export of our natural resources is actually in the national \ninterest, and that consumers are not adversely impacted.\n  Finally, the amendment doesn't define ``barrier.'' So would other \nagencies' regulations, promulgated under other statutory authority, \nconstitute a barrier? I am also not sure that the DOE and the \nDepartment of Commerce even have the appropriate expertise to assess \nthese barriers.\n  For these reasons, Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment as its being \nan unnecessary and vaguely defined study, and I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 30 Offered by Mr. Rouzer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 30 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                        TITLE __--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. ____. REPEAL OF RULE FOR NEW RESIDENTIAL WOOD HEATERS.\n\n       The final rule entitled ``Standards of Performance for New \n     Residential Wood Heaters, New Residential Hydronic Heaters \n     and Forced-Air Furnaces'' published at 80 Fed. Reg. 13672 \n     (March 16, 2015) shall have no force or effect and shall be \n     treated as if such rule had never been issued.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) and\n\n[[Page H8957]]\n\na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nNorth American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act.\n  In early March of this year, the EPA published a final rule \nestablishing new regulations for wood heaters. Manufacturers and \nconsumers across the country are concerned about the negative impact of \nthese new regulations. In essence, these new requirements will increase \nthe cost to the point that wood heaters may very well be priced out of \nthe marketplace. The best case scenario is that consumers will be \npaying more. Now, Madam Chair, neither is a good outcome.\n  According to reports, 10 percent of U.S. households still choose wood \nheaters to keep their energy costs as low as possible. The number of \nhouseholds that rely on wood as their primary heating source--get \nthis--rose by nearly one-third from 2005 to 2012.\n  It is important to note that several States have worked to protect \ntheir residents from the consequences of these new regulations. \nWisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, Virginia, and my home State of North \nCarolina have all introduced or have passed legislation that prohibits \ntheir respective environmental agencies from enforcing these \nburdensome, unnecessary regulations. The reason is that they know the \ncosts of additional regulations are always passed down to the \nconsumers.\n  Simply put, the Federal Government has no business telling private \ncitizens how they should heat their homes.\n  Think about all of the folks in the Midwest and the Northeast who are \ngoing to need and want a wood heater. After all, this is America. If \nyou want to have the opportunity to buy a wood heater, you ought to \nhave that opportunity. It shouldn't be priced out of the market.\n  Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. \nSmith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Madam Chair, the EPA has decided that 12 million wood-burning stoves \nin 2.4 million households across America need to be regulated.\n  Back in the Eighth District of Missouri, about 30,000 households use \nwood heat to warm their homes. Census data shows that households \nheating with wood grew 34 percent between 2000 and 2010 and that low- \nand middle-income households are much more likely to use wood as a \nprimary heating fuel. A given home in my district is five times more \nlikely to be heated with wood than is the national average.\n  Constituents I talk with daily are sick of this administration's war \non rural America. Rules like these disproportionately hurt rural areas, \nwhich use much more wood heat than do urban or suburban environments: \n57 percent of households that primarily use wood for heat are in rural \nareas; 40 percent are in the suburbs; and only 3 percent are in urban \nareas. Times are already tough enough back home. Folks should not be \npunished for their self-reliance and their forethought to take \nadvantage of an abundant, eco-friendly fuel like wood.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in eliminating this rule and keeping \naffordable energy available to folks who need it the most.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, this amendment will delay the \nimplementation of the EPA's important standards for residential wood \nheaters--finalized in February 2015--that will help improve air \nquality, especially in communities where people burn wood for heat.\n  The EPA updated these standards because the Clean Air Act requires \nthe EPA to set new source performance standards for categories of \nstationary sources of pollution that cause or significantly contribute \nto air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare, and the \nlaw requires the EPA to review these standards every 8 years.\n  The EPA issued the first NSPS for residential wood heaters in 1988. \nThe Agency amended the standards once in 1998 to prohibit the sale of \nwood heaters to consumers if the manufacturer had used an invalid test \nto obtain EPA certification that the heater met NSPS requirements. The \n1998 amendments did not change the emission limits in the original \nrule. This means the standards for wood heaters have not been updated \nin nearly 30 years.\n  The EPA's standards reflect significant outreach to the public and \ninterested stakeholders, including consultation with State, local, and \ntribal governments and a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel.\n  The new standards will provide tremendous health benefits by cutting \nharmful air pollution, including particle pollution, carbon monoxide, \nand air toxics. Particle pollution causes a range of adverse health \neffects, including asthma, heart attacks, and stroke.\n  The EPA estimates that the benefits of these standards will be up to \n$7.6 billion annually. Put another way, for every dollar spent to \nmanufacture cleaner wood heaters, we will see up to $165 in health \nbenefits. So blocking this rule is fiscally irresponsible.\n  Some may claim that this rule will require people who use wood \nheaters to replace the models they currently use, but this standard \napplies only to the new manufacturing of wood heaters. It does not \nrequire people to replace the heaters they have already purchased. Let \nme repeat that. The EPA is not going into anyone's home and forcing one \nto replace a heater one currently has. The final rule also has a \ngradual 5-year phase-in to allow manufacturers time to adapt.\n  If this amendment were to become law and if the EPA is unable to \nimplement these standards, manufacturers will be able to continue \nproducing outdated wood heaters that pose risks to our air quality and \nto our health.\n  The EPA's rule is a reasonable one that is long overdue. It has \nimportant benefits, and it should be allowed to be implemented; so I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment that has \nbeen put forward in order to address an onerous, unnecessary rule. My \nquestion is: What are we going to try to regulate next--fireplaces? It \nis next on the list, it seems to me.\n  I ask for the support of this amendment, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Missouri for being here to offer his words of support for the \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Woodall). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 31 Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida (Ms. Castor) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a great \nopportunity to put solar power within reach of more families and small \nbusinesses across America. It amends the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act of 1978 under which Congress directs States to consider \nadopting certain regulatory policies.\n  My amendment directs States to consider solar projects up to 2 \nmegawatts in size to be connected to their power distribution system \nand that utilities allow the electricity produced by the community \nsolar facility to be credited directly to each of the consumers that \nowns a share of the system, thus offsetting the cost of the electricity \nthat would normally be billed by the utility to the customer.\n  Currently, 14 States and the District of Columbia have shared \nrenewable policies in place. My amendment would encourage other States \nto consider implementing new policies to promote community solar \nprojects.\n  Mr. Chair, 49 percent of households are currently unable to host a \nphotovoltaic system because they do not own their building. They are \nrenters or they do not have access to sufficient roof space, like high-\nrise buildings or multifamily buildings, or they live in buildings with \ntoo much shade or insufficient roof space to host such a photovoltaic \nsystem.\n  It is also estimated that 48 percent of businesses are unable to host \na solar array. So by opening the market to these customers, shared \nsolar could represent as much as half of the distributed photovoltaic \nmarket in 2020, adding an additional 5.5 to 11 gigawatts of solar \ncapacity across our country.\n  One good example is what is happening in central Florida. The Orlando \nUtilities Commission has developed central Florida's first community \nsolar farm. The community solar farm gives Orlando residential and \nsmall business customers access to sustainable, maintenance-free solar \nenergy without the hassles and costs associated with installing panels \non their home or businesses.\n  The 400-kilowatt array produces an average of 540,000 kilowatts \nannually, which is enough energy to meet the power needs of about 40 \nhomes. This has great promise. It has great potential for families and \nsmall businesses that we all represent across the country.\n  I would urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires States to consider \nelectric utilities to allow community solar projects of up to 2 \nmegawatts to connect to the electric grid. We do know that community \nsolar is an exciting new technology that many communities and customers \nare seriously considering.\n  I could say that I support the gentlewoman's community solar goals, \nbut there are some concerns with the amendment. Namely, as drafted, it \ncould violate some State electric service laws, while also potentially \nbeing redundant of Federal standards currently imposed on States.\n  But because it is not a mandate and uses PURPA for States to \nconsider, which they are free to consider or reject, we can accept the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee for recognizing the great promise and \ngreat potential for solar power for families and small businesses \nacross the country. I thank him for urging an ``aye'' vote.\n  I also urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 32 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page H8959]]\n\n\n  \n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n                        TITLE VII--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 7001. STUDY OF VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy shall transmit to Congress the \n     results of a study to determine the maximum level of \n     volatility that is consistent with the safest practicable \n     shipment of crude oil by rail.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the Department \nof Energy to study and report to Congress within 1 year the maximum \nlevel of volatility that is safe for transporting crude oil by rail.\n  This commonsense improvement to the bill is a first step in \naddressing concerns of residents in districts like mine that, while it \nis heavily industrialized, is also urbanized. The area that I represent \nhas five oil refineries and two destination facilities for oil by rail.\n  In 2008, oil traffic had increased over 5,000 percent along rail \nroutes leading from production zones in America to refineries and hubs \nalong both coasts. As traffic increases, so does the risk of \nderailments to communities. Bakken crude oil is considered more \nvolatile than other types of crude and has important safety \nimplications for all of us.\n  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has issued \nsafety alerts warning that crude oil being transported from this region \nmay be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil. In fact, heavy \nvolatile crude oil from this region has been compared to jet fuel with \nflammable vapors that can ignite after a derailment.\n  Several communities along rail lines have been forced to evacuate or \nsustain significant property and environmental damage after derailment. \nUnfortunately, there have been instances of severe injuries and some \ndeaths resulting from these accidents.\n  While the Obama administration has taken important steps to improve \ntank car standards, more must be done to ensure that Americans living \nnear railways are safe. This amendment requires DOE to determine the \nacceptable volatility for the safe transportation of oil by rail.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I \nsupport the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, this amendment requires the Department of \nEnergy to study the maximum level of volatility that is consistent with \nthe safest practical shipment of crude oil by rail. Every one of us \nhere wants the safe transportation of all of our natural resources. \nRail transport is getting larger and larger. We need to make sure that \nit is safe.\n  I think it is a worthy amendment. I would urge all my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Mrs. Lowey).\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the DeSaulnier-Lowey-\nGaramendi amendment. At the outset, I want to thank my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman, for your wisdom in supporting this very \nimportant amendment.\n  This year derailments in North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and West \nVirginia endangered lives, destroyed homes, and jeopardized waterways.\n  We must protect those who live near America's extensive rails, \nincluding my constituents in Rockland County, New York, where every \nweek as many as 30 trains carry highly volatile Bakken crude oil past \nhomes, schools, and businesses.\n  In 2013, a freight train pulling 99 oil tanker cars collided with a \ntruck in West Nyack, averting disaster because the cars were empty. \nThis was not an isolated incident. Vehicles are frequently struck on \ntrain tracks that carry crude oil. Just last month a freight train \ncollided with a car in Congers. We cannot afford to risk a ``next \ntime.''\n  We need scientific information to determine what volatility levels of \ncrude oil can be safely shipped, which would be provided if this \namendment passed, to protect those living near railways from the \ndangers associated with a crude oil derailment.\n  I urge support of this amendment. I thank my colleague, Mr. \nDeSaulnier, and our chair again. It looks like we are going to see some \nimportant action on this very critical issue.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman, the staff, and Mrs. \nLowey.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 33 Offered by Mr. Deutch\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Deutch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chair, H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security \nInfrastructure Act, was crafted to support the modernization of our \nNation's energy infrastructure and the promotion of energy efficiency.\n  The Deutch-Takai amendment builds on this legislation by supporting \nfurther development of one of our Nation's clean, renewable energy \nsources, marine and hydrokinetic energy.\n  This amendment reauthorizes the Department of Energy's marine and \nhydrokinetic research, development, and demonstration programs. This \namendment would support the innovative work done by institutions across \nthe country, including Florida Atlantic University in my district. I am \nso proud that FAU has been a leader in hydrokinetic energy, harnessing \nthe clean power of our oceans to bring America one step closer to \nenergy independence.\n  FAU's research being done along our pristine coasts in Broward County \nhas already shown the tremendous potential of hydrokinetic energy to \nproduce reliable energy without endangering our beaches or oceans.\n  These national marine renewable energy research, development, and \ndemonstration centers will serve as information clearinghouses for the \nmarine and hydrokinetic energy industry by providing best practices \ninformation on developing and managing these projects so that others \ncan learn from the work being done nationwide and grow this important \nenergy source.\n  Marine and hydrokinetic energy projects generate energy from waves, \ncurrents, such as the gulf stream, and tides in the ocean and estuary \nor tidal areas. They also can generate energy from free-flowing water \nin rivers, lakes, or streams.\n  Marine and hydrokinetic energy projects generate power without the \nuse of a dam or the impoundment of water. Accordingly, the projects \nhave minimal, if any, impact on the surrounding environment.\n  The ocean waves, currents, and tides are a massive resource that have \nthe potential to produce continuous clean energy. In fact, harnessing \nonly 15 percent of the energy from U.S. coastal waves would produce as \nmuch electricity as we currently produce from conventional \nhydroelectric dams.\n  Moreover, it has been estimated that the amount of energy that could \nbe produced from waves, currents, and tides along the U.S. coast could \nprovide power to approximately 67 million homes. With more than 50 \npercent of our Nation's population currently living within 50 miles of \ncoastline, harnessing the energy of ocean waves, currents, and tides \nand transmitting the energy to our cities and neighborhoods is cost \neffective and practical.\n  The Department of Energy has estimated that hydrokinetic energy could \nprovide up to 25 percent of our Nation's power. The agency estimates \nthat California, Washington, and Oregon could have up to 20 percent of \ntheir electricity requirements generated from waves, while Hawaii and \nAlaska could have nearly all of their energy needs provided by marine \nhydrokinetic energy.\n  Currently, this still young and developing form of energy technology \nis in the process of being commercialized.\n  In Maine, hydrokinetic devices that harness energy from the tides \nnear Cobscook Bay have been connected to the electric grid and provide \nenough power for 25 to 30 homes. In Hawaii, a hydrokinetic device has \nbecome the first to be connected to the electric grid that harnesses \nenergy from waves.\n  These are the beginning steps toward commercializing this energy \nform, and it will enable them to become more widespread and provide \npower to the grids in our cities and communities.\n  Importantly, this amendment will improve the efficiency of \nregulations impacting the licensing of marine and hydrokinetic \nprojects. The amendment would provide clarity on the regulations that \nneed to be satisfied for projects seeking a license and the agencies \ninvolved in reviewing the licensing process so that innovative projects \ndon't get caught up in needless bureaucracy.\n  Marine and hydrokinetic will provide a continuous and a clean source \nof energy. This amendment would support and promote continued \ninvestment in research and development of hydrokinetic projects that \nwork to harness power from ocean waves, currents, and tides, as well as \nour Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. It would also improve the \nregulatory barriers that slow the licensing process for these projects.\n  Marine and hydrokinetic energy is a source of energy we need to \ncontinue to develop, improve, and connect to the grid to provide our \ncities and communities with the electricity that they need.\n  I thank my colleague from Hawaii, Congressman Takai, for all of his \nwork in support of marine and hydrokinetic power and for his support of \nthis amendment.\n  I strongly urge support for the Deutch-Takai amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I would say that I am convinced that this is a \ngood amendment, and I will be in support of the amendment.\n  We have many Members, particularly Cathy McMorris Rodgers on our \ncommittee, who are strong supporters of hydropower.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  This amendment promotes the research, development, and demonstration \nof marine hydrokinetic energy technologies and improves the regulatory \nprocess for such programs.

Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would establish minimum \nprivacy standards for smart meters on people's homes which are part of \nthe smart electric grid.\n  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as of 2013, \nnearly 52 million smart meters have already been installed in the \nUnited States. This amendment would prohibit locally publicly owned \nelectric utilities, electrical corporations, or gas companies from \nsharing, disclosing, or otherwise making accessible to any third party \na customer's electrical or gas consumption data.\n  It would also require these utilities to use reasonable security \nprocedures and practices to protect the customer's unencrypted \nelectrical and gas consumption data from unauthorized access, \ndestruction, use, modification, or disclosure.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the 5 minutes in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. And I will use my time to support the amendment.\n  This amendment does establish minimum privacy standards for smart \nmeters. I think it is a smart amendment, brilliant, and it needs to be \nadopted.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 35 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                          TITLE__OTHER MATTERS\n\n     SEC. ____. YOUTH ENERGY ENTERPRISE COMPETITION.\n\n       The Secretaries of Energy and Commerce shall jointly \n     establish an energy enterprise competition to encourage youth \n     to propose solutions to the energy challenges of the United \n     States and to promote youth interest in careers in science, \n     technology, engineering, and math, especially as those fields \n     relate to energy.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I just want to take a moment, Mr. Chairman, as we \nhave been debating important energy issues on the floor of the House, \nto\n\n[[Page H8962]]\n\noffer my deepest sympathy to the families who have lost loved ones in \nSan Bernardino and hope that we will come together as a country and \nfind solutions to this terrible tragedy.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce \nthis amendment because it talks about the goodness of this Nation and \nthe wonderment of our youth. My amendment particularly is called the \nYouth Energy Enterprise Competition. It asks the Secretaries of Energy \nand Commerce to jointly establish an energy enterprise competition to \nencourage youth to propose solutions to the energy challenges of the \nUnited States and to promote youth interests and careers in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math, especially those fields that relate \nto energy.\n  As a member of the United States Congress, I have had the privilege \nof being on the Congressional Award Board that provides medals to young \npeople across the country for their public service, for their \nvolunteerism. I can see when they come to Washington the excitement and \nthe future of this Nation.\n  I truly believe that the future of this Nation is in energy \nindependence. Economic growth, national security, expanding \nopportunities, and diversifying the energy sector workforce are \ncritical issues we must invest our time and talent in.\n  Across America, colleges, community colleges, high schools, and \nmiddle schools are talking about science, technology, engineering, and \nmath. We are trying to introduce our children to the wonders of \nscience, technology, engineering, and math.\n  I do it by introducing my young people to NASA, NASA Johnson, \ninviting them down to the space center and watching their eyes open in \namazement, or my annual Toys for the Kids effort, a big Christmas \nparty, and the most popular entity is the astronaut and the space \nexhibit. So I know it is in our children.\n  My amendment is consistent with the administration's commitment to \npromoting our national economic and homeland security interests and \nempowering our youth. It asks the Secretaries of the Energy and \nCommerce Departments to develop a challenge so that our young people \ncan compete with their ideas about the energy challenges of America.\n  It is a good approach to getting ideas to those of us who are \npolicymakers or maybe even to the world of the energy industry, from \nthose in Silicon Valley--and when I say that, dealing with high tech--\nto the hard-nosed energy in our Midwest, and certainly down to Houston, \nTexas, where we are dealing with LNG, natural gas, and oil and looking \nfor new ways to produce that product in a safe and environmentally \nsecure way.\n  I think this competition will bring forth new ideas, excited young \npeople, maybe starting from elementary or middle school, certainly \nworking with young people in high school and rewarding them for their \ntalent.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a number of pictures from my district. One \nexhibits a community garden but really is teaching young people about \nsoil and the idea of how you raise trees and dealing with the science \nof farming. Then you have them also dealing with a drone, knowing the \ntechnology of that and using it in a good way.\n  I have faith in America's youth, and I believe that this amendment \nwill help us bring to the forefront their talent and bright new ideas \nto make this Nation the kind of strong and powerful nation that we know \nit is but, more importantly, using the genius of our youth to face the \n21st century energy challenges.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  It is listed in the Committee Report as Jackson Lee #35.\n  Let me express my appreciation to Chairman Upton and Ranking Member \nPallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy \ninfrastructure development, security, independence and economic growth.\n  I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and \nthe members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee \nAmendment #35.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich provides:\n\n\n                  YOUTH ENERGY ENTERPRISE COMPETITION\n\n  The Secretaries of Energy and Commerce shall jointly establish an \nenergy enterprise competition to encourage youth to propose solutions \nto the energy challenges of the United States and to promote youth \ninterest in careers in science, technology, engineering, and math, \nespecially, as those fields relate to energy.\n  Mr. Chair, American energy independence, economic growth, national \nsecurity, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy \nsector workforce are critical issues we must invest our time and talent \nin.\n  But we can diversify the energy sector only if we encourage our youth \nto be interested in energy related fields, which will position our \nnation as the leader in the 21st century.\n  H.R. 8 seeks to continue to modernize energy infrastructure, help our \nnation build a 21st century energy and manufacturing workforce, bolster \nAmerica's energy security and diplomacy, promote energy efficiency and \ngovernment accountability.\n  As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the \nnation, I am always looking to support energy policies that not only \nmake our nation more energy independent and create jobs but one that \nalso invests in the future of America: our youth.\n  According to the Department of Education, 16 percent of American high \nschool seniors are proficient in math and interested in a STEM career.\n  We need to improve on getting more youth interested in and excited \nabout careers in STEM.\n  My Amendment seeks to inspire youth and create opportunities for \nyouth to become excited about careers in the energy industry and to \npursue energy related educational degrees in the STEM industry.\n  The Administration and our nation as a whole must remain committed to \ninspiring, educating and equipping the next generation of Googles, \nAmazons, Twitters and Facebooks of the energy sector.\n  In today's world, one only need look at all the technology we need to \nget by in our day to day dealings to understand the impact of STEM on \nour lives.\n  Toddlers now have hand-held tablets to watch their cartoons such as \nPepper the Pig and Thomas the Train, owing to innovation in technology \nand exposure to technology.\n  Similarly, in the science, technology, engineering and math fields as \nit relates to energy, young people can be the solution to some of the \nchallenges faced by our nation, but only through preparedness.\n  Indeed, educating our youth in Science, Technology, Engineering, and \nMathematics (STEM) fields is central to U.S. economic competitiveness \nand growth.\n  According to a PEW Research Report, countries like Hong Kong, \nSingapore and Taiwan are leading the way in the globe in educating and \npreparing their youth in STEM.\n  My Amendment seeks to propel U.S. youth so that they surpass their \npeers in the global community.\n  Specifically, this Amendment directs the Secretaries of Energy and \nCommerce to jointly establish an energy enterprise competition to \nencourage youth to propose solutions to the energy challenges of the \nUnited States and to promote youth interest in careers in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math, especially as those fields relate to \nenergy.\n  We need to prepare tomorrow's leaders for the competitive world of \nenergy independence, security and infrastructure building.\n  Part of our long-term strategy ought to be to stimulate and promote \ninnovation among young people to meet tomorrow's sure demand for \nadequate supply of a qualified workforce in the STEM fields, \nspecifically as it relates to energy.\n  Mr. Chair, my Amendment will create the space and nurture the \nplatform to develop our young people's ability to think deeply about \nthe energy challenges of our nation and the role they can play in \ncoming up with solutions.\n  A youth energy enterprise competition can be the breeding ground for \nfuture innovators, educators, researchers, and leaders in the energy \nsector who can solve the most pressing challenges facing our nation and \nour world, both today and tomorrow.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me and support \nJackson Lee Amendment #35.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the 5 minutes in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. But there is no way I could oppose this amendment, let me \njust say from the beginning.\n  This amendment directs the Secretaries of Energy and Commerce to \njointly establish an energy enterprise competition to promote youth \ninterest in careers in science, technology, engineering, and math, \nespecially as those fields related to energy.\n\n[[Page H8963]]\n\n  I heard from one of my heroes today, Dean Kamen, probably the best \ninventor of our time. He has, on his own, started just a wonderful \nprogram employing hundreds of thousands of youth all around the \ncountry, all around the world, a competition called FIRST Robotics, to \nreally get high school and middle school students invested in looking \nat the science of so many different things in competitions that I \nparticipated in.\n  My Governor, Rick Snyder, who was in town tonight, was honored as I \nthink the number one guy in the Nation earlier this year in Michigan. \nWe are going to have the national competition in Detroit, I want to \nsay, in 2 years. But I have been at the regional competition for this, \nand where kids and mentors and companies are invested, this is the \nfuture of science in so many different things.\n  This is a great amendment. I would urge all my colleagues to vote for \nit. I know that, as I look at my friendship with Dean Kamen, he will \nprobably never talk to me again if I oppose the amendment. It is a \ngreat amendment. It should have been done as part of our committee \nmark.\n  I look forward to working with the Education committees and \nappropriators to make sure that it is funded. It is a good thing. I \nwould urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Michigan. I \nyield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank my colleague from \nTexas for coming up with such a great program for young people. \nListening to her and her sense of optimism about the future, I think \nthat is what we need to encourage with our young people. I was so \npleased to see that the chairman of our committee also supports it.\n  I would like to lend my support and urge the amendment's adoption.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. If I may, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Upton \nfor his enthusiasm.\n  Dean Kamen is a hero of all of us. As I said, the greatest joy that I \nhave seen in my young people when I invite them out is going to NASA \nJohnson out in Houston and, as well, when I bring the astronauts either \nto their schools or, more importantly, when NASA goes out to the \nschools. But when I have this big Christmas party, Santa Claus comes, \nbut I will tell you that the astronauts are enormously popular.\n  I want to thank Mr. Pallone, as well, for being committed to the \nenergy and the dreaming and the inspiration and talent of our young \npeople. That is what this amendment is about. I hope we can work \ntogether to find the funding but, more importantly, to get our young \npeople engaged. I think they will have a lot of answers.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 36 Offered by Ms. Meng\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

MODERNIZATION OF TERMS RELATING TO MINORITIES.\n\n       (a) Office of Minority Economic Impact.--Section 211(f)(1) \n     of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7141(f)(1)) is amended by striking ``a Negro, Puerto Rican, \n     American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish \n     speaking individual of Spanish descent'' and inserting \n     ``Asian American, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, \n     Native American, or an Alaska Native''.\n       (b) Minority Business Enterprises.--Section 106(f)(2) of \n     the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act \n     of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6705(f)(2)) is amended by striking \n     ``Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and \n     Aleuts'' and inserting ``Asian American, African American, \n     Hispanic, Native American, or Alaska Natives''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, this bipartisan amendment is simple. It seeks to \nstrike the term ``Oriental'' from Federal law in the last two remaining \ninstances it is used to refer to a person within the Federal law.\n  I thank my colleague and my friend, Chairman Royce, for cosponsoring \nthis amendment with me.\n  Mr. Chair, in the same way, I would not want either of my children to \nbe referred to as ``Oriental'' by their teacher at school, I hope we \ncan all agree that the term ``Oriental'' no longer deserves a place in \nFederal law.\n  Toward that end, this amendment strikes the offensive term from 42 \nU.S.C. 7141 and 42 U.S.C. 6705, two sections of Federal law written in \nthe 1970s that fall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy \nand Commerce.\n  Congress once found it appropriate to pass laws such as the Chinese \nExclusion Act and the Geary Act, but we also found it appropriate to \nrepeal them. Times change. What is acceptable changes, and this \nCongress more often than not yields to that change.\n  Mr. Chair, I call on my colleagues to join me in striking the legal \nuse of outdated terms that many in the community would find offensive. \nI thank the Committee on Rules for making this amendment in order. I \nthank the chairman for allowing me time to speak on what is an \nimportant issue to my district, and I thank, again, Mr. Royce for his \nsupport and his cosponsorship of this amendment.\n  I urge support for the amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but again, I \nstrongly support this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I am delighted that Ms. Meng brought this to \nour attention. Mr. Royce is a very dear friend. I know we all share the \nsame thoughts. I also want to just thank Pete Sessions, chairman of the \nCommittee on Rules, for making this amendment in order. I would urge \nall my colleagues to support the amendment and appreciate it being \noffered tonight.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his kind words.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment to H.R. 8 introduced by my colleague, the Gentlewoman from \nNew York, Representative Meng.\n  Racism and discrimination has no place in America today. We are a \nnation of immigrants that is proud of its diversity.\n  And when we get the chance, we should correct the mistakes of the \npast. That is what this amendment is about. The Federal Code still \ncontains language on ethnicity that is antiquated and inappropriate. \nOur society has progressed a great deal in the last 100 years. It is \ntime for us to do the same to our Federal Code.\n  This amendment eliminates outdated, disrespectful terms from federal \nlaw and replaces them with terms, such as ``Asian American,'' ``Alaska \nNatives,'' and ``Hispanic,'' that are more appropriate for our times \nand in keeping with our values.\n  Deleting inappropriate terms from usage in the U.S. Code is a simple \nmeans of demonstrating respect for our nation's diversity, and it will \nhave no effect on the underlying federal laws.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 37 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 37 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n                       TITLE VII--EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n     SEC. 7001. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall not take effect until the Energy Information \n     Administration has analyzed and published a report on the \n     carbon impacts of the provisions of this Act.\n\n\n[[Page H8964]]\n\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, despite original efforts to pass a \nbipartisan bill to address some of our energy infrastructure needs, \nH.R. 8 has become an attempt by the Republican Party to create \nbackward-facing legislation that replaces many good provisions with \nlegislation that would continue to reward polluters and contribute to \nour climate change issue.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  In yesterday's debate on the CRAs, we heard time and again that \nclimate change is not a priority for Republicans because they are more \nconcerned with the economy and jobs.\n  Unlike the rhetoric that they would have us believe, a good economy \nand sound environmental policies are not mutually exclusive. We have \nactually experienced a boost in the economy under the Clean Air Act.\n  However, climate change is having a real effect on our communities, \nfrom more frequent extreme weather events, like Hurricane Sandy, to the \nextreme drought in California, to the floods experienced in Florida. \nThe emotional and economic tolls of these events have been great and \nwill continue to increase the longer this Congress ignores these \npressing issues.\n  Mr. Chairman, we cannot continue to ignore climate change and \ndisseminate misinformation. We are putting ourselves on a track towards \nirreparable damage.\n  Climate change and energy are inexorably linked. Each are a facet of \nthe other. Energy is the source of 84 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas \nemissions, and any energy bill has a large impact on the direction of \nenergy investment.\n  To that end, it is critical that legislation that is focused on \ndeveloping U.S. energy policy move the country on the right path by \nhelping to reduce carbon pollution, not to increase it. It is \nimperative that U.S. energy policy promote clean forms of energy and \nhelp make all energy use more efficient.\n  A necessary step to understanding its potential impact on emissions \nis to have the energy bill scored before it is enacted, and my \namendment would do just that. The energy bill would be submitted to the \nEnergy Information Administration, who would determine the overall \nshort- and long-term impacts of the bill on U.S. greenhouse gas \nemissions: the Climate Pollution Score. The bill should not be enacted \nuntil such an analysis is complete.\n  Mr. Chairman, we know that the higher levels of greenhouse gases will \ncontinue to perturb our climate and impact public health. The \nresponsible choice is to ensure that we are not contributing to the \nproblem.\n  As Members of this Congress, it is our responsibility to protect the \ninterests of Americans, which includes protecting Americans from the \ndevastating effects of climate change while we still can. This \namendment will allow us to do just that by giving us necessary \ninformation to analyze the effects of this legislation.\n  So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote to protect Americans by \nvoting for this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. This amendment, as properly stated, would provide that the \nbill should not take effect until the Energy Information Administration \nhas done a study and prepared a report on the carbon impacts of the \nprovision.\n  So, in essence, it would delay implementation of the bill \nindefinitely. And we believe that that would be a diversion, as the \nfocus of this bill is to modernize our energy infrastructure and ensure \naccess to affordable, reliable energy in a strong economy as fast as we \ncan.\n  An economy based on reliable, affordable energy provides the means \nfor the prosperity for future generations and the economic strength to \nrespond and adapt to future challenges. It is particularly true when it \ncomes to risks of climate change, whether natural or man-influenced.\n  The bill promotes technological innovation; the development of \nresilient, efficient energy infrastructure; and a strong economy to \nwithstand climate events, regardless of the causes. Delaying the \nmeasures in this bill denies the public a direct path to a stronger, \nmore resilient energy infrastructure and greater economic growth.\n  Because of those reasons, I would urge my colleagues to vote against \nmy friend's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The score that I am asking for that would be done by the Energy \nInformation Administration would not indefinitely delay the bill. They \nhave the ability to do the scoring.\n  This is an independent agency within the Energy Department that was \ncreated on a bipartisan basis. It is nonpartisan. It collects energy \ndata for the United States. And once the score was attributed, the bill \ncould move forward.\n  But the point is we need to know what the impact is going to be on \nthe environment, on air pollution, and on climate change.\n  I think that my concern, of course, is that this legislation was \nscored negatively, and that is the reason why I think we need to have a \nscore. It is certainly not going to delay the bill indefinitely, as was \nsuggested by the chairman.\n  I urge a vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 38 Offered by Mr. Norcross\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38 \nprinted in House Report 114-359.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 3007. REPORT ON SMART METER SECURITY CONCERNS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy shall transmit to Congress a \n     report on the weaknesses in currently available smart meters' \n     security architecture and features, including an absence of \n     event logging, as described in the Government Accountability \n     Office testimony entitled ``Critical Infrastructure \n     Protection: Cybersecurity of the Nation's Electricity Grid \n     Requires Continued Attention'' on October 21, 2015.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Norcross) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  First of all, I appreciate the chairman and ranking member bringing \nthis bill to us.\n  As we know and the title indicates, this is about energy security. \nWell, my amendment is very simple and direct. We are urging and \nspecifically directing that the Secretary of Energy study the potential \ncybersecurity weakness in smart meters and to report back on this in 1 \nyear.\n  So the first question is: What is a smart meter? For the consumer, it \nis that little box outside your air conditioner or by the panel. It \nprovides savings to the consumer, and to the utility provider, it is \nabout providing that secure, reliable electricity at a competitive \nprice.\n  But these meters were designed back before the world as we know it \ntoday. Now we have to think of things very differently and think of \nthem before they happen.\n  So what are the risks? A GAO official revealed the vulnerability in \nthese\n\n[[Page H8965]]\n\nsmart meters. There are approximately 40 million to 50 million of these \nmeters that are already installed in hospitals, churches, homes, and in \nindustry that could potentially be a target for hackers. That is why we \nshould be concerned.\n  The CIA report spoke about that malicious activity against IT systems \nand power systems overseas. Our society has become so reliant on the \nvery electricity that we are standing under today that those who would \ndo damage to our country might have a vulnerability here. And we need \nto act before they do. This is why I bring this amendment forward.\n  I started out as an electrician many years ago, so I understand the \npower side of it. I sit on the Emerging Threats Subcommittee. I hear \nthose threats each and every day. We have to make sure that we keep our \nhomes, our businesses, and, most importantly, our military safe.\n  We are talking about damaged equipment and potentially massive \nblackouts, not just like the ones we had in New York almost a decade \nago but potentially taking down our entire grid.\n  Smart meters are now part of the fabric of what we do day in and day \nout. This amendment very carefully identifies those vulnerabilities. I \nwould urge members to support this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, but I support the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. This is the second smart amendment that is part of this. \nBoth are good. We adopted the Grayson amendment a little while ago. It \nwas a good amendment.\n  This amendment directs the Secretary of Energy to study weaknesses in \nthe security architecture of certain smart meters currently available \nand promulgate regulations to mitigate those weaknesses.\n  We want every home to be safe, absolutely. We need to take all those \nsteps, whether it be people's individual billing, whatever it might be. \nIt is a good amendment. As I told Mr. Grayson, it is brilliant, smart.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. I certainly appreciate the support. This is just one of \nmany items that we have to look forward to before those who want to do \nus harm. So I appreciate it, and I urge the passing of this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nAllen) having assumed the chair, Mr. Woodall, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 8) to \nmodernize energy infrastructure, build a 21st century energy and \nmanufacturing workforce, bolster America's energy security and \ndiplomacy, and promote energy efficiency and government accountability, \nand for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8965-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8965-H8968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SYRIAN REFUGEES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, although there are apparently those in the \nmedia that think it is fun to belittle people who express their great \nsympathy, thoughts, and prayers for the victims and their families out \nin San Bernardino, California, right now, those of us who care do \nextend our thoughts and prayers for those people.\n  We don't know quite yet who the perpetrators were. I think this is \nimportant, as we have been talking about Syrian refugees quite a bit \nthe last few weeks, and the President's intention to bring Syrian \nrefugees into this country.\n  Our friend, Senator Jeff Sessions, provided a list of 12 vetted \nrefugees from areas where we actually had material, where we had \ninformation. Unlike the Syrian refugees, the FBI and Homeland Security \nfelt they had plenty of information to vet these individuals, did vet \nthem, thoroughly checked them out, and then brought them into the \ncountry.\n  This article from Neil Munro is dated November 24, 2015. He mentions:\n  ``Senator Jeff Sessions is out with a list of 12 vetted refugees who \nquickly joined jihad plots to attack the United States.\n  ``He's spotlighting the refugees-turned-jihadis because he's trying \nto prod GOP leaders into halting Congress' normal practice of giving \nthe President huge leeway to import foreign migrants and refugees into \nthe United States.''\n  It goes on: ``Obama says the new refugees will be vetted. But top \nsecurity officials say the Syrians can't be vetted because the U.S. \ndoesn't know what they were doing in Syria before they applied for \nrefugee status.''\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  The article goes on:\n  ``Besides, many of the jihad attempts in the United States are \nlaunched by the children of Muslim refugees and migrants. That list \ninclude the two Chechen brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon, and \nAnwar al-Awlaki who was killed by a U.S. missile strike when he fled to \nYemen after the 9/11 atrocity. That means the Americans' federal \ngovernment is actively importing national-security problems that will \neventually cost billions of dollars to manage, but cannot be \neliminated.''\n  And this list only covers 2015. There may be many more from 2015. \nThere are certainly many more from prior years.\n  But here are just some of the individuals that this administration \ncompletely vetted, made sure they were not a threat to the United \nStates and our people, and, yet, brought them in only to find they were \nand are terrorists.\n  On January 29, 2015, in the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Virginia, a Federal warrant was unsealed for the \narrest of Liban Haji Mohamed--a native of Somalia who sources indicate \ncame to the United States as a refugee, adjusted to lawful permanent \nresident status, and subsequently and applied for and received \ncitizenship.\n  ``Mohamed is believed to have left the U.S. on July 5, 2012, with the \nintent to join Al-Shabaab in East Africa. Mohamed previously lived in \nthe metro D.C. area and worked as a cab driver, and is believed to have \nsnuck across the border to Mexico after being placed on the no-fly \nlist. Carl Ghattas, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Washington, \nD.C. Field Office, emphasized the importance of locating Mohamed: \n`Because he has knowledge of the Washington, D.C., area's \ninfrastructure such as shopping areas, Metro, airports, and government \nbuildings, this makes him an asset to his terrorist associates who \nmight plot attacks on U.S. soil.' '' One refugee.\n  Second refugee: On February 5, 2015, a native of Somalia came to the \nUnited States as a refugee. And this was done under the Bush \nadministration. Abdinassir Mohamud Ibrahim came at the age of 22, in \n2007, and then was later adjusted to lawful permanent resident status.\n  But, on February 5, he was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison \nfor conspiring to provide material support to Al-Shabaab, a designated \nforeign terrorist organization. He lied on his application for \ncitizenship, lied on his request for refugee status, and falsely \nclaimed--these are what he was convicted of and charged with--falsely \nclaiming that he was a member of the minority Awer clan in Somalia and \nsubject to persecution by the majority Hawiye clan. However, Ibrahim \nwas actually a member of the clan that was the persecutor and not the \npersecuted. That was Mr. Abdinassir Mohamud Ibrahim.\n  Also, in Missouri, Abdullah Ramo Pazara, a native of Bosnia, came to \nthe United States as a refugee, completely\n\n[[Page H8966]]\n\nvetted, adjusted to lawful permanent resident status, was made a \ncitizen in 2013, 5 years into the President's administration.\n  He has been named in an indictment with five other individuals as a \nterrorist. He is thought to be dead, but the others listed provided \nmaterial support to Pazara who allegedly left the United States to go \nto Syria and fight with ISIS just 11 days after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen.\n  Then there is also Ramiz Zijad Hodzic. A native of Bosnia, he is a \npurported Bosnian war hero who came to the United States as a refugee. \nHe is charged with conspiring to provide material support and resources \nto terrorists and providing material support to terrorists.\n  You also have this year Sedina Unkic Hodzic, wife of Ramiz Zijad \nHodzic, also a native of Bosnia. She came to the U.S. as a refugee. She \nis charged this year with conspiring to provide material support and \nresources to terrorists and providing support to terrorists.\n  Then you have Armin Harcevic. He came to the United States as a \nrefugee from Bosnia and subsequently had that adjusted to lawful \npermanent resident status. He is charged with providing material \nsupport to terrorists. He collected money from third parties and wired \nit and his own funds to terrorists.\n  Then you also have Nihad Rosic, a native of Bosnia, who sources \nindicate came to the United States as a refugee. He applied for and was \ngranted citizenship and has been charged with conspiring to provide \nmaterial support and actually providing material support to terrorists.\n  He is a truck driver and a former mixed martial arts fighter. He \npreviously had been charged with endangering the welfare of a child \nafter punching a woman in the face while she held a child. In a \nseparate incident, he was charged with assault after allegedly beating \nhis girlfriend. But, apparently, nothing came of those charges until he \nwas charged with supporting terrorism.\n  Mediha Medy Salkicevic, a native of Bosnia, came to the United States \nas a refugee, applied for and was granted citizenship, was also charged \nwith conspiring to provide material support and resources to terrorists \nand providing that support to terrorists.\n  Salkicevic was formerly an employee with a cargo company that deals \nwith items coming in and out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, \nanother refugee alleged by this administration to now be a terrorist.\n  Jasminka Ramic, a native of Bosnia, came as a refugee, applied for \nand was made a citizen, was charged with conspiring to provide material \nsupport and resources to terrorists and providing that support to \nterrorists by this administration.\n  You have got Abdurahman Yasin Daud, born in a refugee camp in Kenya. \nHe came to the United States as a refugee when he was a child and was \nsubsequently adjusted to a lawful permanent resident, has been charged \nwith conspiracy to attempt to provide material support to ISIS. He and \nanother individual are alleged to have driven from Minnesota to San \nDiego to attempt to get passports, cross the border in Mexico, and fly \nto Syria.\n  Also, this year you have Guled Ali Omar, born in a Kenyan refugee \ncamp. He came to the United States as a refugee. The United States gave \nhim citizenship. This administration has charged him with conspiracy \nand attempting to provide material support to ISIS.\n\n  Another one of his brothers, Mohamed Ali Omar, was convicted in March \nof threatening Federal agents when they came to the residence to \ninterview Guled Omar.\n  The U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota said that Omar \n``never stopped plotting'' and had previously attempted to leave the \nUnited States, another one of the refugees turned U.S. citizen, all the \nwhile, at least part of the time, a terrorist.\n  And then also this year, in August, a native of Uzbekistan, Fazliddin \nKurbanov, came as a refugee in 2009, was found guilty on charges he \nconspired and attempted to provide material support to a designated \nforeign terrorist organization and possessed an unregistered \ndestructive device.\n  U.S. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin stated that he conspired \nto provide material support to the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan and \nprocured bomb-making materials in the interest of perpetrating a \nterrorist attack on American soil.\n  According to press reports, Kurbanov began his life as a Muslim, \nsupposedly faced persecution when his family converted to Christianity \nand came to the United States with his family as a refugee, and, as it \nturned out, he is Islamic and radicalized.\n  So it is interesting. This administration assures us we have nothing \nto fear, nothing to be concerned about. I am not afraid, but I am \nconcerned about the oath that every one of us take.\n  We are supposed to provide for the common defense in this country. It \nis an obligation we have. I think it is the most important obligation \nwe have. We are supposed to protect the Constitution against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic.\n  As Andrew McCarthy pointed out this past week in one of his articles \non National Review Online, it should be important not merely to check \nto see if we have any information about an individual wanting to come \nhere as a refugee or gaining a visa, however they intend to come, \nillegally, as millions have, more are every day.\n  It would be important to ask not simply is this person a terrorist \nright now, but it would also be important to ask: Are you one of the \ntwo-thirds or so that have been reported to be in the United States or \nwanting to come into the United States as a Muslim who believes that \nShari'ah law should replace the Constitution?\n  Because, if those reports are accurate, that two-thirds of the \nMuslims here believe Shari'ah should replace the Constitution, and they \nare immigrants and they become citizens, then it means that they \nabsolutely perjured themselves in their oath.\n  That should be grounds for revoking their citizenship. And if it \ncan't be used as such, we need to make sure it is used as such by what \nwe do here in Congress.\n  In the meantime, we have heard Ben Rhodes and so many others say: Oh, \nyeah. No. The FBI, Homeland Security, are going to be able to vet \neverybody really well.\n  FBI Director Comey has made clear publicly--regardless of what he \nsaid privately, that does not change anything he said publicly. \nPublicly he has made clear: Yeah. We will vet them. But when you tell \nus their names, we have nothing to either verify or disprove what they \nhave said.\n  We have got nothing. We don't have any records from Syria. We don't \nknow if they are even from Syria. We don't know. We don't have the \ninformation to vet them.\n  FBI had more information to vet people coming from Iraq, and we know \nthat they missed a couple of terrorists that were in Kentucky that were \nallowed in. I think it was 2009. And it turns out they just missed that \ntheir fingerprints--at least one of them--was on an IED in Iraq. The \nguy is a terrorist.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  So despite what this administration tries to assuage, the borders are \nopen. We have Syrian refugees that the President is bringing into the \nUnited States, even when Governors say: We understand you can't vet \nthese people, so you are not bringing them into our States.\n  I see this afternoon that the Governor of my State, Greg Abbott, has \nsued the administration because the administration has made clear: We \ndon't care what you think, we don't care that you are Governor of your \nState, and we don't care about the 10th Amendment. We say we are \nputting Syrian refugees in Texas, and there is nothing you can do about \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, that kind of reminds me of the kind of things that King \nGeorge and his bureaucrats used to say before the Revolution. When King \nGeorge decided he would put his British soldiers anywhere he wanted to \nand there was nothing the people here could do about it, he would put \nthem in their houses. He didn't care what it did to their property \nvalues. He didn't care anything about that. We don't need a revolution. \nWe just need to have Congress hold the President accountable for his \nadministration's lawlessness.\n\n[[Page H8967]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the President has got to secure our borders. He is \nputting American lives at risk every day. He is putting American lives \nfurther at risk since we know now we routinely have people that are \ncompletely vetted by the FBI, Homeland Security, and it turns out they \nare terrorists. The Tsarnaev brothers, even after Russia warned the CIA \nand the FBI that this guy, this older brother, has been radicalized, \nthe FBI talked to him. He said: I am not radicalized. It is not his \nexact words. You talk to his mother, she said: No, he is a good boy. \nAnd then he went and killed people at the Boston Marathon with his \nbrother.\n  If we can't even stop people when we are alerted that they are \nterrorists, how in the world does this President and this \nadministration think they are going to keep the American people safe?\n  The report here, December 1, Tom LoBianco with CNN, said: ``President \nBarack Obama's former top military intelligence official said Tuesday \nthat the White House ignored reports prefacing the rise of ISIS in 2011 \nand 2012 because they did not fit their reelection `narrative.'\n  `` `I think they did not meet a narrative the White House needed. And \nI'll be very candid with you, they just didn't,' retired Lt. Gen. \nMichael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . . . \n`I think the narrative was that al Qaeda was on the run, and Osama bin \nLaden was dead . . . they're dead and these guys are, we've beaten \nthem,' Flynn said, but the problem was that despite how many terrorist \nleaders they killed they `continue to just multiply.'\n  ``Obama has been criticized by opponents for referring to ISIS as the \n`JV squad' and apparently underestimating the group's threat.''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, since we know the President has underestimated \nISIS as a threat, clearly underestimated them, and there is no clear \nstrategy to deal with them, what makes us think that this \nadministration is going to do a better job of vetting potential \nterrorists coming into this country and underestimating them the way \nthey have so many other refugees that have been brought into the \ncountry?\n  Another article from Jim Hoft, December 2, 2015, quoting the \nPresident: ``Yes. He really said this.\n  `` `You go down to Miami and when it's flooding in high tide on a \nsunny day, the fish are swimming through the middle of the streets.' ''\n  The Wall Street Journal reported the same thing, the same quote. But \nThe Wall Street Journal reported: ``We go down to Miami with some \nfrequency and have never seen any such thing. And believe us, we know \nhow to troll.''\n  But the President can find fish in the streets of Miami that nobody \nelse seems to see, but he can't seem to notice how wide open our border \nis, what a threat to our security it is, and what a threat refugees are \nwho we cannot determine who they are, where they came from, what they \ndid, if they kill people, if they are terrorists. He didn't see any of \nthat.\n  There was a report from today, 4:20 actually, from Adam Kredo from \nfreebeacon.com: ``More than 179,000 illegal immigrants convicted of \ncommitting crimes, including violent ones, continue to roam free across \nthe United States, with reports indicating that these illegal \nimmigrants commit new crimes `every day,' according to lawmakers and \nthe director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, also \nknown as ICE.\n  ``Sarah Saldana, ICE's director, disclosed to Congress on Wednesday \nthat the agency is apprehending and removing fewer illegal immigrants \nthan in past years.\n  ``Somewhere around 179,029 `undocumented criminals with final orders \nof removal' from the United States currently remain at large across the \ncountry and are essentially untraceable, according to Sen. Chuck \nGrassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who disclosed \nthese numbers during a Wednesday hearing.\n  ``The total number of criminal illegal immigrants in the United \nStates is in the millions.\n  ``Illegal immigrant criminals are known to be committing new crimes \n`every day,' according to Sen. Jeff Sessions, another member of the \ncommittee.\n  ``Focus on the threat of criminal illegal aliens comes amid a wider \nnational debate on immigration to the United States and the threat \nposed by potential terrorists and other criminals.\n  ``The Washington Free Beacon disclosed in August that the Obama \nadministration had been keeping secret the release of violent criminal \nillegal immigrants and only began notifying local law enforcement \nagencies about this within the last several months.\n  ``The administration is continuing a policy of hiding information \nabout this issue, as `several administration officials informed the \ncommittee they were unable to testify because the hearing wasn't ``in \nresponse to a particular crisis,' '' Grassley said.\n  ``Saldana revealed at the hearing that somewhere between 30,000 and \n40,000 illegal immigrants previously convicted of crimes have been \nreleased from custody in recent years due to legal restrictions on how \nlong the agency can detain an individual.''\n  Here is a quote from Saldana. She said: `` `Whether it's a result of \nprotracted appeals or refusal of a country to accept its nationals \nback, this decision accounts for somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 \nconvicted criminal alien releases in recent years' . . . noting that \nthe number has dropped over time.\n  ``Lawmakers remain concerned that the Obama administration is \ndragging its feet when it comes to taking action to deport criminal \nillegal immigrants. While President Obama has vowed that this would be \na priority for his administration, these criminals continue to be \nreleased into the United States.\n  `` `Many criminals remain in our communities,' Grassley said. `When \nwill enough be enough? Even those with violent criminal histories \naren't being removed as promised . . . American citizens are paying the \nprice while law enforcement officers are instructed to look the other \nway.'\n  ``There have been `thousands of victims' of crimes committed by \nillegal immigrants and `many of the agency's own officers are unable to \ndo the job they signed up to do,' Grassley said.\n\n  ``The Obama administration is removing fewer total illegal immigrants \nfrom the United States than it was just a few years ago, according to \nSenator Sessions.\n  `` `Not only are total removals down, but the number of removals of \ncriminal aliens from the interior of the United States, the so-called \npriority, has decreased significantly,' he said. `The reason for this \ndecrease is not because there are fewer criminal aliens in the U.S. \ntoday than just a few years ago, there are hundreds of thousands of \nknown criminal aliens in the United States.'\n  `` `New crimes are committed every day by criminal aliens, so while \nwe're not seeing a decrease in crimes committed across this country, we \nare seeing a decrease in removals of criminal aliens,' Sessions said.\n  ``This cannot be blamed on a lack of financial resources, Sessions \nsaid, as Congress has increased funding. Still, deportations have \nplummeted and the administration is `doing substantially less with \nsubstantially more.'\n  `` `Our goal should be to keep 100 percent of all criminal aliens out \nof the United States. . . . There's nothing wrong or controversial \nabout such a policy.'\n  ``Saldana confirmed that `overall apprehensions on the border are \ndeclining' and the agency's `removal numbers are lower than they have \nbeen in recent years.'\n  ``However, she maintained that the administration is removing `at a \ngreater proportion' dangerous criminals.\n  ``Of the 235,000 deportations, 59 percent of them were convicted \ncriminals, according to Saldana . . . Yet she said, `there are also \ntimes when despite our best efforts' criminal illegal immigrants `get \nreleased from our custody.' ''\n  An article today from Dianne Solis, Tom Benning, and Brandi Grissom:\n  ``The State of Texas is suing the federal government and the \nInternational Rescue Committee, after the New York-based aid agency \nannounced plans to resettle Syrian refugees in Dallas later this week \nover the strong and repeated objections of Gov. Greg Abbott.\n  ``The State Health and Human Services Commission, filed on Wednesday \nthe suit in U.S. District Court, saying those groups worked to resettle \n`refugees in Texas without consulting with\n\n[[Page H8968]]\n\nTexas or working in close cooperation with the Commission.'\n  ``The agency, citing `reasonable concerns about the safety and \nsecurity of the citizenry of the State of Texas' is seeking a temporary \nretraining order.\n  `` `We have been working diligently with the International Rescue \nCommittee to find a solution that ensures the safety and security for \nall Texans, but we have reached an impasse and will now let the courts \ndecide.' ''\n  That is Health and Human Services spokesman Bryan Black.\n  Tonight at 6:30, I got this article from Tanya Somanader, President \nObama on the shooting in San Bernardino. Here is the transcript of the \nPresident's comments. This is in an interview with CBS that President \nObama spoke about the ongoing situation in California--going on right \nnow--and the unacceptable pattern of mass shootings the U.S. is facing.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just parenthetically insert before reading his \nquote, we don't know who these shooters are yet. We don't know. We \ndon't know their reason for doing what they did. I mean, some on the \nleft have already tried to report that it was right by a Planned \nParenthood facility when that was a mile away, trying to do whatever \nthey can to try to avert responsibility--any responsibility--that the \nadministration has. We have seen Kathryn's Law come about because \nKathryn was shot in California in a sanctuary city that protected \npeople who were illegally in this country and criminals like the one \nthat shot Kathryn. And this administration protects sanctuary cities \nand lets them continue to just ignore Federal law. The lawlessness of \nthis administration seems to know no bounds. If lawlessness breeds \nlawlessness, then the lawlessness of this administration has put this \ncountry in severe jeopardy.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  But here is what the President said, part of his quote from this \nevening, about the shooting in California. And I am quoting the \nPresident.\n  ``And for those who are concerned about terrorism, some may be aware \nof the fact that we have a no-fly list where people can't get on \nplanes, but those same people who we don't allow to fly could go into a \nstore right now in the United States and buy a firearm, and there's \nnothing that we can do to stop them. That's a law that needs to be \nchanged.''\n  The President, the entire time he has been in office, has tried to \nsubvert the Second Amendment to our United States Constitution and our \nBill of Rights. He has tried every which way he can, whether using \nSocial Security laws or all kinds of ways, to take away Americans' \nSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n  As we see that the administration has been knowingly allowing \ncriminals into this country illegally and allowing refugees to come \ninto this country that were terrorists and even finding out, getting \nword that there were people who have become terrorists and not taking \naction to stop the death that followed, how dare anyone allow people to \ncome into the United States illegally, knowing that there are some \ncriminals coming in with people that are coming in illegally, knowing \nthat there are criminals in the United States that this administration \nhas allowed to be released after they have committed crimes.\n  And then coming to the point now today where he says, you American \ncitizens are going to have to give up your Second Amendment rights to \nkeep and bear arms because I have allowed so many people who are \nterrorists in here and we don't want terrorists to get guns. That is an \noutrage. It should not be allowed to stand against any kind of \nlegitimate reasoning.\n  You can't bring people into this country that are a threat to the \ncountry and then, because all these people are here and they might get \na gun, you are going to keep law-abiding people from getting guns. That \nis wrong, and it has to be stopped.\n  I hope and pray our Congress will stand up and stop the lawlessness \nand say, we are not letting you bring more refugees into this country \nthat will have some terrorists within their group, as you have already \ndone, and then tell us we have to give up our constitutional rights \nbecause you brought terrorists into the country that may want to go buy \na gun. Shame on you.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Allen). Members are advised to avoid \nengaging in personalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8968-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Cuellar (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and tomorrow.\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of a \nmedical appointment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8968-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENATE ENROLLED BILL AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to an enrolled bill and joint \nresolutions of the Senate of the following titles:\n\n       S. 1170.
