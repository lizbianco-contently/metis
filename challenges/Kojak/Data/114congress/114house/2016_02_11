The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a gentleman who has \ndedicated his life to serving our Nation, a true American hero from the \nState of Florida, Mr. Doug Richardson. Mr. Richardson is retiring from \nthe United States Special Operations Command after 50 years of \ngovernment service.\n  Mr. Richardson currently serves as a defense intelligence senior \nleader and as the program executive officer for Surveillance, \nReconnaissance, and Exploitation at USSOCOM. A West Point graduate, Mr. \nRichardson distinguished himself throughout his military career, \nretiring as a colonel from Active Duty in the United States Army in \n1993 and then continuing his service to USSOCOM as a civilian.\n  Perhaps the best example of Doug's integrity and courage is recorded \nin his Silver Star Medal citation, which was awarded to Doug for his \nheroism in combat during the Vietnam war. On June 18, 1969, while \nserving as an adviser with the 4th Cavalry Regiment of the Army of the \nRepublic of Vietnam, then-Captain Richardson accompanied a small \narmored infantry team moving to break through a very determined enemy \nforce to rescue the crewmen of a downed United States Army helicopter. \nAs the unit approached the village, it came under intense rocket-\npropelled grenade and automatic weapons fire from very well-concealed \npositions. The area was also known to be heavily mined and set with \ntraps.\n  As the attempts of the Vietnamese to reach the helicopter were \ncontinually repulsed by enemy counterattacks, Captain Richardson \ndismounted his track, rallied a small force of Vietnamese soldiers, and \nthen led them to the helicopter through enemy fire, exhorting his \ncomrades to vigorously engage the enemy. Disregarding his personal \nsafety and armed with only a pistol, Captain Richardson led his men \nthrough the mined area and into an assault on the enemy positions.\n  Following his example, the soldiers, though at a tactical \ndisadvantage, pressed the attack vigorously and ultimately broke the \nresistance and secured the helicopter. Despite a hail of small-arms \nfire and hand grenades directed at his position, Doug continued his \nsearch for the survivors until he had found the remains of all U.S. \ncrewmembers and then remained to extract the bodies of his fallen \ncomrades from the wreckage. As a result of Captain Richardson's valiant \ndisplay of battlefield courage, the Vietnamese force was able to hold \nthe area from a tenacious enemy and return the fallen soldiers to \nallied control.\n  Mr. Speaker, USSOCOM will miss Doug Richardson's leadership. As a \nNation, let us recognize his valiant service. I ask that this body join \nme in honoring and congratulating Mr. Doug Richardson on a most \nhonorable and truly heroic career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H713-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H713-H714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FREE PUERTO RICO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I come with a humble message from the \nPuerto Rican people to the House of Representatives: Free Puerto Rico.\n  Free Puerto Rico so that she can solve the problem of her crushing \ndebt without being handcuffed by Congress. Free Puerto Rico so that her \nhospitals can stay open for sick moms and dads and her schools stay \nopen for children. Nobody should fear that their house will burn down \nbecause the firemen have not been paid.\n  So far the response to Puerto Rico's debt crisis from Washington--the \nonly place that Puerto Rico is forced to rely on--has been very little, \nand greedy bondholders and hedge fund managers only care about Puerto \nRico as a wager, a way to make money whether Puerto Rico sinks or \nswims.\n  Right now, Puerto Rico needs serious, sustained attention from \nWashington to find a path forward such that Puerto Rico is neither \nabsolved of her obligations nor mortally wounded by them. Mr. Speaker, \nhere is what it comes down to: when the U.S. Supreme Court said that \nPuerto Rico belongs to but is not a part of the United States, the \nresponsibility to care for her and her people came along with that \njudgment.\n\n[[Page H714]]\n\n  Congress must act responsibly for the fact that we expect Puerto Rico \nto pay its obligation, but we force her to play by a particular set of \nrules. Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy because Congress passed a \nlaw saying that she could not. Puerto Rico is under the choke hold of \nthe Jones Act, a law passed right here in this room, without any \nconsultation with the Puerto Rican people, that says, by law, Puerto \nRico cannot shop around for the best deal on shipping. No. They must \nbuy the most expensive, which means double the import costs and an \nestimated $500 million extra on Puerto Rico's food bill alone.\n  When it comes to producing for themselves, a large chunk of the best \nagricultural land--the land that sustains and feeds a nation--is taken \naway from them for U.S. military bases. Thirteen percent of the land is \ngone.\n  Puerto Rico is a tropical island, but a lot of its fruit and \nvegetables and almost all of its food is imported. We must allow Puerto \nRico to create an agricultural economy, allowing Puerto Ricans to feed \nthemselves. The economy produces goods the people do not consume, and \nthe people consume goods that they do not produce.\n  Even when the U.S. is caught redhanded stealing water from Puerto \nRico's freshwater supply--not paying a dime for it--what happens? The \nU.S. Government is not held responsible or made to pay. When the \nmilitary bombs and pollutes Vieques and Culebra, does the U.S. \nGovernment feel any obligation to restore it? Not really.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, when Congress talks about Puerto Rico's debt, I say \nwe look at the totality of the debt--the part owed to Puerto Rico, not \njust the part Puerto Rico owes to Wall Street. Every soldier she has \nsent to war, every time the U.S. has stepped in to override her courts \nand her government, these debts add up but are not accounted for.\n  Now, what is the solution that everyone in Washington is lining up \nbehind? A Federal control board. Imagine that. An island that cannot \ndetermine its own destiny. It has to play an economic game with a \nstacked deck and all the rules rigged against her. What is the solution \nin Washington? Take away what little autonomy they have left.\n  If Congress were smart, we would find a way to get out of the way. \nFree Puerto Rico's people to unleash their inherent, hardworking \ncharacter, spirit, and dedication. Free Puerto Ricans to work and toil \nand build and create. Free Puerto Rico so that she can build a \nsustainable economy that keeps her people at home in the land of their \nbirth and their heritage.\n  We cannot get sidetracked by seeing Puerto Rico's economic health \nexclusively through the lens of food stamps, Medicaid, government \nprograms, and further dependency on Washington. We must make the \nconversation about jobs for Puerto Ricans, jobs that build the economy, \nthe tax base, and the self-sufficiency of the island.\n  Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico's problems were a long time in the making, \nbut I have utter confidence in Puerto Ricans' ability to solve them if \nwe in the Congress begin to listen to them, work with them, and \nrecognize them as equal partners.\n  We must free Puerto Rico so that the Puerto Rican people can free \nthemselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H714-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KURDISH PESHMERGA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nimportant efforts made by the Kurds and the Peshmerga in the fight \nagainst ISIS.\n  Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said last December: ``The Kurdish \nPeshmerga have been exactly what we have been looking for in this whole \nfight in Iraq and Syria, namely a capable and motivated force that we \ncan enable.''\n  As you know, Mr. Speaker, we need to do more to combat ISIS on the \nground and also to help our allies who are willing to join us in this \neffort. ISIS is a brutal evil, and it is one of the greatest threats to \nboth our national security and to the security of our allies in the \nregion.\n  We continue to read reports of ISIS raping women, beheading captives, \nand brutally torturing their prisoners; and ISIS' alleged use of \nchemical weapons against the Kurds in Iraq and Syria reaffirms the \ndanger posed by this terrorist group. During the conflict against ISIS, \nthe Kurds tell me that at least 1,600 Peshmerga forces have died and \nthousands more have been wounded, and we see some of these pictures \nhere on this graphic.\n  We are thankful to all of the members of the Peshmerga who are \nfighting to eradicate the evil of ISIS, including several all-women \nunits who are proud to fight for their people's freedom. These are the \nhardships that they all endure.\n  Unfortunately, the Peshmerga still don't have the proper weapons, the \nproper equipment--most of which is over 30 years old--and they are \nstill running low on ammunition. In fact, the Peshmerga are using \ncaptured ISIS tanks to roll through minefields, while ISIS is using \nAmerican equipment that they have picked up after overturning Mosul.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the legislation introduced \nby the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, \nwhich would authorize the direct provision of weapons to the Peshmerga, \na bill which our committee passed unanimously in December.\n  The Peshmerga have already proven to be one of the most capable \nforces on the battlefield, and making sure that they are strong, making \nsure that they are well-equipped is crucial to defeating the ISIS \nthreat that confronts us all. The Peshmerga are continuing to fight \ndespite not being paid for months, with uncertain logistical backup, \nand with inadequate weapons and equipment--three strikes against them.\n  The Peshmerga need our help, and we must get them what they need in \norder to have them continue to be successful. The Peshmerga provides \nsafe havens for Muslims, Christians, Yazidis, and people of any \nreligious minority who have been oppressed. According to the Kurds, \nabout 300,000 Syrian refugees and 1.5 million internally displaced \npersons are in the Kurdistan region, where there is a growing \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  I will turn to the other poster that I have, Mr. Speaker, their \nfighting forces.\n  The burden of war and the responsibility of caring for 1.8 million \nadditional people have pushed the Kurdistan region's economy to the \nbrink of collapse. My friend, Igor Pasternak, recently briefed me on \nhis visit to the Black Tiger Peshmerga base south of Mosul on the ISIS \nfront line, and he introduced me to the Kurdistan Regional Government's \nrepresentative to the U.S., Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman.\n  Ms. Rahman's parents were sentenced to death by Saddam Hussein \nbecause they refused to bow down to his tyranny, and instead they \nfought for Kurdish liberation and for human rights. Her parents lived \nto see Saddam's downfall, and her father continued his leadership role \nin the Kurdish region's struggle before being tragically assassinated \nby Islamic extremists in 2004.\n  In the Iraq city of Erbil, Sami Abdul Rahman Park honors Ms. Rahman's \nfather and, more importantly, recognizes the immense oppression \nsuffered by the Kurdish people.\n  I am pleased that KRG Representative Rahman is in the gallery today.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to announce that I will soon be \nintroducing a resolution to honor the brave men and women of the \nPeshmerga and their families who are fighting bravely against the \nbrutal evil of ISIS and to stand with the Kurdish people as they \ncontinue to endure great hardships during this war.\n  God bless each and every one of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H714-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H714-H715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, since 1970, more Americans have been killed \nfrom domestic gun violence than all the Americans killed in every war \ngoing back to the American Revolution.\n  If all the victims of gun violence since 1970 were put on a wall like \nthe Vietnam Memorial, it would contain\n\n[[Page H715]]\n\n1.5 million names and stretch 2\\1/2\\ miles, 25 times the length of the \nVietnam Memorial.\n  I have had enough of Congress' failure to lead. So each month that we \nare in session, I am going to speak the name of every person killed in \na mass shooting in this country. I will also create my own memorial \nwall in the hallway outside my office.\n  Here are the stories of some of the victims of the 18 mass shootings \nin January of this year. There have been so many people last month \naffected by mass shootings that I don't have the time to list those who \nwere injured, just those who were murdered.\n  David Washington, age 24, Eneida Branch, age 31, and Angelica \nGuadalupe Castro, age 23, who were shot and killed in a house on \nJanuary 6 in Lakeland, Florida.\n  Antoine Bell, age 17, was shot and killed while helping a woman with \ncar trouble on January 7 in Memphis, Tennessee.\n  Raymon Blount, age 29, was shot and killed while standing on the \nstreet on January 8 in Chicago, Illinois.\n  Ira Brown, age 20, was shot and killed on January 11 during a home \nrobbery in Wilmington, Delaware.\n  Joshua Steven Morrison, age 18, was killed near a house party January \n17 in Gloucester County, Virginia.\n  Randy Peterson, age 64, was a bank president shot and killed during a \nrobbery on January 21 in Eufaula, Oklahoma.\n  Kevin McGrath, Sr., age 47, and Shanna McGrath, age 42, were killed \nat their family home on January 23 in Crestview, Florida. Elbert L. \nMerrick, age 22, was killed outside the home on the road.\n  Jason and Jacob McLemore, a father and son, age 44 and 17, were \nkilled at the gun store they owned in a dispute over a $25 service fee. \nThis was on January 23 in Pearl River County, Mississippi.\n  Cyjia Nicole Bell, age 16, Shujaa Jasiri Silver, age 19, were killed \noutside a liquor store on January 23 in Los Angeles, California.\n  An unidentified man was killed at a Mexican restaurant on January 25 \nin Perris, California.\n  James Quoc Tran, age 33, and Jeannine L. Zapata, age 45, were killed \nat a homeless encampment on January 26 in Seattle, Washington.\n  The Dooley family, including mother Lori, father Todd, son Landon, \ndaughter Brooke, and grandmother Doris, were killed at their family \nhome on January 27 in Chesapeake, Virginia. The shooter, their son, \nCameron Dooley, committed suicide after murdering the family.\n  Andre Gray, age 42, and Tina Gray, age 42, were killed at their \nfamily home on January 29 in Caroline County, Virginia.\n  Sean Marquez, age 19, Jose Aguirre-Martinez, age 19, and Yovani \nFlores, age 16, were killed at a house party on January 30 in Glendale, \nArizona. Sean Marquez died in his sister's arms.\n  Victor Mendoza, age 46, was shot and killed at a motorcycle show in \nDenver, Colorado, on January 30.\n  May the dead rest in peace and the wounded recover completely.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the war on coal touches \nnearly every family in southern West Virginia. President Obama and his \nEPA regulations don't just close mines. They put families out of work.\n  Coal miners call it job scare. Every time miners go underground, they \ndon't know, when they come up, if they will receive a WARN notice \ntelling them that they are going to be laid off. Families worry about \nmaking ends meet or moving to find work someplace else.\n  Businesses that depend on coal are suffering, too. CSX recently \nannounced it is closing its Huntington division and moving its jobs to \nanother State, in part because of the decline in coal shipments. \nNorfolk Southern in Bluefield is also moving jobs out of Bluefield, \nWest Virginia.\n  Shops and restaurants are closing their doors, as families leave town \nand have less disposable income. Walmart in McDowell County has \nrecently shut its doors, and the residents in the area have to drive to \nanother State just to get groceries. The uncertainty can be paralyzing.\n  This is reality for so many of my constituents like April Brooks of \nPrinceton in Mercer County. April writes me:\n  ``My husband has worked in the mining industry for the last eleven \nyears, and my dad was a coal miner for over thirty years.\n  ``Like every family that depends on coal for a living, we live day to \nday worrying about what will happen tomorrow. You can't plan for the \nfuture because of the uncertainty.\n  ``I went back to work several years ago so that we would have \nsupplemental income in case of layoffs. We love our State, but how does \none stay here and survive if the jobs aren't there?''\n  Mr. Speaker, President Obama's job-killing overregulations are having \nreal consequences for real West Virginians. We need to pass policies \nthat create jobs and ensure a future for all West Virginians, all West \nVirginia families, so they can stay and work and live in our great \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H715-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H715-H716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CLEAN POWER PLAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of EPA's \nClean Power Plan.\n  I am concerned that the Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Power Plan \nwill significantly and unnecessarily delay the full implementation of \nthis important action.\n  The longer we wait, the more expensive it will be to reduce \ngreenhouse gas pollution and the less chance that we have to keep this \nworld's warming below a safe threshold.\n  This week's Supreme Court decision only highlights Congress' inaction \non the issue of climate change as well as the immediate and pressing \nneed for action.\n  A damaged climate has a negative impact upon our Nation and on my \nsouthern California community. Changing weather patterns, more frequent \ndroughts, worsening air quality, and sea level rise all cost us money \nand threaten the well-being of our families and our neighbors.\n  We all want the world to be safe, to be a healthy place to raise our \nfamilies and to grow our economy. Now America has the opportunity to \nlead the world in making our environment safe and healthy, both now and \ninto the future.\n  We can do this by increasing our use of local, renewable energy \nsources, investing in research and development to bring about the next \ngeneration of clean and efficient energy systems, and assisting \ncommunities both here and abroad in adapting to the inevitable changes \nthat are caused by the damages that have already been done to the \nclimate.\n  Reducing emissions from our power sector is a foundational action in \nthis endeavor. This is an achievable endeavor.\n  America's innovation has given us spaceflight, the Internet, cures to \ndisease once thought to be incurable. Our innovation and our leadership \nis paving the way for a cleaner, safer world, and many States have \nalready determined how they can meet their goals and reduce carbon \npollution.\n  Cities and electric utilities in my district have taken the \nextraordinary steps in increasing efficiency and sustainable practices \nto reduce their carbon footprint.\n  My State of California is on track to exceed its carbon pollution \nreduction goals under the Clean Power Plan. California implemented the \nfirst statewide carbon trading system and has set ambitious targets for \nincreasing renewable energy, increased efficiency, and decreased \npetroleum usage.\n  America's leadership like this will save us money and create jobs, \nbut if we delay, the costs will be higher to us and especially to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  We are not doing this alone. Because greenhouse gases such as carbon \ndioxide spread around the world, no country is immune to the damaged \nclimate. No country can fix this problem alone.\n\n[[Page H716]]\n\n  Representatives of over 200 nations recently gathered in Paris and \nagreed on an international agreement to lower greenhouse gas emissions \nand develop strategies to adapt to changing climate.\n  This contribution from the world's biggest polluters, including China \nand India, represents 90 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n  These international contributions demonstrate how seriously the world \nis taking its moral responsibility to care for our common home, our \nfamilies, and our neighbors.\n  This roadmap for the world reduces climate-damaging greenhouse gas \nemissions, increases investments in clean energy development and \ndeployment, and assists the most vulnerable communities in adapting to \nclimate change.\n  But the United States has to do its part. This pause on the Clean \nPower Plan slows down the progress we have been making and puts U.S. \nleadership on climate in question.\n  I am deeply troubled by the Supreme Court's decision, but I am \noptimistic that the Clean Power Plan will ultimately be upheld.\n  By acting to reduce carbon pollution, we will create more opportunity \ntoday and a better future tomorrow for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H716-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF ADMIRAL ROBERT SHUMAKER ON THE 51ST ANNIVERSARY OF \n                HIS IMPRISONMENT DURING THE VIETNAM WAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, today, February 11, a day that for at least \nme, and I know many other families around our country, is a very dark \nday.\n  February 11, 1965, flying off of the USS Coral Sea, a young \nlieutenant commander, Robert Harper Shumaker, was prepared to do a \nbombing run over North Vietnam.\n  Taking antiaircraft fire, he was shot down over North Vietnam. He \nejected from his F-8 Crusader 35 feet above the ground, broke his back \nupon impact, and was immediately captured.\n  Over the next 8 years, 8 years and a day, he spent time in the Hoa Lo \nPrison, a prison that we now know as the Hanoi Hilton, one that he was \nable to name the Hanoi Hilton.\n  He was considered to be the great communicator because, while he was \nin captivity, he and a few others devised a tap code system, a tap code \nsystem with five rows and five columns that enabled American POWs to \ncommunicate with one another to be able to let them know that they were \nthinking of each other, to be able to make sure that they were \nexercising the most important muscle in captivity, that is, their \nbrains.\n  Over the course of those 8 years, Lieutenant Commander Shumaker was \nconsidered to be one of the top greatest threats to camp security.\n  He and 10 other POWs, commonly known as the Alcatraz 11, were taken \nout of the Hoa Lo Prison, brought over to a prison now known as \nAlcatraz, and put in solitary confinement.\n  These 11 heroes included James Stockdale; George Coker; Jeremiah \nDenton, who was a Senator from the great State of Alabama; Harry \nJenkins; George McKnight; James Mulligan; Howard Rutledge; Ron Storz; \nNels Tanner; and, Mr. Speaker, our colleague Sam Johnson of Texas, who \nwas elected to this body in 1991 and has served with distinction ever \nsince.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Many of the stories that we look back on came from these heroes about \nthe efforts they made to resist their captors. They were tortured day \nin and day out for information. Yet, day in and day out, they battled \nback.\n  For me, it is very important that we never forget. Fifty-one years \nafter February 11, 1965, I am honored to be able to rise in this body \nto remember Robert Harper Shumaker for his valiant efforts and heroism. \nHe is near and dear to my heart, Mr. Speaker. He is my uncle. When my \nwife and I had our first child, we decided we would name her after him, \nin the hopes that she would have a little bit of the courage, a little \nbit of the intelligence, and the stick-to-itiveness that Admiral \nShumaker has.\n  The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that February 12, 1973, 591 POWs \nstarted their return home. Bob Shumaker, the Alcatraz 11, and many \nothers were on that C-141 that flew out of Hanoi. I am proud to say \nthat they returned home with honor, which was absolutely critical not \nonly for them, but for all of the POWs. It is imperative that we in the \nUnited States Congress never forget their sacrifice and heroism.\n  For me, from now, until as long as I am able to serve in this body, \non February 11, I will rise and recognize the heroism of our POWs and \nsay: You will never be forgotten. We will always remember the sacrifice \nand the heroism that you all have given to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H716-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H716-H717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WATER INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, from the moment I arrived in Congress, I \nhave been working to rebuild and renew America. Our great country, \nsadly, is falling apart as it falls behind the rest of the world. The \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers rates our infrastructure as \nfailing.\n  I have worked to develop a plan, a vision for infrastructure for this \ncentury because people have forgotten our history and are woefully \nuninformed about the nature of the challenge we face and the \nopportunities to do it right.\n  This doesn't need to be a partisan fight in Congress. Indeed, \ninfrastructure used to be much more central to our mission in Congress, \ndating back to the postal roads mandated by the Constitution to \nPresident Eisenhower's interstate freeway system.\n  I welcome the administration's proposal for an oil fee to invest in \ngreen infrastructure. I truly believe that President Obama is committed \nto investing in infrastructure. He understands its value, and he has \nworked to include some infrastructure investment in the Recovery Act. I \nthink we all know that it actually should have been much larger than it \nwas; but, nonetheless, was very helpful.\n  The President has proposed things Congress after Congress that would \nfund a grander vision. Unfortunately, in the context of this Congress, \nthey were not realistic. They had no chance of passing, probably \nregardless of who has control, given the nature of those proposals.\n  Nonetheless, I welcome the administration's proposal for a $10 per \nbarrel fee on oil to finance green infrastructure because of the timing \nat this point of incredibly low gas prices, flirting with $1 a gallon, \nhigh oil production, a swollen inventory. Thirty dollars per barrel has \nbecome the benchmark.\n  Unfortunately, the new proposal was launched, as near as I can tell, \nwithout consultation with people in either party or the organizations \nthat deal with infrastructure. It was not met with organized support on \nbehalf of the vast array of individuals and organizations who are \ndeeply committed to rebuilding and renewing America. It simply begs the \nquestion: Why not just raise the gas tax?\n  The proposal I have introduced to raise the gas tax was widely \nsupported by business, labor, professions, local government, \nenvironmentalists; indeed, it was supported by the widest collection of \ninterest groups supporting any major initiative before Congress. When \nyou get the truckers and AAA both saying, ``Raise taxes on motorists \nand truck drivers,'' that is a signal.\n  The proposal does not have the gaps associated with an oil fee that \nwould impose challenges on consumers of oil, like school buses or home \nheating, and it does provoke the petroleum industry, which has accepted \nreasonable gas taxes, but would oppose an oil fee.\n  This is, however, an opportunity for us to revisit the need for \ninvestment in infrastructure, now that the administration has signaled \nits comfort with raising taxes on people who make under $250,000 a \nyear. The oil fee would be the equivalent of 20 to 25 cents a gallon--\nfar more than the model proposal I had to phase in a 15-cent per gallon \nincrease over 3 years.\n  Maybe we can reengage the conversation about raising the gas tax. \nAfter 24 years, we might follow the lead of President Reagan, who led \nan effort to raise the gas tax in 1983. After we raise the gas tax, we \nshould index it and\n\n[[Page H717]]\n\nthen abolish it and replace it with a more sustainable mechanism for \nfunding transportation in the future.\n  I appreciate the administration starting this conversation related to \ninfrastructure finance. Maybe we can have a broader effort to work \ncooperatively on an issue that is gaining traction at the State level \naround the country. Over a dozen States have raised their gas tax, \nincluding a number of red Republican States.\n  This will be something that meets the needs of America now--and in \nthe future--and I hope it is time for us to refocus on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H717-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PROPOSED CRUDE OIL FEE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Tipton) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, at this time of year, we are starting to \nwork on budgets in Washington, D.C.\n  The President recently proposed his eighth budget. If we want to give \ncredit to the President, he is consistent. He believes that we are just \none tax increase, one regulation, one more government program away from \nprosperity in America. But the reality is, Americans in my district are \nstruggling. They are struggling to be able to maintain the jobs they \nhave. Far too many Americans are struggling to be able to find a job.\n  One area where we have had an opportunity to be able to provide good-\npaying jobs has been in responsible energy development in this country. \nToday, I would like to be able to speak to some of the deeply flawed \nlogic by the Obama administration in trying to eliminate the use of \nfossil fuels in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last year and a half, despite the \nadministration's best attempts to stifle production, one of the few \nareas of the economy that has provided some financial relief to the \npoor and middle class has been the low price of energy. The cause of \nthis has been the result of American productivity and American \ningenuity driving down the costs, making it more affordable for people.\n  It is a surprise to no one then that, with his latest budget \nproposal, the President is trying in earnest to take the little savings \nAmericans have welcomed into their wallets and now feed it back to Big \nGovernment.\n  Effectively, what the President is stating is that government--\nWashington--needs those resources more than the American people do.\n  Two days ago, the President presented a budget that included a $10 \nper barrel tax on crude oil. His budget stated that if tax would result \nin $319 billion in revenues that would be used to fund transportation \ninfrastructure, ``reduce America's reliance on oil,'' and ensure \n``electric cars and other alternatives to oil-based vehicles have the \ntechnology and charging infrastructure they need.''\n  I believe we need to be clear. I firmly back the notion that we need \nto have an all-of-the-above strategy. That is highlighted in the bill I \nhave introduced in this Congress, Planning for American Energy Act, \nwhich literally calls for all of the above. It explicitly states as \nsuch.\n  Those resources and technologies are only part of what should be a \nmulti-pronged strategy. If true energy independence is our goal, we \ncannot simply price ourselves out of using traditional energy resources \nand transportation fuels. Yet, that is unmistakably exactly what the \nPresident is proposing.\n  So, while cheap energy is one of the few things keeping the economy \nout of a nose dive into a further deep recession, the President \nproposes a tax cut on crude oil--whether produced domestically or \nabroad--that will cut directly into already low revenues, and will \nundoubtedly be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices at \nthe pump.\n  An additional $10 per barrel will be a significant sum, even with a \nhealthy commodity price, but on the day that the President submitted \nhis proposal, the spot price for a barrel of oil was just under $30. \nGiven that our oil and gas energy sector is already struggling mightily \nwith this downswing in price, what exactly does the President hope to \naccomplish by wresting away a third of that sum? The economic impacts \nof this policy on an industry that is already struggling would be \nextremely harmful.\n  Now, I assume that when we envision who the industry is, the picture \ncomes to mind of large, multinational corporations. Make no mistake: \nthey, too, will feel the impacts. But the brunt of an ill-conceived \npolicy, such as what the President has put forward, will fall squarely \non the shoulders of small- and medium-sized companies that make up the \nbackbone of our domestic oil and gas industry.\n  It will also fall squarely on the many contractors who work in those \ncompanies. They are geologists, engineers, construction companies, well \nservicing companies, and the hospitality industry. They are the many \nhardworking Americans working to provide for their families and working \nto provide the rest of us with an invaluable resource that we too often \ntake for granted.\n  The President wishes to move us away from oil as a transportation \nfuel, so he pursues a purely ideological strategy to force it, never \nmind who is trampled in the process.\n  The President wishes, instead, to pursue electric vehicle sales, \nwhich, in 2015, accounted for less than 1 percent of the total car \nsales in the country. Yet, he takes measures to halt coal leasing and \nbludgeon coal-fired power plants into nonexistence. Coal, of course, is \nthe single largest source of electricity in the United States.\n  These two incoherent policy pursuits are a perfect demonstration of \nthe complete lack of vision this administration has when it comes to \nachieving actual energy independence.\n  Let's stand up for the American consumer and American jobs and reject \nthe President's budget proposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H717-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H717-H718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING ABIT MASSEY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nAbit Massey.\n  Last week, Mr. Massey was awarded one of the highest honors that \nanyone can receive from the University of Georgia. On January 27, Mr. \nMassey was awarded the University of Georgia President's Medal for \nextraordinary contributions to students in academic programs, the \nadvancement of research, and for inspiring community leaders to enhance \nGeorgians' quality of life.\n  Mr. Massey graduated from the University of Georgia in 1949, and \nreceived his Juris Doctorate from Emory University. For almost 50 \nyears, he was executive director of the Georgia Poultry Federation, \nknown to many as the dean of the poultry industry. Before joining the \nGeorgia Poultry Federation, he was head of the Georgia Department of \nCommerce, where he created the first Welcome Center in Georgia. He has \nreceived numerous awards for his service to the State of Georgia.\n  But Mr. Massey would argue that his greatest accomplishment would be \nhis family. Mr. Massey, along with his wife, Kayanne, who was a former \nMiss Georgia, have more than 18 family members who attended the \nUniversity of Georgia, and the Massey family was named the University \nof Georgia Alumni Association Family of the Year in 2014.\n  I commend Mr. Massey for his commitment to Georgia, and I \ncongratulate him for receiving this distinguished award.\n\n\n Recognizing Ms. Frankie Quimby and the Association for Cultural Equity\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. \nFrankie Quimby and the Association for Cultural Equity.\n  Ms. Quimby, the oldest of 13 children, was born and raised on the \nGeorgia Sea Islands and descended from slaves of the Hopeton and Altama \nPlantations in Glynn County. She, along with her family, make up the \nGeorgia Sea Island Singers, who have continued to preserve the rich \ntraditions of African American culture, customs, and the songs of the \nGullah language. In fact, the Quimby family is one of only a few \nfamilies who can trace their ancestry back to a specific spot in Africa \non the Niger River.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  In fact, the Quimby family is one of only a few families who can \ntrace their ancestry back to a specific spot in Africa on the Niger \nRiver.\n\n[[Page H718]]\n\n  Along with the Association for Cultural Equity, whose mission is to \nfacilitate cultural equity through preservation, publication, and \nrepatriation of music, dance, and spoken word, the Quimby family has \nbeen able to continue to preserve the rich heritage of their African \nAmerican culture throughout the Georgia Sea Islands because people \nliving in the area have been able to retain pure versions of games and \nsongs brought over from Africa centuries ago.\n  I commend Ms. Frankie Quimby, the Quimby family, and the Association \nfor Cultural Equity for preserving this rich history of Georgia's \nheritage.\n\n\n                           Stephen Elmo Weeks\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nlife of Stephen Elmo Weeks, who passed away on January 17, 2016.\n  Born on December 6, 1919, Elmo, as his friends called him, graduated \nfrom Savannah High School in 1940. Upon graduation, Elmo attended the \nGeorgia Institute of Technology before heading off to war in 1942, \nwhere he was stationed at a German POW camp in Opelika, Alabama.\n  Upon his return to Savannah, he joined the family business, Fox & \nWeeks funeral home, and soon became actively involved as a founding \nboard member for the Savannah Christian Preparatory School.\n  Mr. Weeks was actively engaged with numerous organizations in the \nSavannah area, including the Savannah Junior Chamber of Commerce, the \nKiwanis Club, and his church and my church, Wesley Monumental United \nMethodist Church.\n  He was also a man who recognized and enjoyed the great outdoors. As \nan avid boater, he spent a significant amount of time on the water, \nteaching his children, his grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren \nabout life's lessons.\n  Whether it was having lunch at the Oglethorpe Club with his close \nfriends or his continued involvement with the funeral home into his \nlate eighties, Elmo was a committed and devoted man who always put his \nfriends and family first.\n  Elmo, your love and service to your family and community will be \nmissed.\n\n\n                  Remembering the Life of Jim Monaghan\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life \nof Jim Monaghan and his dedication to Tybee Island, Georgia.\n  Born in New York City in 1927, Mr. Monaghan arrived in Savannah by \nsailboat in 1982 with his wife, Anne Merchant Monaghan. Soon after \ntheir arrival in Savannah, they moved to Tybee Island.\n  Over the years, Mr. Monaghan served Tybee Island with enthusiasm. He \nserved on the Tybee Island City Council, volunteered at the Tybee \nlighthouse, and delivered stuffed animals to nursing home residents.\n  He was a board member and former president of the Tybee Island \nRepublican Club. A true gentleman with an uplifting spirit and a warm \nsmile, Mr. Monaghan rarely missed the club's dinner meetings, always \nenjoying the social atmosphere and meeting new guests.\n  Mr. Monaghan passed away last week at the age of 88. He is survived \nby his two children, Mr. James C. ``Tripp'' Monaghan III, and Mrs. \nShane Sturm.\n  I am honored to celebrate the life, the generosity, and the character \nof Jim Monaghan. He will truly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H718-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, President Obama released his \nbudget for fiscal year 2017. Some might call this proposal a vision for \nthe future of the country. Well, I am here to tell you the President's \nvision for America ignores our fiscal realities and the magnitude of \nthe problems we face.\n  The national debt is nearly $19 trillion. Our country is in the \nmiddle of a fiscal crisis driven by reckless borrowing and runaway \ngovernment spending, and President Obama once again offers us a budget \nfilled with untenable tax hikes that never balances.\n  Something has to change or the legacy we leave to our children and \ngrandchildren will be a crushing debt burden and a weaker nation.\n  Washington has a moral obligation to the American people to present a \nresponsible budget that reins in wasteful Federal overspending and \nguarantees accountability for the use of taxpayer dollars. House \nRepublicans will continue to do all we can to make this vision a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H719-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF EVA HAMLIN MILLER\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise today during Black History Month to \nrecognize my mentor and friend, fellow artist and teacher, the late Eva \nHamlin Miller.\n  Eva Miller dedicated her life to her art and her students, \nencouraging us to pursue our artistic goals. From the 1930s Harlem \nstreet scenes to stained glass windows in North Carolina, Mrs. Miller's \nartistic talents, range, and precision were phenomenal.\n  She was a pioneering voice for African American art, curating one of \nthe first regional shows of African American art in the North Carolina \nMuseum of Art in Raleigh and founding the African American Atelier with \nme 25 years ago, an art gallery focusing on African American art and \nartists located in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n  Eva Miller possessed an unwavering dedication to students, as a \nteacher at Tuskegee Institute, Bennett College, Winston-Salem State \nUniversity, and North Carolina A\n  Her legacy continues to live on, not only through her work but \nthrough the many students she taught and inspired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H719-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today as co-chair \nof the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus to recognize \nFebruary as National Career and Technical Education Month.\n  Career and technical education programs play a key role in closing \nour Nation's skill gap by preparing students of all ages for the 21st \ncentury workforce and jobs. That is why I was encouraged by the \ninclusion of career and technical education center provisions in the \nrecently passed Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  Not only does the ESSA provide much-needed flexibility to States and \nlocal education agencies, it also encourages businesses to get involved \nwith their local schools. More schools will be able to use Federal \nfunds to provide academic credit for apprenticeships and strengthen \ntheir career counseling programs.\n  This was a result of bipartisan legislation I introduced with the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my colleague and friend, \naimed at informing school counselors of local labor market conditions \nso that they can best guide the decisionmaking process of their \nstudents.\n  It is my hope that this and other Federal education policies will \nprovide support to schools, businesses, and community organizations in \nPennsylvania's Fifth District and across the country as they work to \nprepare our students for the future.\n  I look forward to working toward improving and reauthorizing the \nPerkins Act for career and technical education training.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H719-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF CTE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN.

Perkins \nCareer and Technical Education Act to deliver student-centered \neducation that provides the right skills for successful careers. We \nhave the opportunity to remake Perkins in a way that works for the new \neconomy in the 21st century.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the need \nto control our Nation's debt.\n  Due to a rapid and unsustainable expansion of the Federal Government, \nthe Obama administration has racked up $8 trillion in new debt, pushing \nthe national debt to more than $19 trillion. If we continue down this \nreckless path, the Congressional Budget Office projects a return to $1 \ntrillion annual deficits by 2022.\n  Today, the House of Representatives is working toward returning to a \nmore fiscally responsible nation by voting on the Debt Management and \nFiscal Responsibility Act. This legislation will begin to restore \nfiscal discipline by requiring the U.S. Treasury Secretary to appear \nbefore Congress at least 21 days before hitting the debt ceiling to \npresent the administration's plans to reduce the national debt.\n  While more work needs to be done, this legislation is one step closer \nto financial sanity and security.\n  I want to thank Representative Marchant for his hard work on this \nbill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the national \ncybersecurity strategy included in the President's budget proposal for \nfiscal year 2017.\n  This is a solid framework that includes a 35 percent increase for \ncyber and a new high-level official focused solely on implementing a \ncyber strategy across the entire Federal Government.\n  Cyber hackers are costing American companies billions of dollars in \nintellectual property every year. Terrorists, like ISIS, organized \ncriminals, and even state actors, such as Iran and North Korea, are \nhoning their cyber skills, which could put our country at critical \nrisk, including infrastructure shutdowns.\n  For years, I have advocated for a Cabinet-level cyber position with \nbudget authority because the cyber threat is so severe. This new \nofficial should have real authority to drive change across the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We must also continue working on issues still unaddressed, such as \nthe insider threat posed by people within the government. An example of \nthat is Edward Snowden, who gave stolen American information to Russia \nand China.\n  This is especially critical in the wake of a data breach affecting \nmore than 22 million current, former, and prospective Federal employees \nlast June.\n\n[[Page H720]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H720-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHILDREN'S BEREAVEMENT CENTER\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the current status \nof California's devastating drought.\n  I urge the California State and Federal agencies to maximize the \npumping of water in the delta to the allowable legal limits.\n  As a result of State and Federal agencies' inability to operate at \nthe most flexible range available under the Biological Opinions of the \nEndangered Species Act, over 44,000 acre-feet of water has been lost \njust this last week during these El Nino conditions, and over 131,000 \nacre-feet of water has been lost this year, water that could be used to \ngrow crops and to feed people. This is morally wrong.\n  Congress must pass legislation to provide relief for the people of \nthe San Joaquin Valley and California. Senator Feinstein's introduction \nof water legislation is a critical step. I urge the Senate to pass her \nlegislation so we can enter into negotiations with the House-passed \nbill, which I strongly support.\n  Time is of the essence. Every day of delay only results in further \nlosses of the vital water that is necessary for the people of the \nvalley and the people of California.

These ships are built, in part, by Austal \nUSA in my home district.\n  I have seen these ships being built, I have talked to the Navy \nleadership, and I have visited with the sailors who are actually \nworking on these vessels. They all support the LCS and the vital role \nit plays in the Navy's fleet. In fact, just last year, Secretary of the \nNavy Ray Mabus said: ``We have a need, a demonstrated need, for 52 of \nthese small surface combatants.''\n  Cutting the LCS program, along with failing to include an additional \nExpeditionary Fast Transport ship, would be a tremendous mistake as it \nrelates to maintaining the workforce base that we have worked so hard \nto build up along the Gulf Coast.\n  So I have a message for the 4,000 people who work at the Austal \nshipyard in Mobile: This proposal from a lameduck Secretary of Defense \nand a lameduck President will not stand.\n  I will fight every day to make sure that our Navy has the resources \nthey want and need to protect our Nation and keep sea lanes open.

She was a young teacher who worked \nuntil she finally knew that her talent was worthy of presenting it to \nthe American people.\n  Yolanda Adams rose to fame as one of gospel music's greats, making \nher debut in 1988. I remember her song, ``Just as I Am.'' Since then, \nYolanda has been wowing gospel audiences. She has been before the \nPresident of the United States and all over the world, but yet she is a \nhumble person.\n  Following her illustrious music career, she began the Yolanda Adams \nMorning Show.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak today about Flight 3407 \nthat\n\n[[Page H721]]\n\ncrashed in Buffalo, New York, 7 years ago tomorrow.\n  This plane crashed inside of the runway on an icy February night. We \nlearned that the pilot and the copilot had never been trained at all on \nflying into an icy situation. The young woman who was the copilot had \nflown in the night before from Seattle. She was paid so little--around \n$13,000 a year--that she could not afford a motel room to sleep, so she \nslept on the floor somewhere. On the black box, you could hear them \nyawning before the crash.\n  In that plane crash were two of the best musicians in the United \nStates, a woman who knew more about Rwanda and its problems than \nanybody else, and one of the most extraordinary anthropologists in the \nworld. They died because these pilots had no idea of how to fly in \nthose conditions.\n  Colgan Air, their owner, was trying to take some responsibility.\n  We have worked with the families of the people who died on that \nplane. They have selflessly come down here for 7 years, and we have \nfinally gotten some regulation through the FAA of how much training \nthey had to have, that at least the pilot or the copilot had to have \nsome hours of flying time behind them that would be of some use.\n  Now, we are facing an FAA bill here today, where they are trying to \nundo those safety regulations. It absolutely applies to every last one \nof us in the United States.\n  For goodness sake, I implore my colleagues not to let it happen, that \nthose regulations would be weakened and, once more, we would be flying \npeople who are living on subsistence wages, unable to really cope with \nthe weather or the elements.\n  We deserve better than that in this century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H721-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  (Mr. LUCAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. LUCAS.

It was my hope that the \nPresident would have used this opportunity to progress an agenda that \nreflects our Nation's needs. Unfortunately, it seems to be exactly the \nopposite.\n  The President's proposed budget is supposed to serve as a blueprint \nfor our Nation's prosperity. Sadly, his plan offers an unrealistic way \nforward. Currently, our national debt stands at over $19 trillion. If \nthe President got his way, that number would rise to $27 trillion over \nthe next decade.\n  The President has chosen to ignore the facts. If Americans have to \nbalance their checkbooks and live within their means, so should the \nFederal Government. To pay for his spending, the President hopes to \nraise taxes and institute a $10 per barrel levy on an already anemic \noil industry.\n  I believe my constituents deserve better than that from the \nPresident, and we should work together to ensure certainty, not \nuncertainty, in today's challenging environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H721-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POLIS.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 611 provides for a rule to \nconsider a commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation that will fix a \nproblem that was wholly created by the intransigence of the bureaucrats \nat the Food and Drug Administration. This important bill amends the \ndifficultly drafted Affordable Care Act, which rigidly mandated that \nfood establishments provide physical notices of the nutritional value \nof every food item that they offer.\n  Perhaps this is a noble endeavor in theory, until one considers that \nthe inflexible rule put out by the Food and Drug Administration makes \nno allowances for establishments that allow for multiple variations of \ntheir offerings. This could mean that a pizza chain, for example, would \nhave to provide calorie counts for every possible different type of \npizza combination that one could order, a mandate that would result in \na pizza place needing to literally wallpaper their establishment, and \nperhaps the establishment next door, with all of the different \nscenarios for personalized pizzas.\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate. It is equally divided between \nthe majority and the minority of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The \nCommittee on Rules made in order every amendment that was submitted to \nthe committee to be considered, two Democratic amendments and one \nbipartisan offering. Finally, the rule affords the minority the \ncustomary motion to recommit, a final opportunity to amend the bill \nshould the minority choose to exercise this option.\n  Mr. Speaker, the issue before us today in the underlying bill is not \nabout whether restaurants should provide their customers with \nnutritional information; the issue is fundamentally one of the proper \nrole of government. Since President Obama moved into the White House \nand Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid served as his stewards in the 110th \nCongress, the Democrats have drummed a steady beat toward expanding the \nrole of government in every direction in our lives.\n  H.R. 2017, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, is bipartisan \nlegislation introduced by Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers and \nLoretta Sanchez to fix the Food and Drug Administration's unworkable \nimplementation of the menu labeling law. The Food and Drug \nAdministration's regulatory framework is not just cumbersome for the \nfood industry, it also impedes a business' ability to provide \nmeaningful information that customers can use to make nutrition \ndecisions.\n  The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act is critical to avoid \nharming consumer choice, harming jobs, and harming small business. The \nFederal Government should not presume to know how restaurants, \nsupermarkets, cafes, convenience stores, and entertainment venues can \nbest serve their customers and run their businesses, yet the Food and \nDrug Administration has done exactly that.\n  For years now, many restaurants and retail food establishments have \ndisclosed caloric information to their customers. This industry \nexpertise should have been instructive to the Food and Drug \nAdministration as it developed the Federal regulation. In fact, the \nFood and Drug Administration took 3\\1/2\\ years before finalizing a rule \nthat virtually ignores serious concerns raised about the harm of an \noverly prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach.\n  Not only did the FDA disregard the input of consumers and industry \nexperts, it also extended the scope of the regulation far beyond what \nanyone could have imagined when they voted for this bill in March of \n2010. If the Food and Drug Administration is allowed to implement the \nrule as it stands, the Office of Management and Budget has determined \nit will require more than 14 million--14 million--compliance hours, in \naddition to costs exceeding $1 billion. Even the Food and Drug \nAdministration acknowledged that initial compliance will cost almost \n$400 million, with recurring costs as high as $150 million per year. \nLikely, the actual costs for the private sector will far exceed those \nestimates.\n  Perhaps even more concerning than the costs, food service \nestablishments. Food service establishments are going to face Federal \ncriminal penalties for even the slightest failure to comply with the \nframework envisioned by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Under section 403(a)(1) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, food \nlabeling must be truthful and not misleading. Food labeling that does \nnot meet the Food and Drug Administration's standard for ``truthful and \nnonmisleading''\n\n[[Page H723]]\n\nis deemed ``misbranded.'' Under the U.S. Code, introducing misbranded \nfood into commerce is a prohibited act, and the liable party shall be \nimprisoned for up to 1 year, fined not more than $1,000, or both.\n  Food to which these menu labeling requirements apply is deemed \nmisbranded if the Food and Drug Administration's rule requirements are \nnot met. It is not necessary that the person intentionally mislead \ncustomers. Under the Food and Drug Administration's framework, merely \nadding an extra slice of pepperoni will render the calorie content on \nthe menu misleading, and your chef is now a criminal.\n  People say that the Food and Drug Administration won't put people in \njail over this, so I don't think there should be an issue in saying \njust that, that people will not be put in jail for an extra slice of \npepperoni. I don't think there is a problem with codifying that in \nstatute. I think it will give great reassurance to food preparers in \nthe industry.\n  The Food and Drug Administration's regulation is applicable to \nrestaurants and similar establishments that sell ready-to-eat food that \nare part of chains with at least 20 stores. This would include \nbakeries, cafeterias, coffee shops, convenience stores, delis, \nentertainment venues, food service vendors, fast-food take-out or \ndelivery establishments, grocery stores, confectionery stores, quick \nservice restaurants, and table service restaurants.\n  Although stores may be part of a nationwide chain, there is \nsubstantial variation between regional locations. For example, \nconvenience stores noted in their testimony that, unlike a McDonald's \nor a doughnut shop that have the same format everywhere they go, many \nconvenience stores have different layouts based upon region, so coming \nup with a uniform standard would, in fact, be challenging. This means \nthat all chains will incur individual costs for nutritional analysis \nand for menu labeling for each location, not just one time done at the \nnational level.\n  Under the rule, the definition of a menu is applied broadly to mean \nany writing a customer uses to place an order. This approach would \ninclude everything from in-store menu boards to print advertising in \nthe form of door hangers or circulars or online advertising. The rule \nrequires that each menu item have a clearly visible calorie count, \nincluding separate calorie information for variable menu items such as \ntoppings or flavor additives.\n\n  Pizza chains estimate that there are over 30 million combinations \navailable to customers; and the calorie content for each option \ncouldn't fit on any menu board that I have ever seen. Grocers estimate \nthat the rule would include hundreds of items in stores that are \noffered subject to availability and demand, things such as fresh \nproduce, baked goods, seafood, making it virtually impossible to have \naccurate menu boards without changing them on a nearly constant basis. \nMany of these businesses would likely stop offering the range of \noptions that are currently available because it would simply cost too \nmuch to comply.\n  Clearly, the Food and Drug Administration's regulation does not \nprovide a workable framework for businesses. This rule should be about \nensuring customers are provided with accurate, trustworthy nutrition \ninformation to help inform their decisions, all the while, enabling \nsmall businesses the ability to comply.\n  Representative McMorris Rodgers' bill is carefully constructed to \ncreate transparency for consumers, while maintaining the flexibility \nnecessary for all regulated businesses to be in compliance. The Common \nSense Nutrition Disclosure Act will establish a more reasonable \nstandard for Federal regulation by applying nutritional disclosure \nrequirements to establishments that derive more than 50 percent of \ntheir total revenue from the sale of food.\n  The bill also ensures that inadvertent human error will not subject a \nlocal franchise owner to crippling fines or possibly imprisonment. \nNutritional information could be provided by a remote access menu for \nfood establishments where the majority of orders are placed by \ncustomers off premises. Establishments with self-serve food may comply \nwith the requirements for restaurants or place signs with nutritional \ninformation adjacent to each food item, and the bill clarifies that \nadvertisements are not menus.\n  Yesterday, during the Rules Committee hearing, Ranking Member Pallone \ntestified that it is important that consumers have information at the \npoint of purchase. I disagree with this point. Consumers should have \nthe information when they are placing their order.\n  A menu board may work for some businesses where customers order at \nthe counter where they also pay; but for something like a pizza \nrestaurant where most people are ordering online or over the telephone, \nhaving the calorie information when they pick up their order actually \nwon't be helpful to the consumer when they are actually making the \ndecisions. This is an example of how the Food and Drug Administration \ndid not consider the array of business types included in this rule, and \nthis is why a legislative solution not only is necessary, but it is \nrequired.\n  The food retail sector employs millions of Americans, and it provides \naccess to affordable, healthy options. The Federal Government must not \nimpose arbitrary regulations that will cause unnecessary harm to \nbusinesses and customers. The businesses impacted by this rule widely \nsupport providing customers with the nutritional information to better \ninform their food decisions, but they want to do it in a practical and \ncommonsense way.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  This legislation provides clear guidance to small business owners, \nensuring compliance and at the same time delivering that critical \ninformation.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote \n``yes'' on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the time, \nand I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. This is one of the \nstrangest debates we have had in my time in the House here on the floor \nof the House. We are actually literally debating the fine print of \nmenus in chain restaurants.\n  Frankly, I think the American people want to see this body address \nthe real issues that they care about every day. They want our body to \nfix our broken immigration system and secure our borders. They want us \nto raise the minimum wage and make college more affordable. They want \nto make sure that Americans are safe and secure in their homes and that \nwe can ensure for the next generation of Americans the same promise \nthat our last generation has enjoyed in this country.\n  We know it is becoming even harder and harder for Americans to stay \nand thrive in the middle class, burdened with more and more college \ndebt and with medical bills. It is time to improve that and make sure \nthat we can restore a robust economy that works for all Americans.\n  The finer points of exactly the font size on menus is, of course, \nbest left to the executive agencies. It is a complete waste of \nCongress' time. There is a 400-page guidance from the FDA, and Congress \nis now going into that through this bill and literally doing things \nlike adjusting font size and changing definitions. What a bizarre way \nto spend not only an hour for this rule debate but time for the actual \nbill debate, amendments, and the vote. I wonder how much taxpayer time \nwe are spending on menu font size, which I don't even know why we are \neven talking about that. How bizarre.\n  The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act is advertised as a response \nto what some perceive to be FDA regulations they don't like. Fine. \nElect a different President. There actually will be a different \nPresident. One of the things this bill ironically does is delays these \nrules until there is a new President.\n  So, I don't know, will Members of this body like rules better that \nare set by President Trump or President Sanders or President Clinton? I \ndon't even think the topics come up in their campaign on what font size \nthey want on menus and where they want the calories listed. I haven't \nheard it from any of my constituents.\n  Generally, people want information about calories and how much they \nare getting. They want to know that, if\n\n[[Page H724]]\n\nthey are getting a hamburger, it might make a difference if the smaller \none is 300 calories and the bigger one is 500; maybe if I am watching \nmy weight, I will order the smaller one.\n  That is generally what people want. These rules generally do that. \nBut here we are using hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars \nchanging a few things and saying, by the way, we want President Trump \nor Sanders to do this instead of President Obama.\n  I mean, why? The American people should be outraged. The American \npeople look at Congress, and what do we have, like I think a 6 percent \napproval rating. Six percent of the American people are saying right \non? Six percent of the American people want us to discuss exactly where \nit says how many calories your hamburger has at your fast-food \nrestaurant? Maybe those 6 percent checked the wrong box on that \ncongressional approval poll. But at least 94 percent of the American \npeople think we ought to be doing something else, and so do I.\n  I think we should be working to balance the budget. I think that we \nshould fix our broken immigration system and restore our borders. I \nthink that we should grow the American economy, find a sustainable way \nto invest in infrastructure, find a way to provide a boost to the \nrenewable energies economy, boost American exports in manufacturing, \nraise the minimum wage, make health care more affordable, and build \nupon the improvements of the Affordable Care Act.\n  But no, no. The Republican majority has decided we are going to spend \nthe rest of the day today and tomorrow debating where and how on \nmenus--and not even all restaurants, just some restaurants, with \nrestaurants on all sides of this issue, by the way--that it says how \nmany calories are in your hamburger.\n  While some say that they don't like the regulations, the reality is \nthis bill actually delays and waters down the transparency that the \nAmerican people want. Honestly, my constituents have not called about \nthis. I don't think many of them care that much about where it says how \nmany calories are in their burger. But to the extent they think about \nit, they just want transparency. They want to see it. So do I as a \nconsumer, by the way.\n  When we work late nights here in D.C., I will order online from a \ndelivery service. They will bring the food to my home. Sometimes I will \ngo into their storefront, and sometimes those stores are chain stores \nthat are under this.\n  Now, as a consumer, I like to see the calories at all those \nlocations. What this bill would actually do is prevent that from \nhappening. It would say, look, Mr. Store Owner or Ms. Store Owner of a \nRestaurant Franchise Chain That Delivers, you get 60 percent of your \nbusiness at your door that comes in, 40 percent of your business is \ndelivery, so you don't have to tell your delivery customers on your Web \nsite how many calories are in that burger. If I am one of their \ndelivery customers, I lose out on that transparency because of the \nmeasures in this bill.\n  And the converse, what if 60 percent of their food is delivery food \nand 40 percent are walk-in customers? Now you are saying that if I \nchoose to go there, walk-in customers, sure, maybe the calorie thing is \nsomewhere, maybe it is tucked under a magazine dispenser or it is on \nsome back wall in the restroom, but it is not right there on the menu \nwhere I can actually see how many calories are in the item of my \nchoice.\n  The American people like our labeling. They like transparency. You go \nto the supermarket, every item, you pick it up, there is a label that \ntells you the calories, and it tells you the ingredients. People like \nthat for restaurants. They certainly don't like Congress trying to \nmodify the fine print on the font size on 400 pages of thoughtful rules \naround exactly how this should be done and punting it to the next \nPresident, whom we don't even know who that is going to be, to start a \nwhole new rulemaking process about something that is very simple.\n  People want to see how many calories are in what they eat. It is a \nvery simple concept--very simple. People like it. People don't want us \nwasting time on it. Let's not waste time on it. Let's discuss the \nthings people care about.\n  But, no, we are forced to, under this rule, spend even more time--and \ntime is money. Time is money, not just of opportunity cost, but we \ncould be talking about ending our budget deficit and restoring order to \nour border. We could be doing that. Not just the opportunity cost but \nactual cost. It costs money to keep this body up and running. We are \npaying our staffs, the lights are on, hundreds of thousands of dollars \nof taxpayer money to discuss exactly where and how the number of \ncalories on your hamburger will be listed when there already are over \n400 pages of rules which work and are still being fine tuned.\n\n  We had great testimony from the ranking member on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, Frank Pallone, yesterday in our Rules Committee. He \nsaid that there are ongoing discussions with FDA, and they are well \naware of some of these issues that can be improved.\n  Congress is best setting these broad directions, like the broad \ndirection which I support which Congress actually did. This was part of \nthe Affordable Care Act. If it were a separate vote, I would have been \nproud to support it too. We said chain restaurants need to label \ncaloric intake. That is great. That is a broad direction. The details \nof exactly how to do it need to be figured out on the implementation \nside.\n  I can only imagine, if Congress got this involved with every single \nthing, this country would grind to a halt. Nothing could ever occur. No \npermit would ever be granted. No approval would ever occur of anything. \nIt is simply the wrong way to run the largest, wealthiest, most \ndemocratic, and most free nation on the face of the Earth by grinding \nthe country to a halt over Congress--the Congress of the United \nStates--setting font sizes on restaurant menus. What the heck are we \ndoing? It is a wonder that 6 percent of people, Mr. Speaker, approve of \nthis Congress. I think they checked the wrong box.\n  The whole point of this labeling measure included in the Affordable \nCare Act was to empower consumers to make healthier decisions about the \nfood they eat by simply allowing them to know what is in it. That is \nthe broad direction set by Congress, making sure that we have a public \nhealth impact. We need a certain level of standardization so consumers \ncan compare nutritional information on restaurants, just as we do on \npackages in stores.\n  If companies that make packaged foods had free rein to invent serving \nsizes on nutrition labels, or to put the labels on the inside of the \ncontainer instead of the outside where you can't really see it, would \nanybody in this body argue that those labels were no longer serving the \npublic good for which they were introduced?\n  This is the same thing. This is the same thing as putting a label on \nthe inside of a jar, rather than the outside, to game the system. It \nseems to me like an effort to deprive the American people of \ninformation they want to see. You don't improve Federal standards by \nmaking them unenforceable in a court of law. You make them irrelevant \nby making them unenforceable in a court of law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am one of these people who wants to know what is in \ntheir food. Many of my constituents are too. I am proud to represent \nthe Second Congressional District of Colorado, one of the fittest \ncongressional districts in this Nation, one of the districts with the \nlowest obesity rates, and a district in which people pride themselves \non nutrition, healthy lifestyles, and exercise. I am proud to be a \nrepresentative of that district. My constituents want to know what they \neat. Menu labeling, which has been implemented in five States and \ndozens of cities since 2006, empowers consumers to make healthy \ndecisions and know what they eat, which has never been more important.\n  We all know that obesity and diabetes are on the rise. Last year, \nalmost half of American adults had diabetes or pre-diabetes. Medical \ncosts are in the hundreds of billions to treat these diseases and \ngrowing. Eating well is the most significant thing that a person can do \nas a preventative health measure to prevent themselves from developing \nthese diet-related illnesses, including obesity and heart disease.\n  As it stands now, nutrition information is already available on \nprepackaged foods. So when I cook at home, I know exactly what \ningredients\n\n[[Page H725]]\n\nare going into the meal I feed myself and my kids. It is right on the \nlabel. But when I go out to eat, I don't have the advantage of that \nsame information.\n  In 2015, for the first time ever, Americans spent more money at \nrestaurants than on groceries. Let me say that again: Americans spent \nmore money at restaurants than on groceries for the first time in 2015. \nThat is a big deal. An important part of the nutritional content that \ngives us sustenance comes from restaurants, and the American people \nwant that same level of transparency at their restaurants.\n  With this particular bill, Congress would be moving away from the \nbroad direction that it gave the FDA to basically micromanage over 400 \npages of exactly, in what instances, where, and how labels need to \nappear to the detriment of transparency and access.\n  As my friend from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) mentioned in the Rules \nCommittee, the FDA solicited significant feedback from stakeholders \nover many years, both during the negotiations of the Affordable Care \nAct and, of course, over the course of developing a final rule. They \nhave delayed implementation for 2 years already to give restaurants and \nthe retail food community more time. I am talking about printing \nthings. How overly generous can you get?\n  With this bill, the Republicans are seeking 2 more years of delay. It \nis important to point out it has already been delayed 2 years. Again, \nthis is a typical example of why the American people are so frustrated \nwith Congress. This is a bill that will effectively grind things to a \nhalt. Grind what to a halt? Telling you how many calories are in your \nhamburger, something that people want to know. That is what it will \ngrind to a halt. To what end? To no end. It is a bizarre, unusual waste \nof time for Congress to be even debating this.\n  If this bill were to pass and be signed into law--which it won't be \nbecause, of course, the President does not support this bill--it would \npostpone regulations for another 2 years, leaving an entirely new \nstructure about exactly how the caloric intake on your menus is \nportrayed to the next President of the United States. Let's get this \ndone.\n  Under this bill, the menu labeling provision would go into effect, at \nthe earliest, in 2018 and would be significantly watered down. Why is \nCongress sticking our noses in over 400 pages of rulemaking regarding \nthis issue? If we have issues with the FDA, bring them up appropriately \nin oversight hearings of the FDA. At most, legislatively, perhaps a \nfunding restriction amendment in an appropriations process to run a \nparticular aspect of this regulation that a majority of this body \ndoesn't like might be a legislative way to spend 10 minutes on it and \nresolve it. Ten minutes. Maybe the American people would think it \nreasonable to spend 10 minutes.\n  They don't think it is reasonable to discuss this for 2 days. \nHamburger calories for 2 days and exactly what font size and where it \nappears? What is going on here, Mr. Speaker? This is simply an \ninappropriate way, a shockingly out-of-touch way, for Congress to spend \nits time.\n  My colleagues who support this bill have said that it builds \nflexibility for compliance. They say that it can help clarify nutrition \ninformation. I don't agree with those remarks, but I am more concerned \nwith the provision of micromanaging the way that bills this Congress \nhave already passed are implemented.\n  I am worried this bill would make the provision of nutrition \ninformation more confusing for several reasons. In fact, I think that \nis part of the nefarious goal of this bill.\n  Where are caloric counts supposed to be displayed? This bill would \nallow the restaurant or retail establishment to publish this \ninformation on one menu board, and not necessarily at the point of \nsale. So instead of on the menu at the point of sale, they can stick it \nin the bathroom. They can stick it in the bathroom. If you don't go to \nthe bathroom, you won't see how many calories are in your burger. That \nis what they could do under this rule. Who the heck wants that?\n  As Mr. Pallone pointed out yesterday, H.R. 2017 allows retailers to \npublish nutrition information in the format that receives the majority \nof their customers, whether it was in person or online.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Just because I order food delivered to my home, I might not get to \nknow how many calories are in my family's dinner. Or conversely, if \nother people order delivery and I go into a restaurant, I might not get \nto know how many calories are in a meal that I am feeding my family.\n  I don't see why we don't just publish the information in the store, \non takeout menus, and online. They have it, they know it, print it. It \nis easy. Do it. People want to see it. It is transparency. It is like \nletting prepackaged goods put their label on the inside of the package \nwhere nobody can see it rather than the outside. Or people buy things, \nif you buy your packaged goods online--and some people do--saying: Oh, \nit is on the Web site, so it doesn't need to be on the label. If you go \nin the store, you don't get to know what is in this product.\n  The businesses that are required to implement these regulations \naren't even corner delis or mom and pop shops. This isn't about them. \nThis is about restaurants with more than 20 locations. The FDA has \nexempted any business smaller than that.\n  In fact, the rulemaking has many exceptions already, including \nexemptions for specialty items, for temporary menus, for custom orders, \nand for daily specials. All exempt. They had a thoughtful process. They \ntalked to restaurant owners. I haven't heard any complaints from my \ndistrict about it, and people generally support the overall direction \nof transparency.\n  I am especially concerned with how this bill would eliminate \nmechanisms for enforcement by removing a provision requiring businesses \nto provide documentation of compliance. It means that it would be \nessentially impossible for businesses to be accountable for whether \nthey are even complying with regulations. It would make these \nregulations in paper only, in name only. There would be no meaningful \nenforcement mechanism. If this bill were to become law, which it won't, \nit would effectively gut those transparency requirements.\n  The bill also prohibits civil lawsuits against businesses that \nattempt to deceive customers or circumvent the labeling process. If \ncompanies are willingly lying about what is in their products, in the \ncalories and the nutritional content, of course, they should be liable \nfor that--of course.\n  Should a company intentionally mislead with confusing labels, \ncustomers need a way to fight back. Instead, this bill calls for \ncomplete indemnity, and makes any labeling initiative meaningless \nbecause there is simply no reason to comply.\n  This bill allows restaurants to essentially invent their own \nnutritional information by using deceptive serving sizes and hide that \ninformation in bathrooms or on walls where consumers won't even see it, \nand not put it online or only put it online and not at the restaurant.\n  At the same time, if somehow customers are able to discern that an \nestablishment is lying, it strips away the enforcement mechanism and \ncivil liability from that.\n  What a colossal waste of time for the United States Congress to \ndescend to the level of whether calories should be displayed in \nbathrooms, or on walls, or on menus in restaurants with more than 20 \nchains, when this Nation is in crisis and needs a responsible Congress \nto balance the budget and needs a responsible Congress to secure our \nborders and replace our broken immigration system with one that works.\n  It needs a responsible Congress to ensure the safety and security of \nthe American people, it needs a responsible Congress to find a \nsustainable way to invest in infrastructure and growth, and it does not \nneed a Congress to micromanage the font size of menus.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), a member of the Education and the Workforce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is just another example of excessive burdens placed \non small businesses from Federal regulations.\n\n[[Page H726]]\n\n  The proposed menu labeling requirements by the FDA, which come from a \nprovision of ObamaCare, will require restaurants, grocery stores, gas \nstations, and even movie theaters and miniature golf courses to list \nthe number of calories in food and drinks they sell.\n  Thousands of small businesses will have to absorb the cost of \nproviding new menu displays and calorie information. As a former small \nbusiness owner, I can tell you this is money small businesses cannot \nafford.\n  Ultimately, the group that will pay the price for these new \nregulations is the American consumer through increased food and drink \ncosts at their local restaurants and grocery stores.\n  Several large chain stores have welcomed these new regulations. I \nwonder why. They know that their small business competitors can't \nafford to purchase new menus and signs, placing them at a disadvantage \nto the larger chain companies.\n  I find it ironic that this administration that champions itself a \nsmall business advocate, continues to place additional burdens on small \nbusinesses at the advantage of larger corporations.\n  H.R. 2017, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015 remedies \nthis glaring conflict and removes the unnecessary and expensive red \ntape so small business owners can continue to compete and grow our \neconomy.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support small businesses by supporting \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  First of all, none of what we are even talking about applies to small \nbusinesses.\n  I have friends that own restaurants in Colorado in Boulder and Fort \nCollins. I have a friend that has three restaurants and another one has \none restaurant. I actually used to own a part of a restaurant. I don't \nrecommend that business to anybody. It is a tough business. This bill \ndoesn't apply to any of those people. We are talking about businesses \nwith over 20 restaurants. We are talking about the big guys.\n  I think that is why, for instance, the National Restaurant \nAssociation isn't even in favor of this bill. They represent many of \nthe restaurants that feel that this is a step forward. They want their \ncustomers to know what is in their food because, guess what, when you \nknow what is in your food, you are more likely to dine out.\n  The fact that restaurants have surpassed grocery stores for meals \njust shows the importance of restaurants to the American people. People \nwant to know what is in their food. This bill would impede that. It is \nCongress micromanaging the fine print of a thoroughly vetted and \nnegotiated rulemaking process that has already been delayed 2 years--it \nis Congress delaying it another 2 years--saying somehow this issue of \nexactly where in restaurants it displays the calories is so important \nthat President Obama can't be trusted with it, we have to trust \nPresident Trump or President Clinton or President Sanders. That is what \nthis body is effectively saying. It is a colossal waste of this body's \ntime. It is time for Congress to focus on issues that matter to the \nAmerican people.\n  That is what I hear about. I think it is what my colleagues hear \nabout when we have townhalls when we are out and about in our \ndistricts. I haven't heard a single constituent--we are not even \ntalking one--who said that they want the number of calories on the menu \nitems to be harder to see or posted in less places at restaurants--\nzero. I have heard from literally zero constituents that they want \nthis.\n\n  I have heard from several that they like knowing what is in their \nfood. I think that most constituents--who I haven't heard from at all \non this issue--are just utterly dismayed that Congress is spending a \nday and a half even debating this. How bizarre this is when there are \nreal life bread and butter issues that they face--putting food on their \ntable, paying their rent, paying their college loans, replacing their \ncar that burnt out, making sure they don't lose their job, and having \nto work a second job to make ends meet and make their mortgage. That is \nwhat people are facing out there.\n  The fact that what this Congress is debating is so far removed from \nthat dinner table talk at a family's house is why this Congress has \nsuch a dismal approval rating, which will continue to get worse as long \nas we debate these kinds of bills.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen), a valuable member of the House Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I appreciate this \ntime.\n  Yes, this country does have major problems, and certainly regulation \nis one of them. In fact, I just spent over an hour and a half of my \ntime talking with the administrator of the EPA about the economic \nimpact of that agency.\n  This is just another example of this government reaching out to \nrequire businesses to do things that, frankly, cost money and cost the \neconomy. Every American deserves the opportunity at a good job, and we \nmust grow this economy. That is why I am speaking today in support of \nH.R. 2017, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.\n  This bill protects American small businesses from unnecessary costs \nand regulations, which, again, is the big problem we have with growing \nthe economy. Mainly those in the restaurant and food industries are \naffected by this, establishing one-size-fits-all nutritional disclosure \nrequirements.\n  As a small business owner for over 40 years, I know just how daunting \nnew regulations are. New regulations mean more money spent and \ncountless hours of compliance.\n  It is estimated that if this regulation is implemented, it could cost \nAmerican businesses $1 billion to comply and 500,000 hours of paper. \nThis is a serious issue. American small businesses do not have that \nkind of time, nor do they have that kind of money.\n  During a time of slow economic growth, we should not make it harder \nfor Americans to start and stay in business. As we have seen in just \nabout every industry, one-size-fits-all approaches do not work.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting H.R. 2017. This bill is common sense. It is in \nthe name.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, instead of trying to water down transparency and \npreventive health measures, we should be focusing on what we can \nactively do to make this country healthier, happier, and safer, like \ninvesting in child nutrition, an issue that has broad bipartisan \nsupport. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee passed a bipartisan rewrite of the Child Nutrition Act, and \nthere is widespread support for reauthorizing key child nutrition \npolicies, like the Summer Food Service Program, which really helps some \nof our most at-risk families ensure that kids are at school ready to \nlearn because they have had their nutritional needs met.\n  By some estimates, as few as 18 percent of students who are eligible \nfor free and reduced lunch during the school year also receive a summer \nmeal. We can do better. The time of year should never dictate whether \nor not a child goes hungry in this country.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators agree, and they have offered an \ninnovative solution to the issue in the bipartisan Child Nutrition \nReauthorization Act. The House and our Education and the Workforce \nCommittee should focus on issues like summer meals, which actually make \na difference for families, rather than trying to prevent calorie \ninformation from being displayed large enough or in the right place \nwhere people can actually see it. God forbid.\n  We also should be focusing on policies like the Farm to School \nProgram, which provide support for our local farmers and at the same \ntime give kids the healthy meals that they need.\n  Educating our next generation about eating well while simultaneously \nintroducing them to the values of farmers and growing food in our \nculture and on our land is a double win.\n  It would be great if Congress could roll up our sleeves and get to \nwork on issues that the American people care about, rather than \ndebating how to hide calorie information from consumers. We should be \ndiscussing how to make better nutritional information available to more \npeople, how to feed\n\n[[Page H727]]\n\nmore kids that go hungry, how to improve our public health, and, of \ncourse, the big issues that we actually hear about, securing our \nborders, making sure the American people are safe and secure, investing \nin infrastructure, and growing our economy. That is what this body \nshould be focused on.\n  I was told by my staff person that zero constituents of mine have \ncalled or written in asking me to support this bill. Three have written \nin opposed to this bill. The rest of them--792,000 of them--don't think \nwe should be debating this bill. They haven't opined on it, and they \ncontinue to grow disillusioned with a Congress that is debating for a \nday and a half how to best hide nutritional information from them \nrather than improve the quality of schools, make college more \naffordable, make sure that they can afford their mortgage, and do \nsomething about the fact that it is getting harder and harder to get by \nin our country every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, national standards are important. They create something \nthat consumers can recognize and can understand. Nutritional labeling \nstandards on menus promote consistency and increased transparency. \nStandards make compliance easier and less costly. By engaging \nstakeholders in dialogue, the FDA has tried to accommodate retailers \nthat will be affected by this bill, and worked to put this feedback \ninto the final bill.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Sadly, Members of this body have responded, instead, by preemptively \nintroducing legislation that would not only weaken the guidelines but \nwould delay them for 2 additional years on top of the 2 years that they \nhave already been delayed. This bill would create more confusion than \nit addresses. It undermines the effectiveness of the regulation by \nlimiting a consumer's recourse for action in civil court, and it does \nnot make consumers and the American people any healthier.\n  For all of these reasons and more, prominent healthcare groups across \nthe spectrum oppose this legislation, including the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Heart Association, the Association of State \nPublic Health Nutritionists, the American Public Health Association, \nthe National Physicians Alliance, the Public Health Institute, doctors, \nand public health advocates.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2017 as well. Menu labeling \nprovides the necessary information to make healthy choices when eating \nout. Easy access to accurate information about the foods we eat serves \nour Nation's public health.\n  By rejecting this rule, Congress will be sending the message to the \nrank and file on both sides of the aisle, who, hopefully, will join me \nin opposing this rule and in bringing this down, that Congress should \nhave priorities that the American people have in that we need to get \nCongress to work on dealing with the bread-and-butter issues that \nconcern American families every day of the week, every hour of the day.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up a bill to help prevent mass shootings \nby promoting research into the causes of gun violence, making it easier \nto identify and treat those most prone to committing heinous acts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Paulsen). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to bring down this rule \nand restore the faith of the American people and this institution and \ndefeat the previous question. Vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The simple truth is the faith of the American people does not hinge \nupon the fact that we will jail a chef for an inadvertent mistake made \nat a pizza restaurant.\n  Let me take just a few minutes to recap some of the history of the \nAffordable Care Act and, perhaps, a lesson in civics at the same time.\n  I am just a simple country doctor. My understanding of how a bill \nbecame law was, perhaps, relegated to the video ``Schoolhouse Rock!'' \nthat I saw many years ago as a child with how a bill becomes law: You \nare just a bill on Capitol Hill. You go to committee. You get out of \ncommittee. You come to the floor. You go to the Senate. You go to a \nconference committee. You come back. You get voted on, and you are on \nyour way. But, as Paul Harvey said, then there is ``the rest of the \nstory.''\n  So let's examine the process for a moment.\n  We have the Affordable Care Act. Here is a bill that was sort of \nbumped around on Capitol Hill for a little over a year's time. Finally, \nit did get passed into law. We had a section in the Affordable Care \nAct, section 4205. Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not recall which special \ninterest wanted section 4205 placed into the Affordable Care Act. I \nfeel fairly certain that there was a special interest that did want \nthis language in the bill, because the entirety of the Affordable Care \nAct was, essentially, written by one special interest or another. Yet \nhere is a section that was in the Affordable Care Act, that was duly \nvoted on by the House and the Senate, and that passed in March of 2010. \nI voted ``no''--let me be very clear on that--as did every Republican \nwho was in the House of Representatives at the time.\n  Section 4205 is not a terribly long section, and it is not terribly \ndifficult to read. Section 4205 goes on for, perhaps, four pages, and \nit talks about nutritional labeling. Nutritional labeling, in and of \nitself, is not a bad thing; but because of the way the law is written, \nafter its passage, it was then handed off to a Federal agency--a \nFederal agency that is composed not of elected Members of Congress, not \nof anyone who is directly accountable to any single American \nconstituent anywhere, but the Federal agency sits down and goes about \nthe work of interpreting what Congress intended when it passed the law \nand how we are going to make this work in and amongst all of the other \nFederal rulings and regulations that are out there.\n  The Food and Drug Administration sat down to go about the task of \nwriting the rules and regulations that would govern this one section of \nthe Affordable Care Act--this four-page section in the Affordable Care \nAct. They, indeed, published their work in the Federal Register on \nMonday, December 1, 2014. Since we are talking about font size anyway, \nit is 100 pages of very small font writing, three columns per page; so \nthere is a lot of stuff here--it is pretty dense.\n  You have heard me mention that I am concerned about the fact that a \nhidden, inadvertent addition of a single slice of pepperoni on a pizza \ncould send someone to jail for a year. That, actually, is not covered \nin the remarks in the Federal Register; so let me save people some time \nif they want to read about where the penalties arise. The penalties \narise because, as a consequence of the language in the Federal \nRegister, a law known as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is \namended as a result of this work.\n  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, section 403, reads:\n\n       A food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is \n     false or misleading in any particular.\n\n  That is pretty broad.\n  Now, if the food is misbranded, that then invokes a second part under \nthe ``prohibited acts'' in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n  Under section 331:\n\n       The following acts and the causing thereof are prohibitive: \n     the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate \n     commerce of any food, drug, device, tobacco product, or \n     cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded.\n\n  We go back to the word ``misbranded.''\n\n       A food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is \n     false or misleading in any particular.\n\n  Now we come to a food that has been misbranded and the penalty for \nsuch an act when we get to the section of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act, section 303, under Penalties:\n\n       (a) Violation of section 331 of this title:\n       Any person who violates a provision of section 331 of this \n     title shall be imprisoned for not more than 1 year or fined \n     not more than $1,000 or both.\n\n  Therein, Mr. Speaker, is the problem with the Affordable Care Act, as \nwritten and then interpreted and as it applies to existing law in the \nUnited States Code.\n\n[[Page H728]]\n\n  I would think that menu labeling, as a matter of course, is a \nmarketing aspect. If you know that your restaurant is putting out food \nlabeling that is accurate and upon which you can depend, great, as I \nmay be more likely to go to such a facility; but, there, it is a \nvoluntary choice. It goes from voluntary to compulsory under the \nlanguage of the Affordable Care Act. Therein is the problem. That is \nthe problem that Representative McMorris Rodgers sought to correct of \nthe inadvertent addition of a single food item in food that is prepared \nin a restaurant that has more than 20 facilities.\n\n  Think of a name brand pizza place. You may have a local franchise in \nyour town. If you go there on a Friday night and if the calorie count \nis not identical to what has been posted on the menu board and someone \nchecks, that chef could be imprisoned for a year. That is the reason \nthat, indeed, constituents have written and that restaurant owners have \nwritten. They asked Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, and she responded to their \nrequests, and that is why we have a bill in front of us today.\n  The rule that is under consideration right now provides for the \nconsideration of an important fix to a harmfully crafted law and to a \npoorly written regulation.\n  I applaud my fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers for her work and for doing all she could to bring all \nstakeholders together to craft a workable compromise.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and \n``yes'' on the underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 611 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3926) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \n     better understanding of the epidemic of gun violence, and for \n     other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3926.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H729]]\n\n  I am pleased to speak in support of H.R. 3442, the Debt Management \nand Fiscal Responsibility Act. I would also like to thank Mr. Marchant \nof Texas for his leadership on this legislation.\n  H.R. 3442 was considered by the Committee on Ways and Means in \nSeptember of 2015, and it was passed with strong support. It is also \nhighly relevant.\n  I have just come from our second hearing on the 2017 budget. Anything \nwe can do to add clarity and stability to our budget and debt process \nis extremely helpful. The amount of debt this country currently owes is \nstaggering--$19 trillion and growing. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the debt will reach $29 trillion in 2026.\n  Let's be clear about why this is happening. It is not because \nAmericans aren't taxed enough; it is because Washington has a spending \nproblem. As we look to the future, revenues will remain half a \npercentage point above their historical average as a share of the \neconomy. Meanwhile, spending will rise from 21 percent of the share of \nthe economy today to 23 percent in 2026, both of which are far above \nthe historical average of 19.9 percent.\n  When Republicans took the House in 2010, this government borrowed 40 \ncents for every dollar it spent, and, today, it is 14 cents; but that \nis not good enough, because, under the current law baseline, it will go \nup to 21 cents per dollar in 2026. At this rate, if left unchecked, \ndeficits will rise from over $500 billion this year to nearly $1.4 \ntrillion in 2026. Congress needs to address this and consider real \nsolutions to lowering the debt and bringing sustainability to our \nFederal Government. We can't do that if we don't have a debt management \nsystem that is consistent, transparent, and accountable.\n  The Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act would create a \nsystem that allows Congress to make informed decisions about the debt \nceiling and consider changes before it becomes a crisis.\n  This bill would require the Secretary of the Treasury to report to \nCongress before the statutory debt limit ceiling is hit so that \nlegislators have the information they need when considering the debt \nlimit. That reporting would include the current State of the national \ndebt as well as future debt projections and the administration's plans \nto meet future obligations.\n  The Secretary would also report proposals of the President's on how \nto reduce the debt in the short, medium, and long term and any \nproposals to improve the debt-to-GDP ratio.\n  Finally, the administration would have to submit a progress report if \nit requests multiple debt limit increases so that Congress and the \nAmerican people can finally get information about the progress that is \nbeing made.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  This legislation will also make the Secretary's reports available \nonline so everyone in America can access this important information.\n  We are at a time when serious decisions must be made about how to \ngrow the economy and stop the increase in the national debt. We can't \ndo that if we don't have the necessary information. So this means that \nwe need to be on the same page about the drivers of our debt and to \nhave an open discussion about our intention to reduce the debt.\n  This bill would take a process that has become, I think, chaotic and \ndifficult for everyone and instead create a system--a good, smart, open \nsystem--that provides a consistent framework.\n  As others have said, the national debt is a shared responsibility, \nand we need to focus on ways to address it and move forward sensibly. \nThe current path we are on just isn't sustainable. It will require all \nof us, both in the legislative and executive branch, to work together \nto find solutions.\n  The Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act is an important \nstep in improving this process. It not only provides clarity and \ntransparency, but it also creates accountability and establishes a \nframework to discuss options and ideas on how to reduce this national \ndebt.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The chairman said this bill came out with strong support and it is \nrelevant. Now, the vote in the committee--this was many, many months \nago--was strictly partisan, and this bill is really a diversion. It was \nmarked up at the same time as that Pay China First Act. Does anybody \nremember that irresponsible legislation that came to the floor that was \npassed by the Republicans and died the death legislatively it deserved?\n  So here we are with this bill, part of a two-package bill, that also \nis going nowhere. It is worse than that, because it is really a \ndiversion, a diversion from what we really should be talking about. It \nrequires the Treasury Department to provide to Congress information on \nthe debt limit that we already receive, distracting from Republicans' \nrepeated recklessness about default and reinforcing the false belief \nthat the debt limit is a tool for managing the debt.\n  House Republicans refused to invite OMB Director Shaun Donovan to \nCapitol Hill this week to testify on the President's budget--an \nunprecedented action. We asked this morning in the Ways and Means \nCommittee: Why did neither the House nor the Senate controlled by \nRepublicans invite the OMB Director? Well, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee was there at the time and said something like: We don't have \ntime.\n  That is really shameful. We are debating this bill together, which \nwould require the Treasury Secretary to provide a report and come \ntestify before Congress on the very debt reduction proposals they are \nrefusing to hear about now, including from the Budget Director. If \nnothing else, Republicans are proving they are consistent with their \ninconsistency.\n  If we were to request from Treasury a new report related to the debt \nlimit, it should focus on the dire consequences of default. It should \nprovide detailed information on the veterans who would not get the \nbenefits they earned. It should tell how many doctors and hospitals who \ntreat Medicare patients won't be paid for care they already provided. \nIt should enumerate the Pell grants we will not pay to students who \nrely on them to pay for college. And it should explain and enumerate \nthe catastrophic consequences of default to our economy.\n  That is the kind of information Congress might need the next time we \ndebate the debt limit if Republicans once again propose default instead \nof responsible action. Instead, Republicans are insisting on a report \nthat would distract from the danger of default and do nothing to help \nreduce the debt.\n  If the real goal is debt reduction, as I said, Republicans should \nwelcome OMB Director Donovan to explain the administration's ideas, and \nthen they should sit down with Democrats and take bipartisan action \nnow, as we did during the Clinton administration, when bipartisan \nlegislation generated record budget surpluses.\n  So the Republicans, I guess, are trying to divert the focus from \ntheir inability to take action to reduce the deficit and instead blame \nTreasury and the administration.\n  The administration has issued a Statement of Administration Policy. \nThey indicate, if the President were presented with H.R. 3442, his \nadvisers would recommend he veto this bill.\n  Let me close by just saying how unfortunate it is to bring up this \neffort to obscure the problem instead of acting on legislation that is \nso badly needed, including addressing inversions that are going on one \nafter another in this country. This, I think, demonstrates the total \nfailure of Republicans to face up to what we are now facing. We should \nbe acting on that instead of this bill.\n  Well, this is going to have the same fate as the Pay China First Act, \nsuch a terrible mistake it was. It is going nowhere. It will be \nstrictly partisan.\n  So I say to the Republicans in this House, you talk about common \nground; instead you bring forth something that essentially is a sham, \nand you can't stand together on what is essentially a sham.\n  Mr. Pascrell, a distinguished member of our committee, at this point \nwill control the remainder of the time on our side.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of New York). The gentleman from New \nJersey is recognized.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member and the\n\n[[Page H730]]\n\nchairman and, of course, my good friend from Texas (Mr. Marchant).\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This week, the President sent his fiscal year 2017 budget to Congress \nand released it to the American people. His budget included numerous \nproposals to reduce the deficit by $2.9 trillion and grow our economy. \nIn fact, under President Obama's leadership, we have seen deficits \nshrink to stark lows, the smallest it has been in 7 years.\n  However, the chairman of the House Budget Committee has refused to \nhold a hearing on the President's budget with the Office of Management \nand Budget. This is the first time in 40 years that the President's \nbudget will not be granted a hearing. We separate the powers, but we \nnever separate respect.\n  Ignoring the fact that the President just sent deficit reduction \nproposals to Congress, rebuffing the OMB Director's request to testify, \nthe House has instead gone to consider legislation that requires the \nadministration to submit deficit reduction proposals and come and \ntestify about the debt limit and the deficit. Something doesn't quite \nadd up here.\n  I have tremendous respect for the sponsor of this bill. I think he is \nacting in good faith--I think it is logical, but I don't think it is \ntrue; not everything logical is true, you know--the author of the bill \nand my colleague on the Ways and Means Committee. But I believe this \nlegislation misses the forest for the trees.\n  When nearing the debt limit, the most important thing for Congress to \nknow is the catastrophic consequences of a default, yet this bill makes \nno mention of such a report. Instead, the legislation before us today \nasks the Treasury Department to report to Congress on things that \nCongress is most equipped to know. So they are asking us to hear what \nwe already should know.\n  The drivers and composition of future debt--that is us--and how the \nUnited States will meet its debt obligations, that is what is important \nto us and that is what is important to the American people.\n  Just a reminder of our constitutional roles: the Congress has the \nresponsibility to enact spending and revenue measures; the Treasury \nDepartment, part of the executive branch, executes the laws that we \nenact--not vice versa. They can't spend money that we haven't \nauthorized.\n  This bill would create new statutory requirements for the Treasury \nDepartment that are unnecessary and duplicative. The Secretary of the \nTreasury regularly corresponds with the Budget Committee about the debt \nlimit and provides regular updates about the status of our ability to \nmeet our debt obligations.\n  If I might add just at this point, we know what the Constitution says \nabout the debt limit. The 14th Amendment is very clear, section 4:\n  ``The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by \nlaw, including debts incurred for payment of pensions . . . shall not \nbe questioned.''\n  That is what the Constitution--you know, we refer to the ``we,'' \nconstitutionalists, only when it suits our purpose and supports our \narguments. I think we should look at the Constitution as a document \nwhich affects everybody at any time in any place within our borders.\n  Now, the Treasury provides us with the following: the budget, the \nMid-Session Review--in fact, it is online; the Daily Treasury \nStatement, online; the Monthly Treasury Statement, online; the Monthly \nStatement of the Public Debt, online; the Schedule of Federal Debt and \nthe Financial Report of the United States Government--all of which, I \nam saying again, are available on the Internet.\n  At the time this legislation was brought before the Ways and Means \nCommittee in September of 2015, Republicans were considering a default \non the full faith and credit of the United States. A default would have \ncatastrophic consequences, including a collapse of world credit markets \nand a destruction of job markets.\n  Should Congress fail to raise the debt limit, the Treasury will not \nbe able to pay veterans' benefits, pay doctors, pay hospitals, take \ncare of Medicare patients, pay salaries to our troops or Pell grants to \nstudents who need them. These are expenditures that have already been \nauthorized by the Congress, but if we don't act on the debt limit, we \nsimply can't pay them. We can't.\n  Fortunately, we were able to come together. We worked together, \nbelieve it or not. We suspended the debt limit through March of 2017. \nThe report triggered by this bill, H.R. 3442, will be wholly \nduplicative of information Congress has already received from the \nTreasury Department, the Office of Management and Budget. So much for \ngovernment efficiency.\n  Well, I believe, my good friend from Texas, what we can and should do \nis come together in a bipartisan manner on a budget--what we can and we \nshould do. But I believe that we will instead see a deeply partisan and \nideological budget for my good friends on the other side that has no \nchance of garnering any Democratic support. I hope that is not the \nmotivation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I would like to thank the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee \nfor his consideration and his speaking on the bill today and commend my \ncolleague from New Jersey. We had a very lively discussion about this \nbill in the Rules Committee. Over the years, my colleague and I have \nbeen able to disagree very agreeably, and I trust that today will \ncontinue in that spirit.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I introduced the Debt Management and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act because Congress and the administration need to \nfocus on finding debt reduction solutions.\n  There is rarely a time that I appear in my district at a townhall \nmeeting or even a gathering of just a few people where the subject of \nthe debt of the United States of America is not the focal point of the \ndiscussion. I never go through a public meeting where someone doesn't \nraise their hand and say: What is Congress doing about the national \ndebt?\n  When we began to contemplate this bill a couple years ago, we began \nto think about how we could put into law a process where Congress would \nnot solve the debt problem, but we would begin a process where the \ncommittees of jurisdiction would have a full report from the Treasury \nand the Secretary of the Treasury about where we were with the debt and \nthe plans of the administration and what they would do to reduce that \ndebt.\n  When this bill was passed out of the Committee on Ways and Means in \nSeptember, the national debt was $18.1 trillion. Now it is over $19 \ntrillion. Debt held by the public is now roughly 74 percent of the \neconomy's annual output. It is also a higher percentage than at any \npoint in American history except for a very brief period around World \nWar II. If current law remains unchanged, the Congressional Budget \nOffice predicts that Federal debt held by the public will exceed 100 \npercent of GDP in 25 years. This is unsustainable.\n  Everyone knows that the national debt is increasing, but the existing \nstrategy for dealing with the debt limit only fuels conflict and fiscal \nirresponsibility. This creates disruption and uncertainty, and it \nerodes the confidence in the American leadership and economy.\n  Five times in the last 5 years, the Treasury Department has had to \nemploy extraordinary measures to avoid reaching the debt limit. These \nmaneuvers are supposed to be a last resort. They were only employed six \nother times between the 1980s and 2011. Extraordinary measures have \nbecome the new normal, just like record levels of debt.\n  The goal of H.R. 3442 is to establish a new debt limit process that \nis more transparent, accountable, and timely. This legislation would \nallow Congress and the American people to take an early and accurate \nlook at the debt and the statutory debt limit before it is reached, not \nafter the press release that it has been reached is released.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Texas says he gets asked all \nthe time about the national debt.\n\n[[Page H731]]\n\nHe can give a very simple answer--because the Congress keeps spending \nmoney and not paying for it. That is how you incur debt; you buy things \nand you don't pay for them. They can be all sorts of things. They can \nbe Social Security, they can be Medicare, they can be battleships, they \ncan be health care, they can be roads, they can be bridges. If you \ndon't pay for them--it shouldn't be any surprise--you incur debt.\n  Who spends money in the United States of America? The Congress. Under \nthe Constitution, we are the ones who spend money. I say to my friend \nfrom Texas, he might also say, Well, when you create $800 billion-plus \nof new debt by cutting taxes and not paying for them, you have less \nrevenue, but you don't cut buying stuff, you have more debt. $800-plus \nbillion in December. I didn't vote for that bill because we didn't pay \nfor it.\n  Now, I have been in office a long time. It is easy and takes no \ncourage to cut taxes, no courage whatsoever. What takes courage is \nbuying things--and if people want them--saying, we need to pay for \nthem. We need to pay for them so our children don't pay for them, so \nour grandchildren don't pay for them because, guess what, they are \ngoing to have their challenges in their time, national security \nchallenges, natural disasters like Katrina or Sandy challenges, Ebola, \nAIDS, health crises. They are going to have to have resources, and we \nare spending them.\n  I have been here sometime, longer I think than the gentleman from \nTexas, longer than my friend from New Jersey. There is one person in \nAmerica who can stop spending in its tracks. I have been here 36 years. \nNo President in the 36 years that I have served has had a veto \noverridden of a bill that spent too much money. Not one. Not one \nRepublican President, not one Democratic President. So a President can \nstop spending in its tracks.\n  Under Ronald Reagan, we increased the national debt 189 percent. It \nwas less than a trillion dollars when I came to the Congress of the \nUnited States. It was increased under Ronald Reagan 189 percent, the \nlargest of any President.\n  Under George Bush, in 4 years, it was increased 55 percent; under \nBill Clinton, in 8 years, 36 percent. But guess what, during the last 4 \nyears, we had a balanced budget, the only time in the lifetime of \nanybody in this body that we have had 4 years of balanced budgets.\n  Now, my Republican friends will say, well, we were in charge of the \nCongress. For the last 6 years you were. But you were in charge of the \nHouse, the Senate, and the Presidency under George W. Bush, and the \nbudget deficit was increased 87 percent.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, the President says he is going to veto this \nbill, but the irony is--and the chairman sits on the floor--the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget has submitted a budget \non behalf of the administration to respond exactly to the questions \nthat this bill wants to ask.\n  For the first time in 41 years, the administration has been refused \nthe opportunity to testify, which The Washington Post called, \ngratuitously, contemptuous. And then my friends have the audacity to \nbring a bill on the floor in the same week and ask the Secretary of the \nTreasury to come down and testify, talk about the debt when we know \ndarn well why the debt is what it is.\n  It is our responsibility, because we incur it, to make sure that we \npay our debt. That is our moral responsibility, as well as our \nconstitutional responsibility. This is politics at its most \ncontemptuous level. It is to pretend that somehow the President is \nresponsible.\n  My friends, we ought to reject this bill not because of the bill \nitself, but we get this information, as has been so often said. We \nalready get this information. You don't need the Secretary of the \nTreasury to come down here and give it to us. He testifies before the \nCommittee on Ways and Means; he testifies before other committees.\n  Let's reject this bill because it is phony, not because substantively \nwe don't need this information. We have it. It is redundant. It does \nwhat my friends on the Republican side so often say, we ought to not \nhave redundant things.\n  Mr. Chair, I appreciate the fact that my time has expired. This bill \nought to expire with it.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Black), who serves on the Committee on Ways and Means \nand the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, our Nation is $19 trillion in debt. That is more than \n$58,000 for every man, woman, and child. Now, Tennesseeans know that \nmounting debt burden in Washington is not just an economic concern.\n  This is a national security issue and it is a moral issue, one that \nthe President is willfully choosing to ignore. His latest budget would \ncause our debt to spike to more than $27 trillion over the next 10 \nyears, and when the government maxes out its credit cards to pay for \nthis runaway spending, the Obama administration routinely insists on a \nso-called clean debt limit hike, a blank check with no strings \nattached.\n  Mr. Chair, our constituents deserve better than that. They expect the \nCongress would assert its role as a coequal branch of government and \nleverage these opportunities to demand real cuts and to engage the \nadministration in an honest conversation about Washington's spending \naddiction.\n  And that is why I support the Debt Management and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act. This commonsense piece of legislation would require \nthat the administration come to here--yes, the people's House--before \nany potential debt limit increase and testify about the drivers of our \ndebt and a plan to fix it. The Treasury Department would then be \nrequired to post this information on their Web site so that the \nAmerican people can see the facts for themselves. After all, it is \ntheir money that we are spending.\n  Mr. Chair, this is about injecting some basic accountability into a \nbudgeting process. Taxpayers and the next generation of Americans who \nwill inherit this debt burden that we are accumulating today are owed \nat least that much.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Debt Management and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. How much time is remaining, Mr. Chair?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I just want to remind the young lady from \nthe other side of the aisle, my good friend, that everything she has \nasked for is pertinent and important, but it is already on the \nInternet.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), a \ndistinguished member of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Amnesia. Amnesia, Mr. Chair, once again pervades this \nRepublican Conference. Where were these great deficit hawks 2 months \nago when they had an opportunity to vote on increasing the national \ndebt? They were there raising their hand ``aye'' in favor of hiking the \nnational debt. Today, they come forward with the audacity to say let's \nsolve the runaway national debt problem; we want another government \nreport to do it.\n  Yes, at Christmastime, these deficit hawks went on a spending spree \nright here in this House. Not a spending spree to provide more \neducational opportunity for our children, not a spending spree to \nprovide more medical research dollars for our scientists and \nphysicians, not a spending spree to do something about our crumbling \nroads or to build a competitive infrastructure, but a spending spree \nwith tax expenditures from the Tax Code to stuff every silk stocking \nthey could find. Anyone who had a powerful lobby, they were here to get \nan expanded or extended tax cut.\n  Here is what was said 2 months ago, and I quote:\n  ``Budgeting in this country has pretty much become a joke. Members of \nCongress give heartfelt speeches''--the same kind we are hearing \ntoday--``about being responsible. . . . And then time and time again, \nthey cast votes that add billions and even trillions of dollars to the \ndebt. The rampant hypocrisy is quite galling.''\n  ``How can lawmakers claim that their budget will achieve balance when \nthey just passed a deficit-financed tax deal that blows a big hole in \nthe budget?''\n\n[[Page H732]]\n\n  Those weren't the words of a Democrat. Those weren't the words of a \nprogressive institution. They were the words of Maya MacGuineas, the \npresident of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a \nbipartisan organization. On their board is Mitch Daniels, Alan Simpson, \nand a host of Republicans.\n  That final bill that they voted for 2 months ago added $830 billion \nto the national debt over the next 10 years, as they borrowed money \nfrom abroad to give it to Wall Street and other special interests. It \nwill cost us about $2 trillion over the next two decades.\n  One of the biggest items in that budget was a giveaway to Wall Street \nbanks, the same Wall Street banks that helped bring this country to its \nknees in the economic crisis. Yet they came in and they got a tax break \nin order to encourage shipping more jobs overseas, which is what that \nparticular tax break does.\n  They come back to us today, having added to the debt so much. Never \nseeing a tax break for a special interest that they didn't like--to \nborrow from Will Rogers--they come to us today and say give us a \nreport, give us another speech.\n  When we had the Treasury Secretary in front of our committee all \nmorning, our Republican chairman was candid. He was cordial, but he was \ncandid in saying that everything that the Treasury Secretary was \noffering was dead on arrival, would never see the light of day.\n  This is a wasted endeavor that ought to be rejected.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Roskam), the chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee of \nthe Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Marchant has gotten people's attention \nthis afternoon. I am really surprised at how lively and engaged our \nfriends are on the other side of the aisle.\n  So, it begs the question: What is so provocative about this bill? \nWhat is so provocative and incendiary? Apparently, having the \nadministration come with a plan, as it relates to the debt, is a \nprovocation.\n  I don't think our friends on the other side of the aisle have to take \nthe bait. In fact, the ranking member said it came out with only \nRepublican votes. If I were a Democrat, I wouldn't admit that it only \ncame out with Republican votes. I would be trying to claim credit for \nthis.\n  Why? Because I come from the State of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, let me \ntell you what happens when you avoid problems. The State of Illinois \nhas avoided problems year after year after year. My home State now has \na $100 billion unfunded pension liability. That is a fact. Illinois has \na crisis.\n  What Mr. Marchant is proposing is very simple and very clear. If this \nis provocative, I don't know how to deal with it. It requires the \nadministration to lay out a proposal to reduce the debt in the short \nterm: 1 to 2 years.\n  The criticism of the administration's current budget is that it never \nbalances. Ever. Think about that. Hello. Never. There is never a \nbalance.\n  So, what he is saying is they have got to come in and show how they \nare going to deal with this. Short-term, medium-term, understanding its \nrelationship debt to GDP; all of these things are so important.\n  We are told: Hey, go to the Internet. That is where your information \nis. No; what we need is for the administration to understand the \ninformation on the Internet--if that is where it is--and come in and \npresent it in a cogent and clear way.\n  Yes, Congress has the primary responsibility. Yes, the House \nRepublicans have articulated a view that says we can balance this, we \ncan deal with these programs, and we can deal with these cost drivers. \nWe have been met time again by a stiff arm from the President of the \nUnited States, who has now redefined the concept of balance. Balance \nused to mean one plus one equals two. Now the administration says that \nbalance is--what was their latest vernacular--long-term fiscal \nsustainability. That is ridiculous.\n  Representative Marchant needs to be congratulated. This is a great \nidea. We ought to be celebrating this. If I were a Democrat, I wouldn't \nadmit to voting against it.\n  I urge passage of the bill.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I just heard something from my good friend from Illinois that bears \nrepeating, which is to have the administration come and testify on \ntheir deficit plan.\n  The President's budget includes $2.9 trillion in deficit reduction. \nYou have refused a visit from the administration to discuss it. How is \nthat for provocation?\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Tom Price), chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Marchant, my good \nfriend, for introducing this legislation.\n  Before I address the legislation, I want to talk very briefly about \nthe President's budget.\n  The President has, indeed, introduced a budget. It raises over $3 \ntrillion over a 10-year period of time. It increases spending. It \nincreases the interest payments on the debt so that they approach $1 \ntrillion at the end of 10 years.\n  We thought it was appropriate to save the President the embarrassment \nof bringing him before our committee, because when you put that budget \non the floor, which we have done in the past, the President gets two \nvotes from his own party. Just two. So we thought it was appropriate to \nsave the President that embarrassment.\n  I want to commend my friend, Mr. Marchant from Texas, for introducing \nthis legislation, H.R. 3442, today. This is really a simple and \nstraightforward piece of legislation. The bill enhances accountability, \nreduces potentially disruptive risks to our economy, and would help \nCongress reach real debt reduction solutions that the American people \nso clearly desire and deserve.\n  Under this act, as we approach any debt limit, the administration \nwould have to appear before Congress and provide testimony on what is \ndriving that national debt so that we know that they actually \nappreciate the drivers of that debt; relate a clear, unambiguous series \nof proposals on deficit and debt reduction, which they don't do--by the \nway, the President's budget never balances--and update Congress on \nprogress being made toward debt reduction, which is a principle that we \nbelieve and the American people believe is important, but, apparently, \nthis administration does not.\n  As Budget chairman, I can tell you there is nothing more troubling \nthan the ever-increasing spending that happens around here, especially \nin the automatic programs. That is why I am heartened that this bill \nwould require the administration to project the fiscal health and the \nlong-term sustainability of major programs like Medicare and Social \nSecurity, that, by the way, are going broke unless something is done.\n  This bill will help further educate the American people on the dire \nneed to save and strengthen and secure these programs. Our budget--the \nproposal that we put forward--has proposed positive solutions. We need \nthe administration to be a cooperative partner in getting solutions \nenacted. Forcing them to confront these challenges will be helpful. \nThis bill will do that.\n  It is pretty simple, Mr. Chairman. House Republicans have been \nproposing action our Nation needs to take in order to get spending \nunder control and reduce our debt. It seems only fitting and proper \nthat the administration should have to do the same. That is why I am \nurging a ``yes'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I just heard something very interesting. When I hear \nthings interesting, I like to repeat them.\n  So, we are going to save the President the embarrassment. The ranking \nmember, Sandy Levin, mentioned that. He said today that is less than a \nlame excuse: to save the President embarrassment.\n  You should be embarrassed balancing the budget on the money from the \nAffordable Care Act, which you have recommended we destroy. How is that \nfor embarrassment?\n\n[[Page H733]]\n\n  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), a \ndistinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, the issue of the Nation's deficit is a \nreal concern, but let's be honest: the issue of the country's deficits \nare of greater concern to our constituents at home than they appear \nto be to many people in this Chamber.\n\n  Our constituents understand and support some government spending is \nnecessary to keep our country going strong. Our constituents understand \nthat some debt is needed. Like government, they incur debts, too: a \nmortgage, a car loan, a student loan, credit card debt, a small \nbusiness loan. They also get alarmed when they see deficits that are \ntoo high.\n  So, that is why it is the job of Congress and the President to \ndevelop a budget and raise and spend the necessary revenue to operate \nthe government while also meeting the demands of our constituents.\n  This week, President Obama submitted his budget plan to the Congress \nfor review. Within that budget is a plan to sensibly cut the Nation's \ndeficit by $2.9 trillion.\n  I think there are some good ideas in the budget. Maybe others \ndisagree. But Congress should at least discuss it. Yet, earlier this \nweek, they refused to allow the White House to come to Congress and \ndiscuss the budget and the deficit.\n  We are spending time and taxpayer money to debate a bill to mandate \nthe White House come to Congress and discuss the budget and the deficit \nwhen, earlier this week, these same folks refused to allow the White \nHouse to come to Congress and discuss the budget and the deficit.\n  It is a telling action by my Republican colleagues, as they want to \nlook like defenders of the taxpayers' money by demanding answers on how \nto reduce the deficit--which is a good thing--while blocking the \nability for us to actually get any answers on how to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Because they refuse to invite the White House Budget Director to \ndiscuss the budget, let me share with you a few things that White House \nofficials would have said if they were invited to speak before the \nCongress on the budget and the deficit.\n  Do you remember the $800 billion TARP funds paid to the Nation's \nlargest banks by the Bush administration? The banks have repaid the \nmoney--with interest--under President Obama.\n  Those trillion-dollar annual deficits that started under President \nBush's administration, in part due to the TARP fund and in part due to \nthe Republican recession of 2007-2009, are gone.\n  More Americans are working now than ever in the history of the United \nStates, with private businesses adding over 14 million jobs under the \npolicies of Democrats. One of those policies was supporting the U.S. \nauto industry. When my Republican friends wanted to destroy and \nbankrupt Detroit, Democrats voted to save the U.S. auto industry. \nToday, the American car industry is on fire and has added over 645,000 \nAmerican jobs since 2009.\n  Now, Republicans will argue they are pushing forward to eliminate \nannual deficits and not increase the debt. But that simply is not true. \nThe Republican budget, while theoretically balancing in 10 years, \nincreases the national debt by $3 trillion in that time period, which \nnecessitates an increase in the debt ceiling. Therefore, Republicans, \ndespite their claims and their rhetoric, have to increase the debt \nceiling or risk the U.S. being in default.\n  So, Republicans claiming they won't raise the debt ceiling are either \nnot being honest about raising the debt ceiling, not being honest about \ntheir budget, or they want the U.S. to not pay its bills and be in \ndefault. Which is it?\n  Additionally, the Republican budget eliminates $5.5 trillion in \nspending on programs like student loans, unemployment insurance, child \nsupport programs, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. At least they detail these cuts, such as ending Medicare \nas you know it.\n  Even more sinister, their budget--which every one of them brags about \nsupporting--includes $1.1 trillion in spending cuts that are not even \ndetailed, except to say they will go after retirement programs for \nFederal employees, military personnel, and veterans. They very cleverly \nhid those cuts in a footnote in their budget.\n  I am wondering on what page of their phony budget they create \nunicorns, because everything else in their so-called budget is one big, \ngiant fairy tale.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, let's not fool the American people. They know what \nexactly is going on here.\n  They want to have it both ways: they want to call the White House on \nthe carpet and say they want to discuss the Nation's deficit, and, at \nthe same time, this very week, give the Budget Director an invitation \nto come before the Congress and talk about the budget and the deficit.\n  The American people are asking: What is going on? They know exactly \nwhat you are doing. Once again, you are using rhetoric, but not \naddressing the real problems of everyday Americans.\n  Mr. Chairman, we need to get down to the American people's business \nand get the answers we need and that they demand.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I think a careful review of the bill will reflect that this bill's \neffective date will be 2017.\n  While I cannot say with any certainty who the President will be or \nwhich party it will be, I would remind the House that this bill puts \nthe responsibility on the administration, regardless of which party \nholds the White House, and it is an ongoing responsibility that will \nfurther the discussion and collaborative nature of our solutions to \nthis debt.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat).\n  Mr. BRAT. I thank the gentleman from Texas very much.\n  Mr. Chair, I had some prepared remarks, but the opposition just \nbrought up rhetoric and unicorns in the same sentence, and so I feel \nobliged to respond with a couple of preliminary remarks. I will just \nmake four.\n  The rhetoric is easy to come by in this city, but the facts are very \nclear. I have never seen a Democrat budget that has been smaller than a \nRepublican budget. Every year they turn in a budget that is \nsignificantly bigger than ours. That is just fact number one.\n  Fact number two, our budget balances in 10 years. I have never seen, \nin my history here, a Democrat budget that balances in any time \nhorizon--and we are talking about the debt.\n  Point number three, we are talking about the President and his \ncommitment to fiscal sanity. I have never heard the current President \nmention our unfunded liability problem, which is in the $100 trillion \nrange. That is the most serious number and economic challenge our \ncountry faces. I have never heard our President bring that up as a \nproblem to solve.\n  And finally, when it comes to fiscal restraint on the other side, the \nwinner of the New Hampshire primary on the opposition side is calling \nfor 90 percent tax rates and free everything.\n  So, when it comes to rhetoric, those are just four simple facts I \noffer to the other side when it comes to fiscal responsibility.\n  I want to move forward and commend Representative Marchant for \nputting this bill forward. This country desperately needs to have an \nhonest conversation about our fiscal problems, the full range, from the \ndebt of $19 trillion to the unfunded liabilities at $100 trillion. \nTotal outstanding public debt exceeds $19 trillion. We just passed that \nthis week or so. The unfunded liabilities are multiples of that.\n  Deficits are exploding, in the $500 billion range per year. Deficits \nby 2026 will be about $1 trillion a year. That will bring the total \ndebt to about $30 trillion in a decade. All of this is on the back of \nour children. If we continue on the path of the status quo, we will end \nin a debt crisis as China is in now.\n  That is why I support this bill, because it advances the dialogue \nexactly when Presidential leadership is most needed, when the debt \nlimit looms. Having leadership from a responsible President could make \na world of difference.\n\n[[Page H734]]\n\n  Of course, talking isn't the end goal. Talk must spur action. These \nproblems get harder to solve the longer we wait.\n  According to CBO's 2015 long-term budget outlook, if we wait 10 \nyears, the costs will be nearly one-third greater as a percentage of \nGDP, and even larger in dollar terms. That is why it is so important we \naddress this critical issue head-on now.\n  It is also getting harder to address the drivers of debt. Annual \nspending bills cover only 30 percent of Federal spending, and it will \nbe 22 percent in 10 years.\n  The rest of Federal spending is on autopilot. Back in 1966, autopilot \nconsumed 34 percent of Federal revenues. By 2026, autopilot spending is \non track to be 98.7 percent of revenue in a vastly larger economy.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BRAT. Some say it is all demographics. That is a narrow view. As \nsociety changes, our institutions have to keep up. That is what we are \ntrying to do in this bill.\n  We cannot continue to ignore the looming fiscal debt crisis until it \nbecomes catastrophic. Let's address it now while we can still make \nmeaningful reforms. I thank Congressman Marchant for taking steps in \nthat direction by proposing this bill.\n  Let's come together, pass this bill, and continue with the reforms \nthat will make the economic outlook for our children and for future \ngenerations greater and brighter. Our fellow citizens expect no less.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 6 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), who is a member--a distinguished member, \nat that--of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. I want to thank the gentleman from \nNew Jersey for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3442, and I do so because \nthe bill imposes burdens on Treasury that are totally unnecessary and \nwill do absolutely nothing to improve our national debt.\n  It is Congress that makes spending and revenue decisions, and it is \nCongress' responsibility to raise the debt limit, when needed, to \nenable Treasury to fulfill the debt obligations that we have made. If \nyou owe, you pay.\n  Rather than wasting our time on a redundant report by Treasury that \ndoes nothing to grow the economy, we should focus our time on creating \njobs and strengthening families.\n  I can think of many things that we could be talking about: raising \nthe minimum wage, creating summer jobs for youth, creating jobs through \ninfrastructure development, supporting businesses to hire more workers, \nand increasing grant aid to families so that they can afford college.\n  Although our economy has demonstrated some solid labor market trends, \nwe know that there are still individuals who are not benefiting from \nthe tremendous economic recovery that we are experiencing.\n  For example, the University of Illinois at Chicago just completed a \nstudy that showed that half the African American males in the city of \nChicago between the ages of 20-24 are not working and not in school. \nAnd we could be using this time--our time--to figure out ways to bring \nthese individuals into the labor market so that they become productive \ncitizens, rather than reviewing another report that tells us nothing \nthat we don't already know.\n  So I oppose the legislation not because it is such bad legislation, \nbut it is just a waste of our time, energy, and effort. We need to be \nfiguring out ways to solve problems.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci), one of my colleagues on the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  Mr. RENACCI. I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3442, the Debt \nManagement and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015.\n  This bill isn't about budgets. I have listened today. It is about a \nprocess, a process to keep our eye on the debt by all Members of \nCongress. Americans want us paying attention to our national debt.\n  Our collective debt has now surpassed $19 trillion, which is $58,000 \nper American. Sadly, these numbers are only a tip of the iceberg as \nthey don't include, as my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Brat) indicated, \ntens of trillions of dollars of unfunded liabilities stemming from some \nof our entitlement programs.\n\n  To me, this is inexcusable. We need an accurate accounting of our \ncountry's financial health, and this legislation is a sorely needed \nfirst step only, a first step to start the dialogue in finding a \nsolution to this growing problem.\n  H.R. 3442 will require the Secretary of the Treasury to provide a \nreport to Congress prior to the debt reaching the statutory limit. The \nreport must include historic, current, and projected levels of debt, \nthe drivers and composition of future debt, and how the United States \nwill meet the debt obligations if the debt limit is raised.\n  As someone who has spent nearly 30 years in the business world, I \nknow the importance of leveraging debt to grow a business and, in this \ncase, to move the government forward. I understand that sometimes we \nhave to borrow. But if I showed up to a bank without an explanation and \nplan to repay my obligations, I would be laughed out of the building. \nIf I told the bank, ``The financial statements are on the Internet,'' \n``I have sent them to you already,'' or, ``You already have them,'' the \nlaughing would stop and the debt would be called.\n  Why should raising the national debt limit be any different? The \nTreasury should have to present a plan to Congress.\n  This straightforward legislation is not divisive. It will apply to \nboth Democrat and Republican administrations. It will not even affect \nthe current administration.\n  Let me be very clear. Our debt is not a Democrat or Republican \nproblem. This is an American problem.\n  As I travel throughout my district in Ohio, I hear from my \nconstituents regarding their concerns about the direction of our \ncountry and what we are leaving our children and grandchildren. \nCongress must work together to put our national debt back on a \nsustainable path. That is what this legislation starts the process of \ndoing.\n  I would like to commend Mr. Marchant for his leadership on this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Woodall).\n  Mr. WOODALL. I thank my friend from Texas for bringing this bill to \nthe House.\n  I confess, Mr. Chairman, I have served on the Budget Committee since \nI arrived in this House 5 years ago, and I have listened to testimony \non every single budget the President has submitted to this Congress. \nAmong all the calls of the redundancy of this legislation, I want to \njust encourage my colleagues to read the five short pages that are this \nbill. It says this:\n\n       Not more than 60 days and not less than 21 days before the \n     debt ceiling is to be raised, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall submit the following: a detailed explanation of \n     proposals of the President to reduce the public debt in the \n     short-term, which is the next fiscal year; the medium term, \n     the next 3 to 5 years; and the long term, the next 10 years.\n\n  Five years I have served in this institution; five budgets of this \nPresident I have looked at. Not one reduced the debt by one penny this \nyear, next year, 10 years from now, or 100 years from now. This is not \nredundant.\n  What Mr. Marchant is asking of not this President, but the next \nPresident, whoever he or she may be, is to not promise the American \npeople everything on their children's credit card, that if you are \ngoing to come to the American people and ask for a credit line increase \non America's credit card, you ought to offer at least some semblance of \na plan for paying the bill back.\n  I have heard the charge of hypocrisy here on the House floor. Again, \nI serve on the House Budget Committee. Every\n\n[[Page H735]]\n\nsingle year, this House, Republicans and Democrats, pass budgets that \nbalance. Every single year, this House, Republicans and Democrats, pass \nbudgets that plan not just to pay back a penny of debt, but all of the \ndebt.\n  We can't expect less from our next President. We have to expect more. \nRepublican or Democrat, the next President, before coming to ask for \nthe debt ceiling to be increased, should come with a plan for \neventually paying that debt back.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is embarrassing to me that a clean debt ceiling \nincrease is part of the national parlance. I have got seventh, eighth \nand ninth graders back home who know what a clean debt ceiling is.\n  We should never have a clean debt ceiling increase. We should never \nraise the American people's credit line without a plan for paying it \nback. Not once, Mr. Chairman, have we considered a bill on the floor of \nthis House that has the requirement that Mr. Marchant is proposing \ntoday.\n  The burden will fall on us to implement it, but leadership falls to \nthe White House as well. Don't come and ask the American people for \nmore money until you come with a plan for eventually balancing the \nbooks. That is not too much to ask, Mr. Chairman. In fact, it is too \nlittle to ask, but it is a fantastic first start.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman on the other side has no \nmore speakers, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, from a few speakers today on the other side, I have \nheard ``Apocalypse Now.'' Both sides of the aisle, I think, want to get \nto a day when we balance the budget. We did it several years in a row \nat the end of the Clinton administration.\n  I believe my friends on the other side of the aisle are well-\nintentioned in drafting this legislation. I believe they wanted to \nfocus attention on the ways to address our debt and deficit. I agree. I \nbelieve that instead of toying with default--because that sends a \nhorrible, horrible message to the world economy--we should do our job \nas Members and discuss real, long-term solutions to our budgetary \nchallenges.\n  In fact, I think my good friend from Texas would agree we had an \noutstanding discussion in the Rules Committee because I never heard \nthat discussion on the floor of the House. Maybe I missed it. I don't \nknow; did I miss it?\n  Our discretionary spending, which we use to make critical investments \nin the infrastructure, education, and laying a foundation for our \nNation's future for our kids and our grandkids' economic growth, that \ndiscretionary spending is at the lowest level since 1940. Even the \ngentleman from Virginia, who started to refer to it anyway, said a few \nmoments ago, only talked about 30 percent discretionary money. But it \nwas wrong what he said. We have not done anything to our insurance \nprograms or entitlements.\n  The Affordable Care Act here rears its head again, extending Medicare \nfor 12 more years. I think that is a pretty big deal in talking about \none of these mandatory costs that we have, 12 years more because of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  By the way, if you get rid of the Affordable Care Act, what are you \ngoing to do with the people who don't have insurance anymore? What are \nyou going to do about the 12 years we have extended for Medicare? \nPerhaps that is all in this phantom budget we have out there.\n  Cost increases moving forward will be driven by mandatory programs--\nyou know it, and I know it--like Social Security and Medicare, mostly \ndue to an aging population. We started to address this problem with the \nAffordable Care Act. We have a long ways to go.\n  Many Members of this body have reasonable proposals to address the \ngrowing cost of health care and Social Security on both sides of the \naisle. So I believe we would be better served working together and \ndebating together than sitting here today talking about another report \nthat tells us what we already know.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for the continued debate on the \nbill. This bill is very simple. The bill does not try to talk about the \npast. It doesn't try to address the Reagan administration or the \nClinton administration or the Bush administration or the Obama \nadministration.\n  It tries to look forward and say that the Secretary of the Treasury, \n21 to 60 days before he announces that we will reach the debt ceiling--\nin this case, next year it will be March of 2017, so about this time \nnext year--if this bill is made law, the Secretary of the Treasury will \nappear before the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance \nCommittee--they could meet jointly--and give a plan from the \nadministration on what the administration intends to do about the \nnational debt.\n  It is important to know what the intentions of the current \nadministration are about the national debt. The report will first \nprovide a detailed accounting of the state of the national debt. It \nwould include the composition and trajectory of the debt as well as the \nadministration's plans to meet the obligations in the event that \nCongress agrees to raise the debt.\n  Second, it would just say here is the administration's proposal to \nreduce the debt in the short term, the medium term, and the long term. \nThe answer from the administration may very well be we have no \nintention whatsoever of addressing the debt in the short term, the \nmedium term, or the long term. If that is what the Treasury Secretary \nwants to report to Congress, that could be his report.\n  Third, if the administration requests subsequent debt-limit \nincreases, the Secretary would be required to provide a progress report \non prior debt reduction proposals.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Treasury to put all these \ndocuments online so the American people can read the report for \nthemselves.\n  The Nation owes $19 trillion. The debt is growing every second. \nAddressing the debt is a shared responsibility, and we should use all \navailable tools to manage this responsibility.\n  This type of process is not new. In fact, today, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve is appearing before the Senate and earlier this week \nappeared before the House. Under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, it required \nthe Federal Reserve Chairman to appear before Congress to give a \nstatement on monetary policy. I don't think it is too much to ask for \none meeting a year for the Secretary of the Treasury to come to \nCongress and state his or her opinion and view about the national debt \nand the administration's plan on how it plans to reduce the debt.\n  In fact, this bill would be a simple, first step to addressing that \nproblem. I urge the House to pass this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Report before reaching debt limit.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except \nthose printed in part A of House Report 114-420. Each such amendment \nmay be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member \ndesignated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be \ndebatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and \ncontrolled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to \namendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the \nquestion.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, after line 3, insert the following:\n       ``(B) the historical levels of Federal revenue, including \n     corporate and individual Federal income taxes as a percent of \n     the gross domestic product;''.\n       Page 4, line 4, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(C)''.\n       Page 4, line 6, strike ``(C)'' and insert ``(D)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply asks that, in the \nspirit of this bill and the context of examining the debt, we take a \nlook at Federal revenue trends, which are a critical part of the \nconversation we are having. Specifically, this amendment asks Treasury \nto include in their report the historical levels of Federal revenue, \nincluding information on corporate and individual Federal income taxes.\n  While we may disagree on the merits of the underlying bill, I hope \nthat we can agree that it is important to have a complete picture of \nthe Federal budget when looking at debt and deficit issues. When we \nlook closer at our current revenue policies, a fuller picture emerges. \nThis picture could change our perspective on the need to cut programs \nthat Americans hold so high and, instead, raise questions about the \nneed to close loopholes that prevent us from investing in areas of the \nbudget that support the middle class and working families.\n  Here are a few reasons that we may want to consider changes to this \nconversation:\n  Corporations used to contribute $1 out of every $3 in Federal \nrevenue. Today, it is $1 out of every $10. At the same time, \ncorporations are more profitable than almost ever before.\n  American taxpayers are losing about $90 billion every year due to \noffshore tax loopholes.\n  In the 1950s, corporate taxes were about 6 percent of the economy. \nToday, they are 1.9 percent.\n  All in all, Federal revenue contributed by corporate taxes has \ndropped by two-thirds over the last six decades.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would also allow Treasury to look at \nindividual tax rates so that we can examine if the wealthy are really \npaying their fair share. Currently, many tax loopholes are reserved for \nwealthy Americans. These tax giveaways are leaving the middle class to \npick up their tab.\n  Some multimillionaires and billionaires are paying a lower effective \ntax rate than the average American family. This is wrong. Hard work \nshould never be taxed at a higher rate than making money off Wall \nStreet.\n  Our Tax Code is full of tax loopholes and tax breaks benefiting big \ncorporations and the rich. When they don't pay their fair share of the \ntaxes, the rest of us pick up the tab. American families end up paying \nhigher taxes or getting fewer services, and the country goes deeper \ninto debt.\n  If corporations and the rich paid their fair share, then the economy \nwill work better for everyone. Instead of making seniors pay more for \nMedicare or cutting Social Security benefits, we should close loopholes \nthat allow large corporations to hide profits offshore. Instead of \ncutting funding for repairing our roads and bridges, we should end huge \ntax subsidies to oil and gas companies making record profits. Instead \nof cutting funding for teachers and firefighters, we should ask \nmultimillionaires and billionaires to pay at least as high a tax rate \nas those public servants pay.\n  America's richest corporations should not be able to dodge fair taxes \nto pay lower rates than middle class families.\n  It is time to address corporate tax dodging and invest in America \nagain. If we close these tax loopholes for corporations that ship jobs \noverseas and hide profits offshore, we can raise billions of dollars to \ninvest in America. We could make our classrooms less crowded, improve \nroads and bridges, and provide more security for the American people.\n  Unfortunately, the bill we are voting on today leaves out this entire \nconversation and, instead, offers false choices of austerity or \ndefault.\n  Please, I hope my colleagues will join me in asking for a fuller \npicture of our tax policies by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, this amendment to H.R. 3442 brings very \nvaluable information and transparency to the debt-limit process. The \namendment offered by Mr. Grijalva would strengthen the legislation by \nrequiring the administration to report additional information on \nFederal taxes and revenue.\n  However, I will note that revenues are above their historical average \nas a share of GDP, so the problem surrounding the unsustainable \ntrajectory of our national debt isn't that Americans are not taxed \nenough; it is that Washington spends too much.\n  With that said, I support the text of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n\n[[Page H737]]\n\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Huelskamp\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 8, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 4, after line 8, insert the following:\n       ``(D) any reduction measures the Secretary intends to take \n     to fund Federal Government obligations if the debt limit is \n     not raised, including--\n       ``(i) notifying the Congress when the limit has been \n     reached; and\n       ``(ii) notifying the Congress when the Secretary has begun \n     taking such measures and specifying which measures are \n     currently being used.''.\n       Page 4, line 21, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 25, strike the period and insert ``: and''.\n       Page 4, after line 25, insert the following:\n       ``(D) the plan of the President for each week that the debt \n     of the United States Government is at the statutory limit, to \n     publicly disclose, on the website of the Department of the \n     Treasury, the following:\n       ``(i) All reduction measures currently being used by the \n     Secretary to avoid defaulting on obligations of the \n     Government.\n       ``(ii) With respect to each reduction measure, whether or \n     not such measure is currently being used--\n\n       ``(I) the total dollar amount of such measure that has been \n     used; and\n       ``(II) the total dollar amount of such measure that the \n     Secretary estimates is still available for use.\n\n       ``(iii) The date on which the Secretary estimates that all \n     reduction measures will be exhausted, and the Government will \n     begin defaulting on its obligations.''.\n       Page 6, after line 2, insert the following:\n       ``(d) Reduction Measures Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term `reduction measures' means each of the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Directing or approving the issuance of debt by the \n     Federal Financing Bank for the purpose of entering into an \n     exchange transaction for debt that is subject to the limit \n     under this section.\n       ``(2) Suspending investments in the Government Securities \n     Investment Fund of the Thrift Savings Fund.\n       ``(3) Suspending investments in the stabilization fund \n     established under section 5302 of title 31, United States \n     Code.\n       ``(4) Suspending new investments in the Civil Service \n     Retirement and Disability Fund or the Postal Service Retiree \n     Health Benefits Fund.\n       ``(5) Selling or redeeming securities, obligations, or \n     other invested assets of the Civil Service Retirement and \n     Disability Fund or the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits \n     Fund before maturity.\n       ``(6) Such other measures as the Secretary determines \n     appropriate.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentleman \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to offer \nthis amendment on a very important bill, and I appreciate the work of \nthe gentleman from Texas. I believe the bill is necessary. My \namendment, hopefully, will provide some additional information.\n  As we know, Congress has the authority to set the debt limit. The \nPresident, through the Secretary of the Treasury, however, has the \napparent authority to set the date to which all the cable networks peg \ntheir doomsday countdown clocks. We saw this firsthand in 2011 and \n2013.\n  Even if receipts, expenditures, or use of extraordinary measures \nchange their internal projections of the exhaustion date, Treasury is \nnot required in any way to provide regular, independently verifiable \nupdates to Congress or the American people. Instead, the elected \nofficials charged with making the ultimate decision on increasing the \nNation's maxed-out credit card are expected to simply take Treasury's \nword for it--sometimes months after an initial estimate.\n  My proposed amendment is very simple. It would require that Treasury \nprovide a weekly reporting of the extraordinary measures and the \nprojected exhaustion date per our Nation's debt limit.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  It is a matter of transparency. But it is also exactly the \ninformation we need as Members of Congress to fulfill our \nconstitutional responsibility on this issue.\n  Consider just how long the use of extraordinary measures lasted in \n2015. They were originally utilized on March 15, yet the Treasury set \nNovember 3 as the date of exhaustion--over 7 months later. That \ncreates, I believe, a lot of uncertainty, and Treasury continues to \ncontrol the entire process. Transparency is always a better policy.\n  Mr. Chairman, to further illustrate why this is needed, just last \nweek, a report was issued by the House Financial Services Committee \nthat found that apparently the Department misled Congress regarding \ntheir capabilities and plans concerning debt payments back in 2011 and \n2013.\n  Without going into too much detail, the findings of the report, I \nbelieve, are clear. The Treasury did not report to Congress the \nspecific actions they could take once the debt limit is reached.\n  I urge the House to support my amendment to help ensure the American \npeople and Congress are equipped to make informed judgments on this \ncritical issue of the Federal debt limit.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, Democrats don't want to default. We \nbelieve we should get our deficits under control now and not at the \nmoment of default.\n  I believe my Republican colleagues continue to run from deadline to \ndeadline, creating great anxiety. I don't know if you all noticed how \nthe markets are reacting today with the situation in Europe and in \nChina. We are not doing so well, yet we continue this notion of \nbringing back before the people, before the world, the notion that we \nwill have a default someday and we will prioritize the payment of \ndefault, creating the notion or the idea that somehow the U.S. \nGovernment might even default on its bills someday. That in and of \nitself is very destabilizing, and we will have an amendment coming up a \nlittle later on this afternoon.\n  In fact, this President--our President--has a proposal in his budget \nto cut an additional $3 trillion from our Nation's deficit on top of \nthe $4 trillion in deficit reduction that has already been enacted into \nlaw. In fact, this President--President Obama--cut the $1 trillion Bush \ndeficit in half--in more than half--in 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  America is moving forward. But the underlying issue is the \nRepublicans are afraid that if they allow the White House to come here \nto the Hill in the form of a budget director to testify on the budget, \nthese pesky little facts will become more commonly known to the \nAmerican people.\n  I only have last year's Republican budget to go by--I wait with bated \nbreath for the 2016 budget to come out--but all I have is the 2015 \nbudget. Although there is some transparency that would make cuts in \norder to balance the budget--they make cuts in Social Security, they \nmake cuts in Medicare, they make cuts in Medicaid and other health--\nthey would entirely eliminate the Affordable Care Act. We all know what \ncomplications come with that--no pre-screening; if you are under 26, \nyou would no longer have your parents' insurance; those who already \nhave preexisting conditions would be discriminated against by insurance \ncompanies. We know all the bad things that you all want to see come to \nfruition.\n  But then you also have another less transparent line that says: other \nmandatory cuts, to the tune of $1.1 trillion. You don't spell out what \nthat means. But I would imagine--and I have to assume--it would mean \nmaking mandatory cuts to our veterans, to military personnel, and to \nFederal employees, just to name a few. To get $1.1 trillion in \nadditional cuts, those are where the cuts would come from.\n  That may be your platform--you want to make cuts in veterans, in \nmilitary personnel, and in Federal employees. Those are cuts you are \ngoing to propose. You should just make it more transparent. The \nAmerican people are looking for transparency. They want the debate. We \nknow the cuts you are ready to propose right now in terms of Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[[Page H738]]\n\n  Let's be honest, you want to cut military and Federal employee \npensions, but you are not spelling it out here. I wonder how the folks \nnearby in Virginia or in Maryland feel about the cuts you want to make \nin Federal employee pensions. You don't actually spell it out in your \nbudget. You call it ``other mandatory cuts.''\n  The American people should assume what that means. We are just trying \nto give a little more transparency to what your cuts actually mean. \nThey mean cuts to military and Federal employee pensions. Just a little \nhonesty, just a little transparency. That is what the American people \nare looking for.\n  Democrats oppose the GOP plans of threatening default or the Pay \nChina First Act bill, which means no Social Security checks, if that \nwere to go into effect, no doctor reimbursements from serving Medicare \npatients, and it calls into question the paying of our troops. What it \nreally does, though, is it calls into question what we have prided \nourselves on as Americans, and that is that we pay our debts. We don't \neven create the suspicion.\n  Alexander Hamilton is rolling in his grave today because you are even \ncreating the suspicion that you would not pay the American people's \ndebts. We have an obligation to do our work, to do our business, not \nfor shenanigans, but to get the people's work done. Mr. Chairman, I \nwould suggest that this bill doesn't really further or advance getting \nthe people's work done. It is just creating more bureaucracy and more \ntime on the floor taking up more precious time in debate, but that is \nwhere we are at.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Marchant).\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  This amendment that Mr. Huelskamp has offered requires the \nadministration to report on extraordinary measures on a weekly basis so \nthat Congress will have the most up-to-date information available.\n  I can tell you that at the very heart of this bill, as I began to put \nit together a couple of years ago, was the very fact that through a \npress release the Secretary of Treasury could come out and pick some \ndate out of midair and say we were going to reach the debt ceiling. \nThen we would go month after month after month not knowing whether he \nwould come out again with another press release that says: Well, it \nwill be next week.\n  It is my opinion--and I agree with Mr. Huelskamp--that the Secretary \nof Treasury needs to inform Congress what extraordinary measures he or \nshe is using that week to extend the debt limit deadline.\n  It is a great amendment, and it adds to the bill.\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate support from the gentleman \nfrom Texas, I appreciate support from the Ways and Means Committee, and \nI certainly appreciate the comments across the aisle of the need for \ntransparency.\n  We are an information vacuum on this issue as Members of Congress and \nthe American people. This simply requires a weekly report so folks \noutside of the Department of Treasury know what is happening with our \nNation's credit line.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 8, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 4, after line 8, insert the following:\n       ``(D) if the President recommends that Congress adopt, in \n     general, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States to help control the accumulation of future \n     debt.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Newhouse) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, it is very fitting today that we are \nconsidering this bill. It is the same week that the President released \nthe final budget of his administration--a budget that would add nearly \n$2.6 trillion to our national debt over the next 5 years. In fact, this \nPresident has never submitted a budget to Congress that would balance.\n  Few Americans may realize this, but just last week, our national debt \nreached $19 trillion--Mr. Chairman, $19 trillion. When the President \ncame into office in 2009, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion. That is \nnearly doubling our national debt in just 7 years' time.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are on a high-speed train, careening towards a \nfiscal cliff. Soon it may be too late to slow this train down.\n  If I could, in the name of all that is fiscally sane, I would enact \nan amendment to the Constitution right now requiring us to balance our \nbudget. But, unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, our Constitution requires \ntwo-thirds of our colleagues here in Congress to approve that \namendment, which history and previous votes on constitutional \namendments have shown is a very difficult bar to reach. While this \nmeasure may not be the balanced budget amendment that our country \ndesperately needs and deserves, it will help draw a very clear line of \ndistinction in the sand.\n  Mr. Chairman, the amendment that my colleagues from Virginia and Ohio \nand Alabama and I are offering would simply require the President to \ntell the American people whether or not they support a balanced budget \namendment when he or she asks for a debt ceiling increase. It is as \nsimple as that. This is about transparency and about being open with \nthe American people about where you stand on this very critical issue.\n  It would provide a very clear contrast if the President asked to \nraise the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars in this case, but offers \nno support for a measure that would put an end to our Nation's debt \nproblems for good.\n  Make no mistake, time is quickly coming when our Nation will have to \nmake the decision if we want to restore the fiscal health of our Nation \nto a state of stability and prosperity for future generations, or go \ndown the same road of nations like Greece that have been shattered by \ntheir debt woes. When that day comes, the American people deserve to \nknow who is standing where.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The gentleman from \nNew York is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have three children. I hate it when they \ncome to me on Sunday night and say: Dad, I have a paper due tomorrow, \ncan you help me out with it? In many respects that is how I feel my \nRepublican colleagues are treating government today. They are like \nchildren that need to be forced to do their homework, forced to do \ntheir job, and they are doing it always at the last minute.\n  In many respects, some of the amendments we are talking about today \nare memorializing the notion of running government from deadline to \ndeadline. We really shouldn't be doing that. You don't make good \njudgments. I dare say that my children's papers aren't as good when \nthey wait until the last minute to do them, and I suspect that maybe we \ndon't run government when we go from deadline to deadline. We shouldn't \nrun our government this way.\n  Democrats have taken the action to lower the deficit and restore the \neconomy. Democrats don't want to default. I believe we should get our \ndeficit under control now and not the moment of default. I know I may \nsound a little bit like the gentleman running for President, Mr. Rubio, \nbecause I am going to be repeating myself a little bit here, but I \nthink some of the facts bear repeating.\n  That is where the President again has proposed $3 trillion in deficit \nreduction on top of the $4 trillion in deficit reduction that has \nalready been enacted into law. Again, this President\n\n[[Page H739]]\n\ncut the $1 trillion Bush deficits by more than half in just 4\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  America is moving forward. America doesn't need to be great again. We \nalready are great. We have the ability to deal with our fiscal problems \nif we stop doing it from deadline to deadline and address them in a \nsmart and healthy way.\n  The underlying issue is Republicans are afraid that if they are \nallowed to bring the White House again here before us today to testify \non their budget that they have proposed, that again pesky facts will \nget in the way. I will just point them out again.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  We have a little yellow line going through it here.\n  Other mandatory cuts in the Republican budget are to the tune of $1.1 \ntrillion. Again, I don't know exactly what they are, but I can only \nassume that those cuts are to the military personnel's and veterans' \npensions and to Federal employees' pensions.\n  I don't know how many fellow employees who live in the Virginia area, \nfor instance, are paying attention to the debate today or how many of \nthose who live in Maryland are paying attention to the debate today. I \nsuspect, if they are, they are a little concerned about this one line \nthat is highlighted, because it would include, under the Republican \nbudget for 2016, mandatory cuts to veterans', to military personnel's, \nand to Federal employees' pensions. I just think we need to be more \nopen about what those cuts would be to balance the Republican budget.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have nothing personal against the person who is \noffering the amendment. Again, I just think it further moves forward \nthis notion that we are going to continue to operate the government \ndeadline to deadline. The American people are sick and tired of the \ngovernment's operating in this way. They want a more thoughtful \ngovernment. This is not an answer to that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nMarchant).\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, this amendment offered by Mr. Newhouse \nwould absolutely strengthen H.R. 3442.\n  By requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress \ninformation on the debt ceiling, the President recommends that the \nCongress adopt a balanced budget amendment. This would add more clarity \nto the process. Therefore, I recommend to the Members that they vote \n``yes.''\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chair, once again, I would suggest that my \nRepublican colleagues need to be more clear, more transparent.\n  The gentleman just mentioned transparency. The Republican budget is \nbegging for transparency. The American people want to know exactly what \nis meant by ``other mandatory cuts to the tune of $1.1 trillion.'' \nWhere do those cuts end up being made? Again, I can only suggest it is \nto veterans', to military personnel's, and to Federal employees' \npensions.\n  People living in the greater Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area, \nthose who live down by Norfolk, Virginia, and other heavy military as \nwell as governmental personnel areas, have to question--and I hope they \nare questioning--what the Republicans mean by those mandatory cuts. I \nbelieve it means veterans', military personnel's, and Federal \nemployees' pensions will be cut if the Republican budget is enacted \ninto law.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, in closing, this is a very simple \namendment that just requires the administration to state whether or not \nit would recommend that Congress adopt a balanced budget when it asks \nfor a debt ceiling increase. Our national debt is one of the biggest \nthreats that exists to our Nation. The American people need to know \nwhere the administration is and where Congress is on this important \nissue.\n  When the President ran in 2008, he promised that his administration \nwould be the most transparent administration yet. This helps him keep \nthat promise. Today, it is all about transparency--letting people know \nwhere we stand.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Kelly of Illinois\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 8, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 4, after line 8, insert the following:\n       ``(D) an economic forecast of the negative consequences of \n     failing to raise the debt limit, including costs associated \n     with public health and safety.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois (Ms. Kelly) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple. It merely \nexpands the report the Treasury Secretary must submit per the \nunderlying bill to include an analysis of the economic costs of failing \nto raise the debt limit, especially with regard to the costs to our \nNation's public health and safety.\n  I agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle that misguided \ndeficit spending poses a serious risk to our Nation's long-term \nfinancial stability. It is crucial that we get our fiscal house in \norder. Simply raising the debt limit without discussing strategic ways \nto increase revenues and cut costs is unacceptable. Equally \nunacceptable is not acknowledging the serious short- and long-term \ncosts of failing to raise the debt limit, causing the country to enter \ninto default.\n  Federal tax dollars fund a variety of programs in every single one of \nour congressional districts, programs that are essential to the \ncontinued well-being of our constituents. Seniors rely on Social \nSecurity checks and on Medicare reimbursements. Veterans depend on \ntheir much-needed VA benefits. State and municipal police forces \nreceive funding through Department of Justice grants. Our Nation's \nhospitals receive Federal tax dollars.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say, if the United States of America \ndefaulted on its loan obligations and if it could not pay its bills for \nexpenses already incurred, the health and safety of its citizens would \nbe put at risk. If America were to enter into default, what would \nhappen? Would the Social Security Administration be able to cut checks? \nHow many Americans would be unable to obtain essential medications? \nWould the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the TSA, or State and \nlocal police units furlough agents and officers? How many fewer cops \nwould be on the beat to keep our communities safe?\n  All too often, our debates in Washington about the national debt and \ndeficit are not grounded in reality. We simply analyze economic \nconcepts in the abstract, but our decisions and our debates have real, \nimmediate, and lasting impacts on the daily lives of our constituents.\n  If we are going to engage in a discussion on the pros and cons of \nraising the debt ceiling, let's keep in mind the real, on-the-ground \nconsequences that the decisions will have on everyday Americans.\n  If we are going to require the Treasury Secretary to report on the \ncosts of the growing national debt, let's be fair and require that the \nreport discuss the immediate and lasting costs of failing to raise the \ndebt ceiling on our Nation's public health and safety.\n  The bill's author, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Marchant), stated \nhis goal was to have a comprehensive discussion of the debt ceiling. A \ncomprehensive discussion must include not only the long-term costs of \ncontinued deficit spending, but the short-term costs of default, as \nwell as its far-reaching ripple effects.\n\n[[Page H740]]\n\n  This amendment is one of common sense and is intellectually honest \nand fair. It would have zero budgetary impact, and it would ensure the \nreport is as meaningful as possible; so I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require the \nadministration to speculate on the impact of default on our Federal \ndebt. It doesn't call for any specific report. It doesn't call for any \nspecific numbers.\n  It is not the point of H.R. 3442 to speculate. H.R. 3442 is a \nsensible step in creating a process to consider the debt limit with \ninformation and transparency. I do not feel like this amendment gives \nany support to that priority.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Duffy\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 21, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 25, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 4, after line 25, add the following:\n       ``(D) whether the Administration acknowledges that it is \n     technologically capable of paying only principal and interest \n     on the national debt, as opposed to other obligations, in the \n     event that the debt limit, as specified under section 3101, \n     is reached.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I thank the gentleman from Texas for all of his good work \non this legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, as all of us know in this institution and around the \ncountry, we are $19 trillion in debt. We borrow around $3.8 billion a \nday, and we spend about $250 billion a year to service our debt. One of \nthe tools that we have in this Congress is the debt limit in order to \nget the administration to help reform the way we spend.\n  In 2011, Congress challenged President Obama. When he asked to have \nan increase in the debt limit, we said let's have a decrease in how \nmuch money we spend. As a political fight played out, the \nadministration promised that chaos would ensue across the global \nmarkets if the debt limit were reached, and it also said that any \nproposal that would prioritize payments through the Treasury for \nprincipal and interest on our debt could not be taken seriously. Mr. \nMcClintock had a bill that would have done just that.\n  The Committee on Financial Services, the committee on which I serve, \ndid an investigation, and we found that, though they said Mr. \nMcClintock's bill could not be taken seriously, they actually had a \nplan to do just what Mr. McClintock had recommended, which is, if the \ndebt limit is reached, prioritize payments. They weren't being honest \nwith the American people, because what they wanted to do was to use the \nargument of chaos to put pressure on Republicans to cave and not demand \nthat we reform the way that we spend.\n  My amendment here today is very simple. All it says is let's make \nsure that the Treasury comes clean and tells the American people \nwhether it can pay principal and interest before other obligations so \nthat America does not default on its debt. It is very simple. No one \nhere wants to hit the debt limit, and no one wants us to be the next \nGreece or Puerto Rico, but that is going to take working together in \norder to make sure we have budgets that balance at some point in the \nfuture.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, as I read it, this amendment requires the \nTreasury to notify Congress about which obligations it would be able to \npay were Congress to choose to default and prioritize debt as a vision \nin the Pay China First bill, which the House has twice passed on a \nparty-line vote.\n  First, a bill that plans for default sends a very disturbing signal \nto the world economy. Here is what we have with us: the gentleman, \napparently, through the Speaker and the sponsor of this bill, in good \nfaith, wants to pay China first before vets, before Medicare payments, \nbefore salaries for our troops, et cetera. The gentleman wants to pay \nChina first. Of all of the people lined up who are going to get paid, \nthe gentleman wants to pay China first. Excuse me for repeating myself.\n  The intent of the amendment is to accuse the Treasury of deceiving \nCongress about its ability to prioritize debt payments. The Treasury \ndoes not currently have the capability to prioritize between types of \npayments in the event it does not have enough cash on hand to pay all \nof the bills due on a particular date. That is how it works.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  In such an event, Treasury would likely hold all of its bills until \nit has enough cash on hand to pay those bills. This would repeat daily \nin a cascading fashion. The result would be disastrous, a first-time \nimmediate default on U.S. credit.\n  Let me repeat the 14th Amendment. It is clear, simple, and concise. \nThe 14th Amendment to the Constitution, section 4, says:\n  ``The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by \nlaw''--that is us--``including debts incurred for payment of pensions . \n. . shall not be questioned.''\n  I think that to even entertain the idea of default is \ncounterproductive. To entertain the idea sends a real message to the \nfinancial markets all over the world, including our own. I think that \nis a disturbing thing. I don't think you want it, and I don't think we \nwant it.\n  Now, when you look at how the debt was incurred, when you look at \nthat graph about what contributed to this $19 trillion, zillion, \ngabillion dollars, you are talking about, it could be very interesting \nin case of history--history is important here. History 101--what \ncontributed to that debt: two wars unpaid for, two tax cuts in 2001 and \n2003 unpaid for, plan B Medicare prescription drugs unpaid for.\n  Look, we passed legislation on this floor. We are all culpable here, \nDemocrats and Republicans. So when you stand up and pontificate--you \ndon't have to be in a Presidential election either--and you pontificate \nabout those guys simply want to tax and spend, you have short memories. \nYou have selective memories. We have that at times, too, ourselves on \nour side.\n  Well, you are talking about something pretty darn fundamental, and \nthat is the budget, and that is the deficit of this country. This is an \nabsolutely unnecessary amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I remind the gentleman from New Jersey \nthat there is no such thing as a gazillion dollars. Having said that, \nwe are talking real money here. We are talking trillions of dollars in \ndebt, no doubt.\n  I think the gentleman made reference, as well, to the Constitution \nand spelled out that we shouldn't even hint at the notion of not paying \nour debt; yet that is exactly what this amendment would do, similar to \nlegislation that passed here last year and the year before that that \nwould suggest that maybe the United States won't pay its bills. That is \nnot going to happen.\n  Even in your own budget, you would raise the debt ceiling by $3 \ntrillion in order to pass your budget. So you know you are going to \nraise--if you had your druthers, you would raise the debt ceiling as \nwell.\n\n[[Page H741]]\n\n  I think the gentleman from Wisconsin also had to understand that \nthese are debts that are already owed, not future debts. They are debts \nwe already owe that we have to pay back to make sure the world \nunderstands the U.S. pays its debts.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from New Jersey has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, I would just note that this bill guarantees \nthat we pay our debt. That is exactly what this bill does. So I would \nnote that the Democrats are making the argument for me.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, the law that established the Treasury \nDepartment already instructs it to manage the revenue to support the \npublic credit. This already includes prioritizing payments to assure \nthe national debt is always honored, as the Constitution commands. \nWithout this, a stalemate on the debt could endanger the Nation's \ncredit.\n  Well, during recent debates over raising the debt limit, the Treasury \nDepartment denied that it can prioritize to preserve the Nation's \ncredit. Thanks to the Financial Services Committee's investigation, we \nnow know this was a deliberate and calculated lie told to increase \npressure on Congress. Emails revealed that Federal Reserve officials \nwere incredulous and appalled that the administration would make such \nstatements because they ran a severe risk of panicking credit markets.\n  This amendment simply requires that, when we approach the debt limit, \nthe Treasury Department tells Congress and the public what it is \nactually preparing to do to assure this Nation's creditors that their \nloans to this government are completely secure.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nMesser), someone who has worked very hard on this issue as well.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this important \namendment.\n  Frankly, the opposition to this amendment is baffling. During the \ndebt ceiling debate last year, the administration repeatedly told \nCongress and the American people that, if we don't raise the debt \nceiling, we would default on our Nation's bills, that the seniors would \nmiss their Social Security checks, that interest on the debt would go \nunpaid, and that it would all bring the U.S. economy to its knees. \nThis, as it turns out, wasn't true.\n  Contrary to their posturing, recently exposed documents have shown \nthat the administration was planning to prioritize payments in the \nevent the debt ceiling was reached, the very thing they told us they \ncouldn't do. This is beyond partisan politics. It is fear-mongering.\n  Very simply, my colleague's amendment requires this administration \nand future administrations to acknowledge their ability to prioritize \npayments after hitting the debt limit. It is a good idea.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DUFFY. May I ask the chairman how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 5 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, I would just note that $800 billion from \nObamaCare to Medicare came from Democrats; $250 billion a year in \ninterest goes to China.\n  Let's balance the budget. I would love to see the Democrats' plan to \nbalance.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 amendment no. 6 offered by mr. messer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 21, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 25, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 4, after line 25, insert the following:\n       ``(D) any extraordinary measures the Secretary intends to \n     take to fund Federal government obligations if the debt limit \n     is not raised, a projection of how long such extraordinary \n     measures will fund the Federal government, and a projection \n     of the administrative cost of taking such extraordinary \n     measures.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. \nMarchant) for his great work on this important bill, a bill that seeks \nto make the administration accountable for the out-of-control national \ndebt which others have said just hit a staggering $19 trillion.\n  Mr. Chairman, like the underlying legislation, the amendment I am \noffering today holds this administration and future administrations \naccountable, too. Many don't realize the enormous power Congress has \ngiven to the Treasury Department to use so-called extraordinary \nmeasures when we are about to hit the debt ceiling.\n  To pay our bills and delay hitting the debt limit, Treasury has the \nauthority to take more than $350 billion out of government accounts, \nincluding government worker pension and retirement accounts. This is an \nincredible power, shifting around hundreds of billions of taxpayer \ndollars and dodging the limit Congress has placed on borrowing.\n  Our Constitution says that Congress, not the administration, has the \npower of the purse. So these extraordinary measures, which in effect \nenable the Department to run up bills or IOUs beyond the debt limit, \nshould be transparent. Congress and the American people have the right \nto know what Treasury is doing with our money. At present, it is \nastonishing how little transparency the Department is statutorily \nobligated to provide.\n  Very simply, my amendment requires the Treasury to report on what \nextraordinary measures it intends to use if the debt limit is not \nlifted. It requires them to project how long such measures will fund \nthe Federal Government so Congress and the American people know well \nbefore we near the limit how long those measures will last.\n  It requires the Treasury Department to estimate the administrative \ncosts associated with taking any extraordinary measures. If moving all \nthis money around costs additional money, we should all know about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, we are talking about brinksmanship once \nagain. I think this is a very unhealthy debate we are having because \nthis is the not the way we should be running government anyway, from \ndeadline to deadline.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we should be sitting down and working these \nissues out and not having the world on the precipice of seeing the \nNation default. No good will come of it, and absolutely no good comes \nfrom talking about it because it will never happen. We will not do it. \nWe will not allow our country to default.\n  They continue to talk this way because it is the way they are running \ngovernment, whether it is the government shutdown or the debt limit or \nthe highway trust fund or the Export-Import Bank or the FAA, which we \nare going to be taking up soon. I am sure that that will go to the last \nsecond before we will ever actually act. They will probably do a delay \nand do it a little later on in the year because that is the way we \noperate around here. It is unfortunate.\n  Mr. Chairman, I point out there is a reason why the President has \nproposed a $3 trillion cut in the deficit on top of the $4 trillion \nthat has already been enacted into law. It is to lower the national \ndebt. We are working toward it.\n\n[[Page H742]]\n\nIn fact, this President cut the trillion-dollar Bush deficit in half in \nless than 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  One last time, I want to point out that we see the Republican budget. \nWe understand the clarity in terms of the cuts you would make to Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.\n  There is one portion here, ``other mandatory cuts,'' and I suspect we \nknow what they are as well. They are cuts to veterans', military \npersonnel's, and Federal employees' pensions--veterans' pensions, \nmilitary personnel's pensions, and Federal employees' pensions.\n  I suspect people who live around Richmond, Virginia, or down by \nNorfolk would be very concerned about those cuts you may propose, as \nwell as those folks who live in Virginia and Maryland surrounding \nWashington, D.C. A lot of Federal employees work around here. I know \nthere are a lot of military employees as well. I think they are \nconcerned about their pensions, the ones that you want to cut in the \nFederal Republican budget.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am just looking for a little more transparency.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for \nintroducing the amendment. I know it is in good faith.\n  I am looking at my favorite chart since I have been here about what \ncauses the public debt. I hear all of these folks talking about it--in \nboth parties running for President--about the public debt, and I don't \nknow what public debt they are talking about, to be very frank with \nyou.\n  Let me tell you what the public debt is all about that we are talking \nabout: $19 trillion and rising. Most of the debt that we carry from \nyear to year--and we have to pay interest on that debt, as you well \nknow--comes from either the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 combined with the \ntwo wars we never paid for. I mean, those are the facts. I didn't make \nthem up.\n  So we have very little in the discretionary part of the budget. It is \nonly 30 percent of the total budget. We do have a solution to part of \nthe problem in that we extended Medicare for one of those mandatory \ncosts for 12 years. That is what the ACA did.\n  I am telling you we ought to learn what the facts are, and then maybe \nwe would reduce the number of bills as well as the amendments.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All Members are reminded to address their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, their arguments seem to be summarized this \nway: that somehow if we just would all go bury our head in the sand \nthat we would be better off.\n  I mean, the reality is this: our Nation does have a $19 trillion \ndebt. The reality is that every time this Congress had set a debt limit \nfor our spending, we have breached that debt limit and had to raise \nanother one. The reality is, as we have approached these debt limits in \nrecent years, the Department of the Treasury has taken what they call \nextraordinary measures, doing it under the law to try to lengthen the \namount of time until we hit that debt limit.\n  This amendment is really a very modest one. All the amendment says \nis, if the Department of the Treasury is going to take extraordinary \nmeasures to avoid the limit on debt that has been set by Congress, that \nthey ought to tell us all what they are doing. They ought to define \nwhat it is. They ought to define how much time we are going to buy with \nthese extraordinary measures, and they ought to tell us what it costs \nas we juggle all this money around. Because when you start juggling \nmoney around, as everybody knows in their own life and in their own \nbills they have to pay, it costs money. That is all this amendment \ndoes.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  That is all this amendment does. All this amendment does is make sure \nthat as we approach the next debt limit and the Department of the \nTreasury takes the next extraordinary measures--we can bury our head in \nthe sand and say it won't happen, but our entire Nation's history says \nit will--that we ought to define what they are going to do. They ought \nto tell us, tell the American people. They ought to explain how much \ntime that buys, and they ought to say how much it costs. I hope my \ncolleagues can support that.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman speaks of burying one's head \nin the sand. I think an example of that is not asking the OMB Director \nto come up to the Hill to talk to the Congress about the President's \nbudget.\n  As I mentioned before, the President's budget proposed $3 trillion in \nadditional cuts to the Federal deficit. I may not agree with all the \ncuts the President is proposing, but I think it is a healthy thing for \nthe President's representative, the Director of the OMB, to come before \nthe Congress and speak about that; yet the other side of the aisle has \nrefused to allow the OMB Director to come speak to the Congress to talk \nabout these issues.\n  So there is hypocrisy and then there is hypocrisy. Talk about putting \nyour head in the sand. There is not enough sand for you all to put your \nheads in.\n  The facts are the facts. Reductions are taking place. Accept it. They \nmay not be pretty. The President is proposing them. At least listen to \nhim before you totally disregard it before he has an opportunity to \nspeak to you all. That is what has happened.\n  Again, I know what the Republican budget says. It says cuts to \nveterans' pensions, military pensions, as well as to Federal employee \npensions. That is what your budget does. Be honest about it. You talk \nabout Social Security cuts. You make a lot of cuts, but at least talk \nabout the other miscellaneous mandatory cuts, which really hurt people. \nI am not going to support that. You all may. It is in your budget. I am \nnot going to support that. Democrats are not going to support that. You \nall may support that, but you have to respond to your constituents when \nyou force these cuts down their throats.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is reminded that all remarks are to \nbe addressed to the Chair.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining on my side?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, this debate is a remarkable one. There is \nonly one group here that has a budget that balances. For the fifth or \nsixth or seventh year in a row, we will be submitting a budget that \nbalances.\n  The gentleman speaks of the President's budget. The President is \ngoing to have the unique historical legacy of having never offered a \nbudget that balances, ever. This one doesn't. His others haven't. The \ntruth is that, when the President's prior budgets have been put on this \nfloor, they have received virtually no votes, like my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. That is the truth.\n  Again, back to this very simple amendment. All it does is say, when \nthe Department of Treasury uses extraordinary measures, they should be \nclear with the American people about what they are doing, how much time \nthat buys us, and what it costs. It is a commonsense amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 21, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, after line 25, insert the following:\n       ``(D) projections of earnings of individuals, including \n     salary and wages by decile, and\n       ``(E) projections of consumer spending and the impacts of \n     such projections on gross domestic product.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentleman\n\n[[Page H743]]\n\nfrom Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment requires the Treasury \nSecretary's report to also include individual salary and wage \ninformation as well as projections of consumer spending and the impact \nof spending cuts on the gross domestic product.\n  Stagnant American wages in recent decades are, without a question, \nthe country's most central economic challenge, and the issue of wealth \nand income inequality continues to be a persistent strain on our \neconomy and, indeed, our society. Raising wages is the key in \nstrengthening the middle class, reducing income inequality, and moving \nfamilies out of poverty.\n  I am offering this amendment because we have to start getting \nrealistic about the priorities of the American people.\n  When Americans sit around their dinner tables, their number one \ndiscussion is not about the national debt. Their number one concern and \ndiscussion is providing for their families and how they are managing \ntheir own budgets. Many are seeing that, while costs are rising, their \npaychecks are not. Everyday items are becoming unaffordable, and \nworkers are sick and tired of working full time and still struggling to \nget by.\n  Since 1979, the vast majority of American workers have seen their \nhourly wages stagnate or, indeed, decline. From 1973 to 2013, hourly \ncompensation of a typical production worker rose just 9 percent, while \nproductivity increased 74 percent. In short, people are working harder \nand harder, and their paychecks are getting smaller and smaller.\n  America now has more wealth and income inequality than any major \ndeveloped country on Earth, and the gap between the very rich and \neveryone else is wider than at anytime since the 1920s. Shrinking \nAmerican paychecks are the root cause of rising income inequality, and \na host of issues have come with that.\n  Wages drive our economy and consumer spending amounts to more than \ntwo-thirds of U.S. economic activity. A rise in consumer spending would \nprovide a needed boost to the U.S. GDP. It is time to stop suppressing \nwages through policy choices that are slanted toward helping the \nwealthy. It is time to recognize that our decisions have a direct \nimpact on a person's paycheck.\n  Any report attempting to look at long-term fiscal issues of this \ncountry must examine why 58 percent of all new income since the Wall \nStreet crash has gone to the top 1 percent. We should be considering \nhow every decision will impact a family's income, and the fact that the \nunderlying bill does not include information on wages is an injustice \nto struggling American families.\n  I urge you to support this amendment and show the American people \nthat the Members of Congress are not just fighting for policies that \nprotect the wealthy but, indeed, for policies that protect us all.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, the goal of the Debt Management and \nFiscal Responsibility Act is to create a sound process for considering \nthe Federal debt limit. This amendment is not focused on that goal and, \ninstead, asks for the administration to speculate about unrelated and \nimpractical issues such as projection of wages at various percentiles. \nInstead, we should be spending our time focused on the drivers of our \ndebt and how to come up with a credible solution to slow the trajectory \nof our debt.\n  I oppose this amendment and ask that Members vote ``no.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the bill overall is a push to continue to \ndeal only with austerity as a plausible budgetary policy for this \ncountry. We can see what that austerity only has done to our country so \nfar. This is how we ended up with sequestration. This is how we stifled \nGDP growth and harmed our overall economic recovery.\n  The best way to address our long-term debt is to maximize our \neconomic potential. We can't cut our way to prosperity. Instead, we \nshould focus on protecting American workers and families so that they \nhave the wealth necessary to make our economy grow and prosper again.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Takano\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-420.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made in \norder under the rule.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 21, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 25, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 4, after line 25, insert the following:\n       ``(D) how delayed action by Congress to raise the debt \n     limit and the threat of default impacts the economy, \n     including, but not limited to, the impact on the gross \n     domestic product (GDP), interest rates, employment, household \n     wealth, and retirement assets.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to \nhelp Congress better understand how the mere threat of default would \nimpact our economy.\n  The Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act gathers information \nfrom the Treasury about our Nation's debt but omits critical details; \nnamely, the consequences for the country when my friends in the \nmajority play a game of chicken with the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States.\n  When the majority threatened the default in 2011, it was American \nfamilies who paid the price. Household wealth fell by $2.4 trillion. \nConsumer and business confidence plunged. The S 500 dropped 17 \npercent, $800 billion in retirement assets were wiped out, and our \ncredit rating was downgraded, all thanks to Republicans threatening to \nforce an unprecedented default on America's debt.\n  If the extreme wing of the Republican Party is going to hold the \neconomy hostage over the debt limit, they should at least understand \nthe damage they are causing. My amendment requires the Treasury to \ninclude in its report to Congress the impact that the threat of default \nand congressional delay would have on the economy.\n  The report would include the estimated effect on the gross domestic \nproduct, interest rates, employment, household wealth, and retirement \nassets. Honestly, I hope we never have to see this impact assessment \nproduced. I hope we never again have to convince Republicans that \nraising the debt limit is a basic responsibility of Congress, not a \nbargaining chip. But their record says otherwise.\n  The next time Republicans seek to score political points and push a \nradical agenda by threatening not to pay America's bills, I want the \npublic to understand the cost of that threat. I think we will find \npretty quickly that the American people have no appetite for petty \npolitics when it comes to the debt limit. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chairman, the Debt Management and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act focuses on creating a process of transparency and \naccountability to\n\n[[Page H744]]\n\ndeal with the debt ceiling. This bill gets Congress, the \nadministration, and the public on the same page about why we \ncontinually find ourselves in this position. Raising the debt limit \nwithout any plan to get our debt under control in the future is not a \nplan.\n  This amendment does not advance that goal. Instead, it goes in the \nopposite direction and attempts to focus our attention on the potential \neffects of brinksmanship.\n  I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment does address the issue at \nhand. It does address the threat, just the mere threat of brinksmanship \nwith paying our Nation's bills. History has shown that just the mere \nthreat of defaulting on our bills has brought about damaging \nconsequences to our economy and to the welfare of our people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in part A of House Report \n114-420 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following \norder:\n  Amendment No. 4 by Ms. Kelly of Illinois.\n  Amendment No. 5 by Mr. Duffy of Wisconsin.\n  Amendment No. 7 by Mr. Grijalva of Arizona.\n  Amendment No. 8 by Mr. Takano of California.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Kelly of Illinois\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois \n(Ms. Kelly) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which \nthe noes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Doggett moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3442 to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendments:\n       Page 4, strike line 22 and all that follows through line 25 \n     and insert the following:\n       ``(C) an analysis of the following:\n       ``(i) Long-term revenue lost from tax avoidance and evasion \n     resulting from tax loopholes exploited by businesses, \n     including corporate inversions, base erosion, unlimited \n     deferral of foreign earnings, and loopholes that encourage \n     the offshoring of jobs and profits.\n       ``(ii) Long-term revenue lost from tax avoidance and \n     evasion resulting from tax loopholes abused by the wealthy, \n     including carried interest, estate tax rules, capital gains \n     rates, and deductions and exemptions that widen income and \n     wealth inequality among individuals.\n       ``(iii) Long-term revenue lost due to unfair policies in \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including those specified \n     in paragraphs (1) and (2), which contribute to growing tax \n     avoidance and evasion by American businesses and individuals \n     who are increasingly more discouraged by corporations and \n     wealthy individuals not being required to pay their fair \n     share of taxes.\n       ``(iv) ) Long-term revenue lost due to unfair policies in \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which harm middle-class \n     workers and families and the long-term revenue effect of a \n     shrinking middle class.''.\n       Page 5, line 16, strike ``information, including'' and all \n     that follows through line 2 on page 6 and insert \n     ``information.''.\n\n  Mr. MARCHANT (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, to address a problem that has impacted our \ncountry for generations, some of our problem-solving colleagues have \ndevised a surefire remedy. They are demanding another government \nreport. Instead of actually voting to prevent more debt when they had \nthe opportunity, they want a report.\n  Approval of this motion will not kill the report, it will not kill \nthe bill, nor will it send it back to committee. Rather, the bill will \nimmediately proceed to final passage, as amended, but it will be a more \ncomplete report that more completely describes the problem with which \nwe are dealing.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues have a near insatiable desire for \ntax cuts that don't pay for themselves. They don't mind borrowing from \nforeign sources to provide more tax preferences to Wall Street or the \nprivileged few. This motion would simply expose the cost of this false \nideology. It would add a requirement that the public just find out how \nmuch these special-interest tax loopholes cost.\n  Specifically, this report would be expanded to include inversions. \nThese are schemes by which some multinational corporations are \nrenouncing their American charter, their American citizenship, in order \nto dodge taxes, while continuing to remain in America and claim the \nbenefits of being American, paid for by their business competitors and \nother taxpayers. We have had a recent string of these inversions, which \nare really perversions of our Tax Code by those who refuse to pay their \nfair share of the cost of national security and other vital services.\n  American corporation Johnson Controls, for example, has announced its \nintent to merge with Tyco. Tyco was once an American citizen, before it \nbecame a citizen of Bermuda, before it switched to become a citizen of \nIreland--all the while being managed in New Jersey. And Pfizer, the \nlargest pharmaceutical company, is seeking the luck of the Irish--the \nIrish taxes, that is--but it certainly refuses to charge Americans \nlower, more reasonable Irish pharmaceutical costs.\n  These are the same companies that are insulted by the notion that \nthey ought to pay a higher rate on their earnings than the people who \nclean up the boardroom at night.\n  The Republican chairman of a Houston oil services company wrote me a \nlong time ago rejecting this notion as unfair and unpatriotic.\n  He said:\n  We are proud of our country, and we are willing to pay U.S. taxes to \nreceive the wonderful benefits of U.S. citizenship. My strongly held \nview is that if companies want to be headquartered in some tax haven, \nthen the management should give up their U.S. citizenship and move \nthere.\n  I agree. But that is not what happens. With our current tax \nloopholes, they don't have to move much more than a mailbox and few \nstaff members.\n  Since the U.S. Supreme Court thinks that corporations are people for \nmany other purposes, I agree with former Secretary Hillary Clinton's \nproposal to treat these charter-changing corporations as individuals \nlike the super rich individuals who turn in passports and leave \nAmerica. Apply an exit tax to previous profits that these corporations \nwant to take out of the country.\n  There is much more that the Treasury Department can and should do \nnow, since what it has done so far under existing legal authority has \nnot accomplished very much.\n  Today, let's just get a report about it, about a giant rip-off of \nAmerica. Corporations which are shipping their jobs and profits \noverseas while paying their lobbyists and their chief executive \nofficers more than they pay the United States Treasury in taxes in any \ngiven year have made a pretty good investment for themselves, but it is \nnot too great for the rest of us. They could not do it without enablers \nin this Congress.\n  American companies who stay in America and contribute to building \nAmerican manufacturing in America deserve to have a level playing \nfield. They help keep us secure at home and abroad, and they deserve to \nbe treated fairly. In order to create more opportunity for all, we need \nmore responsibility from all. Let's at least get a report about it.\n  That is all that this motion to recommit does is to ask for a report \nto go along with the report that they are seeking from the Treasury \nDepartment to tell us what is happening, how our middle class--our \nworking Americans--are having to pay more because some others won't pay \ntheir fair share.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the House to reject this \nmotion to recommit and adopt the Debt Management and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act. It is a commonsense solution to Washington's debt-\ncrisis mentality.\n  H.R. 3442 creates a process to bring transparency, responsibility, \nand consistency to the debt management process. Regardless of whether a \nperson supports raising the debt ceiling or not, everyone should \nsupport a process that gives us more information to make an educated \ndecision.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act requires the \nadministration to report on the state of the national debt before the \ndebt ceiling is reached. It also requires the administration to make \nrecommendations and report information about how to reduce the debt and \nhow America can meet its future obligations.\n  This accountability will give Congress the information it needs when \nconsidering the debt limit. All of this information will be made public \nonline.\n  H.R. 3442 is a strong first step to move government away from its \ncurrent crisis approach and changes the focus into coming up with \nsolutions for our debt problem. I am a firm believer in H.R. 3442.\n  I urge all Members to reject this motion to recommit, and support the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page H748]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-\nminute votes on passage of H.R. 3442, if ordered; ordering the previous \nquestion on House Resolution 611; and adoption of the House Resolution \n611, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 179, \nnoes 238, not voting 16, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 75]\n\n                               AYES--179\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Court \nReporting and Captioning Week, which is taking place next week.\n  Court reporters and captioners are highly specialized professionals \nwho record our most important public events and provide vital closed-\ncaptioning services to nearly 48 million Americans.\n  My own parents met in court reporting school and went on to start a \nsmall, successful business. The training is rigorous. Certification \nrequires one's ability to type at a rate of 225 words per minutes. A \ncourt reporter is transcribing this very moment in Congress.\n  The New Hampshire Court Reporters Association recently celebrated its \n30th anniversary, but the profession's history in the United States \nextends much further. Because of court reporters, we have an accurate \nrecord of the first days of our country as our Founding Fathers drafted \nthe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n  I would like to thank court reporters and captioners for their \nservice, enabling public participation in our democracy--a cornerstone \nof representative government in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H751-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1700\n               TRIBUTE TO SANFORD ``MAN MAN'' HARLING III\n\n  (Mr. BRENDAN F.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nhonor of Sanford Harling III, a widely known and well-loved 12-year-old \nfrom Norristown, Pennsylvania, affectionately known as ``Man Man.''\n  Sanford tragically died after he selflessly dove back into the flames \nof his own burning home to rescue his father, who was bedridden while \nrecovering from hip surgery. Unbeknownst to Man Man, his father had \nalready escaped through a second-story window.\n  Although this courageous 12-year-old never reemerged from the \nsmoldering ruins of his home, his memory now resonates well beyond his \ncommunity thanks to this remarkable act of heroism.\n  While the honor and recognition that Sanford deserves cannot return \nhim to the embrace of his family, perhaps his shining example will \ninspire other deeds of lifesaving bravery and devotion. He will be \nforever remembered in our community and our country as a hero.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to the Harling family and to everyone \nwho knew and cherished this young man's character.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H751-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPREME COURT STAY ON CLEAN POWER PLAN\n\n  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, every day hardworking American families are \nliving with greater burdens placed upon them by their own Federal \nGovernment. As our constituents struggle to pay their bills and realize \nthe American Dream, they do so under a weight of taxes and burdensome \nregulations from Washington.\n  This week, the working guy or gal actually got a reprieve from one of \nthese costly burdens when the Supreme Court placed a stay on President \nObama's so-called Clean Power Plan. The $480 billion plan--yes, that is \nbillion, with a B--would increase electric rates for millions of \nAmericans. In Kansas, electric utility rates may spike by 30 percent.\n  At townhall meetings with constituents, I rarely have a constituent \ncome up and ask for a 30 percent increase in their electric rates, yet \nWashington will make Americans foot the bill once again.\n  What do we get for the $408 billion in hidden taxes and higher \nelectric utility rates? A potential one one-hundredth of a degree \nreduction in global temperatures.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Supreme Court for placing a hold on this \nBig Government tax on my constituents. Finally, a win for the little \nguy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H751-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT SECTION 702 AND SPYING BY NSA\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the NSA is using a loophole in the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act to spy on Americans without a \nwarrant. Under section 702 of FISA, government agents may seize \ninformation from databases on suspected foreign terrorists.\n  While seizing the information on these terrorists, NSA also seizes \ndata on Americans without a warrant, data that includes emails, texts, \nand voice communication. This is an unlawful interpretation of FISA.\n  It was never the intent of Congress that section 702 would be used to \ncreate databases of information that would later be searched for \ninformation on American citizens without a search warrant and without \nthat individual's knowledge.\n  I have introduced legislation that would prohibit warrantless \nsearches of government databases for information that pertains to U.S. \ncitizens.\n  The NSA has and will continue to violate the constitutional \nprotections guaranteed to every American unless Congress acts. Until we \nfix this and make the law clear, citizens will never be sure or safe \nthat their private conversations are secure from the eyes and spies of \ngovernment.\n  The Bill of Rights cannot be trampled upon in the name of national \nsecurity, whether the NSA likes it or not.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H751-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H751-H752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to bring attention to \nthe recent outstanding achievements of the University of Texas at \nAustin. This public university, which I represent, has continued to \nfulfill the Texas Constitution's mandate that UT be a ``university of \nthe first class.''\n  I regularly meet with President Greg Fenves and Chancellor Admiral \nWilliam McRaven. I would like to praise them for their continued \ndedication to upholding the core values of UT--particularly the \nstudents' and faculty's cutting-edge research and development of new \ntechnologies.\n  A top public university, UT has conducted $650 million worth of \ninnovative scientific and scholarly research. In the past few years, \nthe Cockrell School of Engineering has invented new technologies, \nincluding a device that will improve physical therapy for patients \nrecovering from spinal cord injuries.\n  The Dell Medical School, under the leadership of neurologist Dean \nClay Johnston, is planning to reinvent medical education and healthcare \nthinking. They are transforming the way we learn about health.\n  The students at UT are taught by some of the most brilliant minds in \nthe country. More than 200 members of the National Academies and 12 \nNational Medal of Science recipients serve as UT professors.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the University of Texas at \nAustin on these impressive accomplishments. Our country is proud of \nTexas' flagship university. What starts at the University of Texas \ntruly does change the world.\n  I say, ``Hook 'em.''\n  In God we trust.\n\n[[Page H752]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H752-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING CLAIRE BENTON\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Claire Benton of \nMinnetonka for earning the Congressional Award Silver Medal. The \nCongressional Award is given by Congress to recognize initiative, \nservice, and achievement in young people.\n  In order to earn the Silver Medal, Claire needed to complete over 400 \nhours in voluntary public service, personal development, physical \nfitness, and expedition/exploration. Claire served her community by \nvolunteering at her local public library and spending time as a \ncounselor at an adventure camp. She also reached the physical fitness \ngoals by participating in cardiovascular and endurance activities that \nhelped her increase her running distance from 8 miles to 20.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Award was established in 1979 in order \nto inspire young people like Claire and recognize their efforts to \nbetter themselves.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday we saw the Supreme Court reject \nyet another of President Obama's executive overreaches.\n  The President's effort to unilaterally micromanage electrical power \nplants across the Nation, without any legal authority to do so, would \ndrive up energy costs in virtually every community and nearly half a \ntrillion dollars in additional costs.\n  In just the last few months, Federal courts have rejected the \nPresident's amnesty plan, his EPA's waters of the U.S. power grab, and \nnow his power plant regulation. The message of these decisions is \nclear: the President should abandon his efforts to end-run around \nCongress, which in nearly every case have been found to violate the \nlaw, and work with Congress, the people's House, to address the issues \nfacing our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H752-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JOB LOSSES IN THE COAL INDUSTRY\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of some recently \nlaid-off coal miners from Somerset County, Pennsylvania.\n  For 7 years, President Obama has been targeting their jobs and, in \nthe process, sacrificing the families and communities who depend on \nthose jobs. The Obama Administration is using the EPA to conjure up \nregulations to all but eliminate a major part of the energy industry in \nwestern Pennsylvania.\n  What do you say to a hardworking, middle class dad, who has a wife, \nthree kids, and a mortgage, whose livelihood has been taken away? This \nparticular dad's job is but one of 40,000 jobs that have been lost in \ncoal country. This assault on good, family-sustaining jobs is one of \nthe reasons the average family income has never fully recovered from \nthe Great Recession.\n  Yesterday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen testified about headwinds facing \nthe economy. I suggest there are a number of manmade anthropogenic--to \nborrow a phrase--headwinds, and the EPA's regulatory assault is one of \nthem.\n  Sacrificing the livelihood of hardworking Americans for some personal \npolitical philosophy is unconscionable. I will continue to fight \nagainst the President's war on middle class jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H752-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H752-H760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL GARVER ``MIKE'' OXLEY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mooney of West Virginia).

I include in the Record two eulogies that many of us \nactually heard personally given in Findlay, Ohio, when we attended a \nvery wonderful service for our colleague, Mike Oxley, recently. These \ntwo specific eulogies are from his son, Elvis, and from Jim Conzelman, \nwho is his long-time devoted chief of staff.\n\n                             [Jan. 5, 2016]\n\n                          Eulogy of Mike Oxley\n\n\n                                o-h-i-o\n\n       My name is Michael Chadd Elvis Oxley, son of Patricia and \n     Mike, husband to Jennifer, and father to Maximus Garver \n     Oxley. I stand before you this afternoon to mourn the loss of \n     and celebrate the life of my father.\n       As the joke goes, ``How do you know if someone is vegan or \n     does Cross Fit?'' They'll tell you.\n       Bob Hope\n       Beachboy Al Jardine\n       Orville & Wilbur Wright\n       General William Tecumseh Sherman\n       Archie Griffin\n       Wendy's\n       Cooper Tire\n       Marathon Petroleum\n       Kroger\n       Victoria's Secret\n       You may have heard of these, they're from Ohio. And so was \n     one Michael Garver Oxley.\n       Everyone in this church knows, on average, between 300-500 \n     direct or indirect accounts of where my father's golf ball \n     landed, what club was implemented at the time, and the \n     associated weather conditions, so I won't focus on that \n     today.\n       Looking back now, I see how supremely fortunate I am to \n     have had Mike Oxley as my father. I can go to YouTube, \n     LexisNexis or the Hancock County Historical Museum Oxley \n     Government Center, click a button and see my father in action \n     again. 99% do not have that beautiful blessing, and for that \n     privilege I am thankful and humbled.\n       However, if I may make one request of you when you have a \n     chance: I want your personal stories. Not for attribution, \n     not for publication. I want the insider view into my father \n     from your perspective. I want meat. For instance, a member of \n     the Real Miami staff reached out to me and said how charmed \n     she was that rather than sitting at the big donor table, Dad \n     sat with the staff to ask them about their Miami experience, \n     and it touched her heart. A former Member shared with me \n     yesterday that Dad politely brokered a meeting between him \n     and a Committee Chair so that a public flare up would soon be \n     quelled and that closure could be reached on an important \n     issue.\n       I know all too well where Dad's ball landed, or how the \n     press statements were presented. I selfishly want this living \n     history to be the very marrow on which I can chew when I miss \n     him the most. I want more in a time when I have less.\n       When my father was, so we thought, in his final days in \n     October, Dad pulled me close and reminded me that I tended to \n     get things wrong the first time, but the second time I got \n     them right. He told me he loved me and was proud of me, which \n     is all I could have ever asked for.\n       My father and I had grown closer in my 30's once I had \n     found the love of my life, earned my MBA, and started my own \n     business--all things I did right the second time--our \n     relationship elevated to a much higher level.\n       The next day Dad awoke and decided it was time to have \n     cataract surgery. By that afternoon, with renewed ability to \n     clearly see his Grandson and Buckeye football, Dad had a new \n     zeal for life and a new inspiration to get better. Thank you, \n     Dr. Harry, for extending my father's quality and quantity of \n     life.\n       Quote: ``When the New York Giants, a team you would give \n     your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift--\n     that's something. When everybody down to the groundskeepers \n     and those boys in white coats remember you with trophies--\n     that's something. When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who \n     takes sides with you in squabbles with her own daughter--\n     that's something. When you have a father and a mother who \n     work all their lives so you can have an education and build \n     your body--it's a blessing. When you have a wife who has been \n     a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed \n     existed--that's the finest I know.''\n       ``So I close in saying that I might have been given a bad \n     break, but I've got an awful lot to live for.''\n       Most of you may not know that quote because it is the third \n     stanza after a much more memorable, pithy truth:\n       ``Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about \n     the bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest \n     man on the face of this earth. I have been in ballparks for \n     seventeen years and have never received anything but kindness \n     and encouragement from you fans.''--Lou Gehrig July 4, 1939.\n\n[[Page H753]]\n\n       To me, there could be no more fitting parallel to Dad on so \n     many levels.\n       Dad's Bucket List was largely accomplished:\n       Retired the Roll Call Trophy\n       Visited most continents multiple times\n       Propelled significant legislation in telecom reform, \n     brownfield cleanup, spectrum auction, fractions to decimals, \n     terrorism risk insurance, and anti-fraud.\n       Mentored hundreds of aspiring politicos on both sides of \n     the aisle.\n       Raised countless funds for charities and fellow candidates.\n       Rode an ostrich in Ohio, a camel in Egypt, and Air Force \n     One with Reagan.\n       Fostered the love of golf in his grandson.\n       And shared all of these experiences with his life partner \n     of 44 years.\n       He did everything he could to enjoy one last reunion, one \n     last round of golf, and one last embrace of his family. It \n     was that fighting spirit for which he was known in life as he \n     will be in death.\n       I am so thankful for this outpouring of love and affection \n     and on behalf of the Oxley family we sincerely appreciate you \n     celebrating Dad's life today. This will not be easy for any \n     of us for a while, but I know we will regularly convene over \n     martinis (see thrus) in order to help one another through \n     this. That would be Dad's will.\n       On the night before he passed, my father texted me ``Are \n     you awake?'' which indicated he wanted me to check in on him. \n     This was a simple request to fulfill and I did. \n     Retrospectively, I look at that one layer deeper. ``Awake'' \n     in the ancient Greek is ``Gregorio'' and it takes on a more \n     metaphysical definition--conscious, active, focused, \n     vigilant.\n       Thanks to you, Dad, I am awake. I am very awake.\n                                  ____\n\n       Good afternoon friends and family of Team Oxley!\n       I am Jim Conzelman and had the honor serving as Mike \n     Oxley's Chief of Staff from August of 1981 to January of \n     2007.\n       Pat, Chadd, Jennifer thank you from all of us for sharing \n     ``The Ox'' with us for so many wonderful years.\n       Over the past couple of days, notes have poured in \n     regarding the passing of our friend Mike Oxley. Allow me to \n     read a couple of them to you.\n       ``He was a dear friend, one of the true good guys . . . a \n     rarity in this town, a man of integrity, a great American!'' \n     It goes on and on. Heartfelt notes that mean so much to this \n     family.\n       Simply put, Mike was an extraordinary human being. He was \n     comfortable in his own skin. I remember once Mike telling the \n     staff they could schedule him in any event in the district, \n     ``just do not put me in blue jeans and boots and send me to a \n     farm to talk AG issues. That dog won't hunt.''\n       If you were to look at our office photo album, you would \n     see Mike on many a farm in Ohio's Fourth Congressional \n     District wearing slacks, white shirt with rolled up sleeves \n     talking substantive AG issues with farmers. Mike was very \n     comfortable. He was not a phony, it came through and they \n     loved him. You can understand why.\n       He enjoyed people and respected them as human beings. In \n     all the years I have known Mike I never heard him talk down \n     or poorly about another person. This was especially true with \n     his colleagues in the House. It just wasn't in his DNA to \n     tear someone else down to make himself look better. He was as \n     comfortable talking to friends and neighbors as he was to \n     colleagues in the House, the Senate and even the President of \n     the United States.\n       Mike won in a special election in 1981. President Reagan \n     invited him to come to the White House to meet and have a \n     photo op in the Oval Office. Over breakfast he told son Chadd \n     that he was going to meet the President. Chadd, ever the \n     capitalist, gave Mike his autograph book and asked him to \n     have the President sign it with just his name.\n       The meeting went very well, but ran way over schedule \n     because of Mike's ability to connect with the President. He \n     almost forgot to have the book signed but at the last minute \n     remembered. That night at dinner Chadd was given his book \n     back. To Chadd with best wishes Ronald Reagan. Chadd was not \n     happy. ``Dad I only wanted the President's name. Now with \n     mine on the page it has decreased value if I want to sell it \n     later.''\n       Mike also connected with President George H. W. Bush. He \n     talked to the President, then Vice President to come out to \n     Ohio to do a political event. After the dinner speech, the \n     Vice President and Mrs. Bush mingled with Mike and Pat's \n     friends. The Oxleys had been asked to ride with the Bushes in \n     the motorcade and return to Washington with them on Air Force \n     2. The Secret Service Agent had strict instructions . . . \n     when the VP departs you must be with him. As time went by, \n     Mrs. Bush left the room, Pat Oxley left the room, the Vice \n     President left the room. Mike was engaged in conversation \n     with friends and became totally engrossed in the \n     conversation. Nothing else mattered to him at that time than \n     talking to his friends. I told him . . . ``sir you must \n     leave.''\n       ``In just a minute'', Mike replied. ``No Mike NOW.'' He ran \n     out catching the just as the motorcade pulling out. But that \n     was the way Mike was. When he was talking to you, you were \n     the most important person in the room and you knew it.\n       Another amazing attribute of Mike's was his optimistic \n     outlook on life. Most of this optimism was due to his \n     beautiful bride, Pat Oxley. Pat you never get enough credit \n     for being the only one that kept Mike ever optimistic and \n     grounded. Thank you PAT for all that you did.\n       Do you realize how difficult it was to be an upbeat \n     Republican in 70's and 80's? House Republican's got beat ALL \n     the time . . . in committee, on the floor of the House and \n     even on the field with the Republican Congressional Baseball \n     team.\n       But Mike was always the optimist. He knew we would \n     eventually win and was always looking for opportunities that \n     would help others in our great country . . . such as distant \n     learning, telemedicine, saving Marathon Oil in his hometown \n     of Findlay from a hostile takeover, keeping the Abrahams M-1 \n     Tank in Lima from being mothballed and of course making \n     corporate governance stronger with his signature Sarbanes \n     Oxley legislation.\n       With each of these endeavors, Mike always came prepared. At \n     any hearing, any mark-up, any meeting he always knew his \n     facts and what to say and when to say it. Mike always made a \n     point, but never at anyone's expense. He would show up on \n     time or early to meetings because it was a right thing to do. \n     You would usually find him chatting with staff or witnesses \n     and would stay to the bitter end of a meeting or hearing long \n     after most had left. He would look you straight in the eye \n     and regale you with stories of that 4 letter word . . . . \n     golf, or baseball talking about his beloved Detroit Tigers or \n     basketball in the House gym and beating Congressman Ed \n     Markey, now Senator Markey in the free throw contest. It \n     should be noted Mike never told us when Ed beat him in the \n     contest.\n       He was always prepared with the follow up . . . returning \n     phone calls, and thanking folks for their hard work. Many \n     here today have legislative red-lines they worked on with \n     personal thank you note from Mike. One former staffer told \n     me, ``I was a no body and he thanked me. I will treasure this \n     forever.''\n       All of these Oxley attributes set an example whether it was \n     professional or personal he always did the right thing.\n       Mike loved his family. First decision after being elected \n     to Congress was moving Pat and Chadd to DC.\n       If you look at the official portrait Mike insisted on \n     having the family photo in it. This was PJ and PM. (pre \n     Jennifer Oxley and pre Max Oxley). If he was Chairman today, \n     I know he would have figured out a way to have their likeness \n     photo shopped . . . No artist shopped in.\n       All in all future politicians will go to campaign school to \n     study and learn the Oxley Model.\n       Treating people as human beings and with respect. Being \n     optimistic and looking for opportunities to leave this world \n     a better place than you found it.\n       Being prepared to engage with life . . . showing up on \n     time, thanking everyone, communicating face to face with \n     people.\n       Setting an example by always doing the right thing.\n       H O P E . . . . This is why he was a great Congressman, \n     great Chairman and a great friend to all of us.\n       Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that the important thing is \n     ``not length of life, but depth of life.'' From his family to \n     his friends to his accomplishments, I can't think of a person \n     who led a deeper, fuller, richer life than Mike Oxley.\n       You all know Mike loved music . . . music of the 50's 60's \n     70's . . . 80's no so much. He could identify all the artists \n     and could sing all of the lyrics. He was seldom wrong. Allow \n     me close with a song that was #1 in 1973 that written and \n     sung by the late John Denver. It goes like this--\n\n     Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy,\n     Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry.\n     Sunshine on the water looks so lovely,\n     Sunshine almost always makes me high.\n     If I had a day that I could give you,\n     I'd give to you the day just like today.\n     If I had a song that I could sing for you,\n     I'd sing a song to make you feel this way.\n     If I had a tale that I could tell you,\n     I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile.\n     If I had a wish I could wish for you,\n     I'd make a wish for sunshine for you all the while.\n       Thank you Mike for touching our lives and making the sun \n     shine on all of us.\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Mike Oxley, who \nserved in this body for 25 years and who, sadly, passed away from lung \ncancer on January 1 of this year. Today would have been Mike's 72nd \nbirthday, and he will be missed by those of us who had the pleasure and \nthe honor of knowing him. I served with Mike in this House for 12 \nyears, from 1995 to 2007, and I will always remember that time very \nfondly.\n  Mike Oxley was a lot of things: an attorney, an investigator, a \nleader, a competitor, an avid golfer, and so many more things. He was \ndedicated to serving his community and serving the people of the State \nof Ohio and the people of our entire country.\n  Mike graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1966. \nSpeaker Ryan, my son, and many other distinguished people are graduates \nof Miami University in Oxford. Mike graduated with a degree in \npolitical science and\n\n[[Page H754]]\n\nobtained his law degree from Ohio State University.\n  Following law school, Mike was a special agent with the FBI, working \nprimarily in Washington, Boston, and New York. In that position, he \nlearned a number of investigative skills that he would later use here \nin Congress.\n  After his time with the FBI, Mike returned to Ohio and began a \nprivate law practice, but he was called to service once again when he \nwas elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1972. He served in \nthe Ohio House until 1981, when he was elected to Congress in a special \nelection to fill a vacancy upon the death of Congressman Tennyson \nGuyer. Mike would represent the people of Ohio's Fourth Congressional \nDistrict for the next 25 years.\n  Upon his retirement from Congress in 2007, Mike continued to find \nways to serve our Nation when he was in the private sector. He was a \nmember of the board of trustees for the University of Findlay. He \nremained active at his alma mater, Miami University. Most recently, he \nwas a senior adviser on the board of directors of NASDAQ OMX Group, \nInc.\n  After being diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, a type of lung \ncancer usually affecting nonsmokers like Mike, he joined the board of \ndirectors of the Lung Cancer Alliance. He would dedicate much of his \nremaining time in fighting lung cancer, including serving as chairman \nof the Lung Cancer Alliance board, beginning in 2014.\n  Mike was a very good man. He really was. He was a family man. In \nfact, his wife, Pat; his son, Elvis; his grandson, Max; and other \nfamilies members; as well as his chief of staff, Jim Conzelman, are \nwith us in the gallery this evening.\n  As they know, he loved life. He had a very infectious laugh. He was a \ngolf enthusiast. He loved sports of all sorts and regularly played \npickup basketball with other Members.\n  For many who served with him, we will never forget his dedication to \nthe congressional baseball team and the baseball game. He viewed the \ngame as a chance for Members from both sides of the aisle to put aside \ntheir differences and engage in a friendly contest of America's \npastime, all while raising money for charitable causes. But that didn't \nmean he didn't want to win. He did.\n  In fact, he was so dedicated to the game that he was always trying to \nrecruit new players to improve the Republican's prospects on the \ndiamond. Not surprisingly, in the eight games that Ox managed the \nRepublican team, we beat the Democrats seven times. We have gone \ndownhill from there.\n  At times, though, Mike's competitive streak may have gotten the best \nof him. In the 1994 game, Ox was playing first base when then-\nRepresentative, now-Senator Sherrod Brown was racing to beat out a \nground ball. As Ox reached for an errant throw, the two men collided \nand Mike broke his arm. You would think that might discourage him from \nplaying in the future, but the very next year there was Ox taking the \nfield again and leading the Republican team.\n  That is who Mike Oxley was: a true competitor who never backed down \nfrom a challenge. Yet he approached challenges, whether it was the \ncongressional baseball team or a divisive fight here on the House \nfloor, with a positive, optimistic demeanor, a smile on his face, and \nusually a kind word for those in the opposition. Put another way, he \nwould disagree without being disagreeable, which is an admirable trait \nand an invaluable skill in all areas of life.\n  Here is what I will remember most about Mike Oxley: he was a friend, \na colleague, and, more importantly, he was a decent, genuine family man \nwho was gracious and well-liked by everyone who had the pleasure of \nserving with him.\n  He will be missed.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  To Mike's wife, Pat, his son Elvis, his grandson Max, and the entire \nOxley family, please know that those of us who knew Mike are saddened \nby your loss, but we appreciate the time you allowed us to spend with \nhim here in the United States Congress. You are in our thoughts and our \nprayers. God bless all of you.\n  There are many other Members who will be sharing some of their \nremembrances here during this Special Order. I would like at this point \nto turn to one of our colleagues also from Ohio who was a very, very \ngood friend of Mike Oxley and just a great American himself, the \ngentleman from the great State of Ohio (Mr. Tiberi).\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, how significant and beautiful that today, \nthe day of Mike Oxley's birth, we celebrate his glorious and beautiful \nlife. Thank you, Pat. Thank you, Chadd Elvis. Thank you, Jennifer and \ngrandson Max. Thanks to all of you for sharing Mike Oxley with us, as \nMr. Chabot said: It was really a special, special honor.\n  I met the Ox when I was a senior in college, a congressional staffer \nfor then Congressman John Kasich. I got asked to help staff an event \nthat Congressman Oxley and Congressman Kasich did here in Washington, \nD.C. It was called a Washington Fly-In. Here this Congressman by the \nname of Mike Oxley met me and was as nice to me as he was to his \ncolleagues at this fly-in, as a young guy who came in for this event \nfrom Ohio.\n  Ironic that 15 years later--we didn't know--that I would be his \ncolleague. He treated me the same then, the same throughout the time \nthat I knew Mike. The way that he treated people was kind of \ninspirational for a really important guy. He led in that way, too. His \nstaff treated people, whether they be here in Washington or back in \nOhio, with the same type of respect that their boss treated people.\n  After that election in 2000, we had a freshman orientation. I \nreplaced the man that I had worked for in the 1980s and early 1990s, \nJohn Kasich. I was at this freshman orientation filling out this form \nfor committee assignments.\n  Another Congressman from our delegation, who seemed to be the \nchairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, came up to me \nand said: Well, you know, just fill out that form and put Financial \nServices, a brand-new committee to be chaired by Mike Oxley, and \nEducation and Workforce, a committee that is going to be chaired by me, \nas your committees because that is what you are going to get.\n  I said to then Congressman Boehner, well, Committee on Financial \nServices sounds really good, Committee on Education and the Workforce \nnot so much.\n  So I filled out my form, and I put Committee on Financial Services \namong some other committees. I excluded Education and the Workforce. \nAbout 10 days later, I got my committee assignments, Committee on \nFinancial Services and Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n  I told my new chairman, Mike Oxley, the story. I said: Was this thing \nwired? In his glorious, special way, he got that grin, and he just \nlaughed, as Mike Oxley often did. He was such a cheerful guy. He was a \nspecial chairman.\n  I didn't realize then how lucky I was to have Mike Oxley as a \nchairman for 6 years on this brand-new committee. Every year that went \nby, more and more Members wanted to be on this committee. It was \nobviously an important committee, but they also wanted to be on a \ncommittee chaired by Mike Oxley. His disposition was great, but he also \nwas such a team guy. It was just in his blood that he wanted to get \nthings done, and he wanted to help the team, the team being our \nRepublican Conference, the team being the Congress, the team being \nmembers of the Committee on Financial Services.\n  I remember one day we were doing a delegation meeting, and during the \nmeeting Mike said: I am going to do an event for one of the members of \nour Committee on Financial Services. If you have nothing going on, why \ndon't you join me? I am driving. We get into his car, and out blares \nBeach Boys music, which obviously was one of Mike's favorites.\n  As we are listening to the song, I am thinking how ironic, this makes \nso much sense. It made sense then; it makes sense now, going back to a \nsimpler time. Mike was pretty simple in how he was a Congressman and \nhow he was a chairman. It wasn't about him. It was never about him. \nThat is why he was such a great mentor.\n  It was about moving the issues forward. He put newer members or \nsubcommittee chairmen in charge of issues. He helped us through it. \nWhen the light shone, he ignored it. He shared it, he put us out in \nfront. It was about the team.\n  As Mr. Chabot mentioned, he was a great manager for the congressional\n\n[[Page H755]]\n\nbaseball team for the Republicans. He was a manager as our chairman. He \nwas a great manager as our chairman. We learned a lot. We learned a lot \nfrom Mike Oxley--not just members of the committee, but staff members, \nso many people who have come through this building, who have come \nthrough the Rayburn Building. He was a mentor.\n  He made a lot of people who touched his life better. He made me \nbetter as a Member of Congress. He made me better as a person, and I \nappreciate that, Pat. We thank you for having you share him with us. \nGod bless you all.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman. We greatly appreciate the \ngentleman's comments here this evening.\n  I now yield to another gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan who \nhad distinguished service in this body for 25 years and made a huge \ndifference for everyday Americans for 25 years. Today would be his \nbirthday, Congressman Mike Oxley, Chairman Mike Oxley, who made a huge \ndifference.\n  I did not have the honor of serving with Congressman Oxley, but what \nI did have was a chance to meet him and have him be an adviser and a \nmentor. When I got here and got on the Committee on Financial Services, \na committee that he was formerly the chairman of, he took me under his \nwing. He introduced me to hundreds of people. He helped me find my way \nhere. He helped make sure I got on the path to being a good legislator. \nHe did that, not really knowing me before that.\n  He became a great friend, a great mentor, and a great adviser. I am \nreally thankful that he was willing to share his time and energy and \ntalents with a guy like me. I want to thank his wife, Pat, his son \nChadd, and all the whole Oxley family for letting him share his life, \neven after he left Congress, with folks who were coming in brand new, \ntrying to make a difference.\n  He will be remembered as somebody who made a difference for all \nAmericans who wanted to figure out how to make sure they could invest \ntheir life savings and not be taken advantage of. Obviously, the famous \nbill that bears his name was part of a bipartisan response to the Enron \ncrisis. He deserves the credit for saving our financial system and \nmaking sure it was safe and sound in the future for all Americans.\n  He would always take on tough issues. He would always work with \npeople across the aisle. That is who he was and what he did. He served \nthe people of his district proudly, and he worked to bring people \ntogether. He was loyal, optimistic, and pragmatic. Even though he was a \nstrong Republican, he would work with Republicans and Democrats to get \nthings done. I think there is a lot that we could all emulate from Mike \nOxley's service. We could learn a lot today and in the future.\n\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Pat, and the entire Oxley \nfamily during this difficult time. Even during his time when he had \nlung cancer, he was optimistic and happy and helping other people. I \nknow he has got to be a tough guy to lose and not have around every day \nbecause he brightened everybody's day. I know I miss him, and I know \nyou will miss him, and America misses Mike Oxley, and they should.\n  I hope that in saying good-bye today, we can honor his incredible \nlegacy that he left and the difference he made for America into the \nfuture. I just want to remember Mike Oxley as the incredible patriot \nand friend and mentor that he was and say Godspeed, Mike Oxley.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman. This is a bipartisan evening, so I \nwould now like to recognize our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. David Scott).\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise to say some \nwords for a very, very, very good man, Mike Oxley. When I came to \nCongress in the year of 2002, I was assigned to the Committee on \nFinancial Services, and that is where I met Mike Oxley. Our lives \nintertwined. He was a tremendous help to me on that committee as I was \nbreaking in.\n  I am very delighted, and it opened my eyes to a world which I was \nonly dimly aware when he asked if I would join him as one of the \nMembers to travel to Scotland and to Europe and to be able to visit and \nto sit with other bankers and financial people to learn the importance \nof finance, to learn how it is important for the United States to stay \ntotally in front and to maintain our financial system as the most \npowerful system in the world.\n  In order to do that, you have to get across the world and talk with \nother financial systems. I found out, and it took me going over there \nto the Bank of Scotland to realize why Mike Oxley wanted to do that, \nbecause very few people knew--and I didn't know--that the Royal Bank of \nScotland was the fifth largest bank in the United States. To go to \nEurope and to meet with the finance ministers in Europe, in Brussels, \nin Paris, and the reason for that was because there was the emerging \nmarkets of derivatives and swaps, which was just a burgeoning part of \nthe economy. Now it is an $800 trillion piece of the world's economy.\n  I went and learned so much there. We went to make sure that the \nUnited States had what would be seen as equivalency, to be able to deal \nwith these other nations and their financial systems and banking \nsystems. Then to come back, and roughly 8, 9 years later, and I am \nsitting now as the ranking member on the subcommittee in Congress that \ndeals with derivatives and swaps. Quite honestly, ladies and gentlemen, \nwhen I went with Mike Oxley, I did not know what a derivative was.\n  Now, Mike and I became friends. When you travel with people, you get \nto know them, you get to share things with them. I came back, and Mike \nOxley comes to me one day. I am wondering what this is about.\n  He said: David, I have got to see you; David, I have got to see you.\n  I said: Mike, what is it? What is it?\n  He said: I heard that your brother-in-law is home run king Hank \nAaron. Can I meet him?\n  Everybody knows that Mike Oxley loved baseball. He loved baseball I \nam sure almost as much as he loved politics. I know his family knows \nhow much he loved baseball.\n  I said: Sure, sure.\n  It was a great evening when Hank came back up. I had dinner, and I \ninvited Mike Oxley to join me and his guests with me and my wife and \nHank Aaron, my wife's brother, for dinner at The Capital Grille. Ladies \nand gentlemen, what an evening that was. I mean, to be there and to \nhear Mike Oxley and home run king Hank Aaron talk baseball, two great \nAmericans loving America's pastime.\n  I remember at one point Mike Oxley said: Hank, can I ask you a \nquestion?\n  So Hank said: Sure.\n  He said: Who was the toughest pitcher who ever pitched against you?\n  Hank said: All of them, all of them.\n  Mike said: All of them, all of them.\n  We would carry that story many times in our conversations.\n  He said: Oh, man, I will never forget that, when Hank said ``All of \nthem.''\n  A great man. You know, we all live a life. There are three things \nthat we all are going to see on that gravestone: the year we were born \nand the year we died, but then there is that other thing. There is that \ndash in the middle, and the question in everybody's life is, what did \nyou do with your dash, that period from when you were born to when the \nLord calls you home.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mike Oxley did a tremendous amount. One of the things he did was \ntouch my life. Mike Oxley helped me. Mike Oxley was my friend.\n  I know everybody joins me in saying from the bottom of our hearts to \nthe family, to this Congress, to the people of America: We thank God \nfor sending Mike Oxley our way.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank Mr. Scott for his tribute to our colleague and \nfriend, Mike Oxley.\n  I learned something here this evening. I did not know that I had Mr. \nScott's brother-in-law's picture up on my wall. He was here in \nWashington 15 years ago or so, and I was like a kid meeting one of his \nheroes. I got a picture with him, and it is hanging on my wall.\n  I yield to my colleague also from Ohio, Mr. Latta.\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, to Pat and Elvis, again, you have heard such \ngreat tributes not only at the funeral not too many weeks back, but \nthis last week in the memorial service in Findlay, and with the Members \nhere tonight.\n  I will go back. I can remember Mike's first race that he ran for the\n\n[[Page H756]]\n\nOhio General Assembly. I was in high school at the time. I used to \ndrive my dad around the district, so we would run into each other quite \noften while we were campaigning.\n  I know that one of my aunts from Putnam County thought that Mike was \njust about perfect. She used to rave about Mike all the time. That is \nthe type of person he was. He had an infectious smile, a great laugh, \nand he could connect with people.\n  As you have heard from many of the folks speaking here tonight, that \nis what made Mike such a great individual. He knew how to reach out and \ntouch people and how to get those people to work together and make \nthings actually work.\n  One of the times I will never forget is back in 1981, after Tenny \nGuyer passed away, the election was taking place that summer. I was \nstudying for the bar at the same time, but I can still remember \neverything that was going on. They were tough times. Having gone \nthrough a special election myself, I know what those things are like. \nMike was one of those kinds of individuals that things didn't affect \nhim; he just went into it and got things done.\n  One of the things I mentioned just last week at the memorial service \nis what my dad taught me years ago. There are two types of people that \nget into public service. There are folks that want to be politicians \nand there are folks that want to be true public servants.\n  He said to always remember what the difference between a politician \nand a public servant is. A politician is a person who goes out there \nand sees how much they can take from the people they represent for \ntheir own benefit, while a public servant sees how much they can give \nof themselves back to the people they represent. That was Mike. He was \nthat true, dedicated public servant.\n  With redistricting over the years, I have several of the counties \nthat Mike represented. I can tell you that when I am out, it is quite \noften that I have people come up to me and tell me about something that \nMike did for them. I don't care if it was Social Security, a veteran's \ncase, or Medicare, you name it, people remember those things because \nMike was out there. He was a very caring person because, again, he \nnever forgot the folks back home.\n  When you talk about the folks back home, Mike never forgot his roots \nin Findlay, Hancock County. Hancock county is my dad's home county. \nThere are great people that live there.\n  Mike and Pat were very, very generous to the University of Findlay \nand one of the buildings there. Mike, as the chairman mentioned, served \non the Board of Trustees. He was very, very influential with his \nservice. He gave of his time. He wanted to make sure he left things \nbetter than he found them. He did this with helping Miami University, \nhis alma mater, and with the Findlay-Hancock Community Foundation, \nwhere Mike and Pat were so generous in establishing a scholarship.\n  One of the things I would really like to talk about is that one of \nthe things Mike really believed in was the Hancock Historical Society. \nThey established the Mike Oxley Government Center. I remember the day \nthe Center was dedicated not more than 2 years ago. Then-Speaker \nBoehner came up. It is one of those things that I think people need to \ngo and see.\n  Again, Mike truly wanted to leave things better than he found them. \nHe also believed the best way to do that is to educate our kids. There \nis an interactive center where people can go in--especially children--\nand learn about their government.\n  Mike said this is the greatest form of government that the world has \never seen. To make sure you have that government go on to the next \ngeneration, you have to make sure that the children and those students \nknow what to do when they become adults. Sometimes it is too late once \nthey become adults and don't learn these things.\n  At the Oxley Government Center, it is in perpetuity now. The children \nin Hancock will have that opportunity to learn about the greatest form \nof government the world has ever created and make sure that it does \ncontinue on. He really, truly believed that our children are our \nfuture.\n  To get into it again, as my dad said, you want to make sure that you \nare a true public servant, to give of yourself not 90 percent, not 100 \npercent, but 110 percent. That is what Mike did.\n  Again, that legacy is going to continue on because the people back \nhome will never forget it. As I am out in the district that Mike \nrepresented, as I said, I hear it from his former constituents. It is \nnot that they just like Mike, they loved him.\n  Again, Pat and Elvis, from the bottom of our hearts Marcia and I \noffer our deepest sympathies. The world was a much better place because \nMike Oxley was in it.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his very nice \nremarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida, Dr. Ileana Ros-\nLehtinen.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank Mr. Chabot for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  It is funny that the gentleman should call me Dr. Ileana Ros-\nLehtinen, because I do have my doctorate from the University of Miami. \nOne of the rivalries that I enjoyed with Mike Oxley is that he would \nwear this obnoxious Miami shirt whenever we were at the Congressional \nBaseball Team practice. I said: That is the fake Miami. I would wear my \nUniversity of Miami T-shirt and he would remind me all the time that \nMiami University was the first.\n  I am so pleased and so honored to be part of this Special Order that \nhas been organized by my dear friend, Mr. Chabot of Ohio--he really is; \nwe have such similar backgrounds--in remembrance of a colleague and a \ndear friend, the late Congressman Mike Oxley. I am not from Ohio. As \nyou heard, I am from Florida.\n  Mike and I served together here in the people's House for over 15 \nyears. When I got here in 1989, Mike had already been serving for a few \nyears, and I looked upon him with great respect. He was a man who was \ndriven by his commitment to his constituents. I was always very \nimpressed with that.\n  He served his great State of Ohio and our Nation with great \ndedication, integrity, and efficiency. These were qualities that were \nseen in his work throughout his years of service in the United States \nCongress.\n\n  As chair, as we heard, of the Financial Services Committee, Mike was \nknown to reach across the aisle. You have heard speaker after speaker \ntalk about how bipartisan he was in ensuring that every American could \nprosper.\n  He worked on bills ranging from the interest of the financial sector \nto the improvement of commerce to the enhancement of emergency \nmanagement always with the consumer--always with the American people in \nmind. It was during his tenure that we were able to pass bills like the \nFair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that allows consumers access \nto free credit reports, which reduces identity theft.\n  Mike Oxley was a born leader, a natural leader. He was coauthor of a \nbill that sought to fight corporate fraud. We thank him for that. He \nwas guided by the principle of economic prosperity and what made \nAmerica great. His legislative record and legacy speak for themselves.\n  He was a kind man. He was good to all of the Members. That is why so \nmany of us are here saying good things about him. He deserves that and \nmore. He was enthusiastic about public service. He had a work ethic \nthat is sorely missed in the people's House.\n  I had a special relationship with Mike because, as I pointed out, he \nwas a player and then manager of the Congressional Baseball Game, which \nI foolishly joined many years back when I was younger and thinner and \nfitter.\n  Encouraged by Mike, I actually became the first woman to get on base \nin this traditional game. Mike made sure that this charity--it really \nis a charity game--was able to generate thousands of dollars for \nvarious charities around this great town.\n  Though Mike is no longer with us, we should not be mourning the loss \nof a life, but celebrating an extraordinary life lived. May Mike's \nmemory live forever in our hearts and in our minds.\n  Mr. Chabot is doing the same thing that Mike Oxley would do by \nleading this great tribute to a Member of Congress. I thank Mr. Chabot \nfor his leadership.\n  And I thank Mike. I know that you are enjoying a good, cold beer and \na great baseball game in heaven.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlewoman very much for her very nice \nremarks this evening.\n\n[[Page H757]]\n\n  I yield to another Buckeye, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), \nchairman of the Freedom Caucus and a dear colleague of ours.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Normally, I don't have prepared remarks when I come to \nthe floor, but I thought when you are honoring someone like former \nCongressman Oxley, it is best to have them in written form.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues from Ohio and across the Nation in \npaying tribute to former Congressman Michael G. Oxley, who passed away \nat the beginning of the year after a battle with lung cancer. I thank \nmy colleague from Cincinnati, Mr. Chabot, for putting together this \nSpecial Order on what would have been his 72nd birthday.\n  Mike was one of the finest and most respected public servants Ohio \nhas ever known. He was tireless in his promotion of his hometown of \nFindlay and all of Ohio's Fourth Congressional District: its people, \nbusinesses, and institutions.\n  His work on behalf of Lima's Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, \ncommonly known as the Tank Plant, helped preserve that vital facility \nand its skilled workforce for a long, long time, ensuring that it \nremains open today to make the armaments that our Armed Forces need to \nkeep our great country safe.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues who have already spoken about some of \nMike's many accomplishments. I want to share something perhaps lesser \nknown about this individual: his longtime connection to Buckeye Boys \nState, a week-long educational exercise for high school boys hosted by \nthe American Legion of Ohio.\n  Mike attended this program as a young man, and always said that it \nhelped prepare him for a career in public service. From 1978 through \n2006, he was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremony--an event \nthat he often said was one of his favorites of the year.\n  In these speeches, he encouraged Boys Staters to develop a clear \nvision, set high goals, work hard, and act with integrity at all times. \nThese life lessons, no doubt, inspired the many thousands of young men \nwho have had the privilege of attending Boys State during that \ntimeframe. Mike took great pride in being inducted into the Buckeye \nBoys State Hall of Fame, an honor shared by a select few, among them \nbeing Neil Armstrong.\n  Of course, the titles Mike held most dear were of husband, father, \nand grandfather. Our prayers continue to go out to his family. I know \nthey are joining us here today. We offer them our sincerest condolences \nat this difficult time.\n  Mr. Speaker, we remain grateful that decent men like Mike Oxley are \nwilling to commit their lives to public service and to inspire others \nto do the same.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nLucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. I thank Chairman Chabot for the opportunity to visit this \nday about our friend and old colleague.\n  Mr. Speaker, I came to this body in May of 1994 in a special \nelection; and I can't remember whether it was that day or the next day \nor the day after, but that is when I met Mike.\n  He had a way of charming and disarming you, a way of being warm. \nMike, from that very first moment, referenced me as ``Big Frank.'' Now, \nI am not sure whether he was representing height or girth, but that was \nhis affectionate term.\n  He noted to me in that first conversation we had that he, too, had \nbeen a ``special election baby'' and that I was pursuing the route that \nhe pursued, not coming in as a part of a big class, but coming in by \nmyself, as he had done in 1981, getting to know the Members, working \nthe way to the committee that I would want to be on, as he had done.\n  He had a very open-arms sort of a fashion. Now, I will confess that, \neven at that point, I understood in those days, as a member of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, an E guy, the unique nature of that \ncommittee. But he was always kind and warm to me.\n  And when, as the result of a great compromise--actually, a statement, \nwhen we became a part of the majority then not that many months later--\nbecause Mike had served in the minority from 1981 until we became the \nmajority in 1995, in January. He had served in the minority. He \nunderstood both sides of the perspective.\n  Ultimately, in the great compromise of 2001, when he came to be \nchairman of what used to be the Banking and Urban Affairs Committee, \nthe Financial Services Committee, and brought substantial new \njurisdictions to the committee, Mike made a huge difference.\n  Suddenly, it went from the committee that Members wanted off of to \none of those committees that everyone wanted to be on. Suddenly, it \nbecame a committee of action that wasn't just a constant battle over \nwhether Karl Marx or Adam Smith was right, but a committee that made a \ndifference.\n  And the way he worked with both Republicans and Democrats, the way he \naddressed the crises that we dealt with--Sarbanes-Oxley being a major \nexample of a piece of reform legislation that no one ever thought would \noccur; that was Mike Oxley.\n  As my friends have said before and my friends will say after me, an \namazing fellow, a charming personality, a kind of individual that I \nwould describe as an old-school Member of Congress, an old-school \nchairman.\n  What do I mean by that? Someone who cared about this place and cared \nabout the Members. Sometimes that is absent now in what we do. But he \ncared about the institution, and he cared about the membership. He \ncared about the country, and it was demonstrated in his work product.\n  I am a better person, a better Member of Congress, for having served \nwith Mike from the day I walked in here in 1994 until his retirement at \nthe end of 2006, a better Member.\n  I think this place is better for him having been a Member.\n  The only regret I have is that there are not more Mike Oxleys out \nthere; there are not more Mike Oxleys out there. But, you know, his \nlegacy, I think, should lead all of us to try and emulate the way he \nconducted himself, the way he focused, the way he worked. If we do \nthat, then his spirit will live on.\n  Again, Chairman Chabot, thank you for the opportunity to come and \nvisit about my friend and the fellow that I served with for half of his \ncareer in Congress.\n  And to the family, thank you for having shared him with us for all \nthose years, all those years. Thank you.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his tremendous \nremarks here this evening. And we really do appreciate his recollection \nof his time shared up here with Mike.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio especially \nfor taking the time to organize this very appropriate tribute to Mike \nOxley.\n  Do you ever get one of those people that you walk into a room and you \nmake eye contact, and you just get a smile on your face? That was Mike \nOxley.\n  It was just that moment which, that sense of fun was part of that \noriginal contact. And I can remember it as fresh today, the first time \nI met Mike Oxley.\n  But it wasn't as a Member of Congress that I really became aware of \nMike Oxley. It was some years ago, in a previous time, when I had been \na United States attorney serving in the Department of Justice.\n  It was a very serious time for our country because it was in the \nimmediate aftermath of the Enron crisis, one in which Americans all \nover the country, and many small investors, began to have a concern \nabout the integrity of the very institutions which they had entrusted \nsome of their resources.\n  As a member of the United States Attorney's Office, I was appointed \nby the President to be sitting with other U.S. attorneys and a number \nof cabinet members on something called the Corporate Fraud Task Force. \nIt was the group, under the auspices of Michael Chertoff, which was \nresponsible for initiating the investigations and the prosecutions into \nthose who had committed the corporate misdeeds.\n  But, at the same time, we were aware that while we were going \nbackwards\n\n[[Page H758]]\n\nand looking at conduct that had taken place, the real challenge was \nmoving forward. How do you instill a sense of confidence back in the \nvery institutions which people have relied on for their economic \nconfidence?\n  It was a guy on a committee here in Washington, D.C., who understood \nthe essence of what this was all about. And it wasn't a huge, 2,000-\npage bill with all kinds of regulations en gros; it was a bill that was \nbuilt on a very simple principle.\n  I think, in many ways, it reflected who Mike Oxley was, from his days \nas an FBI agent, but somebody who knew that, when you were in a \nposition of power or responsibility, you had that responsibility to \nthose below you, and your obligation and your word needed to be \nconnected with that.\n  And when it really drilled down it, that was the essence of what \nSarbanes-Oxley was all about, the idea that you would certify, if you \nwere the fiduciary, that you knew the accuracy but, really, the \nunderlying integrity of that information because it represented the \nlittle people.\n  So when I came to see Mike Oxley for the first time, and it was by \nthe good fortune to be part of something called the Ripon Society, and \nhis former chief of staff, Jim Conzelman, runs that program. And I was \ninvited in, as a young freshmen Representative, to become part of this \norganization which has a tremendous purpose.\n  You see a guy named Mike Oxley for the first time. You know of him, \nbut you have never really met him. And I think about that reputation. \nGee, this guy is a pretty important guy. What it is going to be like?\n  But he is the kind of guy that sits you down and says: Hey, why don't \nyou sit here and have a cup of coffee with me. And it's a funny story \nabout a golf game he may have had, a couple of observations about some \nof the things you might be thinking about as a young Member of \nCongress, and an arm around your shoulder and says: If you ever need \nme, let me know. I'm happy to be there for you.\n  Anytime I ever saw Mike Oxley from that point forward, it was that \nsame sense, a little smile, probably a little story about his last \nround of golf, and always a warm feeling.\n  Mike is going to leave quite a legacy. But when you think about what \nit stands for, the two things that I saw in him in the very end, first \nand most significantly, the work that he had done with that bill which \nwill not only bear his name moving forward but will forever leave that \nsense of responsibility and integrity associated with our fiduciary \nresponsibilities in that financial space.\n  But it was also this powerful guy, Mike Oxley, who used that \ninfluence that he had, after he had contracted cancer, to turn that \ninto a positive and make that a part of his mission in life, to use \nthat influence he had to gather other people around him who were \npowerful and wealthy and, otherwise, to focus on moving forward with \nfinding the way that we can continue to treat and ultimately cure those \nwith cancer.\n  It is a tremendous legacy and one in which I would hope any one of \nus, as one of my previous colleagues had said, we wish that we could \nfill that dash between the beginning of life and the end of life with \nsuch fullness, with such integrity and such fun.\n  Thank you, Mike, for what you did for all of us.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for his very poignant remarks this \nevening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton). And \none of the things that Joe Barton is known for--he is known for many, \nmany things around here--but one of the things he is known for was when \nMike Oxley was no longer the coach of the baseball team, he turned over \nthe reins to Joe Barton.\n  Mr. BARTON. I thank the gentleman. I appreciate being one of the \neulogists for Mike Oxley.\n  I am going to go at this a little bit differently than the other \nspeakers. I am going to talk about Mike Oxley as the baseball player \nand manager of the Republican baseball team.\n  I didn't get here until 1985. I assume that Mike immediately became \nthe starting first baseman for the Republican baseball team when he got \nelected in the special election.\n  The photograph to my left shows the baseball team from 1992. And in \nhis beloved Cincinnati Reds uniform, next to some skinny kid from \nTexas, is Mike Oxley. Carl Purcell of Michigan was our manager. I was \non that team. Mike was on that team. Dan Schaefer of Colorado, who \nlater became the manager; Jack Fields; Jim Nussle; Governor John \nKasich, who is now running for President; Chris Smith, who is still in \nthe House; Rick Santorum, who later became a Senator and a Presidential \ncandidate; Dean Gallo. And the skinny guy on the very left is the \ncurrent chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton.\n  Mike was a hard-hitting first baseman. He was a very good player. And \nmy favorite story on the baseball team, we were playing out in Virginia \nat the old Four Mile Run Park, and we weren't playing in the fancy \nNationals Stadium like we are today.\n  Mike was in his customary position at first base. I was the pitcher. \nThey hit a pop fly down the first base line. And the Democratic runner \nwho had hit the fly was running to first base, and he ran into Mike.\n  Mike fell to the ground. He didn't catch the pop fly, and he began \nwrithing around on the ground, holding his wrist.\n  You know, we have to be honest. Mike was known as somewhat of a \njokester and a prankster, and I thought he was kidding. I didn't think \nhe had hurt himself. So I went over and kind of kicked him in the ribs \nand said, get up, let's get going. He said: No, no. I'm hurt. I'm hurt.\n  They took him to the bench, and we finished the inning. Even when we \ngot over onto the bench, he was still holding his wrist. And I kidded \nhim again. I said: Mike, come on. You have got to get back in the game.\n  Well, they took him to the emergency room; and, as his wife, Pat, \nknows, he had broken his wrist. He actually broke his wrist. So from \nthen on, I never kidded him about things like that.\n  When Dan Schaefer, who was the manager right before Mike Oxley, \nretired, the tradition on the baseball team is that the current manager \npicks the next manager.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  So Dan Schaefer called Mike and me into his office and said: Which \none of you two wants to become the next manager?\n  We both said that we wanted to become the next manager. Mike had \nseniority on me by 2 years--maybe 3 years.\n  I said: Well, I will be the assistant coach, and, Mike, you can be \nthe manager if that is the way Dan wants to do it.\n  Mike looked at me, and he said: I will only do it one time.\n  I said: Okay.\n  Well, that one time turned out to be about 12 years. He was the \nmanager for 12 years. Every year he would say to me: Joe, this is the \nlast one, the last one.\n  But about the time he became manager, we became the majority. We \nelected a bunch of really good baseball players: J.C. Watts, who had \nbeen an all-American quarterback at Oklahoma; Steve Largent, who was in \nthe NFL Hall of Fame; Chip Pickering; Zach Wamp--really good players. \nSo we won 10 or 11 games in a row against the Democrats, and Mike \nenjoyed being the winner. So as those guys began to retire, Mike \ndecided that it might be time to turn it over.\n  I have right here the last trophy that the Republicans won. It is \ntrue that we actually used to win baseball games. We have lost six in a \nrow. But when Mike was the manager, we won, I think, 10 or 11 in a row. \nThe trophy is in my office. There is Mike Oxley, the manager, and Joe \nBarton, who is the assistant coach, the last trophy that the \nRepublicans won.\n  He was a great manager, he was a great player, and he was a great \nguy.\n  Now I want to switch over from his baseball career to his legislative \ncareer. He is remembered as the chairman of what we now call the \nFinancial Services Committee. Before that, Mike was on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee. When the Republicans took the majority in 1995, Tom \nBliley became the chairman. Mike Oxley became one of his subcommittee \nchairmen, one of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee chairmen. I \nserved on Energy and Commerce with Mike Oxley.\n\n[[Page H759]]\n\n  He was an excellent subcommittee chairman. He did his homework. As \nhas been pointed out, he was very bipartisan. He worked with the \nothers, the Democrats, on the other side of the aisle.\n  After Tom Bliley retired, we term-limited our chairmen to three terms \nor 6 years. So in 2001, we had to pick a new chairman for Energy and \nCommerce. Billy Tauzin had been on the committee as a Democrat. He had \nswitched parties and was a Republican. So the top two contenders to be \nchairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee were Mike Oxley of Ohio, \nlongtime Republican, excellent legislator, and Billy Tauzin of \nLouisiana, who had been a Democrat and then became a Republican.\n  It was a pretty hotly contested race. It divided the committee. It \ndivided the House. I was on the steering committee at the time \nrepresenting Texas. It was a close vote. Billy Tauzin was picked to be \nchairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; but because of the \nesteem and respect that Mike Oxley was held in--he had served on what \nwas called the Banking Committee, but he had never been a subcommittee \nchairman--he was elevated to be chairman of the Banking Committee and \ngiven the securities jurisdiction that had long been at Energy and \nCommerce, renamed the committee the Financial Services Committee, and \nhe became the chairman of the Financial Services Committee and did just \nan outstanding job there. Sarbanes-Oxley is probably the most notable \nlegislative achievement in his tenure as chairman.\n  He was a great person and a good friend. I never saw him down or \nunhappy. He was great on the floor, he was great in committee, and he \nwas a super guy on the baseball field.\n  After he retired, he continued to frequently come by and visit when \nwe were practicing. When he became ill, he kept a very, very upbeat \ndemeanor. The last time I talked to him on the telephone was right \nbefore he passed, and by that time he couldn't speak--or he couldn't \nspeak very well. He could just whisper.\n  He said: I appreciate you calling.\n  I told him I loved him.\n  I really respect Mike Oxley. He helped me a lot as a young \nCongressman. We had a lot of fun on the baseball team. He was a great \nlegislator. His family should be very proud of him. He will be missed. \nWe will also honor him.\n  Hopefully this summer, if he is looking down from Heaven, he will \nwatch us beat the Democrats, and we will finally begin the Oxley \nwinning tradition again in the charity baseball game.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman very much for his remarks.\n  There are so many Members that have had an opportunity to speak here \nthis evening. We only had an hour, unfortunately, and we would like to \ngo on a lot longer, but our hour is nearly up.\n  So let me just conclude by saying to Mike's family--his wife, Pat; \nhis son, Elvis; and to his grandson, Max, whom he loved so much; and to \nall his family, including Jim Conzelman, his chief of staff, who was \nactually, let's face it, family, and to all the other family members--I \nthink you all know by the testimony, the reflections, and the personal \nstories that you heard here this evening that Mike really was a beloved \nfigure in this House, the people's House. He will be missed. He will be \nlong remembered. We know that you all love him very dearly, and we \nloved him too.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues from Ohio and across \nthe nation in paying tribute to former Congressman Michael G. Oxley, \nwho passed away at the beginning of the year after a long battle \nagainst lung cancer. I thank my colleague from Cincinnati, Mr. Chabot, \nfor putting together this special order in Mike's honor on what would \nhave been his 72nd birthday.\n  Mike was a friend, mentor, and one of the finest and most respected \npublic servants Ohio has ever known. He was tireless in his promotion \nof his hometown of Findlay and all of Ohio's Fourth Congressional \nDistricts--its people, businesses, and institutions. His work on behalf \nof Lima's Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (commonly known as the \nLima Army Tank Plant during most of Mike's time in office) helped \npreserve that vital facility and its skilled workforce throughout the \n1980s and 1990s, ensuring that it remains open today to make the \narmaments that our armed forces need to keep our nation safe.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues who have already spoken about some of \nMike's many accomplishments. I want to share something perhaps lesser \nknown about him: his longtime connection to Buckeye Boys State, a \nweeklong educational exercise for high school boys hosted by the \nAmerican Legion Department of Ohio. Mike attended this program as a \nyoung man and always said that it helped prepare him for a career in \npublic service. From 1986 through 2006, he was the keynote speaker at \nthe annual Boys State graduation ceremony--an event that he often said \nwas one of his favorites of the year. In these speeches, he encouraged \nBoys Staters to develop a clear vision, set high goals, work hard, and \nact with integrity at all times. These life lessons no doubt inspired \nthe many thousands of young men who attended Boys State during that \ntime.\n  Mike took great pride in being inducted into the Buckeye Boys State \nHall of Fame--an honor shared by a select few, among them Neil \nArmstrong. Of course, the titles he held most dear were those of \nhusband, father, and grandfather. Our continued prayers go out to \nMike's wife, Pat; their son, Chadd; daughter-in-law, Jennifer; and \ngrandson, Max. We offer them our sincerest condolences at this \ndifficult time.\n  Mr. Speaker, we remain grateful that decent men like Mike Oxley are \nwilling to commit their lives to public service and to inspire others \nto do so.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and \nlegacy of former Congressman Mike Oxley from Ohio.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with Congressman Oxley on the House \nFinancial Services Committee. Under his leadership as Chairman, the \nCommittee pursued a pro-growth economic agenda, protected American \nconsumers, and conducted robust oversight of Washington's regulatory \nagencies.\n  Congressman Oxley was a true American patriot that dedicated his life \nto public service and helping his constituents in Ohio. His passion for \nAmerica was profound. This legislative body and the institution of \nCongress became a better place because of his service and legacy.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to \nthe Oxley family. May God Bless the Oxley's and may God continue to \nbless the United States of America.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and in \nremembrance of former Representative Mike Oxley.\n  As a valued member of this Chamber, Representative Oxley represented \nOhio's Fourth District for over twenty-five years and served as \nChairman of the Financial Services committee. As only a freshman Member \nof Congress on his committee, Chairman Oxley met with me and helped me \npass the Life Insurance Fairness for Travelers (LIFT) Act, which \nprohibited discrimination by life insurance companies based on travel \nto Israel and other countries without an actuarial analysis of risk. It \nwas one of the first bills I passed in Congress, and his respect and \ninclusion of the minority Members of our committee taught me that \nthings could indeed get done across the aisle. It is a lesson I have \nnot forgotten.\n  Many remember Representative Oxley for his tireless efforts in \npassing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This law was and continues to \nensure our confidence in public corporations and financial reporting in \nthe private sector.\n  However, more than his legislative accomplishments, I remember him \nfor his involvement in the Congressional Baseball Game--an annual \ntradition that brings Members of both parties together for a good \ncause.\n  No matter what he was involved in, Chairman Oxley was a fair and \ndecent man who ensured all Members felt respected. As a cancer \nsurvivor, his loss to cancer is even more heartbreaking and makes me \nmore determined to fight to defeat this deadly disease. Mike Oxley's \nwork, integrity and passion for public service bettered both the \nCongress and our nation.\n  It is with great pleasure that I honor Representative Oxley.\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of \nCongressman Mike Oxley, who dedicated his career to protecting average \ncitizens from special interests.\n  During his 25 year tenure in the House of Representatives, and as \nChairman of the Financial Services Committee, he tirelessly led \ninvestigations of major corporations like Enron. Congressman Oxley's \n2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act reformed corporate oversight in this country.\n  Congressman Oxley also worked on telecomm issues in Congress; helping \nusher in policies that support our current mobile economy. He helped \nsponsor legislation to authorize the first ever spectrum auctions, an \nissue that continues to drive innovation today.\n  Congressman Oxley also dedicated his life to our country by serving \nas a FBI agent before being elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n[[Page H760]]\n\n  Most of all, Congressman Oxley was a wonderful colleague working hard \nwith both parties to represent his constituents in the best way \npossible. He will be greatly missed.\n  On a personal note, Mike and Pat and Bob and I were personal friends. \nWe got to know each other ``back in the day'' when members of Congress \nsaw each other socially.\n  Even though we came from different parties, it didn't make a \ndifference when it came to friendship. At that time I was a \nCongressional spouse, so Pat and I got to know each other well and \nparticipated actively in Congressional spouse activities. Our sons also \ngot to know each other when we took bipartisan trips to places like New \nYork.\n  In fact, I remember one funny incident when the two families were \ntogether on a Congressional Arts Caucus trip to New York City. As we \nwere riding around, touring on a bus, our sons Brian and Elvis, 10 \nyears old at the time and dressed in their blue blazers, hopped off the \nbus and started walking down the street. Bob and Mike, alarmed, jumped \noff the bus and ran after them. They finally caught up with them and \nasked them what they were doing.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, before I start, let me extend my \ncondolences to those who are mourning the death of our former \nCongressman. That was 60 minutes' worth of very, very nice tribute.\n  As I am sure all of my colleagues are aware, we are now in primary \nelection season. This year the American people will elect a new \nPresident of the United States. Unfortunately, there is a great \npossibility that hundreds of thousands of Americans will be barred from \ncasting their vote because of this body's failure to act.\n  In 2012, I watched, horrified, as voters were forced to stand in \noutrageous lines at their polling places. Meanwhile, States across the \ncountry have set up new barriers to voting, cutting back on early \nvoting hours, and adding difficult new identification hurdles that \nlimit young people and communities of color more than anyone else--and \nthis as we call ourselves the model of democracy for the whole world to \nfollow.\n  Instead of embracing every possible opportunity to improve and \nfacilitate one of the cornerstones of our democracy, we are allowing it \nto crumble. There is quite a bit to fix, yet Congress isn't willing to \ndo anything about it.\n  Mr. Speaker, our States have wildly different voting systems. Early \nvoting is allowed some places but not others, same-day registration is \noffered in one State but not in the next. I can think of few better \ntasks for Congress to take on than to set standards for Federal \nelections, at a minimum, and to provide the biggest possible \nopportunity for our constituents to pick the people that represent \nthem.\n  We have Americans that have made mistakes in their pasts but have \ncompleted their sentences for nonviolent convictions. They have put in \ntheir effort to change and have come back to society as tax-paying, \nlaw-abiding citizens. Unfortunately, we ban millions of these Americans \nfrom the ballot box despite their rehabilitation. It seems to me that \nCongress should get involved in offering individuals like those one of \nthe most fundamental rights that we have as Americans--but we are not.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is also a conversation for this body to have about \ntechnology. Smartphones and other mobile devices have fingerprint \nsensors. I can wave a key fob over a terminal and pay for lunch without \nswiping a credit card or even signing my name. I acknowledge that there \nare very real challenges we face in bringing technology to the ballot \nbox, but we should be talking about how we can use digital advances to \nexpand access instead of trying to manufacture excuses to limit access.\n  Right there alone, there are three steps we could take on voting \nrights in our Nation.\n  Unfortunately, we can't even begin these discussions because we seem \nto have traveled back to a dark place in our Nation's history when it \nwas both legal and common to limit access to polling places. Despite so \nmany opportunities to move forward, we are rolling backward.\n  Since 2010, 22 States have passed laws that make it more difficult \nfor Americans to vote, most commonly in the form of voter ID laws that \ndisproportionately impact communities of color, women, seniors, \nstudents, and low-income individuals.\n  Unfortunately, the Voting Rights Act, which had previously curtailed \nthese dangerous restrictions, was gutted in 2013 by the Supreme Court. \nIn the so-called first-in-the-nation primary held this week in New \nHampshire, voters encountered new ID laws for the first time, a law \nthat allowed poll workers to vouch for voters without approved IDs and \ngives them the leeway to discriminate against some voters while \nvalidating others. Laws like the one in New Hampshire were passed to \nprotect elections from voting fraud--a specter that Republicans have \nused time and again to scare Americans into thinking that some dark \nfigure is hijacking their election, a notion that has been discredited \nand disproved time and again.\n  Between 2002 and 2005, the Department of Justice made prosecuting \nvoter fraud a top priority. In that timeframe, hundreds of millions of \nvotes were cast; yet only 38 cases were brought to trial, and then only \none involved impersonation fraud, which is what photo ID laws protect \nagainst.\n  More recently, a professor at the Loyola University Law School has \ntracked every allegation of voter fraud since 2000 and has found just \n31 cases--just 31 cases--of impersonation. That is 31 ballots out of \nmore than 1 billion that have been cast. The fact of the matter is the \nkind of intentional shady voter fraud these laws were based on simply \ndid not exist.\n  Mr. Speaker, of the many tasks this body has, protecting the right to \nvote, the foundation that built our democracy, the right for which \ncountless Americans have fought over the course of a more than 200-year \nhistory, protecting, expanding, and strengthening that right seems like \nit should be one of our greatest priorities.\n  I hope that my colleagues can begin to see that also and to join me \nand many of my colleagues on the Democratic Caucus in taking action \nthat will facilitate, expand, and provide opportunities for every \neligible person who can vote to be able to vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H760-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H760-H763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VOTING RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) is \nrecognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nminority leader.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I am delighted to follow the gentlewoman from New \nJersey, focusing on the Congressional Progressive Caucus' commitment to \nensuring every American can vote.\n  Might I add that we have worked together with the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, we have worked together with the Congressional Black \nCaucus, and we have worked together with the Democratic Caucus.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the entire House to be \ncommitted to the very values of this Nation. This should not be a \nRepublican or Democratic issue, of which it has become. We stand here \nas Democrats arguing for the empowerment of voters all over the Nation, \nyet legislative initiatives have been introduced by members of the \nJudiciary Committee and others. I have joined a number of those \nlegislative initiatives, and these initiatives cannot be heard and \ncannot be voted on.\n  The American people need to know that. There is no other reason than \nthe Republican majority does not want to have empowered voters.\n\n[[Page H761]]\n\n  This is unlike what we did in years past. I have had the privilege of \nbeing on the House Judiciary Committee for a number of years, and the \nmost powerful and moving experience was--and there have been many \nexperiences on the House Judiciary Committee--when all of us came \ntogether to help write the restoration or reauthorization of the 1965 \nVoting Rights Act.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  It was a very emotional and tearful moment. It was a moment of great \nextensiveness--15,000 pages of testimony; many, many, many witnesses; \nindividuals explaining how precious it is to vote; but, more \nimportantly, how not having protection for the vote can, therefore, \ndisallow them to vote.\n  I guess the most provocative experience was a Republican President \nbeing joined by Republican and Democratic Members on a joyful sunny day \nsigning the legislation that reauthorized the Voting Rights Act of \n1965.\n  Mind you, Mr. Speaker, that bill exhibits, if you will, the pain and \nsuffering of so many who marched and marched and marched and marched. \nNot only did they march, they died, like Jimmie Lee Jackson. Or our own \ncolleague from Georgia, John Lewis, who reminds us every day of the \nfear and feeling of being beaten near to death in his march across the \nEdmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.\n  He also reminds us how precious the right to vote is. When Dr. Martin \nLuther King, who refused to give up or give out or give in, marched \nagain, and they made it--with so many people from all backgrounds and \nall over the Nation--to Montgomery, Alabama, on that fateful trip back, \neveryone was celebrating that they had marched for the Voting Rights \nAct, that they had gotten through without violence--attributable, of \ncourse, to a Texas President by the name of Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n  When a wonderful, wonderful lady--whose children I had the privilege \nof meeting--was driving back some foot soldiers, whom we will honor \nshortly at the leadership of Terri Sewell, when they were driving back \nand Viola Liuzzo was behind the wheel, lo and behold, somebody \nviolently took a gun and killed her.\n  Voting has never been easy. Voting rights has never been easy. A lot \nof blood was shed.\n  It baffles me why we are faced with a situation where the United \nStates Supreme Court eliminated section 5--not an illegal provision, \nbut a provision that somebody disliked because, I believe, it empowered \nvoters.\n  What the Congress was tasked to do by the Court, which I think \nincorrectly and wrongly ignored 15,000 pages of testimony, ignored tens \nupon tens of witnesses in a meticulous rewriting of the Voting Rights \nAct to prove that it was still necessary, in a skewed deliberation, the \nSupreme Court decided to reject it, indicating that it was long passe.\n  And, of course, some brilliant legislators used the example: because \nwe have eliminated polio because of the vaccination, is it appropriate \nto get rid of the vaccination?\n  No, it is not, Mr. Speaker.\n  So with that skewed and, if I might use the term, weird reasoning, we \nare left holding the bag and the door is open to the kinds of laws, \nsuch as voter ID laws, that spread across America like a contagious \ndisease because we did not have the protection of section 5, which the \nidea of section 5 was a preclearance for men and women of goodwill to \nlook and determine whether or not a procedure was going to block \nindividuals from voting.\n  Of course, the voter ID law from Texas sprung up. You will soon hear \nfrom the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my dear friend and \ncolleague, because he was, in fact, the leader on the lawsuit.\n  Let me say that that terrible law blocked a lot of people from \nvoting.\n  I want to remind people that the day of August 6, 1965, in the \npresence of such luminaries as the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Roy \nWilkins of the NAACP, Whitney Young of the National Urban League, James \nForman of the Congress of Racial Equality, A. Philip Randolph, John \nLewis, Robert Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen--mind you, \na lady was missing, but, in the event, many women were foot soldiers.\n  The point was made on the Voting Rights Act:\n\n       The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by \n     man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible \n     walls which imprison men because they are different from \n     other men.\n\n  In this instance, I would modify it and say ``women.''\n  When the voting ID law--because of the misgivings of the State of \nTexas and its legislature--was put in place, there were 80 counties at \nleast in Texas that did not have a Department of Public Safety office \nfor individuals to be able to register or to be able to get an ID. That \nis a tragedy. Each moment there is something coming out of Texas that \nwants to, in essence, put down the rights of individuals to vote.\n  One case that should be brought to our attention is a case before the \nSupreme Court that indicates a group of petitioners who don't like the \nfact that you represent a population of people. So they want to \ncharacterize and get a definition of what a person means, and they want \nto make that person be an eligible voter.\n  So, in essence, a sick person laying in a bed who needs health care \nand needs to be represented is not an eligible voter. Or a senior \ncitizen that has gotten so old and feeble that they may not have been \nregistered because of their illness and their feebleness, but they need \nto be represented. Or it may be a child--Hispanic, African American, \nAnglo, or Asian--who is not at the age of voting and they are not an \neligible voter. Or, as I know they are focusing on, is hardworking \nindividuals who happen to be immigrants and they are not yet eligible \nto vote.\n  And this case is brought primarily to make sure that those people who \nneed to be represented to the extent that they are taxpayers but are \nnot yet status, they will not be counted.\n  This case is not anything to do with voter fraud. These people are \nnot trying to vote. They are just trying to survive. But you are \ntelling me that they are human beings, and this case is suggesting that \nthey cannot be represented.\n  This is the devastating impact of not having voter protection in \nsection 5.\n  So I rise today to ensure that it is heard throughout the land: We \ncan pass voter restoration, voter advancement. We can pass fixing the \nVoting Rights Act and restoring section 5.\n  There are many people in this Congress who previously were here when \nwe stood with President Bush, a Republican, and Republicans and \nDemocrats 98-1, 98-2 in the Senate, massive support in the House, to \nrestore the Voting Rights Act.\n  Let me ask the question, Mr. Speaker: Why now? Why are we struggling \nin this Presidential year not to allow people to vote?\n  Let me close my remarks because we could go on with--how should I say \nit--the irony and, as well, the wrongness of not passing legislation. \nBut let me say this in closing:\n  Redistricting is a result of the Voting Rights Act. Those of us in \nTexas are still in litigation--for 20 years some of us--on the question \nof redistricting and making fair districts where all people are \nrepresented.\n  And the gerrymandering that has been done, that disallows and \ndisenfranchises whole chunks of minorities, disallowing them from \nvoting for the person of their choice, do you know what it brings \nabout? It brings about this House in the majority--good friends \nof mine--having the sheer gall to deny the President's representative \nof the Office of Management and Budget to present the President's \nbudget. In its 41-year history, that has never happened.\n\n  But because we have these districts that are drawn, not representing \nthe vast numbers of people who should be able to hear the President's \nstatement about his budget, by having his representative, the OMB \nDirector, come before Congress and speak about what the President is \ntrying to do: reducing the deficit, providing for education, protecting \nhealth care, job creation, economic security, universal access to child \ncare, education for all, year-long Pell Grants, all of that, and a \nnational security for peace--we can't hear from the OMB Director \nbecause of the skewed redistricting that allows for the majority to be \nso overwhelmingly in charge that they would deny the normal processes \nof government.\n  The Voting Rights Act and the empowerment of voters is crucial and a\n\n[[Page H762]]\n\nfair redrawing of lines to let all of the people be heard and all of \nthe voters be able to speak. That is why I am on the floor today.\n  I am looking forward to reasonable people coming together and \nfostering legislation that answers the constitutional call that we all \nare created equal with certain unalienable rights--the rights of life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness--which is embodied in the vote of \nthe American people.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SHEILA JACKSON LEE. I am pleased to join my colleagues of the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus in this important Special Order on \nvoting rights protection and expansion for every American.\n  I would like to thank Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for \nconvening this evening's Special Order and for her dedicated leadership \non critical issues impacting children and families, including this \nevening's topic of voting rights.\n  Fifty-one years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965 and because of that law, I stand before you \nas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, the first African American woman \nRanking Member of the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.\n  We are here today not just to commemorate the landmark achievement of \n51 years ago but to redouble and rededicate our efforts to the work \nthat remains to be done to protect the right of all Americans to vote \nfree from discrimination and the injustices that prevent them from \nexercising this most fundamental right of citizenship.\n  On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol and in the presence \nof such luminaries as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Roy Wilkins \nof the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National Urban League; James Foreman \nof the Congress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of the \nBrotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis of the Student Non-\nViolent Coordinating Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert \nHumphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President Johnson said before signing \nthe Voting Rights Act, in: ``The vote is the most powerful instrument \never devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the \nterrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other \nmen.''\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter \ndiscrimination violations that historically left millions of African \nAmericans disenfranchised.\n  In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans \nregistered to vote in Texas and only about 3% of African Americans \nliving in the South were registered to vote.\n  Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major \ncauses of these racially discriminatory results.\n  After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited \nthese discriminatory practices, registration and electoral \nparticipation steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than \n1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote.\n  In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were \napproximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just \nthree in Congress.\n  Few, if any, black elected officials were elected anywhere in the \nSouth.\n  Because of the Voting Rights Act, as of 2013 there are more than \n9,100 black elected officials, including 43 members of Congress, the \nlargest number ever.\n  The Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many of the \napproximately 6,000 Latino public officials that have been elected and \nappointed nationwide, including 263 at the state or federal level, 27 \nof whom serve in Congress.\n  Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered \nharsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited \ngreatly.\n  The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which \nrequires that states and localities with a chronic record of \ndiscrimination in voting practices secure federal approval before \nmaking any changes to voting processes.\n  Section 5 protects minority voting rights where voter discrimination \nhas historically been the worst.\n  Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory \nvoting changes in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes \nright here in Texas.\n  And it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in Houston, that in \npursuit of extending the full measure of citizenship to all Americans \nthat in 1975, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also represented this \nhistoric 18th Congressional District of Texas, introduced, and the \nCongress adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the \nVoting Rights Act, which extended the protections of Section 4(a) and \nSection 5 to language minorities.\n  Barbara Jordan championed this reform because as she stated during \nthe floor debate on the 1975 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act: \n``There are Mexican-American people in the State of Texas who have been \ndenied the right to vote; who have been impeded in their efforts to \nregister and vote; who have not had encouragement from those election \nofficials because they are brown people[.] ``So, the state of Texas, if \nwe approve [the Jordan language included in the bill], would be brought \nwithin the coverage of this Act for the first time.''\n  We must remain ever vigilant and oppose all schemes that will abridge \nor dilute the precious right to vote.\n  And we are here today to remind the nation that the right to vote--\nthat ``powerful instrument that can break down the walls of \ninjustice''--is facing grave threats.\n  The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme \nCourt in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which \ninvalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of \nthe VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements.\n  Earlier this week, the Maryland Senate voted to override Governor \nLarry Hogan's veto of a bill that allows formerly incarcerated \nindividuals to register to vote after they are released from prison.\n  Also, the Iowa Supreme Court will also be considering amending laws \nto grant the right to vote those who have been incarcerated in the \npast.\n  Amending this legislation is important for the population because it \nwill help in the reintegration of these individuals, and secure their \nright to vote.\n  In light of this, there is still progress in the fight to restore the \nright to vote.\n  According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down \nSection 4(b): ``Times change.''\n  Now, the Court was right; times have changed. But what the Court did \nnot fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited are due \nalmost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting \nRights Act.\n  And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed.\n  Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by \nDr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not \neliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in \nstymieing the practices that resulted in the wholesale \ndisenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did \neliminate them entirely.\n  The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another \nepidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still \nneeded to prevent another polio epidemic.\n  However, officials in some states, notably Texas and North Carolina, \nseemed to regard the Shelby decision as a green light and rushed to \nimplement election laws, policies, and practices that could never pass \nmuster under the Section 5 preclearance regime.\n  We all remember the Voter ID law passed in Texas in 2011, which \nrequired every registered voter to present a valid government-issued \nphoto ID on the day of polling in order to vote.\n  The Justice Department blocked the law in March of 2012, and it was \nSection 5 that prohibited it from going into effect.\n  At least it did until the Shelby decision because on the very same \nday that Shelby County v. Holder was decided officials in Texas \nannounced they would immediately implement the Photo ID law, and other \nelection laws, policies, and practices that could never pass muster \nunder the Section 5 preclearance regime.\n  The Texas Photo ID law was challenged in federal court and \nthankfully, just yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit upheld the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Nelva Gonzales \nRamos that Texas' strict voter identification law discriminated against \nblacks and Hispanics and violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  To take another example, last year, Councilwoman Pat Van Houte, who \nserves on the Pasadena, Texas City Council was forcibly ejected by \narmed officers at the direction of Pasadena Mayor Johnny Isbell at a \ncouncil meeting to consider a controversial redistricting plan.\n  The Pasadena redistricting plan is one of the first to be implemented \nin the aftermath of the Shelby v. Holder decision.\n  Pushed through by Mayor Isbell and narrowly passed by the voters, the \nredistricting plan switches two of the city's eight council seats from \nsingle member district to at-large.\n  Thus, the effect of the plan is to dilute the voting power of the \npoorer, predominantly Hispanic residents of the Pasadena's north side \nwho opposed the change, and to increase the voting power of residents \nin the wealthier, whiter south side who supported it.\n  This shameful episode is a reminder that the Voting Rights Act \nprotected not only right to vote in federal elections but also applied \nto state and local jurisdictions as well.\n\n[[Page H763]]\n\n  For example, Section 5 subjected to preclearance and could have \nblocked the Texas Education Administration (TEA) from closing the North \nForest Independent School District (NFISD) and disbanding its locally \nelected school board comprised of 7 African American members.\n  Once freed by the Shelby County decision from having to pass muster \nunder Section 5, however, TEA directed the annexation of the NFISD by \nHISD and dissolved the school board, thus diluting the ability of the \nAfrican American and Hispanic community residents served by NFISD to \ninfluence the decisions affecting the education opportunities of their \nchildren.\n  Protecting voting rights and combating voter suppression schemes are \ntwo of the critical challenges facing our great democracy.\n  Without safeguards to ensure that all citizens have equal access to \nthe polls, more injustices are likely to occur and the voices of \nmillions silenced.\n  Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical \nof Voter ID laws because we understand how these laws, like poll taxes \nand literacy tests, can be used to impede or negate the ability of \nseniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast their \nvotes.\n  Consider the demographic groups who lack a government issued ID: \nAfrican Americans: 25%; Asian Americans: 20%; Hispanic Americans: 19%; \nYoung people, aged 18-24: 18%; Persons with incomes less than $35,000: \n15%.\n  Voter ID laws are just one of the means that can be used to abridge \nor suppress the right to vote. Others include:\n  1. Curtailing or Eliminating Early Voting\n  2. Ending Same-Day Registration\n  3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct on \nElection Day will not count.\n  4. Eliminating Teenage Pre-Registration\n  5. Shortened Poll Hours\n  6. Lessening the standards governing voter challenges to vigilantes \nlike the King Street Patriots to cause trouble at the polls.\n  Today, I call upon House Speaker Ryan to bring legislation intended \nto protect the right to vote of all Americans to the floor for debate \nand vote.\n  Specifically, I call for the passage of the bipartisan Voting Rights \nAmendments Act, (H.R. 3899 and H.R. 885) of which I am an original co-\nsponsor, which repairs the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the \nSupreme Court decision.\n  This legislation replaces the old `static' coverage formula with a \nnew dynamic coverage formula, or `rolling trigger,' which effectively \ngives the legislation nationwide reach because any state and any \njurisdiction in any state potentially is subject to being covered if \nthe requisite number of violations are found to have been committed.\n  Alternatively, I call upon the Speaker to let the House debate and \nvote on the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 (H.R. 2867), a bill \nthat provides even greater federal oversight of jurisdictions which \nhave a history of voter suppression and protects vulnerable communities \nfrom discriminatory voting practices.\n  Second, I call for the passage of H.R. 12, the Voter Empower Act of \n2015, legislation I have co-sponsored that protects voters from \nsuppression, deception, and other forms of disenfranchisement by \nmodernizing voter registration, promoting access to voting for \nindividuals with disabilities, and protecting the ability of \nindividuals to exercise the right to vote in elections for federal \noffice.\n  Before concluding there is one other point I would like to stress.\n  In his address to the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, President Johnson said: ``Presidents and Congresses, laws and \nlawsuits can open the doors to the polling places and open the doors to \nthe wondrous rewards which await the wise use of the ballot.\n  ``But only the individual Negro, and all others who have been denied \nthe right to vote, can really walk through those doors, and can use \nthat right, and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice \nand fulfillment.''\n  In other words, political power--and the justice, opportunity, \ninclusion, and fulfillment it provides--comes not from the right to \nvote but in the exercise of that right.\n  And that means it is the civic obligation of every citizen to both \nregister and vote in every election, state and local as well as \nfederal.\n  Because if we can register and vote, but fail to do so, we are guilty \nof voluntary voter suppression, the most effective method of \ndisenfranchisement ever devised.\n  And in recent years, we have not been doing a very good job of \nexercising our civic responsibility to register, vote, and make our \nvoices heard.\n  In the last two mayoral elections in Houston, barely 10 percent of \ncity residents bothered to cast ballots (12% in 2011 and 13% in 2013); \nin many district-level elections, turnout rates were less than 10 \npercent.\n  For millions of Americans, the right to vote protected by the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and \ntears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was \npossible to accomplish extraordinary things.\n  As we are approaching the 51st anniversary of that landmark law, let \nus rededicate ourselves to honoring those who won for us this precious \nright by remaining vigilant and fighting against both the efforts of \nothers to abridge or suppress the right to vote and our own apathy in \nexercising this sacred right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H763-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H763-H764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VOTING RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who represents the Houston \nand Harris County area, who does such a great job of speaking out on \nthese issues.\n  Representative Jackson Lee and really the entire delegation down \nthere--Representatives Gene Green and Al Green, along with \nRepresentative Jackson Lee--do a great job of keeping this on the \nforefront of Texans' minds and on the United States' mind.\n  Texas is such a large State that oftentimes, legislation that is \npassed out of Texas has an impact on the rest of the Nation. It does \nseem that much of the discriminatory laws regarding redistricting and \nregarding voter suppression, like the voter ID bill, sadly, has \nemanated from our State.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me tell you just how bad it is in our State. This is \ngoing to be really hard for some people to believe. But in the State of \nTexas, if a young person on a college campus were to find themselves \ntheir freshman year lost on the campus, or if they were to find \nthemselves in a little bit of trouble on campus, they would be able to \nshow their student ID to the proper law enforcement official, who is a \npolice officer recognized by the State of Texas, on the campus to \nidentify themselves. That ID works for them to be able to legally \nidentify themselves.\n  In the State of Texas today, that same young person would not be able \nto show that same student ID at the voting place, at the voting booth, \nto be able to cast a vote. If you bring your concealed handgun license \nin, then you can cast a vote. The student will be given a provisional \nballot that wouldn't count, and the person with a concealed handgun \nlicense would be able to cast a legal ballot.\n  Who is that really going to hurt? You have so many young people, \nparticularly young people that don't come from wealthy families, whose \nparents really struggle to send them to college. They don't have cars \nin college, so they don't have their driver's license. They really rely \non their student identification for everything that they do.\n  In the State of Texas, they absolutely cannot use that ID.\n  There are many things about the Texas voter ID law, to be honest with \nyou, I really don't like. I became a plaintiff in the suit to try to \nscale back what I consider a very egregious act against voters in the \nState of Texas.\n  I was very delighted that back in July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit actually upheld a lower court's decision that the \nTexas voter ID law had a discriminatory effect on minority voters and \nviolated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n  I hope this means that the proper action will be taken to do \nsomething to scale back this law and the impact that it is having on \npeople that simply want to exercise their suffrage, people that simply \nwant to be able to vote. We take it for granted that you can simply \nvote. But this Texas voter ID law, and many laws from my time in the \nState legislature that were proposed--luckily, some of them advanced--\nwould really roll back the clock on individuals that want to exercise \ntheir right to vote.\n  I will tell you what I have done in the meantime is joined as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 that \nrestores the right and advances the voting rights that were provided to \nus in 1965 by providing a modern day coverage test which will protect \nour communities from these types of discriminatory practices.\n\n[[Page H764]]\n\n  I will tell you, I am very proud to join with Terri Sewell, with \nRepresentative Judy Chu, with Representative Linda Sanchez, and, of \ncourse, with Representative John Lewis, who understands probably more \nthan anyone in this body what discriminatory laws can do to affect a \ncommunity.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  This bill, Mr. Speaker, provides coverage for 13 States upon \nenactment: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Arizona, California, New York, and \nVirginia. I am a very proud Texan--I love everything about our State--\nbut, unfortunately, we have been at the forefront of discrimination \nagainst voters, and Texas is included in this legislation as well. This \nnew geographic formula is based on current conditions and on a 25-year \nlook-back provision.\n  I hope that we will be able to work together in a bipartisan manner \nto protect not just some of our voters but to protect every single \nvoter in the United States who would like to cast a ballot. It doesn't \nmatter if a voter is poor and was not able to go and renew his driver's \nlicense so that his driver's license may be 61 days expired. It doesn't \nmatter if it is a student whose parents are just putting every little \nbit of money that they have to get him through college, and, because of \nthat, his only ID is his student identification card, and he would like \nto use that. We need to be able to make it easier for individuals to \nvote in our State.\n  Everybody wants people to be able to lawfully vote, too. We ought to \nbe able to work together in order to pass strong voting rights laws \nthat protect all of our citizens, because we certainly don't want to \ndiscourage anyone from voting, and we certainly don't want to look like \nwe are going backwards from where we once were, back in the 1960s.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H764-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H764-H767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN HONOR OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED \n                    PEOPLE ON ITS 107TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Palmer). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here tonight \nas a proud member of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People, known as the NAACP.\n  I am a member, and I am a life member, and I believe that the NAACP \nhas had a profound impact upon my life. Hence, tonight, I am going to \ntalk about the NAACP as I am also the person who is the sponsor of the \noriginal NAACP resolution for 2016. In doing this, I want to praise the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, \non this, its 107th anniversary.\n  This resolution has 24 cosponsors. I thank all of them. I also thank \nthe whip for allowing us this time to talk about the NAACP and to \nextoll many of its virtues. I thank all of the leadership for the \nopportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the 11th time that we have introduced a \nresolution to honor the NAACP. It is the oldest civil rights \norganization in the United States of America. We introduced it first in \n2006, and it was passed in the House by a voice vote and in the Senate \nby unanimous consent. When it passed in the House in 2006, it did not \ndo so because of our help alone--``our help'' meaning the Congressional \nBlack Caucus. I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. James \nSensenbrenner, who was the chairperson of the Judiciary Committee at \nthe time, was there to help us get this amendment passed. I have talked \non the floor about the White side of Black history. Mr. Sensenbrenner \nwould be a part of that history because, if not for his presence, I \nassure you we would not have passed this resolution in 2006.\n  We went on to pass it in 2007, and it passed in the House with a vote \nof 410-0. In 2008, it passed in the House of Representatives by 403-0; \nin 2009, by 424-0; in 2010, by 421-0. In 2010, of course, and \nthereafter, we stopped passing resolutions on the floor of the House; \nalthough, we may still present them and talk about them on the floor of \nthe House. So, tonight, this is what we will do.\n  I would like to mention the mission of the NAACP, which is to ensure \nthe political, educational, social, and economic equality of all \npersons--not just of Black people, not just of people of color, but of \nall people. The NAACP also desires to eliminate racial hatred and \nracial discrimination. These are lofty and noble goals because we \nunderstand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial \ndiscrimination in this country, and the NAACP took it upon itself to \neliminate as much of it as possible. It has done a good job, I might \nadd.\n  Let's look at a little bit of the history of the NAACP.\n  Back on February 12, 1909, a group of people decided that it was \ngoing to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in \nthis country. Literally, in this country, between 1889 and 1918, \nthousands of African Americans were lynched--thousands. Lynching was \ndone with mob violence. People were taken to trees, and they were \nlynched. It was done, a good many times, with impunity. No one was ever \nprosecuted. It was a grave injustice, and there were people in this \ncountry who decided that they were going to do something about this \ninjustice. Among the people who met initially were Mary White Ovington, \nOswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling, and Ida Wells-\nBarnett. These persons met and issued a clarion call. Some 60 persons \nanswered that call. Hence, the NAACP was born.\n  The NAACP did not have its first African American as an executive \nsecretary until 1920. It is important for us to note that many of the \nFounders of the NAACP--in fact, most of them--were not of African \nancestry. The first executive secretaries of the organization were all \npersons who were of European ancestry. In fact, the first five \nexecutive secretaries were White. They were not Black. In 1934, the \nNAACP had its first Black board chairperson--Louis T. Wright. Dr. \nWright became chairperson after the NAACP had had a good number of \nWhite chairpersons. So the NAACP has never been and is not now an \norganization for Blacks only. The NAACP has always stood for an \nintegrated society and has been an integrated organization since its \ninception.\n  In 1954, the NAACP, under the leadership and counsel of the Honorable \nThurgood Marshall, who became a Justice of the Supreme Court, won the \nlawsuit of Brown v. Board of Education. This was a giant leap forward \nfor us because this lawsuit integrated, to a certain extent, schools \nthroughout the country. The word that was appropriately used at the \ntime was ``desegregated.'' These schools were ordered to be \ndesegregated with all deliberate speed, and all deliberate speed can \nsometimes take a lot longer than one might expect. A good many years \nlater, there are still those who would contend that we have not fully \nintegrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the \ncountry.\n\n  In 1955, an NAACP member, the Honorable Rosa Parks, an African \nAmerican lady, decided that she was going to take a stand, and she took \nthat stand by taking a seat. She took a seat on a bus. In so doing, she \nignited a spark that started a civil rights movement. By the way, there \nare many people who contend that she did this because she was tired. \nWell, she may have been tired, but she did it because she wanted to \ntake a stand. She was tired of society's relegating her to the back of \nthe bus, and she took a stand against it. Hence, we had the Montgomery \nBus Boycott, which lasted more than a year. At the end of that boycott, \nthe bus line--the transportation system--was integrated in Alabama and, \nof course, later on throughout the country.\n  An interesting note on this point about the integration and \ndesegregation of bus lines. There was a three-judge panel that actually \nheard the litigation associated with this transportation issue. On that \nthree-judge panel, there were judges who had a\n\n[[Page H765]]\n\ngreat debate about this; but there was one Frank M. Johnson, a Federal \ndistrict court judge, who took the position that we could apply the \nBrown decision to public transportation. This was the very first time \nit was done was under the leadership of that three-judge panel and by \nthe Honorable Frank M. Johnson.\n  Again, I point these things out because it is important to note that \nthere were others who were there with the NAACP to help us along the \nway. Frank M. Johnson, by the way, was a Republican appointee who was \nappointed by President Eisenhower, and he went on to help us to \nintegrate schools throughout the South and integrate the Department of \nPublic Safety. He went on to help us with the facilitation of voting \nrights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons \nfrom discriminating against persons in workplace environments. He \nreally played a significant role as did many other persons who were \nassociated with the NAACP in a vicarious way, because I don't have \nevidence of his having been a member.\n  I want to move forward, if I may next, to 2008. I move forward to \n2008 because this is when the NAACP supported the passage of the Emmett \nTill Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. There are many unsolved \ncases in the history of this country with reference to things that \nhappened to African Americans. The NAACP pushed for and supported \nlegislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the \ndastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing \nno harm to anyone. The NAACP has fought for this.\n  In 2009, the NAACP celebrated its centennial anniversary, and the \ntheme at that time was ``Bold Dreams and Big Victories''--obviously, a \ngood theme because the NAACP has won many big victories.\n  In 2012, the NAACP supported the Smart and Safe campaign, which \nbrought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration \nin this country. People who study these issues are well aware that, in \nthis country, we have an overpopulation of persons who are \nincarcerated. Much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws. \nMuch of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of \none type of offense, with drugs, to receive a harsher penalty--cocaine, \nfor example. Then, if you have crack cocaine, you will get a stiffer \npenalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine.\n  The point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many \npeople to be incarcerated who, quite frankly, should not be \nincarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated. Some of these \n``three strikes and you are out'' laws have also caused persons to go \nto prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third \noffense; so the NAACP is fighting against this.\n  The NAACP wants a just society. The NAACP believes that people who \ncommit crimes ought to be punished, but that they ought to be punished \nin a fair and just way. Hence, the NAACP has supported trying to do \nwhat it can to help us with the overpopulation in prisons due to unjust \nlaws.\n  The NAACP joined the lawsuit challenging the Texas strict voter ID \nlaw. In Texas--and you heard colleagues earlier tonight talk about \nthis--we have one of the most draconian photo ID laws in the country. \nIt is one that requires people who have been voting all of their \nlives--who have a history of voting, where a person at the polling \nplace knows who you are if you show up to vote--to present a photo ID. \nThe interesting thing about it is, if you vote by mail, you don't have \nto do this, and most of the fraud that takes place probably takes place \nby mail because you don't have the same identification process. I find \nit onerous that we, in Texas, would be subjected to this type of law, \nand, of course, we are doing what we can to get it properly disposed \nof. The NAACP is part of the effort to make sure this is done.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  In 2014, the NAACP was a leader in the effort to strengthen the \nVoting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act, as has been explained by \ncolleagues prior to my taking the podium, has had section 4 eviscerated \nand, as a result, section 5 has been emasculated.\n  Section 4 was the section of the Voting Rights Act that brought \ncertain places in the country under the purview of the Voting Rights \nAct. Section 5 is the section, then, that imposes the standards that \nhave to be adhered to. Well, you can't have a strong section 5 if you \ndon't have a section 4 to outline, to specify, to delineate the actual \nareas that are to be covered by the Voting Rights Act.\n  The NAACP is still working with us to help us get a strong Voting \nRights Act so that people who have been disenfranchised, people who \nhave been discriminated against will have the right to vote in this, \nthe United States of America.\n  In 2015, the NAACP, after the death of Trayvon Martin, advocated for \nthe arrest of his killer. The NAACP never said that he had to go to \njail, but the belief was that, under the circumstances that existed at \nthe time, the perpetrator should be prosecuted. There should, at least, \nbe a trial. There should be an opportunity for the world to understand \nwhat happened to Trayvon Martin.\n  As a result, there was a trial. There was a finding. The NAACP was at \nthe forefront, a part of the avant guard, if you will, to make sure \nthat Trayvon Martin received justice. A trial is what ultimately \noccurred. I would daresay that, but for the NAACP and many other \npersons of goodwill, this would not have taken place.\n  Finally, I want to point out that the NAACP has also ventured into \nwhat is happening in Flint, Michigan. This is some serious business \nthat we have to take care of in Michigan. In Flint, Michigan, we have a \ncircumstance wherein children, among others, but children have been \npoisoned. This was not at the hands of some major corporation that was \ndoing something that was inappropriate. It was not at the hands of a \ncivilian, some person who just decided he was going to do something \nugly. It was not at the hands of some person associated with some sort \nof terrorist organization.\n  This was done by the government, at the hands of the government. \nChildren have been poisoned at the hands of the government. That is an \nimportant point for us to digest because one does not expect that one \nwould be poisoned by consuming the elixir of life, water, in this \ncountry. Especially, one would not assume this given that this country \nhas some of the best technology and filtration systems in the world. In \nfact, there are none better than ours.\n  One would not expect that in a city wherein the water was fine before \nthe hand of the government was imposed upon citizens, such that they \ncouldn't make the choice themselves as to how they were going to \nregulate their water. A special person was put in charge at the hands \nof the State government, the Governor having the authority to appoint a \nperson who literally took control of the city and, in so doing, caused \ngreat harm to befall young people, children, if you will.\n  When this happens, we have a duty, a responsibility, and an \nobligation to take immediate action to not only bring people to justice \nwho would do this, but also to impose a just system such that persons \nwho had been harmed can be made whole to the extent that people can be \nmade whole. I say this because, truth be told, you cannot make these \npersons completely whole. All of the intelligence that we are receiving \nindicates that once you receive lead poisoning, you don't recover \ntotally and completely. There will be some residue, and this can go on \nfor years and years and years.\n  So the NAACP went there immediately and made it clear that it \nexpected action and had a 15-point plan. I will say more about the 15-\npoint plan as time permits because I want to honor my colleague, the \nHonorable Chaka Fattah, if he is available at this time. Given that he \nis on his way, I will continue.\n  The 15-point plan has 15 priorities that are listed, and I will go \nthrough these priorities rather quickly. They are, one, the emergency \nfinancial manager law must be repealed. This is the law that I spoke of \nearlier that allowed for the Governor to impose upon the citizens of \nFlint, Michigan, this emergency financial manager.\n  Much of this was done unfortunately under the auspices of saving \nmoney--some persons have said that we are talking about $100 a day--\nsaving some small amount of money so that some person who holds public \noffice could\n\n[[Page H766]]\n\nstand before the public and say: I saved you money. I saved you money. \nLook at what I have done.\n  Well, look at what you have done: You have changed the lives of \ninnocent people forever in an effort to save a little bit of money and \nhold yourself out as a person who is cutting the budget, who is saving \nmoney for the taxpayers.\n  There are times when tax dollars are used effectively and \nefficaciously, and what they were doing with the water prior to this \ncut was a pretty good example of how things that are doing well can be \ncorrected such that harm is placed upon people. I regret that it \nhappened, but I am proud however that the NAACP is there to help us \nwith this process of making people whole.\n  The second part of the plan would require water distribution that is \ncurrently being done by the National Guard to be done by local people. \nThe National Guard does a good job, and I salute the National Guard for \nwhat they are doing. The truth is that local people need work, and this \nwould provide them the opportunity to work and to be a part of the \nwater distribution process. There is all of the good sense in the world \nin working out a system so that we can pay people who need work to help \nthemselves by distributing water in their communities.\n  The third point is access to fresh fruits, vegetables, and other food \nitems. Because to a certain extent, this is a food desert area in some \nparts of Flint, Michigan. As a result, there is a desire to make sure \nthat all persons can have access to fresh fruits and fresh vegetables--\ngood, clean, wholesome food.\n  Number four, all Flint citizens must be provided free home \ninspections. There are many homes that have not been properly \ninspected. The water source that leads into the home has to be \ninspected, the lines, and this should be done at no cost to all \ncitizens. The NAACP stands for this. My belief is that this will \nhappen, but I am proud that the NAACP voiced a concern that it should \nhappen.\n  I mentioned the Honorable Chaka Fattah from Pennsylvania's Second \nCongressional District.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah) with the \nnotion that I will reclaim time that he may not utilize.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Lone Star \nState. He is a good friend, and I know that we have had an occasion to \nwork together on water systems in Texas in my role as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee. We were able to work successfully on aiding \ncommunities that needed access to clean, safe water.\n  We had a hearing yesterday on the Hill on Flint in which we heard \nfrom the mayor and a host of other people. It is a circumstance in \nwhich, I think, we should have the utmost urgency and that the Army \nCorps should move aggressively. I would even hope that the President \nwould take action, if necessary, to nationalize the Guard to make sure \nthat people in Flint get water.\n\n  I am rising today in honor of the birth of the NAACP. This is the \nmost loved, most hated, the largest, the oldest, the boldest civil \nrights organization ever created. It has been at the forefront of \nefforts to have our Nation become the more perfect Union that the \nFounders had envisioned.\n  At every point, it has agitated, both in the streets and in the \nsuites, to make changes. Here on the Hill, there is not an organization \nthat has more consistently let their voice be heard on a whole range of \nissues. So I rise to thank those who have been a part thereof and who \nwill continue to be.\n  The local NAACP in Philadelphia had an antiviolence march all the way \nacross a major thoroughfare in our city, 52nd Street. It was great to \nsee an organization that obviously has a lot of sophistication, but it \nalso has the touch at the neighborhood level to reach out to people and \nto have people understand that individual responsibility to make \ncommunities safer is as important as public policy initiatives that \nmight be generated in halls of the legislature like here.\n  So I want to thank the NAACP for all it has done. We hosted the \nNational Convention in Philadelphia. I had a chance to open up the \nconvention and to fly in with the President when he came to address our \ncriminal justice reform.\n  We have so much to do in our country. And we have the understanding \nthat in order to do complicated work, we need organizations to do it. \nIt is difficult for individuals themselves to achieve a lot, but when \nworking together, we can achieve almost anything.\n  We are in a range of dates here of import. Just the other day, we \nacknowledged the announcement date in which President Barack Obama \nannounced he was going to run for President. Yesterday was the day that \nNelson Mandela walked free from a prison cell in Robben Island for over \ntwo decades.\n  So February 12th is when people of different ethnic backgrounds, \ndifferent racial backgrounds got together--people like Ida B. Wells and \nW.E.B. DuBois got together and said that there was going to be an \neffort to put together a membership-based organization, rooted in \nneighborhoods, rooted in individuals who would come together in their \nlocal communities and who would fight on a variety of levels--on the \npolicy level, in the courts, and also work in neighborhoods at a \nneighborhood level to improve the lives of people of our country, \nparticularly people who had been disproportionately ill-served by \ngovernment institutions and people of color in our country who had to \nwork for years, in fact, centuries without a paycheck and who were \nprohibited by law to do basic things like marry, or own a home, or own \nland, who had to bear the brunt of a criminal justice system that, even \nto this day, is yet to be perfected.\n  So we have a history, but it is made better because of the NAACP. So \nI wanted to come and thank my colleague for holding this Special Order \nhere on the House floor. I don't usually speak in Special Orders. I \nthink, over my 20 years, it is a very unusual thing, but I came today \nbecause the NAACP has laid the foundation under which so much of the \nprogress we have made as a country has been made possible.\n  I look forward to an opportunity to continue to work with him on \nissues of importance to his State, to our country, and to this world.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the gentleman especially for taking to \nthe floor tonight and sharing his views on the NAACP. I also especially \nthank him for the good work that he has done in the Congress of the \nUnited States of America. He has served his constituents well, and he \nshould be saluted.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been said that if we did not have the NAACP, we \nwould have to create it. That is just how vital it is to the American \nsystem of justice. It is not an official arm of the American system of \njustice, but it is an aid to justice in this country such that people \nexpect the NAACP to be there under certain circumstances and in certain \nplaces.\n  This gets us back to Flint. People expected the NAACP to be there, \nand the NAACP was there. As I continue, Mr. Speaker, permit me to ask \nhow much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in consuming this time, let me \ncontinue to point out some of the things that the NAACP has within its \n15-point priority plan.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Number five is that all Flint residents must be provided federally \nfunded replacements for their damaged systems and appliances. What they \nare saying and what the NAACP is saying is simply this: There are some \nappliances that have been so damaged that they cannot continue to use \nthese appliances. As a result, they have to be replaced. These are \npeople not of great means, and any help that they can get to maintain a \ngood quality of life should be afforded them.\n  The NAACP has indicated that fairness and justice must be examined in \nrate hikes and in continued billing for poisonous water.\n  I heard Mr. Cummings make this point at a hearing. He made the point \nthat people are still paying water bills for water that they can't \ndrink. That was at the hearing. I am not sure what the situation is \nnow. My understanding is that persons are still getting water in \nbottles, but are they still paying their water bills?\n  The NAACP believes that fairness and justice must be examined in \nterms of the rate hikes that have taken place\n\n[[Page H767]]\n\nand the continued billing of persons for water that they cannot use \nbecause the State made a mistake.\n  The NAACP believes that pro bono legal advice should be made \navailable to all. With this, I think that we can expect and hope that \nthe various bar associations would step up to the plate and help \npersons who are in need of legal advice. This is something that lawyers \ndo eleemosynary quite often. I would hope that lawyers would move in \nand help persons, but if they don't move in and help persons, I think \nwe have got a responsibility--we have done this in the past with funds \nthat have gone to legal aid societies--to do something so that people \nwho need some legal advice and some legal assistance can receive that \nadvice and that assistance.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I will just say this: Thank you \nfor the time. I want to always celebrate the NAACP and all of its great \nvictories.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 107th \nanniversary of the NAACP, an organization dedicated to eradicating \nracism and injustice in the United States. Since its founding in 1909, \nthe NAACP has been a constant voice in the fight for civil rights. But, \nunlike other organizations, its original battlefield was the courtroom.\n  The founders of the NAACP were smart. They understood that in order \nto combat ignorance, you must first change the laws that foster it.\n  One of their first actions was to lobby against Jim Crow lynching \nlaws. Though their efforts were unsuccessful, they turned the nation's \nattention to the ongoing mistreatment of Blacks in the 1920s and '30s.\n  In 1954, the NAACP played a pivotal role in the historic landmark \ncase, Brown v. Board of Education. A team of NAACP lawyers joined \nThurgood Marshall in a series of legal battles that would lead to \nsegregation in public education being ruled unconstitutional.\n  The organization was then instrumental in the passage of the Civil \nRights and Voting Rights Acts of 1965.\n  Since its inception, the NAACP has been our champion, and its \nexpertise is now needed more than ever.\n  We are at a critical point in our nation's history, where strategic, \ncollaborative efforts are best to move our country forward. Like the \nNAACP, we must be catalysts for change, not the cause of division.\n  The anniversary of the NAACP's founding reminds us what can be done \nwhen we work together. We all must play a role in the advancement of \nour communities.\n  To quote NAACP member Ms. Rosa Parks, ``Racism is still with us. But \nit is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet, and, \nhopefully, we shall overcome.'' As a nation, we must reject \ndiscrimination in any form and give all children a chance to succeed in \nthe land of the free and the home of the brave.\n  To the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \nthe NAACP, my sincerest gratitude for all you have done to shape \nAmerican history and ensure all of us have an opportunity to fully \nparticipate in the American dream. Thank you for being there in the \nstreets, on college campuses, and at the courthouse. Our communities \nare indebted to you for the vision in 1909, and the 107 years dedicated \nto righting the wrongs of our nation's past. Thank you for persevering \nand changing the face of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H767-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Hudson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and for the \nbalance of the week on account of illness.\n  Ms. Bonamici (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and February 12 \non account of official business in district.\n  Mr. Pallone (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and February 12 \non account of responsibilities related to the passing of father.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/house-section/article/H767-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BILL PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Karen L.
