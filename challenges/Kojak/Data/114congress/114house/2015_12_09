The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, one of my pleasures in public service is \nthe opportunity to work with some extraordinarily motivated and \ntalented staff. Nowhere in my career has it been more evident than here \non Capitol Hill.\n  The joy of working with smart, dedicated, committed young people, \noften under very difficult, even chaotic, situations, who are here \nbecause they make a difference, brightens every day I work here.\n  There are inevitably bittersweet moments when it is time for some \ntrusted members of your team to move on to other careers, graduate \nschool, or move to follow their families. Today in my office we are \ncelebrating one such moment.\n  Michael Harold has been in our office for over 7 years in positions \nof increasing responsibility until ultimately becoming our Legislative \nDirector.\n  He is preparing to leave for graduate school. Long before he assumed \nthe management of our legislative operations, Michael had made \nsignificant impacts far beyond my office. One specific area that he \ncarved out was international water and sanitation.\n  Thanks to Michael's heroic efforts on the Paul Simon Water for the \nWorld Act and dealing with funding for related programs, literally \nmillions of lives will be saved.\n  Another key achievement has been Mr. Harold's personal commitment to \nthe Special Immigrant Visa Program to protect those Iraqis and Afghans \nwho put their lives on the line to help American personnel as drivers, \ninterpreters and guides under the most difficult of circumstances.\n  Michael understood and fought for their protection to avoid leaving \nthose who are relying on us to the tender mercies of the Taliban and al \nQaeda.\n  Now, one would think that that would be a relatively simple issue. \nThey risked their lives to help us. We made a commitment to protect \nthem. But it became hopelessly confused and complex, with frayed \nnerves, long hours, and frustration.\n  Now, unlike his work on international water and sanitation, which was \nmassive, long term, and dealt with millions of people he would never \nmeet, this was intensely personal.\n  There were a few thousand people, having been confronted with the \nmost personal and searing examples, often on a one-on-one basis. But \nwhether it was saving millions with water policies or saving thousands \nwith Special Immigrant Visas, Michael was relentless. He managed key \nefforts on public broadcasting and started our Neuroscience Caucus. I \ncould go on and on.\n  He was resolute, focused, and determined. He built a network of \npartners at the staff level with legislative leadership, with the \ncommittee staff, and other member offices in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  It was a textbook example of how progress on often overlooked sets of \nissues have profound consequences for the United States' credibility, \nour moral standing, and for future generations around the world.\n  Michael and his wife Brynne are pursuing new academic and career \nopportunities in Boston that will make them more effective in the long \nrun, but also enable the ability to share their attitude and experience \nand effectiveness, the results of his model, that so much of the public \nwill never see that takes place behind the scenes.\n  While Members are obviously essential to the process, it is \nabsolutely critical that men and women like Michael Harold make it \nhappen.\n  It has been amazingly satisfying for me to watch Michael progress \nprofessionally, to marry, start a family, all the while advancing some \nof the most consequential actions in Congress.\n  Everyone who works with Michael Harold knows what he has done and \nappreciates all his special efforts to make the world and Capitol Hill \na better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9083-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9083-H9084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PENNSYLVANIA HUNTERS SHARING THE HARVEST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nan important program which is assisting needy Pennsylvanians at a \npivotal time of the year.\n  In my State, this is deer season, with hundreds of thousands of \nPennsylvanians estimated to participate through the end of this week.\n  It is also the holiday season, which is, of course, a very difficult \ntime for people across the Commonwealth who are less fortunate.\n  This is why the Hunters Sharing the Harvest is so important. Through \nthis program, hunters across Pennsylvania can take a deer they have \nharvested to a participating meat processing facility, and it will be \ndonated to a food pantry, a soup kitchen, or other organization which \nassists the needy.\n  This program is in its 24th year of assisting people across the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. One deer alone can provide enough meat \nfor up to 200 meals. Last year more than 2,300 deer were donated, \namounting to nearly 100,000 pounds of venison.\n  This is a season of giving, and I am proud of the hunters, the meat \nprocessing facilities, and charitable organizations across Pennsylvania \nwho are participating in this program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9084-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE URGENT NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION ON PUERTO RICO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues are aware, the heavily \nindebted U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is ensnared in a severe economic \ncrisis.\n  My constituents are not responsible for this crisis, but they are its \nprimary victims. I know they would prefer to live, work, and raise a \nfamily in Puerto Rico, but thousands are departing for the States every \nmonth in search of quality of life, which is not available in Puerto \nRico. Each time an individual leaves because they feel compelled to go, \nit represents a small human tragedy.\n  I have participated in five congressional hearings on Puerto Rico \nthis year. The message I delivered about the roots of the crisis was \nclear and consistent. I have acknowledged that, over the years, Puerto \nRico's leaders, with a few exceptions, have demonstrated a lack of \ndiscipline and transparency in managing Puerto Rico's public finances. \nFor this, we have no one to blame but ourselves.\n  But, as I have reiterated time and again, the crisis has a second, \nequally significant source. It is the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Puerto Rico, which is like the relationship between a \nmaster and his servant.\n  This relationship is a national disgrace. It denies my constituents, \ncountless numbers of whom have served this country in uniform, the \nfundamental right to vote for their national leaders. Remember this the \nnext time you hear our country lecture another country about the \nimportance of democracy.\n  As an advocate for statehood for Puerto Rico, I am a proud American \ncitizen. But protesting the mistreatment of my people will always take \nprecedence over being polite.\n  The relationship between the Federal Government and Puerto Rico \nallows you to treat us decently when it suits you and to treat us \npoorly whenever it does not. We live at your whim, subject to your \nimpulses, which are bound by virtually no legal rules or moral \nstandards.\n  If there is a silver lining in this crisis, it is that the crisis has \ncaused a clear majority of my constituents to conclude that the \nrelationship between the Federal Government and Puerto Rico must \nchange.\n  Puerto Rico must have equality in this Union or independence outside \nof it. No longer should we be reduced to begging this Congress for \ncrumbs and hoping you throw some our way. We must get off our knees, \nstand up straight, look you in the eye, and say ``No more.''\n  However, until Puerto Rico becomes a State or a sovereign nation, our \nfate rests largely in the hands of Congress. I have introduced a series \nof bills that would empower Puerto Rico to help itself. These bills \ndon't seek a handout or special treatment. They seek the same or \nsimilar treatment as the States receive under the Federal health and \nother safety net programs, Federal tax credit programs, and the Federal \nlaw that authorizes debt restructuring.\n  If Congress declines to act, it will not be because my colleagues did \nnot have options to choose from. It will be because they made a \nconscious decision not to choose at all.\n  Federal action is necessary to prevent a default by the Puerto Rico \nGovernment on its obligations to creditors, which would be catastrophic \nfor all parties. To avoid this outcome, Congress should authorize \nPuerto Rico to restructure a meaningful portion of its bonded debt, but \nin a way that honors the territory's constitution.\n  Such authority can be provided at no cost to American taxpayers. If \nit is, I will not oppose the creation of a temporary, independent board \nthat respects the Puerto Rico Government's primary role in crafting its \nbudget and making fiscal policy, but that is authorized to ensure that \nthe Puerto Rico Government complies with appropriate budgeting \nstandards and fiscal metrics.\n  Ultimately, what Puerto Rico needs is good elected leadership, not \nheavy-handed Federal intervention that further erodes democracy in the \nterritory. It is in the national interest for Congress to act and to \nact now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9084-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OBAMACARE IS COSTING JOBS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Black) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, just this past week the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office confirmed again what we already knew: \nObamaCare is costing jobs. Yes, 2 million of them over the next 10 \nyears, to be exact.\n  But those aren't just numbers. Represented within this study are real \npeople whose lives and livelihoods are being upended by a Government-\nknows-best law that, more than 5 years later, still remains underwater \nwith the American public.\n  We saw a real-life picture of the damage of ObamaCare in my home \nState of Tennessee when a Music City institution, the Noshville Deli, \nannounced this week that it would close its doors after 19 years \nbecause of the onerous mandates and high cost of this law.\n  The restaurant's owner, Tom Loventhal, said this: The administrative \ntime and cost of managing a mandated healthcare insurance in the \nrestaurant industry create an untenable burden, and that's before the \ncost of premiums.\n  He goes on to say: I've spent many hours, including some sleepless \nnights, trying to find a solution, but I can't find one.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Noshville Deli is one of a kind, but, sadly, its \nstory is not. It is being repeated across the country every single day.\n  While I continue to believe that the only real solution to the damage \nof ObamaCare is to repeal this law, root and branch, I am pleased that \nthe House and the Senate have passed a reconciliation bill combating \nthe most onerous portions of this law.\n  When we put this bill on the President's desk, I hope he will think \nof the real people, like Tom and the employees there at the restaurant, \nwho are being hurt by ObamaCare.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  The next time that my colleagues across the aisle want to call \nObamaCare a jobs bill, as Leader Pelosi infamously said, I would invite \nthem to come to the Noshville Deli, where they can get a good meal and \na healthy dose of reality. But they had better do it quickly because, \nthanks to their votes, time for this beloved Nashville icon is running \nout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9084-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9084-H9085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DENYING FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES TO DANGEROUS TERRORISTS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, we are approaching the third anniversary of \nthe day 20 6- and 7-year-old children and 6 brave educators were gunned \ndown at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in my district in Newtown, \nConnecticut.\n  Many advocates and families from Newtown are here in Washington this \nweek. They are joining with survivors and families of victims all \nacross America. We are holding a vigil tonight--the third, sadly. The \nthird annual national vigil to end gun violence\n\n[[Page H9085]]\n\nwill be held at St. Mark's Church near Capitol Hill. The vigil will be \nheld from 7 to 8:30 p.m., and I encourage all of my colleagues and \nstaff members to join us.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Members of this House should spend more time with \nthe families and victims of gun violence. I say that because, in the 3 \nyears since the shootings at Sandy Hook, the majority of this House \nhasn't even allowed a single vote--not one vote--on gun safety \nlegislation. It has now become the habit that, after every new, tragic \nmass shooting that claims the lives of more innocent Americans, this \nHouse merely acknowledges a moment of silence and then goes back to \nbusiness as usual.\n  I am heartsick, and I am outraged. Every time one of these mass \nshootings happens, people are retraumatized in my communities: the \nfamilies, the first responders who went into the school, all of us. It \nis appalling and it is unacceptable that this keeps happening in \nAmerica, and this Congress, the American Congress, does nothing.\n  Mr. Speaker, the time has passed for moments of silence. It is time \nfor days of action. As vice chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention \nTask Force, I am working on several commonsense measures, bills that \nwould help prevent gun violence in this country while respecting and \nprotecting the Second Amendment. It is time for congressional leaders \nto bring these bills to the floor to allow a vote.\n  The cost of the inaction is being paid by American families all \nacross this great Nation. The families of victims and survivors of gun \nviolence deserve a vote. They deserve a vote on a bipartisan bill that \nwill close background check loopholes and save lives. They deserve a \nvote on legislation to end the prohibition on Federal research funding \nfor public health research on our gun violence epidemic, and they \ndeserve a vote on a bipartisan bill this week to close the loophole \nthat allows suspected terrorists to walk into a gun shop and legally \nbuy a weapon.\n  More than 2,000 suspects on the FBI terrorist watch list have \nsuccessfully bought guns in the United States in the past 11 years. I \nam a cosponsor of the Republican bill to fix this. H.R. 1076, the \nDenying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, would bar \nthe sale or distribution of firearms to anyone the Attorney General has \ndetermined to be engaged in terrorist activities.\n  The time for silence is over. We in Congress have a sworn duty to \nprotect and defend the American people, but that is not what we are \ndoing when we observe a moment of silence and do nothing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House bring up H.R. \n1076, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the House is in session solely for the purpose of \nconducting morning-hour debate. Therefore, that unanimous consent \nrequest cannot be entertained.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I will therefore stand quietly for the \nremainder of my time to protest the appalling silence and inaction of \nthis House's refusal to take meaningful action to protect the American \npeople from the ravages of gun violence.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

GREGG UPON HIS RETIREMENT AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT \n         AND CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, CORNING INCORPORATED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Reed) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a great company in \nmy district, Corning Incorporated, an American company that has risen \nover its 164-year history to become one of the most innovative \nmanufacturers in the world. But, Mr. Speaker, in particular, I rise to \ntake a moment to honor one of the individuals of that company that has \nmade it one of the leading manufacturers across the world. That \nindividual is Kirk Gregg, Corning's executive vice president and chief \nadministrative officer, who is retiring from the company after 22 years \nof executive leadership.\n  Over his tenure, Kirk has made an enormous contribution to the \ncompany's success and to the community's development. I am most \ngrateful to Kirk for his unparalleled commitment to the community. He \nhas had an enormously positive impact on our constituents and our \nextended family who live in the district.\n  Mr. Speaker, Kirk joined Corning in 1993 and was named chief \nadministrative officer in 2002. The same year, he was appointed to \nserve on Corning's management committee, a small, very senior group of \nexecutives who lead the company on a day-to-day basis. Over the last \ndecade, Kirk has risen up the corporate ladder to become the third \nhighest ranking executive in the company.\n  As chief administrative officer, Kirk has built the core \ninfrastructure that makes Corning efficient and effective. He has had \nglobal responsibility for the corporate staff, including human \nresources, information technology, supply management, transportation, \nbusiness services, community relations, government affairs, and \naviation--a long list indeed. In total, he has managed over $1 billion \nannually in corporate infrastructure, making Corning's staff one of the \ntop performers among its peers in the country's corporate community.\n  It has been Kirk's work for the community that distinguishes him \namong the corporate leaders and for which I am most grateful. He has \nplayed a huge role in meeting the needs of New York's southern tier. \nFor 17 years, he chaired the Three Rivers Development board, attracting \ntens of millions of dollars of investment to diversify the local \ncommunity and create jobs. For 15 years, he led the Corning Classic \nLPGA tournaments, raising millions of dollars for our area hospitals. \nAnd statewide, he served for a decade on the board of directors for the \nBusiness Council of New York State, 2 years as the board's chairman. \nLast, but not least, he has been an enthusiastic supporter of our local \ncharities, cultural institutions, and human service organizations.\n  Mr. Speaker, every Member of Congress seeks the perspective of people \nwith broad insight into and who would contribute generously to the \ncommunities we represent. For me, Kirk is one of those rare people. He \nunderstands the people, the community, and the responsibility that \ncorporate leaders have to support their local institutions. At the same \ntime, Kirk is modest and self-effacing. Kirk is one of those people who \nworks quietly and effectively to make our communities better.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to call Kirk Gregg my friend. I know \nthat I speak for the entire southern tier-Corning, New York, community \nwhen I thank him for his citizenship and service. We wish him and his \nwife, Penny, the very best in a well-deserved retirement. May they \nenjoy many more happy days entering this new chapter in their great \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9085-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9085-H9086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR PLANET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gallego) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, as the world looks to its leaders convened \nin Paris this month to act on the greatest threat to our planet, I rise \ntoday in support of a strong and fair global climate agreement. Now is \nthe time to demonstrate our leadership and our obligation to the \nsecurity and protection of our communities and our economy by \ncommitting to a robust agreement that puts us on a safer path for \nfuture generations.\n  Last week, Mr. Speaker, House Republicans showed the American people, \nonce again, where they stand when it comes to tackling the threat of \nclimate change. By casting political votes against the Clean Power \nPlan, their message is loud and clear that any meaningful action will \nbe met with attacks and political theater.\n  Mr. Speaker, political theater does nothing to stop rising sea \nlevels, extreme weather, and land erosion. Failure to act will risk \nAmerican economic prosperity and will disproportionately impact the \npoorest and most vulnerable communities across our Nation.\n  In the American Southwest, Latino and African American populations \nare\n\n[[Page H9086]]\n\nmore vulnerable to heat exposure and heat stress due to factors like \nsubstandard housing and the lack of affordable utility costs. Native \nAmerican communities face additional unique challenges. They rely \ndirectly on natural resources for food, medicine, and jobs, all of \nwhich are expected to be negatively affected by climate change. These \ncommunities have all called for action on a national and international \nscale, and we must listen.\n  Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues on the Natural Resources \nCommittee have called on the Republican leadership to tackle this \nproblem. But time and time again, we have been met with silence and \ninaction when it comes to discussing and acting on these critical \nissues. We must do better. Around the world, nations are looking to the \nUnited States for leadership on this serious issue. We must step up and \njoin other nations who have already made commitments to act on climate \nchange.\n  The facts are clear: Action on climate change will not undermine our \neconomy; it will support economic growth. In fact, acting will produce \nreal benefits for our environment and our economy, including new \nbusinesses, better jobs, lower poverty, and reduced mortality rates. \nAnd businesses agree.\n  Last week, in a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal, over 100 top \ncompanies, including Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Sprint, and DuPont, all \ncalled for strong action to tackle climate change in order to minimize \nclimate risk and boost the economy. These businesses recognize what I \nhear from folks in my district from Phoenix and across Arizona: The \ntime to act is now. We must build on the progress made in Paris.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand with the scientific, environmental, and public \nhealth communities who all agree that Paris must be the floor, not the \nceiling, of our ambition. If the world takes a step forward in Paris, \nour partners will be prepared to build stronger climate policies and \nagreements moving forward. Local governments, States, and businesses \nwill be empowered to reaffirm their commitments to low-carbon pathways \nfor decades to come.\n  Some argue that America cannot lead on climate. Mr. Speaker, America \nled the way into space, to the creation of the Internet and computers, \nto cellphones and so much more. We can and must lead into this new \nenergy future. Our innovations and our leadership are going to fuel a \ncleaner and safer environment and economy, and our policies must \nreflect these realities.\n  When future generations look back on the progress made in Paris, I \nhope it will be to thank us for what we have accomplished in order to \nleave them a healthier and safer environment. Let's not let politics \nand grandstanding prevent us from taking responsibility for the planet \nwe are leaving behind for our children and our grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9086-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MENTAL ILLNESS AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, next week is the third \nanniversary of the sad tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School; but it \nis also time to recall all those other cities in America where \ntragedies have occurred: Tucson, Colorado Springs, Lafayette, \nCharlotte, Chattanooga, Dallas, Houston, Roseburg, Isla Vista, the Navy \nYard, and closer to my district in Pittsburgh, Franklin Regional High \nSchool.\n  What is common among these tragedies is the lives lost. I keep in my \noffice photographs of some of the children whose lives were lost at \nSandy Hook--Benjamin Andrew Wheeler, Dylan Hockley, and Daniel Barden--\nas well as those of teachers and other people from the school. A day \ndoesn't go by that I greet them in the morning and throughout the day \nand remember their lives, snuffed out too early.\n  But, sadly, the body count is more than just them when it comes to \ndealing with what people with severe mental illness and violence do. \nThe body count this year is amazing. There will be 41,000 suicide \ndeaths, 43,000 deaths from drug overdose, perhaps 1,000 to 1,500 \nhomicides, perhaps a couple hundred people who encounter the police and \nare mentally ill and end up with their death, an unknown number of \nhomeless who die that slow-motion death of homelessness, and those who \nare mentally ill that die 25 years sooner because of other chronic \nillness.\n  The body count this year will be greater than the U.S. combat deaths \nin Korea and Vietnam combined. Will that wake us up to do something in \nthis Chamber?\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  There are several things we must do:\n  We must reform the agency called SAMHSA, which has used Federal money \nover the years for the most ludicrous and preposterous things; from \ndesigning art for pillowcases to collages and other aspects. We must \nreform the 112 Federal agencies that we pump money into every year to \ndeal with mental illness. We have to deal with the shortage of beds. We \nhave to get rid of the same-day doctor rule. We have to bring in more \npsychiatrists and psychologists who can provide treatment. We have to \nprovide more early intervention and prevention, a greater workforce. \nAnd this Chamber has to stop postponing action on reforming our mental \nhealth system and bring to the floor H.R. 2646.\n  I have been working with a wide range of Democrats and Republicans \nover the last couple of years to reform this bill, revise it, and \nperfect it. But at some point, if we are serious about helping those \nwith serious mental illness, we have to bring it for action.\n  Part of what happened is we closed all these asylums years ago and \nthought that if we provided some treatment for people, things would get \nbetter. States failed to provide that treatment. We shut down hundreds \nof thousands of psychiatric hospital beds and leave people still dumped \ninto a system where they don't get care.\n  Our current mental health system is hugely discriminatory. The most \nfundamental, dangerous, and destructive hidden undercurrent of \nprejudice is low expectations; that your disability is as good as it \ngets. The shift to consider changes in how we treat severe mental \nhealth is a pendulum swinging the other way.\n  The grand experiment has failed of closing down all the institutional \ncare and stopping all treatment. It is a principle that operated under \nthe misguided self-centered and projected belief that all people at all \ntimes are fully capable of deciding their own fate and direction, \nregardless of their deficits and disease, and that the right to self-\ndecay and the right to self-destruction overrides the right to be \nhealthy.\n  Those children at Sandy Hook had rights. The people throughout the \ncountry who are mentally ill have the right to be well and not just the \nright to be sick.\n  But to maintain the current philosophy that many have, we abdicate \ncomfortably our responsibility to action and live under the perverse \nredefinition that the most compassionate compassion is to do nothing at \nall.\n  It further bolsters the most evil of prejudices that a person with \ndisabilities deserves no more than what they are. Under that approach, \nno dreams, no aspirations, no goals to be better can even exist. \nIndeed, to help a person heal is a head-on collision with a bigoted \nbelief that the severely mentally ill have no right to be better than \nthey are and we have no obligation to help.\n  This is the corrupt evil of the hands-up approach in the anti-\ntreatment model. That perversion of thought is embedded in the \nglorification that to live a life of deterioration, paranoia, filth, \nsqualor, and emotional torment trumps a healed brain and a true chance \nto choose a better life.\n  We have to change this trajectory. When we leave for the holiday \nperiod here, we will go by another month before we can bring this bill \nto the floor. Two hundred and forty people will die each day being a \nvictim or perpetrator because of the mentally ill. For goodness sake, \nif we are going to do anything to help this country, Mr. Speaker, let's \nbring H.R. 2646 for a vote on this floor and fix this problem in \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9086-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9086-H9087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TERRORISM AND ISIS STRATEGY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Palazzo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the imminent danger\n\n[[Page H9087]]\n\nfacing our Nation in the wake of the terrorist attacks in California.\n  Earlier this week, the President addressed the country to talk about \nthe impact of the Islamic State and the attacks in California. From \nwhat I saw, he gave his usual very brief and very naive analysis of the \nthreat of global terrorism. Yet, once again, he still failed to provide \nany actual plan or strategy.\n  He made very clear that he believes his plan is working. He talked a \nlot about how we would continue to do the same things we have been \ndoing for months. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to grow, expanding their \ninfluence, and hitting targets far from their home in Syria.\n  It is unfortunate that very few people I have spoken to feel \nsurprised by the lack of focus and direction coming from the White \nHouse. This is the same President that has been dismantling our \nmilitary piece by piece. He has continued to push for unsustainably low \nfunding for our military in favor of social programs, while making \ndangerous deals that jeopardize the safety and security of our Nation \nand our allies overseas.\n  All the while, he claims to be putting the safety and security of the \nAmerican people first. It seems abundantly clear to me and the rest of \nthe country that the most important thing to this President is his \npersonal legacy of instituting social change and other liberal wish-\nlist items.\n  During the same address, where he claimed all of his plans were \nworking and we should continue along the same course, he also argued \nthat part of the solution to Muslim extremism was more gun control here \nin America. Obviously, the President's memory is pretty weak. The \nBoston bombers did unthinkable harm with household items. The San \nBernardino terrorists--yes, terrorists--had a dozen pipe bombs in their \nresidence. These people are dedicated to destroying the West and \ninstituting a caliphate. Do you really think that telling them that \nthey can't buy an AR-15 is going to stop them from hurting people?\n  Let me be clear: this is not a gun issue. This is a terrorism issue. \nTo combine the two is a blatant attempt to capitalize on a tragedy that \nshould be looked at with disdain. But you never know. It wasn't too \nlong ago that Rahm Emanuel, former chief of staff to President Obama, \nwould always remind his party to ``never let a good crisis go to \nwaste.''\n  This isn't the first time though. Last week, while everyone was \ntalking about the terrorist attack in California--and despite pleas \nfrom the Marine Corps to make exemptions to certain military \noccupational specialties--the Secretary of Defense made the historic, \nbut unbelievably dangerous, decision to open all combat jobs to women.\n  But if there is one thing the President loves to do, it is to ignore \nhis senior military leadership. Many people believe that the emergence \nof ISIS is directly related to his premature withdrawal from Iraq, and \nI agree.\n  These are just a few examples of the AWOL nature of this President. \nBut in this case, AWOL stands for ``absent without leadership.''\n  What happened in Paris and here in California was a brutal reminder \nof just how dedicated our enemy is in fighting this war against us. \nYet, the President only acknowledges it as a setback, similar to how he \nrefused to acknowledge ISIS at all over a year ago. And when he finally \ndid, he brushed it off, calling them the JV team. The night before the \nParis attacks, he stated that ISIS had been contained.\n  This President is either delusional or unbelievably misinformed. \nEither way, it does not inspire confidence for the next year of his \nPresidency. Now here we are. He was wrong then, and he is wrong now.\n  Mr. Speaker, while the President held his annual holiday ball on \nMonday night, I held a tele-town hall with my constituents. When asked \nif they felt more safe or less safe under this administration's \nhandling of our national security and foreign affairs, 92 percent of my \nconstituents said they felt less safe, and 73 percent said that we \nshould do anything in our power to destroy ISIS. I have got to say, \nthis is a clear message that I think would resonate nationwide.\n  Time and again, the President, our Commander in Chief, has proven to \nbe oblivious to the real threat that ISIS poses to our national \nsecurity. He said that what we are doing is working, when it is clearly \nnot.\n  Folks, we are under attack, and we cannot be afraid to call it what \nit is: This enemy is radical Muslim extremism.\n  The American people don't feel safe under this President's failed \npolicies. The time has come to change course in this new war against \nISIS, secure our borders, halt the Syrian refugee program, and start \nlistening to the American people.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded not to engage in \npersonalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9087-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9087-H9088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMOVE ESSURE FROM THE MARKET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the story of Angie \nFirmalino of Tannersville, New York, one of the tens of thousands of \nwomen harmed by the permanent sterilization device, Essure.\n  Essure is a nickel-based coil that is designed to be inserted into \nthe fallopian tube and cause tissue scarring, leading to blockage of \nthe tube. However, tens of thousands of women have complained of \nterrible side effects and excruciating pain. Women have died. And when \nthe device has failed and women have become pregnant, this device has \nkilled their unborn child. Yet, despite its failings, this device \nremains on the market with the full support of the Food and Drug \nAdministration and industry.\n  In 2009, 3 months after the birth of Angie and her husband's last \nchild, she underwent the Essure procedure. While the procedure itself \nwas extremely painful, the pain didn't stop when she went home, as she \nbegan having side effects immediately thereafter.\n  For almost 2 years, Angie suffered from a sharp, stabbing pain in her \nlower left side, back pain, heavy and constant bleeding, joint pains, \nfevers, fatigue, and depression. Her doctor reassured her that it was \njust her body recovering from the pregnancy, C-section, and Essure \nprocedure, and that she would eventually get back to her old self. That \ndid not happen.\n  In 2011, after nearly 2 years of pain and complications, Angie's \ndoctor ordered an ultrasound to try to determine a cause. What was \ndiscovered was shocking. An Essure coil had dislodged itself from her \nright fallopian tube and had become embedded in the wall of her uterus. \nMeanwhile, the left coil was almost completely expelled, but twisted \nand coiled. These were the causes of her pain.\n  Overwhelmed and alone, Angie tried to comprehend the situation. She \nwas never told that the coils could expel, migrate, or embed in other \norgans. She wondered how this could happen. Searching online for \nanswers, she found little information and little comfort.\n  It took Angie weeks after identifying the problem to find a doctor \nshe felt comfortable with for the removal surgery. With no information \navailable about Essure removal, Angie located a doctor who seemed to \nknow what they were doing and seemed to have a plan for the device's \nremoval. Unfortunately, during the procedure, the Essure coils broke as \nthey were removed, sending metal fragments, like shrapnel, further into \nher body.\n  In the years since, Angie has undergone four surgeries directly \nresulting from Essure, and eventually lost her fallopian tubes, uterus, \ncervix, and one ovary. And as her joints mysteriously began \ndeteriorating, she has undergone an additional three surgeries on her \njoints.\n  Today, after a hysterectomy and surgery after surgery, Angie still \nlives with daily, chronic pain, joint issues, and debilitating \nheadaches. And while some of her pain may be gone, the emotional scars \nhave stayed with her.\n  At the age of 43, the mother of four, Angie says she is still not, \nnor will she ever be, her old self. But as a result of all this pain \nand suffering, she was able to do something pretty incredible: Angie \nstarted a Facebook group called the Essure Problems Group--something to \nfill the void that she found. It was a\n\n[[Page H9088]]\n\nplace to tell her story and to see if others had been impacted the same \nway that she had.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the years since, this online community has surged to \nmore than 24,000 members. Sadly, Angie now knows that she was not \nalone. Every day, this group connects women living through their own \nEssure nightmares; and every day, Angie is brought to tears at seeing \nthe stories, many so similar to her own, of thousands of women around \nthe country. Together with her Essure sisters, they now work toward one \ncommon goal: to remove this dangerous device from the market so that no \nmore women are harmed.\n  I am proud to rise today as a voice for these women, to tell the \nChamber that their stories are real, their pain is real, their fight is \nreal. If the manufacturer or the regulatory industry tasked with \noversight won't act, then we, as representatives of the thousands of \nharmed women, must act.\n  That is why I rise in support of the E-Free Act, a one-page bill to \nremove Essure from the market by forcing the Food and Drug \nAdministration to revoke the pre-market approval that let this product \ninto the public back in 2002.\n  Mr. Speaker, the E-Free Act can halt this tragedy. I urge my \ncolleagues to join this fight because stories like Angie's are too \nimportant to ignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9088-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HOLY ANGELS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. McHenry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two fine \ninstitutions in my home community that I grew up in: Gaston County, \nNorth Carolina. I grew up in that community and spent most of my life \nliving in Gaston County, and there is an incredible story.\n  Beginning in 1955, a newborn baby named Maria Morrow was brought to \nthe Sisters of Mercy's motherhouse in Belmont, North Carolina.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Maria was born with severe physical disabilities, and her mother was \noverwhelmed and unable to care for her. The Sisters of Mercy nuns took \nMaria in, and, thus, Holy Angels was born.\n  As word about Maria spread throughout the community, State--and \ncountry, in fact--more children with special needs began arriving at \nHoly Angels. As each new child arrived, the Sisters of Mercy worked to \nmeet their needs. Funds were raised, and the necessary facilities were \nbuilt. Over time, more professional nursing and medical staff were \nhired. Today, Holy Angels provides full-time resident care as well as \nphysical therapy, day programs, and vocational programs through their \nCherubs Cafe and Life Choices locations.\n  Holy Angels' CEO, Dr. Regina Moody, and her dedicated team of \nprofessionals continue to fulfill the promise that the Sisters of Mercy \nmade when they took Maria in 60 years ago. That promise is now \nenshrined in Holy Angels' motto: Loving, living, and learning for the \ndifferently able.\n  Holy Angels has been serving those in need for 60 years, and their \ntimeless spirit will be around forever in the families they have \ntouched, in the lives they have touched, and in how they have helped \nshape our community in Gaston County. I honor Holy Angels, and I thank \nthem for their service, not just for those people in their midst for \nwhom they are providing care, but for what they mean to our community.\n\n\n                            Tony's Ice Cream\n\n  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, we also hear stories of small businesses \nbeing around for 10 or 20 or 30 years, and it is amazing, in and of \nitself, that a small business can survive that long. In my hometown of \nGastonia, North Carolina, Tony's Ice Cream has been a landmark for over \n100 years. In fact, this year marks its 100th anniversary.\n  In 1915, an Italian immigrant named Carmine Coletta began Tony's as a \nhorse-drawn wagon that served ice cream to those in Gastonia's Loray \nMill Village. Eventually, the first store was opened and took the name \n``Tony's'' in honor of Carmine's brother-in-law, who managed the store. \nThe current location was built in the 1930s and now is run by Carmine \nColetta's grandson and his children. Generations of Gaston County \nkids--me included--have grown up knowing there is no better milkshake \nthan one from Tony's. In fact, my favorite is chocolate.\n  To the Coletta family, I thank them for their service to our \ncommunity. Really, building an enduring institution for a century is \nsuch a significant achievement, especially given the challenges that we \nface as a country and with the economy. They have meant a lot to their \nemployees. They have also meant so much to generations of children, \nlike me and so many others, in what they have provided.\n  I thank the Coletta family, and I honor them on their 100th \nanniversary. I also thank Holy Angels, on their 60th anniversary, for \ntheir significant contribution.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an amazing place in which to grow up, Gaston \nCounty. It has such great values and also wonderful institutions there \nthat I learned so much from as a child, growing up there with my two \nbrothers and two sisters and my parents, from whom I learned so much. \nSo I take this moment to recognize these fine institutions in Gaston \nCounty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9088-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, today I am grateful to \nexpress my appreciation for Major Jacob Barton. He has been serving in \nthe office of South Carolina's Second Congressional District on loan \nfrom the Army for the past year as a defense fellow.\n  Major Barton enlisted in the United States Army in 1996 and quickly \ndistinguished himself, being commissioned as an intelligence officer in \n2005. He served as a member of the 75th Ranger Regiment from 2006 to \n2013, with 3 years' service in Iraq. He is also an esteemed scholar, \nearning two bachelor's degrees, a master of arts in national security, \na master of professional studies in legislative affairs, and a doctor \nof philosophy in public policy administration. Jacob's extensive \nexperience has been successful for the American people.\n  Beginning in January, Mr. Speaker, Major Barton will serve as a \nlegislative liaison within the program's division of the Office of \nChief Legislative Liaison, specifically working on the intelligence \nportfolio. I wish him and his wife, Darlene, and their four children, \nDouglas, Nya, Alyssa, and Jene, all the best in the future. Godspeed.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9089-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FOOD RECOVERY ACT\n\n  (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, every day in kitchens across the country, \nsomeone pulls a can of soup right out of their cupboard or a box of \npasta off the shelf. They look at the ``best by'' date on the package, \nand then they try to decide whether to throw it out or not. Is the food \nno good because it is past the date, or does it still have weeks or \neven years of shelf life left?\n  Too often perfectly good food gets thrown out, contributing to the 40 \npercent of all food that is wasted every year in this country. Much of \nit ends up in a landfill, where it produces methane, a potent \ngreenhouse gas.\n  Currently, Mr. Speaker, there is no standard for date labeling, which \nis one reason I have introduced the Food Recovery Act this week.

Come visit my region. Come to the Pacific Northwest.\n  I would ask them to visit a tribal village a stone's throw away from \nthe Pacific Ocean where water continues to rise toward homes, cultural \ncenters, and sacred sites. I would ask them to come and visit with \nshellfish growers whose futures and the jobs that are tied to them are \nat risk because of changing ocean chemistry.

Residents of the town of Sderot have endured constant rocket \nattacks from the Gaza Strip.\n  Children have grown up with the psychological trauma that comes from \nliving under the constant threat of attack. Because they must always be \nwithin about 15 to 30 seconds of a rocket shelter, even an afternoon in \nthe park is dangerous.\n  In response, Mr. Speaker, the JNF built a 21,000-square-foot secure \nindoor playground at a community center in Sderot. The recreation \ncenter has provided young people with a safe place to simply be kids \nagain, and also it provides parents with the peace of mind that their \nchildren are safe from terror.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with the JNF and \nthank them for all that they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9089-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MODERN DINER\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE.

Situated in a vintage Sterling Streamliner, the \nModern Diner is known for its breakfast specials and great meals.\n  In the late 1980s, it became the first diner to be placed on the \nNational Register of Historic Places.

Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday, December 2, the Nation was \ndevastated by another mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. On \nDecember 2, there were three mass shootings in the United States. The \nfact that this violence is routine and ordinary is incomprehensible.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is particularly incomprehensible that people who are \non the no-fly list are able to legally purchase assault weapons. How is \nit that someone considered too dangerous to fly is able to purchase an \nassault weapon? There is a solution, though, Mr. Speaker. A bill \nproposed by Peter King of New York will not allow people on the no-fly \nlist to purchase weapons without a sufficient background check.\n  Mr. Speaker, gun violence in our Nation kills nearly 90 people every \nday, roughly 32,000 people a year. I am a gun owner, but there are \nreasonable approaches to keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous \nindividuals while still protecting our Second Amendment rights.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support legislation that will \nend daily shootings and protect our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9090-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FRIVOLOUS ADJOURNMENT MOTIONS STALL HOUSE BUSINESS\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA.

We are sitting idly by as those planning \nto do harm to our citizens obtain the tools to do just that. That we \nwould choose to do nothing to stop it is simply unfathomable to me.\n  We have a chance today to close a loophole in our laws before it is \nexploited, before we find ourselves standing on this floor once again \nfor another moment of silence.

Mr. Speaker, Americans' distrust of national news\n\n[[Page H9091]]\n\noutlets continues to rise because of the media's persistent bias and \none-sided coverage.\n  A recent Pew Research Center survey found that nearly two-thirds, or \n65 percent, of Americans believe the national news media has a negative \neffect on our country. This is because the media slants stories with \ntheir opinions instead of reporting the facts.\n  For example, the media often praises President Obama's regulations \ninvolving climate change, but their reports fail to cite the costs of \nextreme environmental regulations and the loss of jobs. National news \nstories also fail to mention that these regulations would have little \nimpact on global warming.\n  Americans will continue to believe the media has a negative impact on \nthe country until the media provides the American people with the \nfacts, rather than tells them what to think.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9091-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TERRORIST GUN LOOPHOLE\n\n  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California.

They cannot be alone in \nthis endeavor. It is time for Congress to act.\n  We cannot let terrorists on our own U.S. terrorist watch list buy \nguns. If you are considered too dangerous to board a plane, you are too \ndangerous to buy a gun. That is why closing this loophole is just \ncommon sense. Yet, over the past 11 years, 2,000 suspected terrorists \nhave walked out of stores with a lethal firearm. Ninety percent of them \nhave been able to buy guns, no questions asked.

Mr. Speaker, from California to Colorado, the devastating \nrealities of gun violence are hitting home. In the face of more \nsenseless attacks on innocent victims, it is past time that we treat \ngun violence in America as a national crisis.\n  Preventable gun violence is inexcusable. We need to enact commonsense \ngun law reforms, like ensuring that no terrorist suspect is able to \nwalk into a gun shop and buy a deadly weapon.\n  According to a report by the GAO, since 2004, more than 2,000 \nsuspects on the FBI's terror watch list have successfully purchased \nweapons in the United States. In fact, more than 90 percent of all the \nsuspected terrorists who attempted to purchase guns in the last 11 \nyears walked away with the deadly weapon they wanted.\n  These statistics are indefensible. Let's put our political excuses \naside and close the terrorist gun loophole because lives are on the \nline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9092-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING TOYOTA MOTOR MANUFACTURING KENTUCKY PLANT AS TOYOTA'S \n                        LARGEST PRODUCTION PLANT\n\n  (Mr. BARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, Kentucky is famous for horses, bourbon, \ncollege basketball, and hospitality. And now we can add to that list \nthe fact that the Commonwealth is home to Toyota's largest \nmanufacturing plant in the world.\n  With production of the 2016 Lexus ES fully up and running, the Toyota \nMotor Manufacturing Kentucky plant now ranks as the company's largest \nby production volume. That is right; Toyota now has its largest \nmanufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky.\n  The addition of the Lexus production line brought with it 750 new \njobs to my district. This continued investment in Kentucky is a \ntestament to the skill, perseverance, and dedication of the American \nworkforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must continue to foster the manufacturing renaissance \nin America by enacting comprehensive tax reform; reining in burdensome \nregulations; fixing Dodd-Frank and other financial rules that impede \naccess to capital; ending the EPA's destructive war on abundant, \naffordable energy; and promoting free trade so that American exporters \nare competitive around the world.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 556 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n[[Page H9093]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              H. Res. 556\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 2130) to provide legal certainty to property \n     owners along the Red River in Texas, and for other purposes. \n     The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with.

After general debate the bill shall be considered \n     for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall be in \n     order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of \n     amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on \n     Natural Resources now printed in the bill. The committee \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered \n     as read. All points of order against the committee amendment \n     in the nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to the \n     committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in \n     order except those printed in the report of the Committee on \n     Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment may \n     be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be \n     offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be \n     considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified \n     in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent \n     and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall \n     not be subject to a demand for division of the question in \n     the House or in the Committee of the Whole.

Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against House \nResolution 556 because the resolution violates section 426(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act. The resolution, in waiving all points of \norder against consideration of the bill, waives section 425 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, thereby causing a violation of section \n426(a).\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Connecticut makes a \npoint of order that the resolution violates section 426(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The gentlewoman has met the threshold burden under the rule, and the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut and a Member opposed each will control 10 \nminutes of debate on the question of consideration. Following debate, \nthe Chair will put the question of consideration as the statutory means \nof disposing of the point of order.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, Americans, understandably, feel a sense of \nfear and chaos caused by the news of the senseless attacks that have \nbeen carried out against civilians in this country and around the world \nin the past few weeks.\n  We can and we should help reassure the American people that their \nRepresentatives in Congress--that we here in this Chamber--are doing \neverything in our power to prevent such a brutal attack from happening \nin any one of our communities.\n  If we do not act this week, how can we go home? How can we go home \nand look our constituents in the eyes and tell them that we are doing \neverything we can? that we are upholding our sworn duty to protect the \nAmerican people?\n  But we can act. We can act, and we should act today.\n  We need to close the loophole that allows dangerous people from \nbuying guns. There is no loophole more egregious, more glaring, or more \nshocking than the one that allows suspected terrorists in this country \nto walk legally into a gun shop, to go online or to go to a gun show, \nand purchase a weapon in order to kill American citizens.\n  This astounding loophole has allowed more than 2,000 individuals on \nthe FBI's terrorist watch list to buy weapons legally in this country \nin the last 11 years. In that time, more than 90 percent of the \nindividuals on the watch list who have tried to buy guns have been \ngiven a green light. They have been handed a gun. Those numbers are \nshocking, and they are disturbing.\n  As Members of Congress, it is our responsibility to protect all \nAmericans wherever they live, and one of those areas of protection is \nfrom terror in their communities. It is to keep our citizens safe.\n  What is terror? There has been a lot of discussion about what terror \nis. In its most simple sense, terror is spreading fear and chaos, and \nthat is exactly what the American people are feeling right now--fear \nand chaos here and around the world.\n  There are no easy answers for mass shootings, and there are no easy \nanswers for combating terrorism; but the fact that the answers are not \neasy does not absolve us of our responsibility to step up and do what \nis hard. We are not elected to do what is easy. We are not elected to \ndo what is possible. We are elected and we are sworn to do what is hard \nand what is necessary to protect and advance the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  Now is the time to act.\n  Yesterday, the House voted to strengthen the security screening \nprocess for those who travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver \nProgram, and I was proud to cosponsor that bill. We acted together in \nthis body to protect the American people.\n  While reforming the Visa Waiver Program is a good thing, it is not \nenough. It is insufficient to the task. Keeping guns out of the hands \nof terrorists in this country, on American soil, is a necessary and an \nimportant step for us to take; but until we have the opportunity to \nvote to close this loophole, suspected terrorists in this country will \ncontinue to have and to use the opportunity to buy weapons in our \ncountry.\n  The simple truth for the American people to know is that we have been \ndenied even the opportunity to vote to close this loophole, and we have \na bipartisan bill right now that we could act on. It is time for us in \nthis House to stand up for the safety of the American people and to \nstand up to the NRA and others who are sowing fear and misinformation \nabout what is possible to do to protect people.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan bill that would protect the \nAmerican people. The Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous \nTerrorists Act would close this loophole by banning the sale or the \ndistribution of firearms to anyone the Attorney General deems to be \nengaged in terrorist activities.\n  The U.S. Government already maintains a list of known and suspected \nterrorists. If there are problems with that list--and I have heard my \ncolleagues raise that question--then let's fix the list. If there are \nproblems with the law, let's fix the bill. We can't afford to remain \nsilent. We can't afford to remain passive. We can't afford to be denied \nthe opportunity to exercise our duty to vote as Members of Congress. \nThat is what we do; and, right now, we are being denied that simple and \nstraightforward right.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  It is time. It is past time for this Congress to act. Let's keep guns \nout of the hands of suspected terrorists. Let's bring up the bill. If \nyou can't fly, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.\n  Tonight, I will be joining some of my colleagues at the third \nnational vigil to end gun violence. Here on Capitol Hill in a church a \nfew blocks away, we will be meeting with families and survivors of gun \nviolence from across the country, from Newtown, Connecticut, in my \ndistrict; from Aurora, Colorado; from Chicago; from Harlem; from across \nthis great country. Thousands of Americans are affected every month by \nour inaction.\n  I am going to have a very hard time looking these folks in the eye \ntoday. I ask you to join me, come with me, and look them in the eye and \ntell them why you are unwilling to take one single vote, one single \nstep to try to protect people in America. We have an opportunity to \nchange that today. We have an opportunity to act together. We have an \nopportunity to fulfill our duty\n\n[[Page H9094]]\n\nto protect and defend the American people from the scourge of gun \nviolence. A simple, straightforward, and important way to start is to \nallow us to vote on this bipartisan bill that will close an absurd \nloophole in the law that allows terrorists to buy guns to kill \nAmericans.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \npoint of order and in favor of consideration of the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, the question before the House is should \nthe House now consider House Resolution 556. While the resolution \nwaives all points of order against consideration of today's measures, \nthe Committee on Rules is not aware of any violation of the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act. In fact, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut \nclearly agrees, she did not even mention the word ``unfunded'' once in \nher comments. The waiver is only necessary to ensure that the House can \ncontinue with its scheduled business. In fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has stated in its analysis of this measure that there are no \nviolations of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a dilatory tactic. This straightforward bill \nwill provide certainty to the landowners on the Red River who are \nunsure if the land to which they hold title and have paid taxes on will \nremain in their families.\n  In order to allow the House to continue its scheduled business for \nthe day, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on the question of \nconsideration of the resolution.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, some say as my colleague just did, my friend \nacross the aisle, that we shouldn't bring up this issue this week; that \nthis is political and, therefore, inappropriate. Well, I have to \ndisagree and disagree strongly.\n  Politics is about people coming together to solve problems. If we \ncan't come together to help address the crying need of the American \ncitizens to be protected a little bit more from the fear and chaos of \nterrorists on our soil, armed with guns legally purchased in this \ncountry because we have refused to act, I proudly say it is political \nand that is exactly what we should be doing. We should be coming \ntogether as the body politic of the American people.\n  It is precisely the time to take action, and I support the underlying \nlegislation. I support even more us taking steps now in the wake of \nmass shootings, now in the wake of terrorism, now at the time when many \nof the world's religions are praying for peace, hope, and light in the \ndark time of the year.\n  It is a dark time in the soul of the American people and in this \ncountry, and we have the opportunity to take action. We have the \nopportunity to be a beacon of light and hope and responsiveness to the \nneeds of the people. That is our job.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me at the vigil and to join me in \nallowing us the opportunity to vote, to act, to protect and defend this \ncountry.\n  I yield the remaining time to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern).\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty) for raising an important issue, for forcing us \nto talk about something that the Republican leadership is working \novertime to prevent us from having a vote on.\n  Only in this Republican-controlled House of Representatives would the \nidea of prohibiting terror suspects from getting weapons be considered \ncontroversial. It is stunning.\n  Let me say to the Republican leadership, who are, again, preventing \nus from being able to deliberate on this issue, you take my breath \naway. I cannot believe that you will not allow us to have a vote on the \nfloor on this important issue. You are on the wrong side of history. \nYou are certainly on the wrong side of public opinion.\n  The vast majority of Americans--Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents--all think we ought to close this loophole, everybody but \nthe leadership of this House, which is beholden to one special \ninterest.\n  Terror suspects can't fly on airplanes. I fly back and forth from \nBoston to Washington every week. I am glad that terror suspects can't \nfly on airplanes. I feel more safe. The people I fly with feel more \nsafe.\n  Why would it be somehow acceptable, then, to allow those same people \nwho cannot fly to be able to go out and buy weapons, highly \nsophisticated weapons, weapons that are used by terrorists to kill \ncivilians? Why would that be acceptable?\n  We ought to have a vote on this. Let us vote. Let us deliberate on \nthis important issue.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from my \ncolleagues from Connecticut and Massachusetts. I can't think of one \nperson out of 535 Members of Congress that wants terrorists to have a \nfirearm. Certainly not. That is not something that is even in question.\n  I do find it very interesting, especially from my colleague from \nMassachusetts--and which we sit together on the Rules Committee--to \nbring up a point of something that, I would say, he advocates for daily \non this floor and in this body and, that is, to follow regular order to \nallow pieces of legislation to go through the committee process, to \nallow every Member of this body to have their input, to have their say, \nto be able to amend, to be able to argue, to be able to debate, to \nallow it to go through the process that this body stands for, until \ntoday when it is their side of the aisle's idea that they have to move \nan issue forward.\n  They say: Let's circumvent regular order, let's bring something that \nhas not gone through the committee process, that has not allowed every \nMember of this body to weigh in on, to debate, to bring up amendments, \nto make their feelings known. Let's only do it when it is not their \nidea. That is the message I am getting.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the enormity of the issue \nbefore us. We are working on many bills in this legislative body to \ndeal with the issue of terrorism in front of us as a Nation and as a \nworld. I hope that Members of the other side of the aisle will support \nthose efforts to make this country safer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  The question is, Will the House now consider the resolution?\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 241, \nnays 174, not voting 18, as follows:\n\n

The gentleman from Washington is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, House Resolution 556, providing for consideration of \nan important piece of legislation, H.R. 2130, the Red River Private \nProperty Protection Act.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2130 under a structured \nrule, making every amendment submitted to the committee in order, which \nincludes a manager's amendment and an amendment by Mr. Cole of \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2130, the Red River Private Property Protection \nAct, is critically important to protecting private property in the \ngreat States of Texas and Oklahoma. This bill prevents the Federal \nGovernment from seizing thousands of acres of private land that is \nlawfully owned by American citizens along the 116-mile stretch of the \nRed River between Oklahoma and Texas.\n  The Bureau of Land Management, or the BLM, is currently updating its \nTexas and Oklahoma Resources Management Plan, which covers this stretch \nof the Red River.\n  BLM initially stated that there are an estimated 90,000 acres of land \nalong this stretch of the river that may be considered public domain \nand managed as Federal land. They have since reduced this estimate to \n30,000.\n  Of these 30,000 acres, less than 6,500 acres have actually been \nsurveyed. These revisions and drastically different estimates based \nupon a fraction of acreage surveyed have caused great concern among \nlandowners and local stakeholders.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  H.R. 2130 would commission a survey of the entire 116-mile stretch of \nthe contested area along the Red River using the gradient boundary \nsurvey method developed and backed by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates in 1923's decision, Oklahoma v. Texas, that determined the \nproper boundaries between private and federally owned land.\n  This decision set the precedent for determining the boundaries, \nincluding taking into account the doctrine of erosion, accretion, and \navulsion of the Red River, which changes rapidly and materially in \nflood.\n  The underlying bill states the survey must be conducted within 2 \nyears by licensed State land surveyors and approved by the Texas \nGeneral Land Office in conjunction with the Commissioners of the Land \nOffice in Oklahoma.\n  Once the survey is approved, affected landowners have the ability to \nappeal the survey to an administrative law judge. After the boundary \nbetween public and private land is settled, the BLM is required to sell \nthe remaining Federal land along the Red River at no less than fair \nmarket value. Landowners will rightly be given the rights of first \nrefusal.\n  H.R. 2130 also requires that a resource management plan adhere to the \nrequirements in the bill and explicitly states that nothing in the \nlanguage will affect the Red River Boundary Compact, which established \nthe visible boundaries between the two States and solves jurisdictional \nand sovereignty disputes.\n  Land already patented under the Color-of-Title Act will not be \naffected nor will the sovereignty of federally recognized Indian tribes \nregarding land that is located to the north of the South Bank boundary \nline.\n  Mr. Speaker, the entire section of this 116-mile stretch has never \neven been surveyed by the BLM, and the small portions that the agency \nhas surveyed appear to stray widely from the accepted gradient boundary \nsurvey method endorsed by the Supreme Court.\n  Uncertainty clouds all decisions being made with regard to this land. \nThe BLM has never actively managed the small strip of land they \nactually do own, as they are unsure of exactly what land it is they \nown.\n  Meanwhile, the agency appears incapable of understanding basic \nnatural\n\n[[Page H9096]]\n\nmovements of the river. While the approved survey method makes clear \nthat ownership boundaries between private and public land will change \nwith the movements of the river over time, BLM surveys do not.\n  A major determinant of land ownership must reflect the location of \nthe existing median line of the river while taking into account past \nchanges in the river's movement.\n  While BLM fails to understand the very land they claim to be \nsurveying, landowners along the river are left unsure if the land they \nhave held titles to and have paid taxes on will remain their property \nor be subject to Federal ownership.\n  This uncertainty threatens the value of privately owned lands. It \nclouds the title and causes landowners to think twice before making \nimprovements on their land. This insecurity is harming local landowners \nand local economies, stifling any potential economic development in the \narea.\n  H.R. 2130 will solve this problem and clear up the uncertainty caused \nby BLM's decision, after over 90 years, to suddenly decide to claim the \nrights to this land. In conjunction with the States and affected \ntribes, this legislation will make clear the true ownership of the \nproperty.\n  The House Natural Resources Committee, which I sit on, favorably \nordered this bill in September. It is important to note that this \nlegislation is an updated version of legislation introduced in the \n113th Congress and reflects the input received from landowners, both \nStates in subject, as well as feedback provided by the minority members \non the Natural Resources Committee.\n  So I believe the updates reflect the bipartisan nature in which this \nlegislation was drafted and highlights the necessity of solving this \nproblem for the people of Texas and the people of Oklahoma.\n  This legislation is necessary to not only right an obvious wrong in \nthis specific instance regarding the Oklahoma-Texas border, but is \nessential to ensuring that local landowners have a judicious, practical \nprocess to firmly establish title to their rightfully owned land.\n  Government exists to protect our natural rights. Those include \nproperty rights. H.R. 2130 will put in place the proper process to \nensure government agencies assist, rather than impede, with the \nprotection of private property.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, this rule allowing for consideration of H.R. 2130, \nthe Red River Private Property Protection Act, will support the \nprotection of private property and prevent the Federal Government from \nfalsely claiming thousands of acres of land lawfully owned by American \ncitizens.\n  I support the rule's adoption. I urge my colleagues to support both \nthe rule and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Newhouse) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we should be talking about today is keeping the \ngovernment open before funding runs out. With the horrific terrorist \nattack in San Bernardino taking place just 1 week ago, we should also \nbe talking about how to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\n  House Democrats are united in making these our top priorities so that \nwe can address the pressing issues the American people elected us to \ntackle. Instead, we are talking about H.R. 2130, the Red River Private \nProperty Protection Act.\n  This is a bill that Republicans know is going nowhere, but they still \ninsist that we take it up. Today I rise in strong opposition to the \nrule and the underlying legislation.\n  Proponents of this bill claim that the Bureau of Land Management's \neffort to survey land along the Red River is a Federal land grab. In \nfact, H.R. 2130 is a land grab by the State of Texas which will harm \nlocal Native American tribes and taxpayers nationwide.\n  H.R. 2130 would set aside existing Federal surveys of land along the \n116-mile stretch of the Red River in Texas and would require the \nSecretary to commission and to accept, without Federal participation, \nsurveys of the land approved by the Texas General Land Office.\n  We should be helping to provide legal certainty to property owners \nalong the Red River, but we should not use the approach of voiding or \nnullifying Federal surveys.\n  BLM's survey and public planning process is not a land grab or a \ngovernment overreach, but simply a Federal agency trying to resolve a \nvery complex situation. If Texas wants to challenge the BLM's survey \nmethods, they should do it in the normal way, in the courts, not \nthrough Congress.\n  Additionally, this legislation would require the Interior Department \nto delegate its authority for determining Federal estate to a State \nagency, would be counter to near 100 years of settled law, and could \nreduce mineral revenue opportunities for the Kiowa, Comanche, and \nApache tribes and the State of Oklahoma.\n\n  Passing this bill could potentially complicate oil and gas leases \nthat local tribes rely on for income. The Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche \ntribes receive 62.5 percent of any royalty generated for oil and gas \ndevelopment along this section of the Red River.\n  If part of this land no longer belongs to the Federal Government, \nthen this agreement would disappear and the important source of revenue \nrelied on by these tribes could vanish into thin air. These tribes view \nthis bill as a threat to their livelihood and an assault on their \nproperty.\n  In addition to potentially losing revenues from mineral revenues, \ntribes have also expressed concern about access to water. Water is \nscarce in this arid region, and tribes rely on access to the Red River \nsignificantly. So H.R. 2130 could threaten that critical access.\n  If we want to do what is right by the people of Texas, the people of \nOklahoma, the affected tribes, and the people of the United States, we \nhave got to reject this bill in its current form.\n  We all know that it is going nowhere and will be just another waste \nof the House's precious time. I ask my colleagues: Shouldn't we be \ntackling pressing issues, like gun violence or funding for our \ngovernment?\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress only has 1 legislative day left to avert a \ngovernment shutdown. Let me remind my Republican friends about the last \ntime that they shut down the government:\n  The economy lost $24 billion and 120,000 private sector jobs. \nVeterans' disability claims were stalled. Head Start centers were \nforced to close. Small businesses were cut off from SBA loans. $4 \nbillion in tax refunds were delayed. Hundreds of Americans were \nprevented from enrolling in NIH clinical trials.\n  So instead of heading down that road again and damaging our \nrecovering economy, I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwill do the right thing.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to drop their demands for radical \npolicy riders that put an omnibus funding bill in jeopardy. Work with \nour leadership. Work in a bipartisan way to advance a bill that will \nkeep the government open and avert yet another Republican-manufactured \ncrisis.\n  There is a lot of work that needs to be done, Mr. Speaker, and it \nneeds to be done right now.\n  My friend from Washington earlier made reference to regular order, \nsaying that those of us who are trying to get a vote on a bill to \nbasically close a loophole that allows terrorist suspects to be able to \nbuy weapons are not adhering to regular order.\n  Well, I have news for my friend from Washington State. Regular order \nis dead in this House of Representatives. It died a long time ago. My \nRepublican friends killed it a long time ago. There is no regular order \nin this House.\n  Whether it is on your bills to defund Planned Parenthood, the energy \npackage, the Syrian refugee bill, the oil bill, none of that came \nbefore us in regular order. We are on this floor day after day, \ndemanding votes on procedural motions precisely because there is no \nregular order in this House.\n  The committees of jurisdiction are not doing their job, are not even \ndoing hearings or reporting a bill out of committee that would prevent \nterrorist suspects from getting access to weapons.\n\n[[Page H9097]]\n\n  So we are using procedural motions to try to put some pressure on the \nleadership in this House--if not pressure, maybe to shame the \nleadership of this House to bring a bill to the floor that the \noverwhelming majority of the American people want.\n  As I said earlier, only in this Republican-controlled House of \nRepresentatives would the idea of prohibiting terrorist suspects from \ngetting weapons be considered controversial.\n  These people that we are talking about are on the no-fly list. They \ncan't fly on airplanes, and I am glad that they can't fly with me when \nI go back and forth from Washington to Boston every week. I think the \nmajority of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, are glad that \nterrorist suspects are not on their plane flying around the country \nwhen they are on these planes.\n  Why, then, would it somehow be a good idea to say that these people \nwho cannot fly on our airplanes because we suspect them of links to \nterrorism can somehow go out and buy a weapon of war that could \npotentially be used against our citizens?\n  There are a lot of things we need to do. This is one of them. I get \nit that there is a particular special interest out there that is \nputting a lot of pressure on the leadership and on some Members on the \nother side to not be able to bring this bill to the floor. But I would \nsay that a majority of the members of the National Rifle Association \nactually agree with us on this issue.\n  By the way, this idea that we are putting forward here today is not a \ndemocratic idea. It is introduced by a Republican Member of Congress, \nCongressman Peter King of New York. It is an idea that has been \nendorsed by a Republican President and its administration, the Bush \nadministration prior to this one. Their Justice Department thought this \nwas a good idea.\n  Former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean, who is the co-chair of the 9/11 \nCommission, said this is a good idea. I mean, reasonable, rational \npeople think this is good idea.\n  Yet, in this House of Representatives, we can't even get it on the \nfloor for a vote. If you don't want to vote for it, then have the \ncourage to vote ``no.'' Allow it to come to the floor. Let your \nconstituents know where you stand on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my colleague \non the Rules Committee. I appreciate his opening comments and take \ngreat interest in some of the things that were pointed out.\n  Certainly, nobody in this body on this side of the aisle or on your \nside is interested in closing down the government and shutting the \ngovernment. In fact, just yesterday Leader McCarthy stood at this very \npodium and told everyone to make sure that they kept their travel plans \nflexible enough to be able to stay here and get their work done.\n  So I think there is a commitment on both sides of the aisle in order \nto get work done for the American people. Also, protecting Americans in \nthis very dangerous time that we face in the world today is one of the \nhighest priorities that we have as a Congress and is certainly a \nconstitutional duty that all of us take very seriously.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  We are working very hard. We have committees of jurisdiction working \nvery hard and coming up with workable ideas in order to accomplish just \nthat. In fact, we just passed something this week that had to do with \nthe waiver program for visas that I think will go a long way in keeping \nthis country safe.\n  We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can deal with the \nimportant issues of the American people as well as not only keeping the \ngovernment open, keeping Americans safe, but also protecting property \nrights when a Federal agency creates a problem by trying to take \nprivate property away from citizens. In this case, it is not in my \nState, but tomorrow it could be, and it could be in your State \ntomorrow. So we can do multiple important things that the American \npeople expect us to do on their behalf.\n  Mr. Speaker, we talked a lot about regular order in my colleague's \nopening statements, so here we go again. As I said earlier, we are \nlectured on a daily basis on the importance of regular order. This bill \nthat we are considering here is a perfect example of regular order. It \nwent through the committee process. We have accepted two amendments in \nthe Rules Committee that were offered to perfect this bill that the \nMembers of this full body will get an opportunity to voice their \nopinions on and to vote whether they accept them or not.\n  Just last week, Mr. Speaker, we heard two conference reports: one on \nthe highways bill and one on education. That is a great example of \nregular order being reestablished in this House of Representatives. \nSpeaker Ryan is committed to regular order, working from the ground up, \nletting the committees do their jobs, and allowing every Member to have \na voice in this process.\n  So I am very happy. I am very optimistic about the future of this \nbody and our ability to get work done under Republican leadership. I \nthink we have shown that we can get work done, and we are doing a great \njob doing it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry). He would like to speak on this issue of \nthe Red River Valley.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much the gentleman \nfrom Washington yielding me the time and his work on this issue, as \nwell as the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee for bringing it \nto the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to spend a great deal of time debating \nthe merits of the bill at this point on the rule. I think it is \nimportant, however, that I try to clear up some misunderstandings, \napparently, that have been generated.\n  Let me just say that one misunderstanding that I have heard referred \nto on the floor is that the committees in this House are not taking \naction against terrorism. I can say that the committee I am privileged \nto chair, the Armed Services Committee, has had a briefing this very \nmorning about how we can be more effective against ISIS and the threat \nof terrorism. So there is a great deal of work that is going on around \nthis House. It may not be every bill that every Member wants to see \ndebated, but a variety of committees and committees working together \nare working to take action to try to keep this country safe, and I \nthink that is important for the American people to know.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Red River Private Property Protection Act is an \nimportant act not only for the landowners on both sides of the river \nalong this 116-mile stretch in Texas and Oklahoma, but it is important \nfor property owners across the country; because, if an agency of the \nFederal Government can wake up one day and say, ``We own more land than \nwe ever have thought we owned over the last 90 years,'' it puts in \ndoubt the property rights of landowners everywhere because it is very \ndifficult to fight the Federal Government.\n  The suggestion was made that this underlying legislation is a \nlandgrab by Texas. Of course, my opinion, Mr. Speaker, is that reflects \na fundamental understanding of the situation and certainly of what this \nlegislation does.\n  Let me take just a moment to explain that, when Thomas Jefferson \nbought the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803, he bought for the \nUnited States all of the land in the riverbed of the Red River down to \nthe south bank of the river. That was affirmed in numerous treaties \nbetween the United States and Spain, the United States and Mexico, and \nthe United States and the Republic of Texas. That is the boundary, the \nsouth bank. But in 1867, the United States made a treaty with three \nIndian tribes, and that reservation that was the subject of that treaty \njust went to the middle of the river.\n  I have the exact treaty which I may well enter into the Record at a \nfuture point.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is, any reservation which later \nbecame private property in the State of Oklahoma extended only to the \nmiddle of the river, while Texas did not go further north than the \nsouth bank of the river. That leaves a narrow strip from\n\n[[Page H9098]]\n\nthe middle of the river to the south bank that is absolutely Federal \nterritory.\n\n  That is the way it has been since, as I say, at least 1867, with \nnobody else making a claim that they owned it--until 2 years ago; and \nthen the Bureau of Land Management said: We think we own a lot more \nland, not just the south bank, but a lot more land. And that is what \nhas caused this controversy.\n  So how do you solve a controversy like that? You do a survey. You \nfollow the Supreme Court decision from the 1920s. You get professionals \nout there who know what they are doing, and you conduct a survey \nexactly along the line the Supreme Court said we should. And that is \nwhat this bill does. It requires a survey along the whole 116-mile \nstretch, which has never been done. As the gentleman from Washington \nstates, as a matter of fact, they have only surveyed 6,000 acres in a \nspot sort of fashion.\n  So this tries to answer this issue once and for all. Survey the whole \nthing. We know where the line is, and, therefore, people who are \nprivate property owners on both sides of the river know where the line \nis as well.\n  Now, clearly, Mr. Speaker, there is no intention of infringing upon \nany of the rights that the tribes or anybody else has. Let me just \nquote a few provisions from the underlying legislation:\n  Nothing in this act shall be construed to ``alter the valid rights of \nthe Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Nations to the mineral interest trust \nfund created pursuant to the act of June 12, 1926.''\n  ``Nothing in this act shall be construed to modify the interest of \nTexas or Oklahoma or sovereignty rights of any federally recognized \nIndian tribe over lands located to the north of the South Bank boundary \nline as established by the survey.''\n  ``The sale of a parcel under this section shall be subject to . . . \nvalid existing State, tribal, and local rights.''\n  There are more protections in here than even I can count. So the \npoint is not to change anybody's rights. It is to prevent the Federal \nGovernment from confiscating the land that private property owners have \ndeeds to, often for generations, and have paid taxes on for years and \nyears. That is what this is trying to solve.\n  The suggestion has been made, well, all this ought to be worked out \nin court. Number one, private landowners sometimes don't have the \npockets to work it out--especially a fight with the Federal \nGovernment--in court.\n  Secondly, while you are working it out in court, this cloud hangs \nover your title. You can't sell your land. You can't borrow money on it \nbecause nobody knows if that is really Federal land or private land.\n  This was not a problem until 2 years ago, when the Bureau of Land \nManagement said: We are going to take in more land than anybody has \never alleged that the Federal Government owns.\n  The way to fix a BLM overreach is for this House to take action and \nanswer the question once and for all. That is what this legislation \ndoes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much the gentleman from Washington and \nthe chairman of the committee for giving us the opportunity to debate \nit.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration \nPolicy on H.R. 2130, which says that if the President were presented \nwith H.R. 2130, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the \nbill.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n          H.R. 2130--Red River Private Property Protection Act\n\n                 (Rep. Thornberry, R-TX, Dec. 8, 2015)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2130, which would \n     set aside existing Federal surveys, divest the Secretary of \n     the Interior of responsibility as surveyor of record for the \n     United States, and transfer lands out of Federal ownership \n     without ensuring a fair return to the taxpayer.\n       H.R. 2130 would set aside existing Federal surveys of land \n     along the Red River in Texas and would require the Secretary \n     to commission and to accept, without Federal participation, \n     surveys of the land approved by the Texas General Land \n     Office. This legislation would require the Secretary to \n     delegate her authority for determining Federal estate to a \n     state agency, would be counter to nearly 100 years of settled \n     law, and could reduce mineral revenue opportunities for the \n     Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Tribes and the State of Oklahoma.\n       The Administration shares the goal of providing legal \n     certainty to property owners along the Red River, but \n     strongly opposes the approach of voiding or nullifying \n     Federal surveys.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 2130, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include that in the Record, first of \nall, to make it clear to my colleagues that what we are doing here is a \nwaste of time. This bill isn't going anywhere.\n  I would say to the gentleman from Washington that, if his idea of \nregular order is bringing bills to the floor that are going nowhere, we \nhave a different definition of what regular order is all about. I have \nlisted for you a series of major bills that did not go through regular \norder. Most of them never went through committee. This whole process, \nsince we are 1 day away from a government shutdown, of putting an \nomnibus together is not regular order.\n  Mr. Speaker, my friends control the House, they control the Senate, \nand yet we are going to get this big bill no matter whether it passes \nor not. We are not going to know what is in this bill for weeks and \nmonths afterwards, all these riders and all these different deals on \nthe omnibus bill and the tax extender bill. So, please, regular order \nis dead.\n  We are again pursuing these procedural motions to try to force you, \nto try to shame my friends on the other side of the aisle, to bring a \nbill to the floor that the overwhelming majority of the American people \nwant us to vote on.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous \nquestion. If the previous question is defeated, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan legislation that would \nclose a glaring loophole in our gun laws allowing suspected terrorists \nto legally buy firearms. Mr. Speaker, this bill would bar the sale of \nfirearms and explosives to those on the FBI's terrorist watch list. Why \nthat is so controversial for the Republican leadership is beyond me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. To discuss our proposal, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McGovern.\n  Mr. Speaker, with just 2 days until the government runs out of \nfunding, House Republicans have chosen to bring a bill to the floor to \nsolve a dispute between two States: Texas and Oklahoma.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have an epidemic of gun violence in this country, and \nCongress is doing nothing to end the killing. Right now, a person on \nthe FBI's terrorist watch list can go to a gun store or a gun show and \npurchase a firearm legally.\n  If a person on the terrorist watch list is too dangerous to buy a \nplane ticket, why are they allowed to purchase unlimited quantities of \nweapons and ammunition?\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to act now to protect the American \npeople. The Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act \nis a bipartisan bill which prohibits the sale of firearms to people on \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation's terrorist watch list. Congress \nneeds to take the most basic step we can by passing this bill to keep \nAmericans safe from those who wish to do us harm.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts again for the \ntime.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a gun violence epidemic in this country. There \nhave been nearly 50,000 incidents of gun violence in our country this \nyear. More than 12,400 people have lost their lives. There have been \nmore than 350 mass shootings in the United States this year, more than \nthere have been days\n\n[[Page H9099]]\n\nin the year. For many killers in these mass shootings, assault weapons \nare the weapons of choice.\n  Right now, Mr. Speaker, someone who is on the terrorist watch list, \nsomeone law enforcement has deemed too dangerous to board an airplane, \ncan walk into a gun store and buy an assault rifle. This is insane. \nH.R. 1076 will fix this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman King of New York for introducing \nthis commonsense bill, and I applaud him for actually working with the \nDemocrats. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill. We need \nmore people on his side of the aisle to stop kneeling at the altar of \nthe NRA and actually do something about this urgent threat to public \nsafety.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we don't pass this into law, then shame on us for \ndoing nothing while thousands of Americans are dying each year from gun \nviolence. Instead of spending time on this Texas landgrab, as Mr. \nMcGovern says, we should be focused on the urgent issues facing our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so \nwe can take up H.R. 1076 and do something to protect our constituents \nfrom gun violence in this country.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have just one comment to make in \nresponse to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  If the definition of regular order is only considering those issues \nthat the administration approves of, then what really is our function \nhere as a Congress? Should we just put a sign out that says that we are \nclosed until a new administration comes along? It seems to me that we \nhave a duty to the American people to consider issues that are \nimportant from the majority's perspective.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I will just respond to the gentleman by \nsaying that my objection is that we have become a place where trivial \nissues get debated passionately and important ones not at all. The \ndifference between debating a Texas landgrab bill that is going nowhere \nversus a bill that could protect the American people from terror \nsuspects who now have access to buy guns, I don't think there is any \ncomparison here. The difference between doing this Texas landgrab bill \nand actually passing a bill to keep the government running, I think \npassing a bill to keep the government running is more important.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Hahn).\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for \nthe few moments to talk about something really important.\n  Colleagues, it is our responsibility to take action on behalf of the \nAmerican people that we represent, and right now they are begging us to \ntake action to keep them safe. We should not be wasting our time \ndebating this legislation on the floor today when so many lives are at \nstake.\n  The American people are anxious, many are afraid, and they have \nreason to be. Guns kill 36 people every day in our country. No other \ndeveloped country comes close to that level.\n  Some would say it is we, in this body, who are to blame because we \nhave failed to enact even the most reasonable policies to keep guns out \nof the hands of dangerous criminals.\n  It is unbelievable that an individual on the terrorist watch list can \nwalk into a gun shop and buy the firearm of their choice in this \ncountry. Among all the gaps in our gun laws, this loophole is the most \nglaring. In fact, in the past 11 years, 2,000 suspects on our FBI's \nterrorist watch list have walked into a gun store and bought the weapon \nof their choice.\n  All we are asking for is the commonsense legislation that Peter King \nhas introduced that would close this loophole be brought to this floor \nfor a vote. This bill, introduced by Peter King, has bipartisan \nsupport. Of course, this bill is not a cure-all for all gun violence in \nthis Nation, but it is a step in the right direction.\n  I join my colleagues in asking Speaker Ryan to bring this legislation \nto the floor for a vote.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Castor).\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  I had to take this opportunity to come to the floor to urge my GOP \ncolleagues to allow a vote on closing the loophole that allows \nterrorists and terrorist suspects to go and purchase firearms and get a \nlicense for explosives. It is unbelievable that this loophole still \nexists. This is something that we can work together on to help keep our \nfamilies safe all across America.\n  And here is the state of the law. Currently, if you are a felon, you \ncannot purchase a firearm. If you are a fugitive, you cannot purchase a \nfirearm. If you are a drug addict, you cannot purchase a firearm. If \nyou have been convicted of domestic violence, you cannot purchase a \nfirearm.\n  Here is the loophole: If you are on the terrorist watch list and you \ncannot fly, you can still go into the gun store and purchase a firearm. \nThis really is truly unbelievable.\n  I ask the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) to tell us \nagain the statistic, based upon the GAO report, of how many people, \nterrorists, suspected terrorists, have been able to purchase firearms.\n  Do you know?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. This astounding loophole has allowed more than 2,000 \nsuspects on the FBI's terrorist watch list to buy guns in the United \nStates over the last 11 years.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Reclaiming my time, I include in the Record a \npage that summarizes the GAO report from a few years ago, because I \nknow folks think this is a partisan fight. And don't take it from us. \nTake it from the independent GAO. It states:\n  ``Membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person \nfrom possessing firearms or explosives under current Federal law.''\n\n                   [From GAO Highlights, May 5, 2010]\n\nTerrorist Watchlist Screening: FBI Has Enhanced Its Use of Information \n       From Firearm and Explosives Background Checks To Support \n                        Counterterrorism Efforts\n\n\n                         Why GAO Did This Study\n\n       Membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a \n     person from possessing firearms or explosives under current \n     federal law. However, for homeland security and other \n     purposes, the FBI is notified when a firearm or explosives \n     background check involves an individual on the terrorist \n     watchlist. This statement addresses (1) how many checks have \n     resulted in matches with the terrorist watchlist, (2) how the \n     FBI uses information from these checks for counterterrorism \n     purposes, and (3) pending legislation that would give the \n     Attorney General authority to deny certain checks. GAO's \n     testimony is based on products issued in January 2005 and May \n     2009 and selected updates in March and April 2010. For these \n     updates, GAO reviewed policies and other documentation and \n     interviewed officials at FBI components involved with \n     terrorism-related background checks.\n\n\n                          What GAO Recommends\n\n       GAO is not making new recommendations, but has made prior \n     recommendations to the Attorney General to help ensure that \n     background checks involving individuals on the terrorist \n     watchlist are properly handled and that allowable information \n     from these checks is shared with counterterrorism officials, \n     which the FBI has implemented. GAO also suggested that \n     Congress consider adding a provision to any future \n     legislation that would require the Attorney General to define \n     when firearms or explosives could be denied, which has been \n     included in a subsequent bill.\n\n\n                             What GAO Found\n\n       From February 2004 through February 2010, FBI data show \n     that individuals on the terrorist watchlist were involved in \n     firearm or explosives background checks 1,228 times; 1,119 \n     (about 91 percent) of these transactions were allowed to \n     proceed because no prohibiting information was found--such as \n     felony convictions, illegal immigrant status, or other \n     disqualifying factors--and 109 of the transactions were \n     denied. In response to a recommendation in GAO's January 2005 \n     report, the FBI began processing all background checks \n     involving the terrorist watchlist in July 2005--including \n     those generated via state operations--to ensure consistency \n     in handling and ensure that relevant FBI components and field \n     agents are contacted during the resolution of the checks so \n     they can search for prohibiting information.\n       Based on another recommendation in GAO's 2005 report, the \n     FBI has taken actions to collect and analyze information from \n     these background checks for counterterrorism purposes. For \n     example, in April 2005,\n\n[[Page H9100]]\n\n     the FBI issued guidance to its field offices on the \n     availability and use of information collected as a result of \n     firearm and explosives background checks involving the \n     terrorist watchlist. The guidance discusses the process for \n     FBI field offices to work with FBI personnel who conduct the \n     checks and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \n     Explosives to obtain information about the checks, such as \n     the purchaser's residence address and the make, model, and \n     serial number of any firearm purchased. The guidance states \n     that any information that FBI field offices obtain related to \n     these background checks can be shared with other \n     counterterrorism and law enforcement agencies. The FBI is \n     also preparing monthly reports on these checks that are \n     disseminated throughout the FBI to support counterterrorism \n     efforts.\n       In April 2007, the Department of Justice proposed \n     legislative language to Congress that would provide the \n     Attorney General with discretionary authority to deny the \n     transfer of firearms or explosives to known or suspected \n     ``dangerous terrorists.'' At the time of GAO's May 2009 \n     report, neither the department's proposed legislative \n     language nor related proposed legislation included provisions \n     for the development of guidelines further delineating the \n     circumstances under which the Attorney General could exercise \n     this authority. GAO suggested that Congress consider \n     including a provision in any relevant legislation that would \n     require the Attorney General to establish such guidelines; \n     and this provision was included in a subsequent legislative \n     proposal. If Congress gives the Attorney General authority to \n     deny firearms or explosives based on terrorist watchlist \n     concerns, guidelines for making such denials would help to \n     provide accountability for ensuring that the expected results \n     of the background checks are being achieved. Guidelines would \n     also help ensure that the watchlist is used in a manner that \n     safeguards legal rights, including freedoms, civil liberties, \n     and information privacy guaranteed by federal law and that \n     its use is consistent with other screening processes. For \n     example, criteria have been developed for determining when an \n     individual should be denied the boarding of an aircraft.\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, we have got to act in a \nbipartisan fashion to close this loophole.\n  I urge my GOP colleagues to stop blocking the bill from \nconsideration. Bring it up for debate, and let's have a vote.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask, why are we not addressing gun violence? People \nwho aren't allowed to fly because they are suspected of terrorism \nshould not be allowed to purchase firearms.\n  I can't believe that in 2015 this is a problem that needs fixing. \nDemocrats have tried three times over to open debate on a bill--a bill, \nby the way, authored by a Republican that would block people on the no-\nfly list from walking out of a gun shop with their firearm of choice--\nand three times, the Republican House majority has blocked that \nopportunity. Ninety-one percent of the time, suspected terrorists pass \na background check because the system we have in place does not check \nto see if a potential buyer is on the no-fly list. This is absolutely \nunacceptable.\n  I ask the leadership in this House to immediately bring to the floor \nRepublican Congressman Peter King's bill to close the loophole that \nallows suspected terrorists to buy guns. And if they won't, I call upon \nmy colleagues from both sides of the aisle to sign the discharge \npetition, a petition currently before the House to force a vote on this \nbill.\n  We must allow the House to work the will of the people instead of \nthose in Congress who are more concerned with losing their ``A'' rating \nwith the NRA than keeping Americans safe.\n  Let us address gun violence. Bring the bill to the floor.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for yielding me the time and for the \ntremendous work that he has done on this issue over his career in \nelected office and, before that, as a staff member here on Capitol \nHill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in calling for this House to \nmove a bipartisan piece of legislation because we have an opportunity \nto close a loophole that allows suspected terrorists to legally \npurchase firearms and explosives. I believe we have a responsibility to \ndo so before this House takes another moment of silence, as we have \ndone countless times already this session.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the last 2 years alone, 94 percent of individuals \nsuspected of planning terrorist attacks have been able to successfully \npass background checks and purchase deadly weapons. If we don't trust \nsomebody to board a plane, why on Earth would we trust them to buy a \ngun?\n  That is why I led over 60 colleagues, along with my colleague from \nCalifornia, Mike Thompson, to write a letter to Speaker Ryan asking him \nto bring up our colleague Peter King's bill for a vote.\n  Our response to gun violence, this body's response to gun violence, \ncan no longer be moments of silence and thoughts and prayers by Members \nin this Chamber. We can do more than that. We are expected to do more \nthan that. My hope today is that we will.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the State \nof Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  Again, I want to emphasize with him, as I was down here listening to \nmy friend, that this is regular order. And, frankly, the one thing I \nhave learned in the Rules Committee, especially under this \nadministration, is, it wouldn't be a Rules Committee party if we didn't \nget a letter from the administration saying, I am not going to sign it.\n  I am not sure, many times, what they are for. Again, if we are just \ngoing to talk about issues today--we are talking about a piece of \nlegislation that affects Americans. And it is amazing to me, every time \nI come down here to hear my colleagues actually talk about trivial \npieces of legislation--if it affects the American public and it is \nsomething that affects American lives, then it is not trivial on the \nfloor of this House.\n  This bill is worth it. This Red River Private Property Protection \nAct, we are going to vote on the rule. It needs to be supported. The \nunderlying bill is going to be debated. It came through regular order. \nThese are the things that we need to be doing.\n  But if we also want to talk about things that are going on in the \nworld right now, I want to talk about the absolutely anemic response \nthat we have seen in the world situation from the administration, \nespecially when it comes to where terrorists are moving and growing and \nbeing unfettered while we stand by and watch. Especially now. In fact, \nfor this, we have had a debate, and we are looking through it.\n  Iran, you know, oops, here we go again; it is not just a song on the \nradio. Iran has decided that they are just going to flaunt what we have \nbeen saying for years.\n  But this is the key thought of our administration on attacking and \nbeing at peace with the world. They just tested nuclear missiles again \nin violation of two U.N. directives, just did it. Where is the outrage? \nThere is none.\n  We want to hang dangly little things out here. And let's talk about \nthis: The real terrorists in the world, who hate us just because we are \nfree, are still unabated.\n  It is time not to tell Congress, we will work with AUMF. But, Mr. \nPresident, it is time for you to actually give us a plan. It is time \nfor you to stop passing the buck. It is time for the administration to \ngive us an actual idea of how you want to address this, how you want to \ngo about it.\n  Iran says: I will make a deal with America, flaunt it whenever I want \nto. I will do whatever I need.\n  We come to the floor. We debate things that matter to Americans. The \nmajority understands that national security is projecting a strong \nnational security. The majority is putting forth bills that actually \nwork for people. The majority is looking today to work on a piece of \nlegislation that affects real people's lives.\n  We will continue to have debates with my friends across the aisle on \na number of issues. But today, let's move forward. And let's also have \na time to say, Mr. President, we are looking for direction. It is time \nto lead. Check in, or check out.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Young of Iowa). Members are reminded to \naddress their remarks to the Chair.\n\n[[Page H9101]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to defend the \nrecord of this House in terms of regular order, they can have it at. It \nis laughable, the record. This is the most closed Congress in the \nhistory of the United States Congress. That is the record that they are \nproud of.\n  We are here, again, trying to pressure the leadership of this House \nto let this House do what it is supposed to do: have the committees of \njurisdiction report this bill to shut down this terrible loophole which \nis a potential danger to our citizens. Bring it to the floor. We can't \nget you to bring anything to the floor related to this issue.\n  But to get up here and to somehow talk like my friends on the other \nside care about regular order or even are in the most minimal way \ncommitted to an open process here is laughable. Look at the record of \nthis Congress.\n  The Speaker and the previous Speaker all get up here and talk about \ntheir commitment to regular order. And then what do they do? They do \nthe opposite time and time again.\n  I read to you some of the bills that you brought up recently that \nhave come to the floor not under regular order. We don't need lectures \non regular order from my friends on the Republican side who, again, are \npresiding over the most closed Congress in the history of the United \nStates of America.\n  With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. \nTorres).\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, despite the increasing frequency with which \nmass shootings seem to happen in this country, we never expect it to \nhappen in our community. But a week ago today, that is exactly what \nhappened when tragedy hit home.\n  I knew the Inland Regional Center well, represented the city of San \nBernardino during my time in the State senate; and on this tragic day, \nfive individuals who lived in cities that I represent were murdered.\n  Far too many communities have felt the pain that the San Bernardino \nand Inland Empire community is facing right now. Far too many Americans \nhave lost loved ones in similar acts of violence.\n  Mr. Speaker, the loophole that allows suspects on terrorist watch \nlists to purchase a gun, to walk into a gun store and purchase a high \ncaliber weapon, must be fixed.\n  This is an urgent, commonsense, widely supported reform that we can \nmake to reduce gun violence, but we haven't. We haven't been able to \nhave a serious conversation about any of these issues.\n  Those who want to support changes to our gun laws need to make their \nvoices heard and say, enough is enough; check in, or check out.\n  Before we gather for yet another moment of silence, I remind my \ncolleagues that this House floor is for action, not inaction. Doing \nnothing is inexcusable. It is an insult to the lives lost on that \ntragic day.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would challenge any one of my colleagues to go out on \nany street corner in the United States of America and ask people who \nare walking by: Do you think the people who are on the terrorist watch \nlist who are not allowed to get on an airplane should be able to go \ninto any gun store and buy a weapon of their choice?\n  For example, a weapon that looks like this. This is a Smith & Wesson \n.223-caliber assault rifle. This is a weapon that is available to \npeople who are on the terrorist watch list. It is also the weapon that \nwas used by the shooters in San Bernardino to fire off 65 to 75 rounds \nand kill the coworkers of one of those shooters.\n  Since 2004, over 2,000 suspects on the FBI's terrorist watch list \nhave successfully purchased weapons in the United States. More than 90 \npercent of all suspected terrorists who attempted to purchase guns in \nthe last 11 years were able to do that. It may not be the biggest \nissue, but, clearly, the American people don't think that potential \nterrorists should be able to buy guns.\n  Let's do it.\n  H.R. 1076 would ban the sale of weapons to any individual, according \nto the Attorney General, who is considered to be engaged in terrorist \nactivities. Introduced by a Republican, this is bipartisan. Let's \nsupport Peter King's bill, the bill that many of us have gotten \ntogether to sponsor, as a beginning in order to say we are serious \nabout protecting our communities.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise more in sadness than in anger. This debate has \ngone on long enough. Too many of our fellow Americans have been \nvictimized by gun violence because we are enthralled by the gun lobby.\n  Who do we serve in this body if it isn't the American people? It is \nthe sacred responsibility of every Member of this body to protect that \npublic, not a special interest lobby. Are we ever going to be willing \nto put aside what we perceive we owe that lobby and act on behalf of \nthe American people?\n  If we can't do it in this example--preventing guns from getting in \nthe hands of people on a terrorist watch list--I would venture to \nguess, Mr. Speaker, that the American people who are watching this \ndebate think it is made up, that it can't be true, that it can't be \ntrue that somebody on the terrorist watch list qualifies and is going \nto be protected by this body to exercise his Second Amendment right and \nbuy a gun. Surely that cannot be true.\n  I hope we examine our hearts as well as our minds in this discussion \nand come to our senses and do something vitally important for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I think most Americans think it is \nimportant for the Constitution to be protected. The Second Amendment is \nprotected. We have the right to bear arms.\n  But most Americans would find our actions and inactions questionable \nat best because, after the 353rd mass murder, this Congress cannot come \ntogether and vote on one simple bill, that is, that individuals on the \nno-fly and terrorist watch lists would not be able to purchase guns.\n  Yes, my colleagues, today, as we stand here, they can purchase guns. \nThey can purchase guns without imprisonment, without charges. In memory \nof San Bernardino, among the other failures that caused their deaths, \nthe one we know of was the utilization of automatic weapons that shot \nthousands or hundreds of rounds--many rounds--killing these innocent \npersons.\n  I rise today to say that we should not move from this place without \npassing the Peter King bill, which keeps guns--automatic weapons--out \nof the hands of terrorists. How simple a question. How simple an \nanswer. Vote ``yes'' for the American people.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is left \non both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington has 11\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the gentleman has any \nfurther speakers?\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I have one further speaker.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I am the last speaker on my side.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Amodei).\n  Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Speaker, I don't usually show up unannounced or \nuninvited. But I have listened to the debate on this, and I find \nabsolutely amazing the outpouring of abhorrence for potential gun \nviolence from a body that failed to have a moment of silence for Kate \nSteinle, that failed to do anything to recognize that instance of gun \nviolence in the Bay Area.\n\n[[Page H9102]]\n\n  So, as I sit here and listen to all of the deplorable, junior varsity \ntheater on the message, I wonder: Why aren't we doing something about \nthat instance, which was put in the rearview mirror instantly and \naccelerate it away at the speed of light?\n  America, the junior varsity theater is in session on this issue. I \nencourage you to skip the show.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself my remaining time.\n  I am sorry that the previous speaker doesn't see the importance of \nthis issue and thinks that this is theater. I assure you that the vast \nmajority of Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike--\nthink this is a very serious issue.\n  Right now, according to the ATF, the people who cannot own a gun in \nthis country are criminals, unlawful users of controlled substances, \npeople who are mentally ill, people who have renounced their \ncitizenship, and people who have been convicted of domestic violence.\n  Our laws are clear on that. These people can't go out and buy guns. \nYet, when it comes to people who are suspected of terrorism, for some \nreason, we can't apply the law to them. For some reason, there is a \nreluctance by some on the other side of the aisle--not all, but some--\nto do something about this.\n  This is fairly easy. Congressman King, a Republican from New York, \nhas a bill that I think is fairly straightforward. It basically says \nthat people who are suspected of being terrorists, who right now can't \nfly on airplanes, should not be able to go out and purchase a gun, \nshould not be able to purchase a weapon of war.\n  That concept is controversial in this House of Representatives. It is \nhard to fathom. People can't quite understand what the problem is.\n  Now, maybe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to \nintroduce bills to allow us to be able to sell weapons to people who \nare convicted of domestic violence or to people who are felons or to \npeople who have renounced their citizenship. Maybe that is going to \nmysteriously come to the House floor. Maybe that is what the plan is, \nbut I hope not.\n\n  I don't hear them saying that. I don't hear people on the other side \nof the aisle saying we should do away with the no-fly list and allow \nsuspected terrorists to be able to fly on airplanes with the American \npeople. I don't hear people asking to do that. So what is the problem?\n  We are making a big deal of this. I am sorry the gentleman from \nNevada doesn't appreciate the importance of this issue, but we are \nmaking a big deal of this because it is a big deal. We need to do a lot \nof different things to protect the American people, and this is one of \nthem. No one is up here saying this will solve all of our problems, but \nwe are saying this is an important piece that we ought to get done.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat the \nprevious question. Allow us to have the opportunity to bring this up \nbecause we have tried every which way--we even have a discharge \npetition going to try to force a vote on this issue--and all we have \nencountered is resistance, resistance, resistance. Give us the \nopportunity to deliberate. Let the people's House do the people's \nbusiness.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and to \nthen vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  It has been an interesting hour in our discussion of private property \nrights in Texas and in Oklahoma. We have quite a broad subject here. \nLet me just say a couple of things before I close.\n  It was just yesterday that the newspaper in Los Angeles, the LA \nTimes, which is not known to be a conservative newspaper, stated: ``One \nproblem is that the people on the no-fly list''--and Mr. McGovern was \nsaying nobody wants to do anything about the no-fly list.\n  The LA Times points out: ``One problem is that the people on the no-\nfly list . . . have not been convicted of doing anything wrong . . . \nAnd the United States doesn't generally punish or penalize people \nunless and until they have been charged and convicted of a crime.''\n  It continues: ``But serious flaws in the list have been identified. \nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union''--the ACLU--``which is \nsuing the government over the no-fly list, the two lists include \nthousands of names that have been added in error . .  .The no-fly list \nhas also been used to deny boarding passes to people who only share a \nname with a suspected terrorist. Former Sen. Ted Kennedy''--from your \nState of Massachusetts--``was famously questioned at airports in 2004 \nbecause a terror suspect had used the alias `T. Kennedy.' It took the \nsenator's office three weeks to get his name cleared.''\n  Does that sound like common sense to my colleagues?\n  This is about upholding the Constitution, which we all swear an oath \nto every 2 years. Even the ACLU believes so.\n  Mr. Speaker, even though this has been a great distraction by the \nother side, I think, to blur the fact that the current administration \nhas no policy in place to defeat terrorism, to defeat ISIS, I think we \nneed to keep our eye on the ball.\n  The special terrorism task force has come up with fully 30 \nrecommendations that I am hopeful the other side of the aisle will help \nus work through and pass in order to keep this country safe.\n  This is a serious issue that all Americans are concerned with. I am \nsure my office is no different than anyone else's in that the majority \nof calls and contacts they have received over the last few weeks has \nbeen about security, about being safe in our country.\n  I hope we can work in a bipartisan way to address the true issues \nthat will keep Americans safe and not address the distractions that \ntake away the attention from where it needs to be: on the lack of a \nclear policy on the administration's part to defeat terrorism.\n  Let me get back to the underlying reason we are having this \ndiscussion this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, that being the Red River \nPrivate Property Protection Act.\n  For over 200 years, confusion and dispute over the Texas-Oklahoma \nborder have been ongoing staples of land management in that region. I \nam sure my colleagues from Oklahoma and Texas would agree with me that \nthe last thing we need further muddying this confusion is a Federal \nagency's stepping in and claiming ownership of a large portion of that \narea.\n  Dozens of landowners along the Red River should not have to live in a \nrestless state, unsure if the land they have held titles to, have \nworked hard to pay taxes on, and, in some cases, have owned for \ngenerations will suddenly be snatched up through a shoddily conducted \nsurvey.\n  Conducting a survey using the Supreme Court's approved gradient \nboundary method is the only way to truly find the boundary between \npublic and private ownership to settle this dispute once and for all.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  My colleagues from Oklahoma and Texas and their constituents deserve \nto have this matter finally settled and in a just fashion. H.R. 2130 \nprotects private property and settles the question of ownership by \nrequiring the BLM to commission a survey along the entire 116 mile \nstretch of the Red River using that gradient boundary survey method \nbacked by the Supreme Court to determine the property ownership \nboundary between private and public land. This bill ensures that the \nsurvey is done correctly, accurately, and according to the Supreme \nCourt's instructions.\n  I support the rule's adoption, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe protection of private landowners, the States, and the affected \ntribal nations' rights upheld by this rule and the underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts \nis as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 556 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist.\n\n[[Page H9103]]\n\n     The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All \n     points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. \n     General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not \n     exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair \n     and ranking minority member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered \n     for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order \n     against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion \n     of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee \n     shall rise and report the bill to the House with such \n     amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments \n     thereto to final passage without intervening motion except \n     one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the \n     Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to \n     no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day \n     the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of \n     business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the \n     Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The \n     previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New \n     York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to \n     him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

FLAP incentivizes the use of \n     more than two dozen languages and has been instrumental in \n     identifying and utilizing U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n     officers and agents who are proficient in a foreign language.\n       (B) In 1993, Congress provided for dedicated funding for \n     this program by stipulating that certain fees collected by \n     U.S. Customs and Border Protection be used to fund FLAP.\n       (C) Through FLAP, foreign travelers are aided by having an \n     officer at a port of entry who speaks their language, and \n     U.S. Customs and Border Protection benefits by being able to \n     focus its border security efforts in a more effective manner.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     FLAP incentivizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers \n     to attain and maintain competency in a foreign language, \n     thereby improving the efficiency of operations for the \n     functioning of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's security \n     mission, making the United States a more welcoming place when \n     foreign travelers find officers can communicate in their \n     language, and helping to expedite traveler processing to \n     reduce wait times.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Preclearance Operations\n\n     SEC. 811.

(as \n     continued in effect pursuant to the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)), including \n     sections to ensure foreign persons comply with applicable \n     reporting requirements relating to the Boycott;\n       (C) enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-\n     455; 90 Stat. 1520) that denies certain tax benefits to \n     entities abiding by the Boycott;\n       (D) ensuring through free trade agreements with Bahrain and \n     Oman that such countries no longer participate in the \n     Boycott; and\n       (E) ensuring as a

commercial relations specifically with \n     Israel, such as boycotts of, divestment from, or sanctions \n     against Israel;\n       (5) notes that boycotts of, divestment from, and sanctions \n     against Israel by governments, governmental bodies, quasi-\n     governmental bodies, international organizations, and other \n     such entities are contrary to principle of nondiscrimination \n     under the GATT 1994 (as defined in section 2(1)(B) of the \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3501(1)(B)));\n       (6) encourages the inclusion of politically motivated \n     actions that

against Israel; and\n       (7) supports efforts to prevent investigations or \n     prosecutions by governments or international organizations of \n     United States persons solely on the basis of such persons \n     doing business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in any \n     territory controlled by Israel.\n       (c) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives of the United \n

  foreign boycotts of Israel, or compliance with the Arab \n     League Boycott of Israel, by prospective trading partners.\n       (2) Effective date.--This subsection takes effect on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act and applies with respect to \n     negotiations commenced before, on, or after such date of \n     enactment.\n       (d) Report on Politically Motivated Acts of Boycott

description of specific steps being taken by the \n     United States to encourage foreign countries and \n     international organizations to cease creating such barriers \n     and to dismantle

As of 2015, exports from Nepal are \n     approximately $800,000,000 per year, with India the major \n     market at $450,000,000 annually. The United States imports \n     about $80,000,000 worth of goods from Nepal, or 10 percent of \n     the total goods exported from Nepal.\n       (B) The World Bank has found evidence that the overall \n     export competitiveness of Nepal has been declining since \n     2005. Indices compiled by the World Bank and the Organization \n     for Economic Co-operation and Development found that export \n     costs in Nepal are high with respect to both air cargo and \n     container shipments relative to other low-income countries. \n     Such indices also identify particular weaknesses in Nepal \n     with respect to automation of customs and other trade \n     functions, involvement of local exporters and importers in \n     preparing regulations and trade rules, and export finance.\n       (C) Implementation by Nepal of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization could directly \n     address some of the weaknesses described in subparagraph (B).\n       (2) Establishment of trade facilitation and capacity \n     building program.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall, in \n     consultation with the Government of Nepal, establish a trade \n     facilitation and capacity building program for Nepal--\n       (A) to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal \n     to support successful exporters and to build awareness among \n     potential exporters in Nepal about opportunities abroad and \n     ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the \n     United States and other countries;\n       (B) to provide export finance training for financial \n     institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal;\n       (C) to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining \n     publication on the Internet of all trade regulations, forms \n     for exporters and importers, tax and tariff rates, and other \n     documentation relating to exporting goods and developing a \n     robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade \n     Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for \n     implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for \n     under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade \n     Organization; and\n       (D) to increase access to guides for importers and \n     exporters, through publication of such guides on the \n     Internet, including rules and documentation for United States \n     tariff preference programs.\n       (e) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than one year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually \n     thereafter, the President shall monitor, review, and report \n     to Congress on the implementation of this section, the \n     compliance of Nepal with subsection (b)(1), and the trade and \n     investment policy of the United States with respect to Nepal.\n       (f) Termination of Preferential Treatment.--No preferential \n     treatment extended under this section shall remain in effect \n     after December 31, 2025.\n       (g) Effective Date.--The provisions of this section shall \n     take effect on the date that is 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 916.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A MISCELLANEOUS \n                   TARIFF BILL PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States imposes \n     duties on imported goods for which there is no domestic \n     availability or insufficient domestic availability.\n       (2) The imposition of duties on such goods creates \n     artificial distortions in the economy of the United States \n     that negatively affect United States manufacturers and \n     consumers.\n       (3) It would be in the interests of the United States if \n     the Harmonized Tariff Schedule were updated regularly and \n     predictably to eliminate such artificial distortions by \n     suspending or reducing duties on such goods.\n       (4) The manufacturing competitiveness of the United States \n     around the world would be enhanced if the Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedule were updated regularly and predictably to suspend or \n     reduce duties on such goods.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     to remove the competitive disadvantage to United States \n     manufacturers and consumers resulting from the imposition of \n     such duties and to promote the competitiveness of United \n     States manufacturers, the Committee on Finance of the Senate \n     and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives are urged to advance, as soon as possible, \n     after consultation with the public and Members of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, a regular and predictable \n     legislative process for the temporary suspension and \n     reduction of duties that is consistent with the rules of the \n     Senate and the House.\n\n     SEC. 920.

Companies that are members of C-TPAT are \n     considered low-risk, which expedites cargo clearance based on \n     the company's security profile and compliance history.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 101 requires the Commissioner of CBP to work with \n     the private sector and other Federal agencies to ensure that \n     all CBP partnership programs provide trade benefits to \n     participants. This would apply to partnership programs \n     established before enactment of this bill, and any programs \n     established after enactment. It establishes elements for the \n     development and operation of any such partnership programs, \n     which require the Commissioner to: 1) consult with private \n     sector entities, the public, and other Federal agencies when \n     appropriate, to ensure that participants receive commercially \n     significant and measurable trade benefits; 2) ensure an \n     integrated and transparent system of trade benefits and \n     compliance requirements for all CBP partnership programs; 3) \n     consider consolidating partnership programs in situations in \n     which doing so would support the objectives of such programs, \n     increase participation, enhance trade benefits, and enhance \n     the allocation of resources of CBP; 4) coordinate with the \n     Director of ICE, and other Federal agencies with authority to \n     detain and release merchandise; and 5) ensure that trade \n     benefits are provided to participants in partnership \n     programs.\n       It further requires the Commissioner to submit to the \n     Committee on Finance and the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Ways and Means and the Committee on Homeland Security of the \n     House of Representatives a report that: 1) identifies each \n     partnership program; 2) for each program, identifies the \n     requirements for participation, benefits provided to \n     participants, the number of participants, and in the case of \n     a program that provides for participation at multiple tiers, \n     the number of participants at each such tier; 3) identifies \n     the number of participants enrolled in more than one program; \n     4) assesses the effectiveness of each program in advancing \n     the security, trade enforcement, and trade facilitation \n     missions of CBP; 5) summarizes CBP's efforts to work with \n     other Federal agencies to detain and release merchandise \n     entering the United States to ensure that partnership \n     programs of those agencies are compatible with CBP \n     partnership programs; 6) summarizes criteria developed with \n     those agencies for authorizing the release, on an expedited \n     basis, of merchandise for which documentation is required \n     from one or more of those agencies to clear or license the \n     merchandise for entry into the United States; 7) summarizes \n     CBP efforts to work with the private sector and the public to \n     develop partnership programs; 8) describes measures taken by \n     CBP to make the private sector aware of trade benefits \n     available to participants in partnership programs; and 9) \n     summarizes CBP's plans, targets, and goals with respect to \n     partnership programs for the two years following submission \n     of the report.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 101 of the Senate amendment is the same as section \n     101 of the House amendment with the exception of a difference \n     in the recipients of the report required in this section.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment.\n\n\n  SECTION 102.

The Department of \n     the Treasury Order No. 100-16, effective May 23, 2003, \n     specified that COAC would be administered jointly by the \n     Department of the Treasury and Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 109(a) requires the Secretary of the Treasury and \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly establish a \n     Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC).\n       Section 109(b) requires that COAC be comprised of 20 \n     appointed individuals from the private sector, appointed \n     without regard to political affiliation; the Commissioner of \n     CBP and the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Tax Policy, \n     who shall co-chair meetings; and the Assistant Secretary for \n     Policy of the Department of Homeland Security and the ICE \n     Director, who shall serve as deputy co-chairs of meetings. \n     Section 109(b) further requires that appointed private sector \n     individuals be representative of individuals and firms \n     affected by the commercial operations of CBP, and provides \n     that individuals may be appointed to multiple 3-year terms \n     but cannot serve more than two terms sequentially. The \n     Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security are \n     authorized to transfer members to the COAC who are currently \n     serving on the Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of \n     the United States Customs Service.\n       Section 109(c) establishes the duties of COAC, which shall \n     be to: 1) advise the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland \n     Security on all matters involving the commercial operations \n     of CBP and the investigations of ICE; 2) provide \n     recommendations to the Secretaries on improvements that CBP \n     and ICE should make to their commercial operations and \n     investigations; 3) collaborate in developing the agenda for \n     COAC meetings; and 4) perform other functions relating to the \n     commercial operations of CBP and the investigations of ICE as \n     prescribed by law or as directed by the Secretaries.\n       Section 109(d) establishes that: 1) COAC shall meet at the \n     call of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security, or two-thirds of the membership of COAC; \n     2) COAC shall meet at least four times each calendar year; \n     and 3) that COAC meetings shall be open to the public unless \n     the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security determines that the meeting will include matters the \n     disclosure of which would compromise the development of \n     policies, priorities, or negotiating objectives or positions \n     that could impact the commercial operations of CBP of the \n     operations or investigations of ICE.\n       Section 109(e) requires COAC to submit an annual report to \n     the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on \n     Ways and Means that describes the activities of COAC during \n     the preceding fiscal year and sets forth any recommendations \n     of COAC regarding the commercial operations of CBP.\n       Section 109(f) establishes that section 14(a)(2) of the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), relating to \n     the termination of advisory committees, shall not apply to \n     COAC.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 109 of the Senate amendment is the same as section \n     109 of the House amendment.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and \n     the Senate amendment with a modification. The Conferees have \n     agreed to strike Section 109(d)(2). The Conferees believe \n     that COAC meetings should normally be open to the public. The \n     Conferees recognize the need to close COAC meetings, in \n     portion or in whole, when a meeting will include matters the \n     disclosure of which would compromise the development of \n     policies, priorities, or negotiating objectives or positions \n     that could impact the operations of CBP or the operations or \n     investigations of ICE. The Conferees agree, however, that the \n     current procedures in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 \n     U.S.C. App.) are sufficient to close COAC meetings, in \n     portion or in whole, when necessary.\n\n\n           section 110. centers for excellence and expertise\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 110(a) requires the Commissioner to develop and \n     implement, in consultation with the Committee on Finance and \n     the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives, and the COAC established by section 109(a), \n     Centers of Excellence and Expertise (CEE) throughout CBP \n     that: 1) enhance the economic competitiveness of the United \n     States; 2) improve enforcement efforts; 3) build upon CBP \n     expertise in particular industry operations, supply chains, \n     and compliance requirements; 4) promote the uniform \n     implementation at each port of entry of policies and \n     regulations relating to imports; 5) centralize the trade \n     enforcement and trade facilitation efforts of CBP; 6) \n     formalize an account-based approach to the importation of \n     merchandise into the United States; 7) foster partnerships \n     through the expansion of trade programs and other trusted \n     trader programs; 8) develop applicable performance measures \n     to meet internal efficiency and effectiveness goals; and 9) \n     when feasible, facilitate a more efficient flow of \n     information between Federal agencies.\n       Section 110(b) requires the Commissioner to submit a report \n     to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Homeland \n     Security of the House of Representatives no later than \n     December 31, 2016 describing the scope, functions and \n     structure of the CEEs; the effectiveness of the CEEs in \n     improving enforcement efforts; the benefits to the trade \n     community; applicable performance measurements; the \n     performance of each CEE in facilitating trade; and any \n     planned changes to the CEEs.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 110 of the Senate amendment is similar to section \n     110 of the House amendment except the House amendment \n     requires the CEEs to use targeting information from the \n     National Targeting Center at CBP, while the Senate amendment \n     requires the CEEs to use targeting information from the \n     Commercial Targeting Division established in the amendment. \n     The amendments also differ in the recipients of the required \n     report.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment.\n\n\n   section 111. commercial risk assessment targeting and trade alerts\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 111(a) requires National Targeting Center (NTC) to \n     establish methodologies for assessing the risk that imports \n     may violate U.S. customs and trade laws and to issue trade \n     alerts when the NTC determines cargo may violate such laws; \n     assess the risk of cargo based on all information available \n     to CBP through the Automated Targeting System, ACE, the \n     Automated Entry System, ITDS, and TECS (formerly known as the \n     ``Treasury Enforcement Communications System'') or any \n     successor systems, publicly available information, and \n     information made available to the NTC by private sector \n     entities; and, provide for the receipt and transmission to \n     appropriate CBP offices of allegations from interested \n     parties in the private sector of violations of the customs \n     and trade laws of the United States relating to the priority \n     trade issues described in section 111(a) of the House \n     amendment (section 117 of the conference report).\n       Section 111(b) authorizes the Executive Director of the NTC \n     to issue trade alerts to port directors when such person \n     determines cargo may violate U.S. customs and trade laws. \n     The trade alert may direct further inspection or physical \n     examination or testing of specific merchandise by the port \n     personnel. A port director may determine not to carry out \n     the direction of the trade alerts if the port director \n     finds security interests justify such determination, and \n     the port director notifies the Assistant Commissioner of \n     the Office of Field Operations of such determination. The \n     Assistant Commissioner of the Office of Field Operations \n     must compile an annual report of all determinations by \n     port directors to not implement trade alerts and include \n     an evaluation of the utilization of trade alerts. This \n     report must be submitted to Committee on Finance and the\n\n[[Page H9157]]\n\n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives not later than December 31 each year. \n     Section 111(b) further defines ``inspection'' as the \n     comprehensive evaluation process used by CBP, other than \n     physical examination or testing, to permit the entry of \n     merchandise into the United States, or the clearance of \n     merchandise for transportation in bond through the United \n     States for the purposes of assessing duties, identifying \n     restricted or prohibited items, and ensuring compliance \n     with all applicable customs and trade laws and regulations \n     administered by CBP.\n       Section 111(c) amends section 343(a)(3)(F) of the Trade Act \n     of 2002 to establish that the information collected pursuant \n     to regulations shall be used exclusively for ensuring cargo \n     safety and security, prevent smuggling, and commercial risk \n     assessment targeting, and shall not be used for any \n     commercial enforcement purposes, including for determining \n     merchandise entry.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 111(a) of the Senate amendment establishes a \n     Commercial Targeting Division (CTD) at CBP by amending \n     section 2(d) of the Act of March 3, 1927 (19 U.S.C. 2072(d)). \n     The section requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     establish and maintain a Commercial Targeting Division (CTD) \n     within CBP's Office of International Trade at CBP. The CTD \n     shall be comprised of headquarters staff led by an Executive \n     Director, and individual National Targeting and Analysis \n     Groups (NTAGs) led by Directors reporting to the Executive \n     Director. The CTD shall develop and conduct commercial \n     targeting with respect to cargo destined for the United \n     States and issue trade alerts.\n       Section 111(a) requires the establishment of an NTAG for, \n     at a minimum, each of the following priority trade issues \n     (PTIs): 1) agricultural programs; 2) antidumping and \n     countervailing duties; 3) import safety; 4) intellectual \n     property rights; 5) revenue; 6) textiles and wearing apparel; \n     and 7) trade agreements and preference programs. The \n     Commissioner may alter the PTIs in consultation with the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House of Representatives.\n       The duties of each NTAG include: 1) directing the trade \n     enforcement and compliance assessment activities of CBP as \n     they relate to the each NTAG's PTI; 2) facilitating, \n     promoting, and coordinating cooperation and the exchange of \n     information between CBP, ICE, and other relevant Federal \n     departments and agencies regarding each NTAG's PTI; and 3) \n     serving as the primary liaison between CBP and the public \n     regarding United States Government activities related to each \n     NTAG's PTI.\n       Section 111(a) also requires the CTD to establish \n     methodologies for assessing the risk that cargo destined for \n     the United States may violate U.S. customs and trade laws and \n     for issuing Trade Alerts. The CTD should assess the risk of \n     cargo based on all information available to CBP through the \n     Automated Targeting System, ACE, the Automated Commercial \n     System, the Automated Export System, ITDS, and TECS (formerly \n     known as the ``Treasury Enforcement Communications System''), \n     the case management system of ICE or any successor systems, \n     and publicly available information. The CTD should also use \n     information provided by private sector entities and \n     coordinate targeting efforts with other Federal agencies.\n       The section authorizes the CTD Executive Director and NTAG \n     Directors to issue Trade Alerts to port directors to ensure \n     compliance with U.S. customs and trade laws. The Trade Alert \n     may direct further inspection or physical examination or \n     testing of merchandise by port personnel if certain risk-\n     assessment thresholds are met. A port director may determine \n     not to carry out the direction of the Trade Alerts if the \n     port director finds such a determination is justified by \n     security interests and the port director notifies the \n     Assistant Commissioners of the Office of Field Operations and \n     the Office of International Trade of such a determination. \n     The Assistant Commissioner of the Office of Field Operations \n     must compile an annual report of all determinations by port \n     directors to override Trade Alerts and evaluate the \n     utilization of Trade Alerts.\n       Section 111(b) amends section 343(a)(3)(F) of the Trade Act \n     of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 2071 note), to indicate that information \n     collected pursuant to the regulations shall be used \n     exclusively for ensuring cargo safety and security, \n     preventing smuggling, and commercial risk assessment \n     targeting, and shall not be used for any commercial \n     enforcement purposes, including for determining merchandise \n     entry.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment with \n     modifications.

COOPERATION WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES ON PREVENTING EVASION \n                          OF TRADE REMEDY LAWS\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 414(a) requires the negotiation of bilateral \n     agreements with other countries' customs authorities to \n     cooperate on preventing evasion. These agreements should \n     include provisions allowing the sharing of information to \n     determine if evasion occurred, verification of such \n     information, allowing officials from the importing country to \n     participate in such verifications, and, if a country refuses \n     to allow officials from an importing country to participate \n     in a verification, allowing the importing country to take \n     such lack of cooperation into account in its trade \n     enforcement and compliance activities.\n       Section 414(b) allows CBP to take into account whether a \n     country is a party to a bilateral agreement regarding \n     cooperation on evasion and the extent to which that country \n     is cooperating under such an agreement for the purposes of \n     trade enforcement and compliance assessment of that country's \n     exports regarding potential evasion.\n       Section 414(c) requires an annual report to Congress on the \n     status of ongoing negotiations of bilateral cooperation \n     agreements regarding evasion, the terms of any such completed \n     agreements, and any cooperation and other activities \n     conducted as a result of such agreements.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment.\n\n\n               section 415. trade negotiating objectives\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 415 establishes obtaining the commitments for \n     cooperation on evasion described in section 414 as a \n     negotiating objective for current trade agreements under \n     negotiation and future agreements.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment.\n\n       Subtitle B--Investigation of Evasion of Trade Remedy Laws\n\n\nsection 421. procedures for investigation of evasion of antidumping and \n                       countervailing duty orders\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 421 grants the Department of Commerce the authority \n     to administratively investigate evasion and order CBP to \n     collect or preserve for collection antidumping and \n     countervailing duties owed on evading imports. In addition to \n     defining required terms, section 421(a) excludes from these \n     investigations evasion that is the result of clerical errors \n     unless the errors reflect a pattern of negligent conduct.\n       Section 421(b) establishes the procedures for evasion \n     investigations. The Department of Commerce may self-initiate \n     an evasion investigation, or may initiate an investigation as \n     a result of an adequate petition from an interested party or \n     a referral from CBP. CBP is required to refer a matter to the \n     Department of Commerce if CBP has information that evasion \n     occurred, but cannot determine if the merchandise is in fact \n     subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order. The \n     Department of Commerce has 30 days after receiving a petition \n     or referral to determine whether to initiate an \n     investigation. The Department of Commerce is to notify CBP if \n     it initiates an evasion investigation as a result of a \n     petition from an interested party.\n       CBP is required to provide documents and information \n     requested by the Department of Commerce for an evasion \n     investigation within 10 days after the request and these \n     documents and information will be available to\n\n[[Page H9162]]\n\n     authorized representatives of interested parties under an \n     administrative protective order. If an authorized \n     representative of an interested party has access to business \n     proprietary information from another Department of Commerce \n     proceeding under an administrative protective order issued in \n     that proceeding and this information is relevant to an \n     evasion investigation, the authorized representative may \n     submit this information on the record of the evasion \n     investigation. The Department of Commerce is authorized to \n     issue questionnaires to interested parties in an evasion \n     investigation and to make an adverse inference against a \n     party that fails to cooperate to the best of its ability.\n       The Department of Commerce is to issue a preliminary \n     determination of whether there is a reasonable basis to \n     believe or suspect evasion within 90 days after initiation of \n     the investigation and a final determination of evasion within \n     300 days after initiation. If the Department of Commerce \n     makes an affirmative preliminary determination of evasion, \n     CBP is to suspend liquidation of entries of evading \n     merchandise on or after the preliminary determination and any \n     unliquidated entries before that date. A cash deposit is also \n     required for such entries reflecting the applicable rates \n     previously determined by the Department of Commerce.\n       If the Department of Commerce makes an affirmative final \n     determination of evasion, CBP is to assess the applicable \n     antidumping and countervailing duties on entries of evading \n     merchandise, including such entries that were already \n     liquidated, and to review and reassess the amount of bond or \n     other security the importer must post for entries of such \n     merchandise on or after the date of the final determination. \n     The Department of Commerce may also instruct CBP to require a \n     cash deposit or bond on entries of such merchandise on or \n     after the date of the final determination in the amount of \n     antidumping and countervailing duties potentially owed on the \n     merchandise. If the Department of Commerce cannot determine \n     the amount of the applicable antidumping and countervailing \n     duty rate or cash deposit because the actual producer or \n     exporter of the merchandise is unknown, then the highest \n     amount for any producer or exporter will be applied. If the \n     Department of Commerce makes a negative final determination \n     of evasion, then any suspension of liquidation is ended and \n     any cash deposits refunded. The preliminary and final \n     determinations in an evasion investigation are to be \n     published in the Federal Register, as well as the notice of \n     initiation of such an investigation.\n       If the Department of Commerce makes an affirmative \n     preliminary or final determination of evasion, it is required \n     to transmit the administrative record of the investigation to \n     CBP and any other agency that requests the administrative \n     record. After making a final determination, the Department of \n     Commerce may also provide importers information discovered in \n     an investigation that would help educate importers on \n     complying with importing merchandise in accordance with U.S. \n     laws and regulations.\n       The Department of Commerce and CBP are to establish \n     procedures to maximize cooperation and communication between \n     the two agencies to quickly, efficiently, and accurately \n     investigation allegations of evasion. The Department of \n     Commerce will issue annual reports to Congress on the conduct \n     of evasion investigations.\n       Section 421(b) makes a technical amendment to the table of \n     contents for title VII of the Trade Act of 1930 to reflect \n     this subtitle.\n       Section 421(c) establishes that the Department of \n     Commerce's final determination in an evasion investigation is \n     subject to judicial review by the U.S. Court of International \n     Trade.\n       Section 421(d) instructs the Department of Commerce and CBP \n     to issue regulations to implement this subtitle.\n       Section 421(e) provides that the amendments in this \n     subtitle are effective 180 days after enactment and applies \n     to merchandise entered on or after the date of enactment.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 402 requires that if the Commissioner makes an \n     affirmative determination of evasion, the Commissioner shall: \n     1) suspend the liquidation of any unliquidated entries of the \n     covered merchandise that is the subject of the allegation \n     entered between the date of initiation and the date of the \n     determination; 2) extend the period for liquidating any \n     unliquidated entries of merchandise that entered before the \n     initiation of the investigation; 3) notify Commerce of the \n     determination and request that Commerce determine the \n     appropriate duty rates for such covered merchandise; 4) \n     require importers of such covered merchandise to post cash \n     deposits and assess duties on the covered merchandise as \n     directed by Commerce; and 5) take such additional enforcement \n     measures as the Commissioner deems appropriate, including \n     initiating proceedings for related violations of law, \n     modifying CBP's procedures for identifying future evasion, \n     requiring a deposit of estimated duties on future entries, \n     and referring the matter to ICE for civil or criminal \n     investigation. The section also requires the Department of \n     Commerce to promptly provide the Commissioner with cash \n     deposit rates and antidumping and countervailing duty rates, \n     and establishes a special rule for cases in which the \n     producer or exporter is unknown.\n       Under section 402, the Commissioner must determine within \n     90 calendar days of initiation of an evasion investigation \n     whether there is a reasonable suspicion that entries of \n     covered merchandise that are the subject of the allegation \n     were entered through evasion. If the Commissioner decides \n     there is a reasonable suspicion, the Commissioner shall: \n     1) suspend the liquidation of any unliquidated entries of \n     the covered merchandise entered after the date of \n     initiation; 2) extend the period for liquidating any \n     unliquidated entries of merchandise that entered before \n     the initiation of the investigation; and 3) take any \n     additional measures necessary to protect the ability to \n     collect appropriate duties, which may include requiring a \n     single transaction bond or posting cash deposits with \n     respect to entries of covered merchandise.\n       Section 402 requires that if the Commissioner makes an \n     affirmative determination of evasion, the Commissioner shall \n     (1) suspend the liquidation of any unliquidated entries of \n     the covered merchandise that is the subject of the allegation \n     entered between the date of initiation and the date of the \n     determination; (2) extend the period for liquidating any \n     unliquidated entries of merchandise that entered before the \n     initiation of the investigation; (3) notify Commerce of the \n     determination and request that Commerce determine the \n     appropriate duty rates for such covered merchandise; (4) \n     require importers of such covered merchandise to post cash \n     deposits and assess duties on the covered merchandise as \n     directed by Commerce; and (5) take such additional \n     enforcement measures as the Commissioner deems appropriate, \n     including initiating proceedings for related violations of \n     law, modifying CBP's procedures for identifying future \n     evasion, requiring a deposit of estimated duties on future \n     entries, and referring the matter to ICE for civil or \n     criminal investigation. The section also requires the \n     Department of Commerce to promptly provide the Commissioner \n     with cash deposit rates and antidumping and countervailing \n     duty rates, and establishes a special rule for cases in which \n     the producer or exporter is unknown.\n       Under section 402, the Commissioner must determine within \n     90 calendar days of initiation of an evasion investigation \n     whether there is a reasonable suspicion that entries of \n     covered merchandise that are the subject of the allegation \n     were entered through evasion. If the Commissioner decides \n     there is a reasonable suspicion, the Commissioner shall (1) \n     suspend the liquidation of any unliquidated entries of the \n     covered merchandise entered after the date of initiation; (2) \n     extend the period for liquidating any unliquidated entries of \n     merchandise that entered before the initiation of the \n     investigation; and (3) take any additional measures necessary \n     to protect the ability to collect appropriate duties, which \n     may include requiring a single transaction bond or posting \n     cash deposits with respect to entries of covered merchandise.\n       Section 402 provides a period of 30 business days for \n     interested party who made the allegation of evasion or the \n     importer of the covered merchandise alleged to have entered \n     the merchandise subject to the evasion determination to \n     request de novo administrative review by the Commissioner \n     after notification of a determination. Section 402 \n     establishes that judicial review shall be available to the \n     interested party alleging evasion or the party found to have \n     entered merchandise subject to the investigation through \n     evasion of any administrative review of the evasion \n     determination by CBP. Section 402 also sets out a rule of \n     construction with respect to other civil and criminal \n     proceedings so that no determination under subsection (c) or \n     action taken by the Commissioner pursuant to the section \n     shall be construed to limit the authority to carry out, or \n     the scope of, any other proceeding or investigation pursuant \n     to any other provision of Federal or State law.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment \n     except for the following changes. The definition of the term \n     ``interested party'' is expanded to include a foreign \n     manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or the United States \n     importer, of covered merchandise, or a trade or business \n     association a majority of the members of which are producers, \n     exporters, or importers of such merchandise.\n       The Commissioner has 15 business days after receiving an \n     evasion allegation or a referral to determine whether to \n     initiate an investigation.\n       If the Commissioner is unable to determine whether the \n     merchandise at issue is covered merchandise, the Commissioner \n     shall refer the matter to the Department of Commerce to \n     determine whether the merchandise is covered merchandise. The \n     Department of Commerce is to make this determination pursuant \n     to its applicable statutory and regulatory authority, and the \n     determination shall be subject to judicial review under 19 \n     U.S.C. 1516a(a)(2). The Conferees intend that such \n     determinations include whether the merchandise at issue is \n     subject merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1677j. The time required \n     for the Department of Commerce to determine whether the \n     merchandise at issue is covered merchandise shall not be \n     counted in calculating any deadlines under the procedures \n     created by this section.\n       The Commissioner has 300 calendar days after the date on \n     which an evasion investigation was initiated to make a \n     determination as to whether the covered merchandise was \n     entered through evasion. If the Commissioner concludes that \n     the investigation is extraordinarily complicated and \n     additional\n\n[[Page H9163]]\n\n     time is necessary to make a determination, then the \n     Commission may extend the time to make a determination by no \n     more than 60 calendar days.\n       It is clarified that an adverse inference may be used with \n     respect to a person alleged to have entered covered \n     merchandise through evasion, or a foreign producer or \n     exporter of covered merchandise alleged to have entered \n     through evasion regardless of whether another person involved \n     in the same transaction or transactions has provided \n     requested information.\n       The standard of review for judicial review of an \n     investigation is clarified to be whether the Commissioner \n     fully complied with all procedures in making a determination \n     and conducting an administrative review of that determination \n     and whether any determination, finding, or conclusion is \n     arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Other \n     technical changes were made to the judicial review provision.\n\n\n          section 422. government accountability office report\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 422 directs the Government Accountability Office to \n     submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the \n     provisions made by this title and the actions by the \n     Department of Commerce and CBP pursuant to this title.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement does not contain this section. \n     Under the House amendment, the Department of Commerce would \n     conduct evasion investigations, and the primary purpose of \n     the report was to monitor the cooperation of the Department \n     of Commerce and CBP in the Department of Commerce's conduct \n     of such investigations. This report is not required under the \n     Conference Agreement because the Senate amendment is being \n     followed, which has CBP conduct evasion investigations.\n\n                       Subtitle C--Other Matters\n\n\n           section 431. allocation and training of personnel\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 431 requires CBP, to the maximum extent possible, \n     to assign sufficient personnel responsible for preventing and \n     investigating evasion and to provide adequate training for \n     such personnel.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment.\n\n\nsection 432. annual report on prevention of evasion of antidumping and \n                       countervailing duty orders\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 432(a) directs CBP, in consultation with the \n     Department of Commerce and ICE, to provide Congress with an \n     annual report on efforts to prevent and investigate evasion.\n       The required contents of the report are described in \n     section 432(b). In addition to metrics on CBP's activities, \n     resource allocation and training regarding evasion, the \n     report must include a description of CBP's policies and \n     practices regarding evasion, any changes in such policies and \n     practices, and any recommended legislative or other changes \n     to improve the effectiveness of CBP in preventing and \n     identifying evasion.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 403 requires the Commissioner to submit to the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House an annual report on the Commissioner's \n     efforts to prevent and investigate the evasion of antidumping \n     and countervailing duty orders.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, \n     except to clarify that the report is to cover all types of \n     evasion allegations and investigations. The requirement to \n     report the number of investigations not completed within the \n     deadlines provided in section 517 of the Tariff Act of 1930, \n     as added by section 421 of this Act, is removed because the \n     Commissioner is statutorily required to meet these deadlines.\n\n\n         section 433. addressing circumvention by new shippers\n\n     Present Law\n       Section 751(a)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \n     1675(a)(2)(B)) allows new exporters and producers to obtain \n     an individual weighted average dumping margin or individual \n     countervailing duty rate on an expedited basis. While the \n     review to determine the individual margin or duty rate is \n     being conducted, an importer of the new exporter or \n     producer's merchandise may post a bond or security instead of \n     a cash deposit for entries of that merchandise.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 433 strikes the ability of an importer of a new \n     exporter or producer's merchandise to post a bond or security \n     instead of a cash deposit for entries of that merchandise \n     while the Department of Commerce is determining the exporter \n     or producer's individual weighted average dumping margin or \n     individual countervailing duty rate. This section also adds \n     the requirement that the individual weighted average dumping \n     margin or individual countervailing duty rate for a new \n     exporter or producer must be based on bona fide sales in the \n     United States and sets out criteria to be considered in \n     determining if such sales were bona fide.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment.\n\n   Title V--Small Business Trade Issues and State Trade Coordination\n\n\n                        section 501. short title\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement sets forth the short title as the \n     ``Small Business Trade Enhancement Act of 2015'' or the \n     ``State Trade Coordination Act.''\n\n\n    section 502. outreach and input from small businesses to trade \n                          promotion authority\n\n     Present Law\n       Per section 203 of Public Law 94-305 (15 U.S.C. 1634c), the \n     Office of Advocacy within the Small Business Administration \n     is statutorily charged with receiving complaints, criticisms, \n     and suggestions concerning federal policies affecting small \n     businesses, transmitting those complaints, criticisms and \n     suggestions to the relevant federal regulatory agencies, and \n     developing proposals for changes in the policies and \n     activities of federal agencies as those relate to small \n     businesses. However, current law does not specifically \n     provide for engagement by the Office of Advocacy during the \n     negotiation of trade agreements.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The Conferees agree to amend section 203 of Public Law 94-\n     305 (15 U.S.C. 634c) by adding certain provisions and \n     requirements concerning the Office of Advocacy. In \n     particular, the provision requires: 1) the Chief Counsel for \n     Advocacy to convene an Interagency Working Group (IWG) not \n     later than 30 days after the date on which the President \n     submits a notification to Congress under section 105(a) of \n     Public Law 114-26; 2) the IWG to include representation from \n     the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the \n     Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, and \n     any other federal agencies deemed relevant with respect to \n     the subject of the trade agreement at issue; 3) the IWG to \n     identify a diverse group of small entities to provide to the \n     IWG the views of small businesses on the potential economic \n     effects of the trade agreement at issue; and 4) the Chief \n     Counsel for Advocacy to submit to relevant Committees of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the \n     economic impacts of the trade agreement at issue on small \n     entities. By assigning the Office of Advocacy a role in trade \n     negotiations, the legislation will promote consideration of \n     small business interests throughout trade negotiation \n     processes.\n\n\n               section 503. state trade expansion program\n\n     Present Law\n       Section 1207 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Pub. \n     L. 111-240) created a pilot State Trade and Export Promotion \n     Grant Program to make grants to states to carry out export \n     promotion programs for small businesses.

HONEY TRANSSHIPMENT\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 608(a) requires the Commissioner of CBP to direct \n     appropriate personnel and resources to address concerns that \n     honey is being imported into the United States in violation \n     of U.S. customs and trade laws.\n       Section 608(b) requires CBP to compile a database of the \n     individual characteristics of foreign honey to facilitate the \n     verification of country of origin markings, and to seek to \n     work with foreign governments, industry, and the Food and \n     Drug Administration in compiling the database.\n       Section 608(c) requires the Commissioner to submit a report \n     to Congress within 180 days after enactment of the Act that \n     describes and assesses the limitations in existing analysis \n     capabilities of laboratories with respect to determining the \n     country of origin of honey and includes any recommendation of \n     the Commissioner for improving such capabilities.\n       Section 608(d) expresses the sense of Congress that the \n     Commissioner of Food and Drugs should promptly establish a \n     honey national identification standard to ensure that honey \n     imports are classified appropriately for duty assessment; and \n     are denied entry to the United States if such imports pose a \n     threat to the health or safety of consumers.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment. The \n     agreement of the conference on establishment of a database \n     pertaining to honey transshipment reflects the\n\n[[Page H9166]]\n\n     unique geographical characteristics of honey, particularly \n     unique regional pollens, that allow CBP to discern the \n     country of origin of honey imported into the United States \n     through currently available, cost-effective scientific \n     methods, and also the importation of honey in sufficient \n     quantity and with historical patterns of duty evasion to \n     justify establishing and maintaining such a database.\n\n\n    SECTION 609. ESTABLISHMENT OF CHIEF INNOVATION AND INTELLECTUAL \n                          PROPERTY NEGOTIATOR\n\n     Present Law\n       Section 141 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171) \n     establishes the structure, functions, powers, and personnel \n     of the Office of the United States Trade Representative \n     (USTR).\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 611(a) amends section 141 of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     (19 U.S.C. 2171) to establish a Chief Innovation and \n     Intellectual Property Negotiator at USTR with the rank of \n     Ambassador, who shall be appointed by the President, by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to conduct trade \n     negotiations and to enforce trade agreements relating to \n     United States intellectual property, and to take appropriate \n     actions to address acts, policies, and practices of foreign \n     governments that have a significant adverse impact on the \n     value of United States innovation.\n       Section 611(b) amends section 5314 of title 5, United \n     States Code, to set the pay for this position at Level III of \n     the Executive Schedule.\n       Section 611(c) requires the USTR to submit an annual report \n     to the Senate Finance and Ways and Means Committees detailing \n     the enforcement actions taken by USTR to ensure the \n     protection of United States innovation and intellectual \n     property interests, and other actions taken to advance United \n     States innovation and intellectual property interests.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n\n\n    SECTION 610. MEASURES RELATING TO COUNTRIES THAT DENY ADEQUATE \n              PROTECTION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n     Present Law\n       Section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242) \n     requires USTR to submit to the Committees a ``Special 301 \n     Report'' identifying countries that deny adequate protection \n     or market access for intellectual property rights.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 612(a) amends section 182(d)(2) of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242(d)(2)) to require USTR to identify \n     foreign countries that deny adequate and effective protection \n     of trade secrets.\n       Section 612(b) amends section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     (19 U.S.C. 2242) to require USTR, within 90 days after \n     submitting the annual National Trade Estimate, to develop an \n     action plan for foreign countries that have spent at least \n     one year on the Priority Watch List of the Special 301 \n     Report. The action plan calls for such countries to meet \n     benchmarks designed to assist them to achieve effective \n     protection of intellectual property rights, and equitable \n     market access for U.S. persons that rely upon intellectual \n     property protections. This section also authorizes the \n     President to take appropriate action with respect to foreign \n     countries that fail to meet action plan benchmarks and \n     requires USTR to transmit to the Committees a report on the \n     action plans and the progress in achieving the action plan \n     benchmarks.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, with \n     the addition of allowing USTR to provide assistance to \n     developing countries pursuant to Section 611.\n\n\n               SECTION 611. TRADE ENFORCEMENT TRUST FUND\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 607 of the Senate amendment establishes a Trade \n     Enforcement Trust Fund (Trust Fund) in the Treasury of the \n     United States. The provision requires the Treasury to \n     transfer $15 million each fiscal year to the Trust Fund of \n     receipts from antidumping and countervailing duties, and the \n     aggregate money held in the Trust Fund may not exceed $30 \n     million at any time. Transfers to the fund are made \n     quarterly. The provision allows the United States Trade \n     Representative to use amounts in the Trust Fund to enforce \n     the provisions of and commitments and obligations under WTO \n     Agreements and free trade agreements to which the United \n     States is a party, monitor the implementation by foreign \n     countries of the provisions and commitments and obligations \n     under free trade agreements, and investigate and respond to \n     petitions under section 302 of the Trade Act of 1974. In \n     addition, identified Federal agencies would also be \n     authorized to also use amounts in the Trust Fund to ensure \n     capacity building efforts undertaken by the United States \n     prioritize the implementation of intellectual property, \n     labor, and environmental commitments, are self-sustaining and \n     promote local ownership, include performance indicators, and \n     monitor and evaluate capacity building efforts.\n       If a Federal agency uses amounts in the Trust Fund in \n     connection with the entry into force of any free trade \n     agreement, that agency must submit a report to Congress on \n     the actions taken by that agency not later than 18 months \n     after the agreement enters into force. It also requires the \n     Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress within one \n     year of enactment that contains (1) a comprehensive analysis \n     of the trade enforcement expenditures of each Federal agency \n     and (2) recommendations on the additional employees and \n     resources that each Federal agency may need to effectively \n     enforce free trade agreements that the United States is a \n     party to.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     a number of changes. The conference agreement establishes the \n     Trust Fund through 2026 and funds are transferred from the \n     general fund. It allows the United States Trade \n     Representative, on the basis of advice from the Trade Policy \n     Committee, to use amounts in the Trust Fund, only as provided \n     in appropriation acts, to enforce obligations under WTO \n     Agreements and free trade agreements to which the United \n     States is a party, monitor the implementation by foreign \n     countries of the provisions and commitments and obligations \n     under free trade agreements, investigate and respond to \n     petitions under section 302 of the Trade Act of 1974, and to \n     support capacity building efforts, including commitments and \n     obligations related to trade in goods, trade in services, \n     trade in agriculture, foreign investment, intellectual \n     property, digital trade in goods and services and cross-\n     border data flows, regulatory practices, state-owned and \n     state-controlled enterprises, localization barriers to trade, \n     labor and the environment, currency, foreign currency \n     manipulation, anticorruption, trade remedy laws, textiles, \n     and commercial partnerships. Additional changes are made with \n     respect to reporting and definitions.\n       The conferees are committed to work diligently and at the \n     earliest opportunity to achieve full appropriation for the \n     fund, including during the annual budget resolution process \n     to assure full appropriations to the fund.\n\n                    Title VII--Currency Manipulation\n\n\n SECTION 701. ENHANCEMENT OF ENGAGEMENT ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE AND \n  ECONOMIC POLICIES WITH CERTAIN MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS OF THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       This section strengthens and complements existing \n     requirements by requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     submit to Congress a report on the macroeconomic and currency \n     exchange rate policies of each country that is a major \n     trading partner of the United States and to take specific \n     steps if it finds that a currency is undervalued. The report \n     is to include: 1) an analysis of various economic indicators \n     for each major trading partner and 2) an enhanced analysis \n     of macroeconomic and exchange rate policies for each major \n     trading partner that satisfies certain economic criteria \n     related to its bilateral trade balance, current account \n     balance, and foreign exchange interventions. The new \n     report thus strengthens existing requirements, established \n     in Section 3005 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness \n     Act of 1988, regarding reporting by the Secretary to \n     Congress of international economic and exchange rate \n     policies. The provisions direct the Secretary to conduct \n     enhanced bilateral engagement with each country for which \n     an enhanced analysis of macroeconomic and currency \n     exchange rate policies is included in the report submitted \n     by the Secretary to Congress. The Secretary may determine \n     not to enhance bilateral engagement with a country if the \n     Secretary determines that commencing enhanced bilateral \n     engagement would have an adverse impact on the U.S. \n     economy greater than the benefits of such engagement or \n     would cause serious harm to the national security of the \n     United States. The provision authorizes the President to \n     take certain remedial actions regarding a country that \n     fails to adopt appropriate policies to correct the \n     identified undervaluation and surpluses, including: 1) \n     restrictions on U.S. government financing; 2) restrictions \n     on U.S. government procurement; 3) additional efforts at \n     the International Monetary Fund; or (4) by taking into \n     account such currency policies before initiating or \n     entering into any bilateral or regional trade agreement \n     negotiations.\n     Senate Amendment\n       The Senate Amendment is similar to the House Amendment but \n     contains certain variations, including variations related to \n     the economic criteria associated with an enhanced analysis of \n     a major trading partner, variations related to the objectives \n     of enhanced bilateral engagement, and variations related to a \n     decision by the Secretary not to enhance bilateral engagement \n     with a country.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment with \n     modified criteria in section 701(a)(2)(B), an additional item \n     in the list of actions in section 701(b)(1) from the Senate \n     amendment, and modified reporting requirements.\n\n[[Page H9167]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n SECTION 702.

Section 802(a) also establishes \n     the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as the \n     head of the component, and the position of Deputy \n     Commissioner to assist the Commissioner in the management of \n     CBP.\n       Additionally, section 802(a) establishes operational \n     offices within CBP. These include: U.S. Border Patrol and its \n     head, the Chief of U.S. Border Patrol; Office of Air and \n     Marine Operations and its head, the Assistant Commissioner \n     for the Office of Air and Marine Operations; the Office of \n     Field Operations and its head, the Assistant Commissioner for \n     the Office of Field Operations; the Office of Intelligence \n     and its head, the Assistant Commissioner for the Office of \n     Intelligence; the Office of International Affairs and its \n     head, the Assistant Commissioner for the Office of \n     International Affairs; and the Office of Internal Affairs and \n     its head, the Assistant Commissioner for the Office of \n     Internal Affairs.\n       Finally, section 802(a) establishes certain Standard \n     Operating Procedures, audits, and reports to be carried out \n     and completed, mandates training for CBP officers and agents, \n     establishes short term detention standards, and grants the \n     Secretary additional authorities to establish additional \n     offices and Assistant Commissioners to carry out the \n     functions of CBP.\n       Section 802(b) affirms that CBP shall continue to carry out \n     the functions, missions, duties, and authorities that were \n     vested in them prior to the passage of this act. Further, \n     this subsection makes clear that rules, regulations, and \n     policies issued by CBP pursuant to section 411 of the \n     Homeland Security Act prior to the passage of this act shall \n     remain in place.\n       Section 802(c) clarifies that the Commissioner of CBP, as \n     well as Assistant Commissioners and other CBP officials, may \n     continue to serve in their roles after passage of this act.\n       Section 802(d) amends 5 U.S.C. 5314 to include the \n     Commissioner of CBP in place of the outdated ``Commissioner \n     of Customs''' position in the Level III Executive Pay \n     Schedule.\n       Section 802(e) amends the table of contents in the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 to reflect the changes made by this act.\n       Section 802(f) repeals provisions in the HSA that are no \n     longer necessary or have already been fulfilled. These \n     include: Sec. 416, which mandated a Government Accountability \n     Office report that was completed in 2003; and section 418, \n     which required a report from the Secretary of the Treasury \n     that was completed in 2003.\n       Section 802(g) amends sections of the HSA to accurately \n     reflect current titles and functions. In addition, 802(g) \n     amends the HSA to maintain the Transportation Security \n     Administration as a distinct entity within the Department of \n     Homeland Security and grants the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security the authority to discipline any employee of CBP or \n     ICE who willfully deceives Congress or DHS leadership.\n       Section 802(h) amends the Act of March 3, 1927, at 19 \n     U.S.C. 2071, et seq., to establish the Office of Trade within \n     CBP, and its head, the Assistant Commissioner for the Office \n     of Trade.

This subsection further \n     establishes that the amount of drawback claimed must be \n     calculated pursuant to section 313(l) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930, as amended by this amendment, and allows records kept \n     in the normal course of business to be used to demonstrate \n     the transfer of merchandise.\n       Section 906(d) amends section 313(i) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 by striking the current text and replacing it with a new \n     provision requiring that a person claiming drawback based on \n     exportation shall provide proof of the exportation of the \n     article, that such proof shall fully establish the date and \n     fact of exportation and identity of the exporter, and may be \n     established either by records kept in the normal course of \n     business or through an electronic export system of the United \n     States Government.\n       Section 906(e) amends section 313(j) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 by allowing unused drawback claims for merchandise \n     classifiable under the same 8-digit HTS subheading number as \n     such imported merchandise. Merchandise may not be substituted \n     for imported merchandise for drawback purposes based on the \n     8-digit HTS if the article description for the 8-digit HTS \n     begins with the term ``other.'' In these instances, \n     merchandise may be substituted for imported merchandise if \n     such imported merchandise is classifiable under the same 10-\n     digit HTS. If the 10-digit HTS begins with the term \n     ``other,'' then substitution drawback is not permissible and \n     the drawback claimant must use direct identification under \n     section 313(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by this \n     Act. For unused merchandise that is either exported or \n     destroyed, the Department of Commerce Schedule B number may \n     be used to demonstrate that an article and merchandise are \n     classifiable under the same 8-digit HTS without regard to \n     whether or not the Schedule B number corresponds to more than \n     one 8-digit HTS number. Furthermore, this subsection amends \n     the filing deadline for drawback claims to be 5 years from \n     the date of importation and establishes that the amount of \n     drawback claimed must be calculated pursuant to section \n     313(l) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by this \n     amendment.\n       Section 906(f) amends section 313(k) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 by providing that any person making a drawback claim is \n     liable for the full amount of the drawback claimed. Any \n     person claiming drawback shall be jointly and severally \n     liable with the importer for the lesser of the amount of \n     drawback claimed or the amount the importer authorized the \n     other person to claim.\n       Section 906(g) amends section 313(l) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe \n     regulations for claims with respect to unused merchandise \n     drawback to establish that the calculation of drawback that \n     cannot exceed 99 percent of the lesser of the amount of \n     duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported \n     merchandise or the amount of duties, taxes, and fees that \n     would apply to the exported article if the exported article \n     were imported. Section 906(g) also requires the Secretary of \n     Treasury to prescribe regulations for claims with respect to \n     manufactured articles into which substitute merchandise is \n     incorporated to establish that the calculation of drawback \n     cannot exceed 99 percent of the lesser of the amount of \n     duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported \n     merchandise or the amount of duties, taxes, and fees that \n     would apply to the substituted merchandise if the substituted \n     merchandise were imported. This section requires the \n     promulgation of the necessary regulations within 2 years. \n     Additionally, one year after the enactment of this Act, and \n     annually thereafter until the regulations required under this \n     subsection are promulgated, the Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the status of the regulations.\n       Section 906(h) amends section 313(p) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 to require evidence of transfer to be demonstrated with \n     records kept in the normal course of business.\n       Section 906(i) amends section 313(q) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 to require the amount of drawback shall be calculated \n     pursuant to section 313(l) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as \n     amended by this amendment.\n       Section 906(j) amends section 313(r) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 to establish that a drawback entry shall be filed or \n     applied for, as applicable, no later than 5 years after the \n     date on which merchandise on which drawback is claimed was \n     imported. This section also requires that all drawback claims \n     be filed electronically no later than 2 years after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       Section 906(k) amends section 313(s) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 by allowing a drawback successor to designate unused \n     imported merchandise, other merchandise classifiable under \n     the same 8-digit HTS subheading number as such imported \n     merchandise, or any combination of such imported merchandise \n     and such other merchandise, that the predecessor received, \n     before the date of succession, from the person who imported \n     and paid any duties, taxes, and fees due on the imported \n     merchandise as the basis for drawback on merchandise \n     possessed by the drawback successor after the date of \n     succession.\n       Section 906(l) strikes section 313(t) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930.\n       Section 906(m) amends section 313(x) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 by requiring the amount of drawback claimed pursuant to \n     section 313(l) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by this \n     amendment, to be reduced by the value of any materials \n     reclaimed during the destruction of unused merchandise.\n       Section 906(n) defines key terms.\n       Section 906(o) amends section 508(c)(3) of the Tariff Act \n     of 1930 by requiring records for drawback claims to be \n     maintained for 5 years after the date of liquidation.\n       Section 906(p) requires the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) to provide the Senate Committee on Finance and \n     the House Committee on Ways and Means with a report that \n     shall include: 1) an assessment of the modernization of \n     drawback and refunds; 2) a description of drawback claims \n     that were permissible before the enactment of the bill that \n     are not permissible after, and an identification of \n     industries most affected; and 3) a description of drawback \n     claims that were not permissible before the enactment of this \n     bill that are after, and an identification of industries most \n     affected.\n       Section 906(q) provides that the amendments made by this \n     section shall take effect upon enactment of this bill and \n     apply to drawback claims filed on or after the date that is 2 \n     years after such enactment. This section also requires the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report to Congress, no \n     later than two years after enactment of this bill, on the \n     date on which the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) will \n     be ready to process claims and the date on which the \n     Automated Export System (AES) will be ready to accept proof \n     of exportation. Lastly, this section provides for a one-year \n     transition for filing drawback claims under section 313 as \n     amended by this section, or under section 313 in effect \n     before the enactment of this bill.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 906 of the Senate amendment is the same as section \n     906 of the House amendment with exception the following: (1) \n     the Senate amendment permits the substitution of a \n     manufactured article that is exported or destroyed with an \n     article that is classifiable under the same 8-digit HTS \n     subheading; (2) the House amendment requires CBP to \n     promulgate separate regulations for calculating drawback for \n     unused merchandise and drawback for articles into which \n     substitute merchandise is incorporated; and (3) the Senate \n     amendment permits a delay in the effective date of this \n     section if the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) is not \n     ready to process drawback claims within two years after the \n     enactment of this Act.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment with \n     technical revisions. The Conferees agree that section 906(g) \n     grants CBP the authority, in prescribing regulations for \n     determining the calculation of amounts refunded as drawback, \n     to permit the drawback claim to be based upon the average per \n     unit duties, taxes, and fees as reported on the summary line \n     item. This authority is granted to CBP solely to allow for \n     the simplification of drawback claims. It is not granted to \n     allow claimants to manipulate claims in order to maximize \n     refunds to the detriment of the revenue of the United States. \n     The Conferees grant this authority with the expectation that \n     CBP and the Department of the Treasury will study the \n     potential impact of such line item averaging in drafting \n     regulations and will forego such averaging if it is \n     determined that line item averaging will result in a \n     significant loss to the revenue of the United States.\n       The Conferees further clarify that the existing treatment \n     of wine under section 313(j)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930 is \n     preserved, and that the amendments to the statute do not \n     change this treatment. Such preservation, however, does not \n     preclude the filing of drawback claims for wine under the new \n     substitution drawback procedures, subject to the restrictions \n     in such procedures, such as the amount of drawback that may \n     be refunded when such procedures are used.\n       With respect to claims for unused merchandise under section \n     906(g) (adding section 313(l)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of \n     1930), the Conferees intend that if the exported article was \n     not imported, CBP will determine the amount of duties, taxes, \n     and fees applicable to the exported article by applying the \n     rate of duties, taxes, and fees applicable to the imported \n     merchandise by substituting the value of the imported \n     merchandise for the\n\n[[Page H9171]]\n\n     value of the exported article. For claims with respect to \n     manufactured articles into which imported or substitute \n     merchandise is incorporated under section 906(g) (adding \n     section 313(l)(2)(C) of the Tariff Act of 1930), the \n     Conferees intend that if the manufactured exported article \n     contains substitute merchandise that was not imported, CBP \n     will determine the amount of duties, taxes, and fees \n     applicable to the imported merchandise by substituting the \n     value of the imported merchandise for the value of the \n     substitute merchandise incorporated into the exported \n     article. The goal of the rules established in section 906(g) \n     (adding sections 313(l)(2)(B) and 313(l)(2)(C) of the Tariff \n     Act of 1930) is to prevent the refund of full duties, taxes, \n     and fees on the importation of higher value goods upon the \n     exportation of lower value goods. The Conferees do not intend \n     a scenario in which the drawback claimant would not receive a \n     refund upon the application of either rule, but rather intend \n     to limit the refund to the lesser of the import and the \n     export.\n       Lastly, the Conferees agree that section 906(o), amending \n     section 508(c)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, shall require \n     records for drawback claims to be maintained for three years \n     after the date of liquidation.\n\n\n   SECTION 907. REPORT ON CERTAIN U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION \n                               AGREEMENTS\n\n     Present Law\n       Section 560 of the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act of 2013 authorizes CBP to enter into \n     certain reimbursable fee agreements for the provision of CBP \n     services.\n       Section 559 of the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act of 2014 establishes a pilot program \n     authorizing CBP to enter into partnerships with private \n     sector and government entities at ports of entry.\n     House Amendment\n       Section 911 requires the Commissioner to submit to Congress \n     a detailed annual report on each reimbursable agreement and \n     public-private partnership agreement into which CBP enters. \n     Each report must include: 1) a description of the development \n     of the program; 2) a description of the type of entity with \n     which CBP entered into the agreement and the amount that \n     entity reimbursed CBP under the agreement; 3) an \n     identification of the type of port of entry to which the \n     agreement relates and an assessment of how the agreement \n     provides economic benefits at the port of entry; 4) a \n     description of the services provided by CBP under the \n     agreement during the year preceding the submission of the \n     report; 5) the amount of fees collected under the agreement \n     during that year; 6) a detailed accounting of how the fees \n     collected under the agreement have been spent during that \n     year; 7) a summary of any complaints or criticism received by \n     CBP during that year regarding the agreement; 8) an \n     assessment of the compliance with the terms of the agreement \n     of the entity that entered into an agreement with CBP; 9) \n     recommendations with respect to how activities conducted \n     pursuant to the agreement could function more effectively or \n     better produce economic benefits; and 10) a summary of the \n     benefits to and challenges faced by CBP and the entity that \n     entered into an agreement with CBP.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 909 of the Senate amendment is the same as section \n     911 of the House amendment except with respect to the \n     recipients of the report required in this section.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment and \n     House amendment with modifications. For agreements with an \n     airport operator, the Conferees agree to require CBP to \n     include in the annual report a detailed account of revenues \n     collected by CBP to cover its operating costs at that airport \n     from fees collected under the agreement and fees collected \n     from other sources, including fees paid by passengers and \n     aircraft operators. Further, subsection (a) is modified to \n     require CBP to identify the authority under which a program \n     operates and to require the reporting of the total operating \n     expenses of a program, and subsection (b) is modified to \n     cover the program under which CBP collects a fee for the use \n     of customs services at designated facilities under 19 U.S.C. \n     58b. The conference agreement also incorporates reporting \n     related to the preclearance program established by subtitle B \n     of title VIII.\n\n\n                      SECTION 908. CHARTER FLIGHTS\n\n     Present Law\n       Section 13031(e)(1) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(e)(1)) requires CBP \n     to provide customs services to passengers upon arrival in the \n     United States in connection with scheduled airline flights.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       Section 910 of the Senate amendment amends current law to \n     permit CBP employees to provide customs services for \n     passengers and baggage on charter flights that arrive at U.S. \n     ports of entry after normal operating hours, if the air \n     carrier specifically requests the services at least four \n     hours before the flight arrives and pays any overtime fees.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n\n\n   SECTION 909. UNITED STATES-ISRAEL TRADE AND COMMERCIAL ENHANCEMENT\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       This section sets out U.S. policy identifying the \n     importance of the bilateral U.S.-Israel trade relationship \n     and establishes principal trade negotiating objectives, \n     statements of policy, findings, and other provisions related \n     to trade and commercial activities affecting the United \n     States and Israel. This section: 1) states that among the \n     U.S. principal trade negotiating objectives for proposed \n     trade agreements with foreign countries is the discouragement \n     of politically motivated actions to boycott, divest from, or \n     sanction Israel (i.e., BDS actions); 2) sets forth various \n     statements of policy regarding trade with and commercial \n     activities affecting Israel, including Congress's opposition \n     to politically motivated BDS actions against Israel; 3) \n     presents various positive findings regarding the trade and \n     commercial relationship between the United States and Israel; \n     4) requires the President to report annually to Congress on \n     politically motivated BDS actions against Israel; and 5) \n     requires that no U.S. court recognize or enforce any judgment \n     by a foreign court against a U.S. person doing business in \n     Israel, or any territory controlled by Israel, if the U.S. \n     court determines that the foreign judgment is based, in whole \n     or in part, on a determination by a foreign court that the \n     U.S. person's mere conduct of business operations therein or \n     with Israeli entities constitutes a violation of law.\n     Senate Amendment\n       The Senate amendment contains the statements of policy \n     contained in the House amendment.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment with \n     the exception of section 908(b)(8) of the House amendment \n     regarding certain activities by U.S. states, which is \n     excluded from the conference agreement.\n\n\nSECTION 910.

Subsection (a) \n     ensures that trade agreements do not require changes to U.S. \n     immigration law or obligate the United States to grant access \n     or expand access to visas issued under 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15). \n     Subsection (b) ensures that trade agreements do not establish \n     obligations for the United States regarding greenhouse gas \n     emissions measures. Subsection (c) adds a negotiating \n     objective related to fisheries. Subsection (d) allows the \n     Chair and Ranking Member of the House and Senate Advisory \n     Groups to each send up to three personnel to serve as \n     delegates to negotiating rounds. Subsection (e) perfects the \n     negotiating objective on human trafficking to require \n     countries to take concrete steps to address trafficking. \n     Subsection (f) makes technical amendments.

This objective is not \n     intended to prevent trade agreements from including generally \n     applicable or horizontal commitments, such as those regarding \n     transparency or nondiscrimination, that may also apply to \n     such requirements, nor to prevent trade agreements from \n     including obligations consistent with other negotiating \n     objectives addressed in the Bipartisan Trade Priorities and \n     Accountability Act of 2015, including those relating to the \n     environment, the reduction of tariffs on environmental goods, \n     or fisheries as provided in this Conference Report. Were an \n     agreement to include a provision establishing obligations \n     regarding U.S. greenhouse gas emissions measures as specified \n     in the Conference Report, a bill approving the agreement \n     should be disqualified from eligibility for trade authorities \n     procedures and should be considered under regular order, just \n     like an agreement that fails to make progress in achieving \n     the negotiating objectives set forth in section 102 of the \n     Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability \n     Act of 2015.\n       With regard to Section 914(d), the Conference additionally \n     clarifies that Members of Congress and personnel designated \n     by the Chair and Ranking Member of the House and Senate \n     Advisory Groups shall be delegates and official advisors to \n     any trade agreement negotiating round.\n       With regard to section 914(e), this provision follows the \n     House Amendment with additional changes to incorporate the \n     sense of Congress that the integrity of the annual \n     trafficking in persons report and report process should be \n     respected and should not be affected by unrelated \n     considerations, to require that the President provide \n     supporting documentation with any letter submitted pursuant \n     to the exception, and to require the President to submit a \n     detailed description of the credible evidence supporting a \n     change in designation from tier 3 to tier 2 watch list.\n\n\n                section 915. trade preferences for nepal\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement creates a additional trade \n     preferences for Nepal. The program requires Nepal to satisfy \n     the eligibility criteria of the Africa Growth and Opportunity \n     Act to be eligible for duty-free treatment of certain \n     articles imported from Nepal. The provision is in response to \n     the recent natural disaster in Nepal.\n\n\nsection 916. agreement by asia-pacific economic cooperation members to \n          reduce rates of duty on certain environmental goods\n\n     Present Law\n       No provision.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       Section 916 amends section 107 of the Trade Priorities and \n     Accountability Act of 2015 to allow the President to use \n     section 103(a) authorities to implement an agreement by \n     members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum \n     to reduce any rate of duty on certain environmental goods \n     included in annex C of the APEC Leaders Declaration issued on \n     September 9, 2012, notwithstanding the notification \n     requirement in section 103(a)(2).

This voluntary system requires that \n     taxpayers comply with deadlines and adhere to the filing \n     requirements. While taxpayers may obtain extensions of time \n     in which to file their returns, the Federal tax system \n     consists of specific due dates of returns. In order to foster \n     compliance in meeting these deadlines, Congress has enacted a \n     penalty for the failure to timely file tax returns.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ See United States v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 245 (1985).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A taxpayer who fails to file a tax return on or before its \n     due date is subject to a penalty equal to 5 percent of the \n     net amount of tax due for each month that the return is not \n     filed, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net amount.\\2\\ If \n     the failure to file a return is fraudulent, the taxpayer is \n     subject to a penalty equal to 15 percent of the net amount of \n     tax due for each month the return is not filed, up to a \n     maximum of 75 percent of the net amount.\\3\\ The net amount of \n     tax due is the amount of tax required to be shown on the \n     return reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is \n     paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax \n     and by the amount of any credits against tax which may be \n     claimed on the return.\\4\\ The penalty will not apply if it is \n     shown that the failure to file was due to reasonable cause \n     and not willful neglect.\\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Sec. 6651(a)(1).\n     \\3\\ Sec. 6651(f).\n     \\4\\ Sec. 6651(b)(1).\n     \\5\\ Sec. 6651(a)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       If a return is filed more than 60 days after its due date, \n     and unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable \n     cause, the failure to file penalty may not be less than the \n     lesser of $135 (indexed annually for inflation) or 100 \n     percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on the \n     return. If a penalty for failure to file and a penalty for \n     failure to pay tax shown on a return both apply for the same \n     month, the amount of the penalty for failure to file for such \n     month is reduced by the amount of the penalty for failure to \n     pay tax shown on a return.\\6\\ If a return is filed more than \n     60 days after its due date, the penalty for failure to pay \n     tax shown on a return may not reduce the penalty for failure \n     to file below the lesser of $135 or 100 percent of the amount \n     required to be shown on the return.\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ Sec. 6651(c)(1).\n     \\7\\ Ibid.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The failure to file penalty applies to all returns required \n     to be filed under subchapter A of Chapter 61 (relating to \n     income tax returns of an individual, fiduciary of an estate \n     or trust, or corporation; self-employment tax returns, and \n     estate and gift tax returns), subchapter A of chapter 51 \n     (relating to distilled spirits, wines, and beer), subchapter \n     A of chapter 52 (relating to tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, and \n     cigarette papers and tubes), and subchapter A of chapter 53 \n     (relating to machine guns and certain other firearms).\\8\\ The \n     failure to file penalty does not apply to any failure to pay \n     estimated tax required to be paid by sections 6654 or \n     6655.\\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\8\\ Sec. 6651(a)(1).\n     \\9\\ Sec. 6651(e).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     House Amendment\n       Under the provision, if a return is filed more than 60 days \n     after its due date, then the failure to file penalty may not \n     be less than the lesser of $205 or 100 percent of the amount \n     required to be shown as tax on the return.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to returns required \n     to be filed in calendar years after 2015.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment \n     provision.\n\n\n   section 922. permanent moratorium on internet access taxes and on \n        multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce\n\n     Present Law\n       The temporary moratorium on states and localities taxing \n     Internet access or placing multiple and discriminatory taxes \n     on Internet commerce expires on December 11, 2015.\n     House Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Senate Amendment\n       No provision.\n     Conference Agreement\n       Section 922 makes permanent an existing moratorium on \n     states and localities taxing Internet access or placing \n     multiple and discriminatory taxes on Internet commerce. The \n     existing temporary ban was first put in place in 1998. Since \n     then, Congress has extended it multiple times with enormous \n     bipartisan support. Section 922 converts the moratorium into \n     a permanent ban--on which consumers, innovators and investors \n     can permanently rely--by simply striking the 2015 end date. \n     The original moratorium included a grandfather clause to give \n     States that were then taxing Internet access some time to \n     transition to other sources of revenue. All but six of the \n     originally grandfathered states have discontinued taxing \n     Internet access. Section 922 gives those states additional \n     time by delaying the phase-out of the grandfathers until June \n     30, 2020 which is the end of the fiscal year for states and \n     the start of a new billing cycle for Internet access \n     providers.\n\n                             MINORITY VIEWS\n\n       During the Senate's consideration of legislation earlier \n     this year, Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, \n     Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD), \n     members of the Finance Committee, expressed their support for \n     the establishment of a process whereby Congress would \n     consider the merits of an extension of certain apparel Tariff \n     Preference Levels (TPLs). It is the view of Senator Wyden \n     that these programs can offer benefits to U.S. consumers, \n     workers, and exporters, and Congress should further consider \n     the merits of an extension of the Nicaragua, Bahrain, and \n     Morocco TPLs.\n     Kevin Brady,\n     David Reichert,\n     Pat Tiberi,\n                                Managers on the Part of the House.\n\n     Orrin Hatch,\n     John Cornyn,\n     John Thune,\n     Johnny Isakson,\n     Ron Wyden,\n     Debbie Stabenow,\n     Managers on the Part of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9173-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9173-H9186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RED RIVER PRIVATE PROPERTY PROTECTION ACT\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  General debate shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided and controlled \nby the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural \nResources.\n  The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, this is an extremely important bill \nto the people who live in this particular area of Texas and Oklahoma.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcClintock), the subcommittee chair who heard this bill.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, every now and then, we have a chance to \nstop an injustice and restore the fundamental purpose of our government \nto secure the inalienable rights of the people. In this instance, the \nFederal Government has become destructive of this end. It is attempting \nto seize thousands of acres of private land lawfully owned by American \ncitizens along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River between Texas and \nOklahoma. Mr. Thornberry's bill would stop this injustice, reassert the \nrule of law, and restore the unclouded title of these lands to their \nrightful owners.\n  In 1923, the U.S. Supreme Court established the rules for determining \nthe boundary between Texas and Oklahoma that established the property \nrights over this land. For nearly a century, the Federal Government \nrecognized and respected the property lines established by this ruling. \nProperty owners purchased and sold this land and, in some cases, passed \nit down from generation to generation. These property owners, in good \nfaith, dutifully paid\n\n[[Page H9174]]\n\ntaxes on their lands year after year, invested in these lands, \nmaintained them, cultivated them, and improved them.\n  Out of the blue, the Bureau of Land Management has now announced that \nit is arbitrarily changing the boundaries established by the Supreme \nCourt and is seizing this land for itself.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  This outrageous claim clouds the property rights along this vast \nterritory. It is based on the flimsiest of pretexts, a limited survey \nover a fraction of this land that ignored the 1923 Supreme Court decree \nthat originally established these boundary lines. In other words, it is \na guess based upon a fraud.\n  The Red River Private Property Protection Act rights this obvious \nwrong. It requires the Federal Government, in conjunction with the \naffected State and tribal governments, to make clear the true ownership \nof this property.\n  It tells the BLM to back off, and authorizes a collaborative survey \nto be conducted by the affected State and tribal governments, according \nto the rule of law established by the Supreme Court. And if this new \nsurvey determines any errors in the old, it provides that the \nlandowners who have poured their blood, toil, tears, and sweat into \nthis land can repurchase it for a $1.25 per acre, the price set by the \nColor of Title Act to resolve disputes of this nature.\n  Without this act, title to the farms and homes will be clouded for \ndecades while this matter drags on through the courts.\n  Meanwhile, the BLM's assertion that it has regulatory jurisdiction \nwould have devastating impacts on local landowners and businesses and \nmake it much more difficult to encourage economic development in the \nregion.\n  We should also beware of an amendment sought by several neighboring \ntribal governments that attempts to seize this property for themselves. \nDespite the fact that this bill is to be amended to reaffirm all tribal \ntreaties to assure that the tribes are an integral part of the new \nsurvey process, and are guaranteed the right of first refusal over any \nlands they currently occupy, they are seeking to replace the injustice \nperpetrated by the BLM with an injustice of their own.\n  Whether private property is seized by the Federal Government or by a \ntribal government makes no difference to the innocent victims whose \nland is being stolen, and it is an equal affront to the just principles \nof property rights that this bill seeks to restore.\n  Tribal governments whose own sovereignty and property rights are \noften threatened by this Federal Government ought to be particularly \nsensitive when that same government threatens the rights of others.\n  Government exists to protect our natural rights, including our \nproperty rights. This bill realigns our government with its stated \npurpose.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2130, the Red River Private Property Protection Act, sponsored \nby Representative Thornberry of Texas, aims to resolve a series of \nproperty disputes along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River, which \nforms a portion of the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma.\n  While this legislation may seem like an issue with only local or \nregional interests, it speaks to broader policy issues on our Nation's \npublic lands, lands which belong to all Americans.\n  I am sympathetic to the concerns of Mr. Thornberry and his \nconstituents. Landowners in the area, some of whom have lived there for \ngenerations, deserve clarification on the amount of land owned by the \nFederal Government and the location of the boundary between Texas and \nOklahoma.\n  However, as written, I am concerned that this legislation undermines \nthe authority of the Federal Government, and potentially jeopardizes \nlongstanding mineral revenue distribution agreements with the State of \nOklahoma and certain Native American tribes.\n  Federal interest in land along the Red River goes back to the \nLouisiana Purchase. More than 200 years later, after several treaties \nand compacts, there is still confusion about the amount of land owned \nby the Federal Government and the location of the boundary between \nTexas and Oklahoma.\n  The majority rightly cites a 1926 Supreme Court case that established \nthe gradient boundary method as the means of determining the boundary \nbetween the two States, Texas and Oklahoma.\n  Under this decision, which has been adhered to for nearly a century, \nthe boundary of Oklahoma extends to the center of the river, and the \nTexas boundary extends to the ordinary high water mark on the south \nbank. All the land in between was retained in Federal ownership.\n  The Supreme Court ruling established the boundary between the States, \nbut it did not change the ownership status of any land, and the Federal \nGovernment has had a continual interest in land along the Red River.\n  To complicate matters even further, the area has a long history of \noil and gas development and includes several tribal interests.\n  The Bureau of Land Management, the Federal Government's ``Surveyor of \nRecord,'' is in the process of updating its management plan for the \narea, which includes surveying all of the land in question, in order to \ndetermine the extent of the remaining Federal interest and clarify \nownership claims.\n  There are many overlapping claims, missing and unreliable records, \nand even competing claims from both Texas and Oklahoma over the same \npieces of property, so the BLM is poring through county GIS data to \nsort out who owns what and where.\n  This survey is not a land grab by the Federal Government. It is a \nlong, but necessary, process that BLM must work through to validate \nownership claims.\n  In fact, BLM wants to limit Federal interest in the region. But it \nhas to be allowed to survey the area first.\n  There are an estimated 30,000 acres of Federal land in the affected \narea, 23,000 of which are potentially overlaid by private deeds. \nWithout the survey, the agency will have no legal way to give a clear \ntitle to land claimed by a private interest or determine what Federal \nland is suitable for sale.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 2130 halts the survey process, nullifies all \nprevious BLM surveys, and transfers survey authority to the Texas \nGeneral Land Office. The bill also requires the Secretary of the \nInterior to forfeit any right, title, and interest to land in the \naffected area.\n  Taking away BLM's survey authority and putting the Texas General Land \nOffice in control of the survey would effectively make a large portion \nof the estimated Federal landholdings disappear. The result is unfair \nto American taxpayers, who deserve fair compensation for their assets.\n  H.R. 2130 could also jeopardize a longstanding agreement between the \nFederal Government and the Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche tribes. These \ntribes receive 62.5 percent of any royalty generated for oil and gas \ndevelopment along this section of the Red River. If part of this land \nno longer belongs to the Federal Government, this important source of \nrevenue relied on by the tribes could also vanish.\n  Yesterday, the Natural Resources Committee received a letter from the \nKiowa-Comanche Intertribal Land Use Committee that outlined serious \nconcerns with the bill, as introduced. We were unable to hear about \nthese concerns until now, because we have not had a hearing on this \nbill in this Congress.\n  Representative Cole has offered an amendment to address the concerns \nof these tribes. His amendment will ensure that the mineral and surface \ninterests held by tribes are not diminished by this bill. The Cole \namendment makes significant improvements to the bill, and I am glad the \nRules Committee made it in order.\n  Adoption of the Cole amendment, however, does not address all of our \nconcerns or remove our fundamental opposition to the bill.\n  I want to reiterate, we would all like to see the property dispute \nresolved in a way that benefits all parties and provides much-needed \nclarification for local landowners and tribes. However, instead of \nceding Federal authority to a State, Congress should allow BLM to \ncomplete its work.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 2130.\n  Before I reserve my time, I want to note that, as we approach the end \nof the year, there are critical issues that\n\n[[Page H9175]]\n\nwe have yet to address. Funding the Federal Government, extending tax \nbreaks and, yes, addressing the scourge of gun violence in this country \nare just a few that deserve our urgent attention, instead of debating \nthis bill, which the President will likely veto.\n  For example, Representative King's bill, H.R. 1076, the Denying \nFirearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act is a bipartisan and \ncommonsense bill that would make our communities safer.\n\n  Since 2004, for 11 years now, more than 2,000 FBI-identified \nsuspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United \nStates. This is an alarming figure.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of Republican Congressman Peter King's \nbill, which would prevent people who are linked to terrorist activities \nfrom buying a gun, a commonsense bill that has support from both \nRepublicans and Democrats, and would protect our communities.\n  It is pretty simple. If the Federal Government doesn't allow you to \nboard an airplane, it shouldn't allow you to buy a gun.\n  I have joined my colleagues in filing a discharge petition to force a \nvote on this bill after House Republicans have repeatedly voted to \nprevent the House from even debating Congressman King's bill.\n  We should be doing everything we can to keep deadly weapons out of \nthe hands of suspected terrorists. It is just common sense to allow a \nvote on this.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to allow on vote on this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  For people whose homes and lives are being threatened by inaction or \nan improper action of the Federal Government, that is a critical issue \nto them. This bill is significantly important to people who are being \nharmed by the Federal Government.\n  So this is what happened: In 2009, the Bureau of Land Management, \nthey did a survey on 6,000 acres, out of a potential of about 90,000 \nacre piece of property. They used poor surveying methods, methods that \nwere outlawed by the Supreme Court back in the 1920s because of the \ninaccuracy of the method they used.\n  Four years later, this Bureau then decided, based on the inaccurate \nsurveying done in an improper way, that they would lay claim to 90,000 \nacres. They later reduced that number somewhat, even though people \nlived on the land they were claiming. Their homes were there. Their \nfuture was there. They had a valid title to that land. They had been \npaying taxes on that land for years.\n  Nonetheless, the government decided it was theirs. The government had \nno use for this land. They had no plan. They had no need for it. All it \nwas was about control.\n  Even the BLM workers who were on the field that understood, they \ndidn't want this. It was made up here in the higher levels of people \nwho want to control. And even though they own a third of the land mass \nof the United States, that simply was not enough. They wanted to go \nafter the homes of these people as well.\n  If people were in the way of that control, they didn't care. If \nproperty rights were in the way of that control, they didn't care.\n  We have seen this issue played over and over on this floor recently. \nWe had a bill the other day in the State of Virginia, where 1 acre, 1 \nacre of a park that was not being used was needed for a daycare center, \nand the Park Service was opposed to it because it took their control \naway from that 1 acre of land. Fortunately, we passed that bill on a \nvoice vote.\n  There is a school, a middle school in Reno, Nevada, that was stopped \nby the BLM because it was going to be put on land that was 12 miles \naway from a potential sage grouse lek. That was stopped.\n  There is a lake in Louisiana where the exact same thing is happening \non 200 acres around that particular lake, a bad survey in which the \nFederal Government says, oh, give us time to fix this problem.\n  The bottom line is, we are seeing, time after time after time, in \nwhich actions by the Federal Government, specifically, the Department \nof the Interior, are actually hurting people, and that is wrong. We \nmust stop that.\n  We are here in the people's House. It is incumbent upon us, if an \nagency of government, an administration, or a bureaucracy does \nsomething to harm people, it is our responsibility to change that, to \nchallenge it, and to set it right.\n  If the bureaucracy decides to become heartless thugs and tries to \ntake away property rights, tries to take away homes, then we, the \nRepresentatives of the people, need to have this time to stand up there \nand say, no, it is wrong; we need to do it the right way.\n  That is exactly what the bill before us does. It says: Stop this \ninaccuracy. Stop this offense. Stop hurting people. Redo the survey, \nbut redo it in a proper way, and put in a source of process where those \nwho have actual rights on this land can go about and get their rights.\n  If that undermines the Federal Government, which has had 6 years to \nredo the survey, and do it the right way, then it is incumbent upon us. \nIf they have done something wrong, we need to fix it.\n  This bill in no way, shape, or form has any negative impact on \nanybody's mineral rights. Whether it is the government, tribes, or \nindividuals, it does not harm them.\n  But it is our job to make sure we do something. We, in this body, set \nthe standards and the boundaries of what government should do, not a \nfaceless bureaucracy. And when that faceless bureaucracy, after a great \ndeal of time, fails to do their job, that is when we, as a body, need \nto stand up and set things right to protect the people whom we \nrepresent.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am appalled that Republicans are continuing to ignore \nthe calls that Mr. Thompson has led to bring up my good friend from New \nYork, Republican Peter King's bipartisan bill to keep guns out of the \nhands of terrorists.\n  It is remarkable enough that individuals on the terrorist watch list \nare able to freely purchase weapons in this country, weapons that could \nthen be turned against innocent Americans.\n  In fact, the GAO report showed that over the last 10 years, 90 \npercent of the people on the terrorist watch list who wanted to buy a \nweapon passed a background check. That is simply outrageous.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  But it is extraordinary that, knowing of this truly absurd policy, \nRepublicans refuse to bring Mr. King of New York's aptly named Denying \nFirearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, protecting our Nation from its enemies motivates my \nwork here in Congress, as it should motivate all of us. That Members on \nthe other side of the aisle are in such thrall to gun advocates that \nthey would place their political aspirations above our national \nsecurity shocks the conscience. This cannot be.\n  Mr. Chairman, I hope you will see Mr. King's worthy bill on the floor \nwithout delay\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the sponsor of this bill. He is someone \nwho has been working for at least 6 long years to try to make sure that \nthe Federal Government stops its harming of individuals in taking away \ntheir property and their homes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to express my \nappreciation to Chairman Bishop not only for bringing this bill to the \nfloor, but for taking the time to understand the issues, how they came \nto be, and cutting to the heart of the matter. I thought he did an \noutstanding job of explaining the challenges that my constituents face. \nAlso, Subcommittee Chairman McClintock has done an excellent job of \ntalking about this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is absolutely true. This specific legislation \napplies only to the 116-mile stretch of the Red River\n\n[[Page H9176]]\n\nthat is at issue here; but one point I completely agree with the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts on is that the consequences of this \nextend far beyond those 116 miles, because if the Federal Government \ncan come in and, through a regulatory process, say this land that you \nmay have a deed to, that you may have paid taxes on for generations, \nthat you may think you own, is not yours but is really ours, then that \nthreatens private property rights throughout the country.\n  I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that that is the reason the American \nFarm Bureau, the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, the Texas Farm Bureau, the \nNational Cattlemen's Association, and the Public Lands Council all \nsupport this legislation, because private property rights are very \nimportant to be protected wherever they may be threatened.\n  Now, the bottom line, as Chairman Bishop just mentioned, is that the \nBLM conducted some surveys several years ago, spot surveys, and they \nrefuse to follow the mandates of the Supreme Court in its 1926 \ndecision. The rest of the story is, BLM has indicated they will never \nsurvey the whole 116 miles. So, as the gentlewoman from Massachusetts \npoints out, well, there is confusion, and this, that, and the other. \nThe only way to straighten it out is to conduct a survey of the whole \narea and do it under the mandate, the way the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States said it should be done. BLM has said they are not going \nto do that. The only way to get that done is to support this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the gentlewoman from Massachusetts \naccurately described how there got to be this narrow strip of Federal \nland from the middle of the river to the south bank. Some people don't \nunderstand that. The gentlewoman described it exactly right. But that \nhas been the problem for the BLM. They don't know how to manage a \nnarrow strip of sand down the middle of the river. It has been \nsuggested to me that that is the reason they are looking to expand what \nthey own, so it is easier to manage if they can make it grow. \nObviously, as the chairman points out, that takes away people's homes, \nproperty that people have the deeds to and that they have paid taxes on \nsometimes for generations.\n  The other misstatement that has been made is that somehow Texas is \ngoing to control this survey. That is not true. This legislation says \nTexas, in conjunction with Oklahoma--and I think the manager's \namendment will say in conjunction with the tribes--will choose a \nprofessional surveyor to do this right. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays this legislation actually saves the taxpayers money. Certainly, we \nhave bent over backwards to make sure landowners on both sides of the \nriver--the tribes, individuals, and local governments--are part of this \nprocess.\n  I think the bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is the only way to prevent the \nBLM from taking this land in a timely way without years of court \nbattles is to pass this legislation, as written, with the manager's \namendment that Chairman Bishop will offer, requiring there to be a \nsurvey that is done right, and then set up the process so that whatever \nthat survey reveals can be dealt with in an equitable manner. That is \nwhat the underlying bill does.\n  Again, I appreciate the chairman's taking the time to understand \nthis. We don't have a lot of Federal land in and around Texas, but any \ntime the Federal Government comes in to try to confiscate what people \nown and have paid taxes on for generations, it is a threat to us all, \nand this legislation, I hope, will be supported.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham), my \ncolleague.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I too believe \nthat Congress must act quickly to address terrorist threats in order to \nkeep Americans safe.\n  Congress promptly acted in a bipartisan manner this week to \nstrengthen glaring holes in our country's Visa Waiver Program. However, \nwe have done absolutely nothing to close an equally alarming loophole \nwhich allows suspected terrorists to purchase guns.\n  Unlike felons, domestic abusers, and the adjudicated mentally ill, \nsuspected terrorists can legally purchase firearms in the United \nStates. I think that is worth repeating. Individuals who are suspected \nof being involved in terrorist activities by the FBI can legally \npurchase dangerous weapons--including military-style assault rifles and \nexplosives--in this country. In fact, more than 2,000 suspects on the \nFBI's terrorist watch list have purchased firearms over the last 11 \nyears.\n  If our intelligence community is concerned enough about an \nindividual's suspected ties to terrorism to prohibit them from boarding \nan aircraft, why would we allow that person to purchase a firearm?\n  The American people are urging Congress to address gun violence and \nstrengthen our Nation's security against increasing threats from ISIS \nand other terrorist organizations. This bill provides a rare \nopportunity to do both. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has \nrefused to even debate this bill.\n  We cannot, Mr. Chairman, wait to act any longer. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation and help ensure that every American lives \nfree from the threat of gun violence.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), my colleague.\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chairman, here is what the terrorists \nsay: ``America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You \ncan go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away \nwith a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and \nmost likely without having to show an identification card.''\n\n  Those words, Mr. Chairman, are from the mouth of former al Qaeda \nspokesman Adam Gadahn, who, until his demise, was one of the world's \nmost wanted terrorists. Mr. Gadahn can be seen on a video urging lone-\nwolf attacks on innocent Americans.\n  After describing how easy it is to buy a firearm in our country, he \nends the video by saying: ``So what are you waiting for?''\n  So I ask this Congress: What are we waiting for--more attacks like \nSan Bernardino or Paris? more families destroyed? more innocent lives \nwasted? more 30 seconds of silence in this Chamber?\n  Let's save some lives today. Say ``no'' to the purchase of weapons by \nthose who would use violence and threats to destroy our way of life.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I have some other speakers who are \non their way, so I will reserve in the hopes that I can hear some other \nspeeches that care about people who are about to lose their homes by \nthe actions of this government, that we actually care about those \npeople.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to address an issue that has been \naddressed in the course of our conversations.\n  The majority continues to claim that the Federal Government does not \nand has never had any legal claim to the land between the river's \nmedian and the south bank, but that claim is inaccurate.\n  This 116-mile stretch of the river originally came into Federal \nownership under the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Treaties between 1819 \nand 1838 established the south bank of the Red River as the southern \nborder of the United States and the northern border of what is now the \nState of Texas. In 1867, the land north of the river became part of the \nKiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation, with the medial line of the river \ndenoting the reservation's southern boundary.\n  All land between the medial line and the southern bank of the Red \nRiver was retained--not acquired--by the Federal Government as public \nland. The land between the medial line and the south bank has never \nbeen owned by anyone other than the Federal Government.\n  The Supreme Court decision in the 1920s never ceded ownership of the \npublic land to either State but simply adopted a new methodology and \nterminology for determining where the southern bank of the Red River, \nstill the border between Texas and Oklahoma, lies.\n\n[[Page H9177]]\n\n  Although litigation in the 1980s, resulting from natural changes in \nthe river's location, attempted to settle private landowners' acreage \ndisputes, these agreements had no effect on Federal land ownership. \nLikewise, while the Red River Compact changed the boundary between the \nStates by switching from applying the gradient line measurement to \nusing the vegetation line, that compact explicitly did not transfer any \ntitle or status of land held in the public domain to Texas, Oklahoma, \nor any private landowner. Any claim that any litigation or agreements \nover the past 90-plus years have somehow negated Federal ownership of \nthese 30,000 acres simply is not true.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield, once again, such time as \nhe may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the \nsponsor of this bill, to explain how this actually did take place and \nwhat the issue is here.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that statement by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts. I do not disagree with anything she \nsaid, and I think I said that a while ago, that there absolutely is a \nlegitimate Federal claim from the middle of the river to the south \nbank. That has been the case ever since 1803. The gentlewoman is \nexactly right in laying that out.\n  The problem is that the Bureau of Land Management has said now the \nsouth bank is as much as a mile to the south of where it is because \nthey refuse to follow the survey method that the Supreme Court \nmandated. They have done these spot surveys the chairman mentioned.\n  It is not a question about the middle of the river to the south bank. \nIt is a question of where the south bank is. In some cases, it is a \ntremendous difference back, and that is where they confiscate the land. \nIt is because their new interpretation of the south bank is far, far \naway from the river, as I say, as much as a mile. That is the issue. \nThat is the reason the only way to solve this is to have a professional \nsurvey define the south bank using the criteria set by the Supreme \nCourt, and then that decides it.\n  Will there continue to be Federal land between the south bank and the \nmiddle of the river? Absolutely. BLM has said they don't know what they \nare going to do with it because it is a narrow strip of sand. But the \nkey is to define that boundary so we don't take away the livelihood and \nthe homes of the people who have lived and had deeds on the land far \nbeyond the south bank. That is what is at issue here.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, just to address an issue that my colleague from Texas \nhas brought up, the BLM is trying to resolve the very difference that \nhe suggests and has instituted a survey and would like to continue that \nprocess in order to resolve the very issue that he is raising, but it \nis an issue that should be retained by the Federal Government through \nthe BLM.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, when you can't do a survey in 6 \nyears, maybe somebody should insist the Federal Government's agencies \ndo it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, if I could inquire of the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts how many more speeches she has. There is \none person coming down, but I don't know if he will make it. I think, \nin light of the time, I am ready to close if she is ready to close.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I am ready to close and yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I want to conclude by acknowledging that I sympathize with the \nproperty owners along the Red River. Providing them with certainty and \nassurance that their property rights are not threatened is a goal that \nwe should all share, and we do.\n  Unfortunately, this bill will only complicate an already complicated \nand messy situation. As introduced, it will likely lead to litigation \nfrom tribes and tribal members who stand to lose both property and \nmineral interests.\n  Furthermore, this bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to \ndisclaim all right, title, and interest in the affected areas and \ntransfer survey authority to the State of Texas. It is unclear how the \nBLM will be able to work with property owners to clear titles after the \nUnited States has already conceded its authority over the land.\n  Additionally, transferring the Federal Government survey authority to \nTexas is not a workable solution. It is so implausible, in fact, that \nthe bill has triggered a veto threat from the White House.\n  If there is really a problem that Congress can solve, providing Texas \nlandowners with the certainty they desire, we should work together to \ncome up with legislation that would earn the President's signature.\n  We should go back to the drawing board. Until that happens, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This is one of those situations where this is an issue that has been \nfestering for 6 years now. If the Bureau of Land Management truly \nwanted to solve this issue, if they truly wanted to make amends, if \nthey truly wanted to give certainty to these people, it could have \nhappened by now. But up the food chain they have refused to do it.\n  That is why it is incumbent upon us to do the right thing. We are \ntalking about people whose property, whose homes, their future, their \nlivelihoods, are being threatened by a government bureaucracy that \nsimply says they don't care. They would rather have control than solve \na problem.\n  The bill before you actually sets out a way of doing the survey in \nthe right way, the way the Supreme Court said it should be done, doing \nit the right way the first time and ensuring that everyone will be part \nof the table. It sets out a process to actually solve this problem in a \nminimum amount of time. This is the right thing to do. We should go \nforward with that.\n  I appreciate those who have spoken on this particular issue because \nthere are people whose lives are being threatened right now because of \nthe uncertainty about what their property rights are and where they \nwill not be, and that is wrong. That is simply wrong.\n  What has happened to these people is wrong. If we allow it to go \nforward by our inability of trying to make decisions here, we are \nwrong, too. It is time to quit hurting people and do things that \nactually help them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, first off, I would like to thank \nCongressman Thornberry for leading this effort in the House.\n  It is no surprise that the Bureau of Land Management under this \nAdministration has become greedy.\n  But their blatant disregard of the law and private property rights is \nshameful.\n  One would think the federal government would be satisfied with the \n653 million acres of land it currently controls and owns, which is over \n27 percent of the total U.S. surface area.\n  A lot of which goes unused, but apparently that is not enough.\n  If anything the federal government should being selling land instead \nof trying to claim more.\n  The Bureau of Land Management's actions are a cloud on the title of \nTexas ranches.\n  Since the 1845 annexation of Texas into the United States, the \nfederal government has owned very little to no property in Texas.\n  The Red River Private Property Protection Act, if signed into law \nwould settle these absurd claims and clearly define the borders.\n  It is important that we support and protect Oklahoma and Texas \nlandowners from this Administration's ridiculous attempt at another \nland grab.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute recommended by the Committee on Natural Resources printed in \nthe bill.

Pursuant to House Resolution 556, the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Bishop) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of a \nbrilliantly written manager's amendment to H.R. 2130.\n  In short, this bill, introduced by my friend, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Mr. Thornberry of Texas, prevents the Federal \nGovernment from claiming thousands of acres of private land legally \nowned by American citizens and tribes along the 116-mile stretch of the \nRed River between Texas and Oklahoma.\n  My manager's amendment will do the following: It will ensure that \nnothing in this bill will create or reinstate a tribal reservation. It \nensures that nothing in this bill alters the valid existing mineral \nrights of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Nations. It allows affected \nfederally recognized Indian tribes to be part of the survey process in \naddition to the States of Oklahoma and Texas. It allows landowners \naccess to judicial review beyond the Bureau of Land Management's \nadministrative appeals process.\n  This manager's amendment reflects concerns that have been brought to \nus by Chairman Thornberry, by Congressman Cole of Oklahoma, by Oklahoma \nGovernor Fallin, by private landowners, and by the other stakeholders \nwho have an interest in this particular area.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the manager's \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bishop).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Cole\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \nHouse Report 114-375.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, line 13, strike ``landowners'' and insert \n     ``federally recognized Indian tribes with jurisdiction over \n     lands''.\n       Page 7, lines 8 and 9, strike ``or deed or color of \n     title''.\n       Page 7, line 11, strike ``$1.25'' and insert ``fair market \n     value''.\n       Page 8, after line 7, insert the following (and redesignate \n     the subsequent clauses accordingly):\n       (i) the federally recognized Indian tribes holding \n     reservation or allotment land on June 5, 1906, with the first \n     right of refusal;\n       Page 8, line 9, strike ``first'' and insert ``second''.\n       Page 8, line 13, strike ``second'' and insert ``third''.\n       Page 8, line 15, strike ``third'' and insert ``fourth''.\n       Page 8, line 18, strike ``fourth'' and insert ``fifth''\n       Page 8, after line 22, insert the following (and \n     redesignate the subsequent clauses accordingly):\n       (i) the federally recognized Indian tribes holding \n     reservation or allotment land on June 5, 1906, with the first \n     right of refusal;\n       Page 8, line 24, strike ``first'' and insert ``second''.\n       Page 9, line 3, strike ``second'' and insert ``third''.\n       Page 9, line 5, strike ``third'' and insert ``fourth''.\n       Page 9, line 8, strike ``fourth'' and insert ``fifth''\n       Page 11, after line 20, insert the following:\n       (d) Tribal Allotments.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to alter the present median line of the Red River \n     as it relates to the surface or mineral interests of tribal \n     allottees north of the present median line.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 556, the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Cole) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to start by noting how much I \nrespect the sincerity and good intentions of my friends from Texas and \ntheir desire to settle this issue of landownership along the Red River.\n  I want to particularly thank Chairman Thornberry and Chairman Bishop, \nwho have been extremely cooperative and helpful in trying to resolve \nsome of these thorny issues.\n  I do, however, still have serious concerns about the unintended \nconsequences that the suggested message for resolving this issue will \nmost certainly have on Indian tribes in my district, specifically the \nKiowa, Comanche, and Apache. All three tribes oppose the bill and \nsupport this amendment.\n  This bill gives Texas and Oklahoma the power to conduct a survey, the \ngoal of which is to ascertain the exact location of the portion of the \nRed River currently owned by the Bureau of Land Management.\n  The BLM land would be sold off in a three-step process. The first \nstep provides for adverse possessors to apply for a patent to the BLM \nland. The second is a sale based on a right-of-first-refusal structure. \nThe third provides for any remaining BLM land to be sold via a \ncompetitive sale process. The goal is to remove the Federal control\n\n[[Page H9180]]\n\nthat the BLM has over a 116-mile stretch of the river and, by the CBO's \nestimate, of roughly 30,000 acres.\n  My amendment seeks to accomplish the following:\n  Ensure that tribes receive fair notice of their right to appeal any \nsurvey conducted pursuant to this legislation.\n  Ensure taxpayers receive full compensation instead of $1.25 per acre, \nas proposed, for any Federal land. This would also discourage \nfraudulent patent applications to BLM land that would hinder the \nprocess of disposal.\n  Ensure tribes will be provided with rights of first refusal to \npurchase BLM land.\n  And, finally, explicitly ensure that a survey and/or subsequent \npurchase does not result in any diminishment or alteration of tribal \nsurface or mineral interests.\n  Mr. Chairman, the first portion of this amendment is an easy fix. \nProviding tribal landowners with notice of their right to appeal a \nsurvey determination is a fundamental notion of due process. Tribes \nhave been left out of such notice requirements in the bill, as \ncurrently drafted.\n  The second portion of my amendment will help minimize the likelihood \nthe projected litigation will commence. Litigation does nothing but \nunduly delay the opportunity for tribes to buy back their land at a \nfair market price. The $1.25 an acre price the current bill proposes is \nnot the best deal for taxpayers, and Congress should vote to get the \nbest value for BLM land.\n  To avoid this result, my amendment raises the standard patent \napplicants must meet for their applications to be approved.\n  The amendment also alters the right of first refusal structure for \nlandowners to purchase BLM land by competitive sale. Indian tribes that \nformerly held reservation land in this part of Oklahoma, like the \nKiowa, Comanche, and Apache, now have the right of first refusal for \nany competitive sale of BLM land that takes place pursuant to this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, my amendment would disallow the survey from moving the \nmedial line of the river north to affect the surface or mineral \ninterests of tribal allottees north of the river in Oklahoma.\n  I simply cannot support a bill that would negatively impact tribal \nlandowners in Oklahoma whose interests in surface, oil, gas, minerals, \nand water are critical to economic stability and funding for tribal \ngovernment programs.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill would begin a process of give-and-take in \nredetermining landownership between Texans, Oklahomans, and Indian \ntribes. Congress should remain mindful of its trust responsibilities \nand tread carefully when it comes to what could very well be construed \nas a taking of the Constitution.\n  Those in support of the bill will likely argue that tribes stand to \nbenefit from re-surveying the river, citing that allotments bordering \nthe river will actually expand in certain areas. That is a big gamble \nto take.\n  The fact is that neither Texans, Oklahomans, nor tribal members have \nany indication of whether they stand to gain or lose as a result of the \nsurvey method to be used. As a result, they have everything to lose \nshould this bill become law without the amendment.\n  I urge the support of the Cole amendment to H.R. 2130.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I have a great deal of respect for \nCongressman Cole and his efforts. I want to also offer that, as this \nbill continues to be processed, I will be more than happy to work on \nthese and other issues, as we have in the past on certain issues that \nare in the manager's amendment.\n  But I have to oppose this particular amendment. It does certain \nthings that are problematic.\n  First, the amendment alters the bill's rights of first refusal \nprocedure to give precedence to some above others, whether or not they \nhave a reasonable claim to the land or hold an adjacent allotment. That \nis the key point right there: is the claim and the allotment adjacent.\n  The bill, as is already written, already gives the right of first \nrefusal to those landowners who are there as long as they own the \nadjacent land parcel. That should not be changed.\n  Secondly, the medial line is an important issue in allocating where \nthe location of the river actually is. If you are going to solve the \nproblem unequivocally to demonstrate the true ownership of the land, \nthis has to be solved. Otherwise, the clouded title to private lands \nwill continue on, as they have been by BLM's action so far.\n  The Supreme Court has made it very clear that the medial is supposed \nto change as the movements of the river change. BLM's recent survey \nignored the movement of the river, which is causing the very issue that \nwe are facing today.\n  This amendment would put it back into the failed process. This \namendment then runs contrary to what the Supreme Court's decision said \nis the fair surveying practices that ought to have been done 6 years \nago by the BLM in the first place.\n  Congressman Thornberry has worked extensively with Congressman Cole \nto address some of the concerns--many of the concerns--that are there. \nI would point out just a few that have been added.\n  We are preventing the alternation of sovereign right States under the \nRed River Boundary Compact. We are ensuring the State of Oklahoma and \naffected tribes are involved in picking surveyors and approving the \nsurvey.\n  We are preventing the creation or reinstatement of the tribal \nreservation. We are ensuring that the bill does not impact the valid \nrights of the affected tribes to the mineral interest fund created in \n1926.\n  Overall, the bill, as written and amended with the manager's \namendment, proposes a fair solution to the issue at hand, incorporates \nthe ideas and views of those interested in a wide range of the \nstakeholders.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by acknowledging what my \nfriend said. I appreciate Mr. Thornberry and him working with us. This \nis a long and complex issue.\n  I will just say, we don't see the 1923 Supreme Court decision is \nwhere it started. We think it goes back to an earlier period where the \ntribes did not ever agree to give up their reservation land. They want \nan opportunity to be able to repurchase what they think was taken from \nthem, if it should become available on the market.\n  I thank my friends again for working with me and look forward to \ncontinuing that process.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I \nactually have?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. I appreciate the chairman's yielding to me.\n  I also appreciate the considerable efforts that have gone on not just \nin the past few weeks and months but all the way back to the last \nCongress with Congressman Cole, with the Governor's Office of Oklahoma, \nand with the tribes directly to try to make sure that any concern was \naddressed.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me just say one overall point. Actually, the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts made this really clear, which is that in \ngoing back to at least 1867 there is no tribal claim that goes south of \nthe median line of the river. As a result, really, the only interests \nthat could be threatened are that narrow strip of sand that the Federal \nGovernment does have a rightful claim on or its expansion beyond its \nrightful claim.\n  There should be no question of any tribal surface or mineral interest \nthat is impinged by this legislation because they only ever went to the \nmiddle of the river. What we are talking about is the south bank of the \nriver, which is what the BLM is now claiming.\n  I want to address the $1.25 issue because the bill requires that any \nland sold to an adjacent landowner or to anybody else be sold at \ncurrent market value. The only exception is if, for a period of at \nleast 20 years, you have\n\n[[Page H9181]]\n\nowned the land, if you have a deed to the land, if you have paid taxes \non the land, or if the Federal Government has never made a claim on the \nland for at least 20 years. In that instance, then you can under color \nof title procedure purchase the land for $1.25 an acre if the Bureau of \nLand Management agrees. It is at their discretion.\n  The idea is, if this survey happens to find some acreage--and I am \nnot sure it will--that somebody has owned, has a deed to, has paid \ntaxes on, has lived on, or if nobody else has claimed the title to it, \nthen they don't have to buy it twice because they already bought it \nonce. That is the purpose of this. In every other case, you have to pay \nthe full market value for any land.\n  The last point is that Congressman Cole is very interested in making \nsure that the tribes are fully participating and know this about the \nsurvey, et cetera. I agree. I think the manager's amendment that \nChairman Bishop has just offered ensures that the tribes participate in \nthe survey from the beginning. Of course, they have the right to appeal \njust like any other landowner would.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think this is the answer to a problem that needs our \nintervention because it is wrong to leave these people hanging for \nanother 6 or 10 years without a complete survey that answers the \nquestion.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against \nthe motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment \nto the bill, which will not kill the bill nor send it back to \ncommittee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final \npassage, as amended.\n  My motion to recommit would incorporate H.R. 1076, a Republican bill \ntitled the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act \nof 2015, into the underlying bill.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  The bill is straightforward. It says if you are on the FBI's \nterrorist watch list, then you don't get to walk into a gun store, pass \na background check, and leave with a weapon of your choice. It is an \noutrageous loophole. And we know it allows dangerous people to easily \nget guns.\n  Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally \npurchased weapons in the United States. And more than 90 percent of all \nsuspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years \nwalked away with the weapons they wanted. If there is one thing both \nsides of this House can agree on, it is keeping guns from terrorists.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side have expressed some concerns. \nSo let's address them.\n  You are worried that there are names on the list that shouldn't be \nthere. This is a legitimate concern. So let's scrub the list.\n  You are worried that it is difficult to get off the list if you are \nwrongly put on it. This bill has an appeals process.\n  You are concerned about denying people their Second Amendment rights. \nWell, I am a gun guy. I own guns. I support the Second Amendment. If \nthis bill did anything to violate those rights, my name wouldn't be on \nit.\n  We are not talking about prohibiting law-abiding, non-dangerous \npeople from getting guns. We are just talking about taking a pause.\n\n[[Page H9184]]\n\n  I think we can all agree that it is better to err on the side of \ncaution and let people get their names taken off the list, rather than \njust sell them a gun and hope they are not a terrorist.\n  So let's scrub the list and make it accurate. Let's make sure the \nappeals process is functional and efficient. And if someone is on the \nterrorist list and is denied from buying a gun, let's pump the brakes \nand make sure they are, in fact, not a terrorist before that sale is \nallowed to proceed.\n  Everyone on my side of the aisle stands ready to address your \nconcerns. Will your side do the same? Will you address our concern \nabout terrorists being able to have legal and easy access to guns?\n  We have a chance to take a simple, straightforward step to keep \nspouses, kids, and communities safe. We can take this vote today. I \nhave filed a discharge petition on the bill. We just need a simple \nmajority to sign it. You can do it right now.\n  If House Republicans agree that terrorists shouldn't be able to get \nguns, then walk down to the well, sign your name on the line, and let's \nhave a vote.\n  It is your own party's bill. It was supported by George W. Bush's \nDepartment of Justice. All it does is prevent suspected terrorists from \ngetting guns--in the exact same way we prevent criminals, domestic \nabusers, and the dangerously mentally ill from getting guns.\n  We will work with you to address your concerns. Do the same for us. \nWork with our side to keep guns from suspected terrorists.\n  This is an issue we can all come together on. 2,000 suspected \nterrorists buying guns is 2,000 too many. So let's stop it. Let's take \na stand. Put your name down in writing and let's take a vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition, and \nI continue to reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that our \ncolleagues, Mr. McClintock and Don Young, were put on this watch list--\nactually, for Don Young maybe it fits.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I am going to insist on my point of order.\n  This motion to recommit involves subject matter that is different \nfrom the bill. The fundamental purpose of the motion is unrelated to \nthe bill.\n  I insist on my point of order.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to be heard on \nthe point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California may be heard \non the point of order.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the \nChair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California should \nunderstand that the Chair has not ruled on the point of order.\n  The Chair will now rule.\n  The gentleman from Utah makes a point of order that the instructions \nproposed in the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from \nCalifornia involve a subject matter different from the bill.\n  Clause 7 of rule XVI, the germaneness rule, provides that no \nproposition on a subject different from that under consideration shall \nbe admitted under color of amendment.\n  The bill addresses the boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma drawn \nby the Red River. Though the bill touches on a number of aspects of \nproperty management, it does so only with respect to a narrow \ngeographic area.\n  The amendment proposed in the motion to recommit makes a variety of \nchanges to title 18 of the United States Code relating to the sale, \npossession, licensing, and distribution of firearms and explosives. It \nhas no bearing on the land addressed in the underlying bill.\n  The Chair finds that the amendment proposed in the motion to recommit \ngoes beyond the subject matter of the underlying bill. It is, \ntherefore, not germane. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the \nChair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the House?\n\n\n                            Motion to Table\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I move to lay the appeal on the \ntable.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by 5-\nminute votes on passage of the bill, if arising without further \nproceedings in recommittal, and agreeing to the Speaker's approval of \nthe Journal, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 246, \nnays 182, not voting 5, as follows:\n\n

The gentlewoman will state her parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, is it true that the \nRepublicans have repeatedly blocked legislation that would explicitly \nprevent terrorists from buying guns?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman will suspend.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, why can we not get \nan answer to this question?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has not stated a proper \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The Chair is prepared to put the question on passage to a vote of the \nHouse.\n  The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in using the \npower of the purse to stop the reckless policies of President Obama \nthat leave the citizens of the United States vulnerable. Americans \noverwhelmingly support this.\n  The FBI, DNI, and DHS have testified that they cannot fully screen \nthe thousands of refugees that the President wants to bring in from \nSyria, Somalia, Iraq, and other regions with high rates of terrorism. \nIllegal immigrants from Syria, Libya, Somalia, and other hotbeds of \nterrorism continue to test the openness of our southern border. The \nloopholes in the screening of immigrants from hotbeds of terrorism are \nbeing exploited, and the administration opposes closing them.\n  This House has one chance, the end of the year appropriations bill, \nto end these dangerous policies.\n  This Member of Congress will vote against any bill rushed to the \nfloor that fails to stop these reckless policies.\n  Let's put aside political correctness, criticism from foreign \nnationals that leave Americans vulnerable. This is our chance to stop \nfuture San Bernardinos, Parises, Chattanoogas, Garlands, and Ft. Hoods. \nThe lives of these American citizens are worth it. Indeed, they cry out \nfor it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9186-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, the people of \nVenezuela took to the polls and, in a loud, clear voice, deposed the \nChavista ruling party from the National Assembly.\n  Polls leading up to the election indicated that a vast majority, 87 \npercent of Venezuelans, were dissatisfied with the direction that \nMaduro and his cronies were taking the country.\n  Maduro's policies have led Venezuela to having the hemisphere's \nhighest inflation rate, causing critical shortages of food and \nmedicine, as well as the collapse of the Venezuelan currency and \nrampant crime.\n  The newly elected coalition has pledged to make necessary reforms to \nget a handle on the economy. It has also promised to pass laws to \nrelease the political prisoners that have been unjustly arrested by the \nMaduro regime.\n  Sunday's elections were a watershed moment for the Venezuelan people, \nand it charts a new course for their destiny. However, there is still \nhard work that needs to be done to ensure a thriving, prosperous, and \njust Venezuela, at peace with itself and with its people.\n  I congratulate the Venezuelan people and the Venezuelan community in \nthe United States on this momentous occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9186-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9186-H9187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FDA, DO YOUR JOB, BUT GET IT RIGHT\n\n  (Mr. WELCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, the Food and Drug Administration has an \nextremely important job to make certain that our food is safe, but it \nis often misguided and overreaches in some of its regulations.\n  The FDA is considering a standard that would severely impact artisan \ncheese producers. They have proposed a safety standard that seeks to \nlimit the level of nontoxigenic E. coli found in raw milk cheeses.\n  The problem is there is absolutely no scientific connection between \nmeeting that standard and improving food and safety. Yet, there is a \nvery practical, burdensome impact on our artisan cheese makers.\n  It is why the ICMSF, the leading global food safety body, the \nEuropean Union, and many U.S. food safety experts have argued that \nmonitoring raw milk cheeses for nontoxigenic E. coli is absolutely \nunwarranted. In spite of that international consensus, the FDA is \nforging ahead, and it is going to do real damage to our artisan cheese \nmakers.\n  Artisan cheese makers already have rigorous protocols in place to \nensure safety. That is why I led a bipartisan, bicameral group of \ncolleagues in sending a letter to FDA raising concerns with this \nstandard: FDA, do your job, but get it right.\n\n[[Page H9187]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9187-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9187-H9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n              POVERTY AND ITS IMPACTS ON AMERICAN FAMILIES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Lee) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority \nleader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, for her tireless \nwork on so many issues, and for allowing us to use the Congressional \nProgressive Caucus' time tonight to organize this Special Order on \npoverty and its impacts on American families.\n  Also, I would like to recognize my friend and colleague from \nMissouri, and thank our cochair of the Congressional Black Caucus' \nPoverty and Economy Task Force, Congressman Cleaver, for his leadership \non poverty, opportunity, housing, and so many issues that he cares \nabout and has been a champion about for so many years.\n  Also, to our colleague and our good friend and whip, Mr. Hoyer, his \nunwavering commitment is very evident in making poverty a priority for \nthis body.\n  Also, to Leader Pelosi, I want to thank her and recognize her for her \ncommitment to the most vulnerable, and for reminding us constantly that \n20 percent of America's children continue to live below the poverty \nline.\n  So this evening, I rise as the chair of the Democratic Whip's Task \nForce on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, and cochair of \nour Congressional Black Caucus' Task Force on Poverty and the Economy \nto call on all of our colleagues, and our country, really, to refocus \nour efforts on programs and policies in funding that help lift \nAmericans out of poverty, but also to remember that there is a safety \nnet that has to be preserved until we can do just that: People want to \nwork; people want opportunity.\n  I invite all of our colleagues to join us tonight in creating a \nnational strategy to eradicate poverty once and for all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to hold my remarks and yield to my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio (Ms. Fudge), former chair of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus and member of the Education Committee and the Ag \nCommittee. She has been, consistently, since she has been in Congress, \nand before she came to Congress, worked and spoke on behalf of the most \nvulnerable in our country.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I just want to say that there is no one in this Congress who works \nharder and puts in more time trying to find a way to come back and \neradicate poverty than Barbara Lee. It is my pleasure and my privilege \nto work with you every day. I have learned so much from you, and I just \nwant you to continue to do the people's work, and I appreciate it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to address a topic that many of us know far too \nwell, and that is poverty. I see its impact on the people of the 11th \nCongressional District every day.\n  My district has some of the Nation's most impoverished cities. The \noverall poverty rate is 28 percent. Out of the 435 Congressional \ndistricts in the United States, my district is one of the top 20 \npoorest districts in America.\n  Nearly 200,000 of my constituents live in poverty. I see and talk to \npoor people every day. Mothers and fathers without jobs, families with \nlittle to no access to healthy food or adequate housing, and children--\nyes, Mr. Speaker, children--who are in overcrowded classrooms with \noutdated textbooks.\n  Poverty is the source of our Nation's most persistent social and \neconomic issues. It permeates our entire society and has victimized too \nmany Americans for far too long.\n  We don't need another committee hearing on hunger or poverty to tell \nus what we already know. We know what the problems are and how to \naddress them.\n  My colleagues and I have been proactive in finding solutions to \neradicate poverty in this, the wealthiest country in the world. I have \nintroduced bills supporting initiatives to feed children and families, \nfought to protect safety-net programs, and insisted Congress develop \npolicies that create jobs that pay a living wage.\n  The majority in this House has not been a willing participant. Some \nMembers believe that if you don't work, you are lazy. Others believe \nthat poor people are looking for handouts.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, none of that is true. The people I have \nspoken to are not looking for a handout. They simply need a hand up, a \njob to take care of their families and pay their bills. The dignity of \nwork is what we all want.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  We must put aside politics and pass policies that give everyone a \nfair chance at the American Dream. When we do not work together, our \nconstituents suffer.\n  FDR said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to \nthe abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough \nfor those who have too little.''\n  We must act now.\n  Ms. LEE. I thank the gentlewoman for her very powerful statement and \nfor, once again, her leadership.\n  I want to remind this body that she has been such an active advocate \non behalf of those needing that safety net of SNAP and food stamp \nbenefits and for making sure that people have the right to eat in this \ncountry regardless of how much money they have.\n  Again, I thank Congresswoman Fudge.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro), the ranking member on the Appropriation Committee's Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies \nSubcommittee, on which I am honored to serve. Every day she is a \nchampion on behalf of all of those who we are discussing tonight in \nterms of making sure they have an opportunity to live the American \nDream.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Lee, for organizing \nthis effort this evening. It isn't just this evening. Every day, 24 \nhours a day, in her heart of hearts, she knows what her mission is \nhere. That is to make sure that there is a better life for our families \nand to make sure that there is a better life for our children. It is an \nhonor to work with her on these issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a saying that the strength of a nation starts \nwith the strength of its families. The child tax credit was created in \n1997 to help working families afford the expense of raising children. \nAs we all know only too well, the cost of child-rearing goes up every \nsingle year.\n  According to the latest figures from the Department of Agriculture, \nthe average two-parent, low-income household will spend more than \n$218,000 per child up to the age of 18. Middle-income families will \nspend even more. We in this body have an obligation to do what we can \nto help households cope with these mounting costs.\n  Today the child tax credit helps improve the lives of some 38 million \nfamilies. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in \n2013, the child tax credit alone lifted 3.1 million people out of \npoverty, including 1.7 million children. The child tax credit, together \nwith the earned income tax credit, lift more children out of poverty \nthan any other Federal program.\n  Thanks to the 2009 expansion of the credit, a household with two \nchildren and one full-time minimum wage earner receives a total credit \nof about $1,812 per year. That is a real help to families who might \notherwise struggle just to make ends meet. Unfortunately, each year, \nthe value of that credit declines with inflation as the cost of raising \na child increases each year.\n  In the last big tax deal, Congress made the estate tax cut both \npermanent and indexed to inflation. The beneficiaries of the estate tax \nare one-tenth of a percent of the people in this Nation. It strictly \nbenefits the children of the wealthy. I don't want to deny them \nbenefits, but I want us to consider the children in low-income \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page H9188]]\n\n  Congress should do the same for working families with the child tax \ncredit. We should provide a cost-of-living increase as costs go up for \nraising children. By the end of this decade, the simple measure would \nsave an estimated 750,000 children from falling back into poverty.\n  Another statistic, my colleague from California, is that there are \nabout 7,450 estates in the United States that benefit from the estate \ntax. If we indexed--provided a cost of living--for the child tax \ncredit, 19 million children could be lifted out of poverty. Where is \nour balance? Where is our sense of right and wrong?\n  The value of indexing our anti-poverty programs cannot be \nunderstated. Because Social Security benefits are indexed, the rate of \nseniors in poverty has been relatively stable, at close to 10 percent \nfor the last four decades. Because SNAP benefits--food stamp benefits--\nwere re-indexed in the 2008 farm bill, families saw the value of their \nbenefits stabilize.\n  The biggest economic challenge facing our country today is that far \ntoo many hardworking people are still not earning enough to make ends \nmeet. Middle class wages are stagnant or are in decline. We need to do \nwhatever we can to support working people.\n  No family in our country should have to struggle to raise a child. By \nindexing the value of the child tax credit--providing the cost of \nliving--and making the expansion permanent, we would help millions of \nparents afford these costs by giving them a permanent tax break, which \nhelps families and does not lose its value over time.\n  This year, at this time, we should reaffirm our Nation's support for \nits hardworking families. We should provide them with the same benefit \nthat we provided the children of the 1 percent when we made the estate \ntax exemption permanent and indexed it to inflation.\n  The fact of the matter is that the families that we are talking \nabout--and these are not my words, but those of Economist Mark Zandi, \nwho was the economist for John McCain.\n  When he was asked what would be most stimulative in our economy, he \ntalked about food stamps because people spend that money. He talked \nabout extending unemployment benefits because people spend that money \nright away and engage and drive our economy. He also talked about the \nrefundable tax credits, like the earned income tax credit and the child \ntax credit, because people will spend that money and use it to drive \nour economy.\n  I want to say a thank you to my colleague from California. It is an \nimportant discussion. I thank the gentlewoman for organizing it and for \nalways being there to make sure that those of us who serve here do not \nforget and that we keep our focus where it should be, on the sons and \nthe daughters and the children of working families, of low-income \nfamilies, and of middle class families.\n  Ms. LEE. I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for that very \npoignant statement and for her tremendous leadership each and every \nday.\n  Also, I want to thank the gentlewoman for laying out what the choices \nare in terms of our priorities and the fact that we know how to \neliminate, really, poverty if we just have the will to. So I thank the \ngentlewoman for laying it out.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend and colleague from New Jersey, \nCongresswoman Watson Coleman, who each and every day is so consistent \nwith her votes and her voice in terms of doing what is right for \nchildren, for the American people, for her constituency.\n  Once again, I thank her for giving us the time this evening to talk \nabout poverty because that certainly is a priority of hers. With the \nProgressive Caucus, she has just hit the ground running and has really \ncaptured this moment to talk about the issues that the American people \ncare about.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for \norganizing, coordinating, this opportunity for this discussion. I thank \nthe gentlewoman because she is the most vibrant and is the strongest \nvoice for those who are the most vulnerable in our communities across \nthis Nation.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, poverty isn't just a problem in America. It is a crisis. \nWe are not doing enough about it.\n  In September, the Census Bureau released the newest data on the \nnumber of Americans living below the poverty line. The report further \nconfirms what my colleagues and I have been trying to get the majority \nin this body to acknowledge, and that is that poverty may be one of the \ngreatest challenges facing our Nation right now.\n  The median household income stayed the same. The poverty rate \nremained the same as well. Women and minorities did worse than the \naverage. Overall, nearly 15 percent of American families--almost 47 \nmillion people--earn less than $24,000 a year.\n  The fact that terrifies me the most is that the way we calculate the \npoverty rate has several inherent flaws, and when you dive deeper into \nthe numbers on this issue, you come up with a picture of an America \nthat is deeply broken.\n  The poverty rate is just a snapshot of a single year. Last year, for \nexample, 22 percent of all children lived in families that fell below \nthe poverty line, something we should be embarrassed by in not devoting \nmore resources to fixing.\n  But childhood lasts more than 1 year, and when you look at the span \nof childhood, you find that nearly 40 percent of our children have \nspent at least 1 year in poverty, double what we see in a single year. \nWe have more children who are living in poverty than in most developed \nnations.\n  That alone should serve as a wake-up call to all of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle who so frequently invoke the need to \nprotect our children's futures when they are debating bills here on the \nfloor.\n  In case that is not enough, here is another indicator: The number of \npeople who are living in high poverty areas--better known as slums--\ndoubled between 2000 and 2013. That is a very big deal because living \nin an impoverished community fundamentally changes the futures of \nchildren.\n  Study after study has found that they are more likely to be poor \nlater in life, less likely to achieve in school, less likely to find \njobs, less likely to achieve the milestones that are necessary to \nchange their trajectories, like graduating from high school and \nattending college, and they are more likely to end up in one of our \npenal institutions.\n  The biggest problem, Mr. Speaker, is that we are not doing enough to \nfix poverty. In fact, in some cases, we are making it worse. Take \nhousing assistance programs, for example.\n  We leave it up to the States to dole out funds for low-income housing \nprograms. These States then place the overwhelming majority of low-\nincome developments in already low-income areas, depriving those \nfamilies of quality schools, of access to jobs, and of a variety of \nsocial services that more affluent communities benefit from.\n  At home in New Jersey, I have fought hard against just such \ndiscrimination with legislation that required all communities to build \naffordable homes. We need the same kind of initiatives at the Federal \nlevel, laws that will ensure affordable housing exists beyond urban and \nlower income boundaries, that will give working families access to \nchild care, that will lower the cost of college, and that will increase \nwages.\n  We also need to think about what it really means every time we deny a \ncost-of-living increase or refuse to give Federal workers the pay they \ndeserve. Groceries still cost more every year. Rent still goes up. Bus \nfare gets higher. We are asking them to do more with less because we \nare unwilling to enact policies that actually work. That is flat out \nwrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, for many of the challenges facing our Nation, we have \nyet to find a clear solution. Poverty isn't one of those. With the \nwillpower to act, we could eradicate poverty and build a stronger \nfuture for generations to come.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for her very \neloquent statement, but also for laying out a pathway out of poverty.\n  It is comprehensive. We have to do this together in an integrated \napproach. Whether it is child care, whether it is housing, whether it \nis SNAP benefits, whether it is higher education, whether it is K-12, \nCongresswoman Watson Coleman has laid out the intricacies of what we \nmean when we talk about pathways out of poverty.\n\n[[Page H9189]]\n\n  I thank the gentlewoman very much for taking us to the next level in \nterms of how we need to really view our strategies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), \nour Democratic whip, who has really insisted that we, as a body, look \nat how we develop our pathways out of poverty within the context of our \nTask Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, because it \ntakes opportunity to help lift people out of poverty.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for making this a priority \nfor this body and for continuing to beat the drum on behalf of those \nwho have the least.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  No one more than Congresswoman Barbara Lee in this House has been \nfocused on how we lift those in poverty out of poverty and into the \nmiddle class.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Of course, as she so well says, it will be good for those in poverty, \nbut it will also be good for all the rest of us. They will help build a \nbetter economy. They will help grow jobs, and they will help America be \nstronger.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join my friend, Chairwoman Barbara Lee \nof the Democratic Whip's Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, and \nOpportunity, for this Special Order.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Cleaver of the CBC's Poverty and \nEconomy Task Force for the work that it has done in this area.\n  Mr. Speaker, poverty is bad for your health. Poverty is bad for your \nmental health. Poverty is bad for children. Poverty is bad for \nfamilies.\n  More than 50 years after President Johnson declared unconditional War \non Poverty, 46 million Americans are still struggling in poverty. That \nis not to say we haven't made some progress. There are programs we have \nadopted.\n  Frankly, Medicare is a tremendous poverty program. Our seniors are \nbetter off, and far less of them are in poverty because of Medicare. \nMedicaid is a critical program to make sure that those who cannot \nafford it are, nevertheless, given health care, which is important for \nall of us to have healthy citizens with whom we deal on a daily basis.\n  Ours, Mr. Speaker, may be the wealthiest nation on Earth, but we can \nbest measure America's economic success not by how many are at the very \ntop, but how few are stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder. By \nthat measure, we have a long way to go to fulfill America's promise as \na land of equal opportunity and of success.\n  Even in 2015, the lines between rich and poor trace the old divides \nof race and background, with 29 percent of Native Americans, 26 percent \nof African Americans, and 23 percent of Latinos living in poverty.\n  Poverty also strikes, of course, our rural communities. In fact, in \nmany respects, there is more poverty in our rural communities than in \nour cities and urban communities. It is more visible in our cities \nbecause they are aggregated; although, we ought not to forget that \nliterally--as I just mentioned about minorities--millions and millions \nof nonminorities struggle in poverty every day. Poverty strikes \nchildren at a higher rate, unfortunately, one in five children in \nAmerica, as our leader says.\n  The task force we launched and which Barbara Lee chairs has been \nworking hard to raise awareness in Congress of these very real and very \ndifficult challenges of poverty in America and to provoke policies that \nhelp alleviate suffering in the short term while working to eradicate \npoverty over the long term.\n  Speaker Ryan has raised poverty as an issue on which he is focused, \nand he has visited areas of poverty in our country. We could recognize \npoverty. We can visit those in poverty. But what it is important to do, \nMr. Speaker, and what Barbara Lee is leading us to do, is to adopt \npolicies that almost eliminate, reduce, and empower those in poverty.\n  The number one rule on the War on Poverty, of course, ought to be \nfirst, do no harm. This means making sure that we refrain from \ndisinvesting in the critical programs that serve the poor and help \nmillions stave off hunger, homelessness, and disease. Mr. Speaker, we \nought to have those criteria in mind when we consider the \nappropriations bills, tax bills, and other policies that affect our \npeople.\n  Thankfully, the recent bipartisan budget deal prevented the return of \nsequestration's severe and painful automatic cuts, which would have \ndisproportionately harmed the most vulnerable in our economy. Now \nCongress has a responsibility to follow that up by passing an omnibus \nand avert a shutdown.\n  However, not doing further harm is not enough. Congress has a \nresponsibility first and foremost to help create jobs that put \nAmericans back to work and enable them to rise out of poverty and, as \nCongressman Coleman Watson indicated, to make sure that, when we ask \npeople and give people the opportunity to work, we value that work and \npay them a living wage.\n  We cannot enable people to rise out of poverty if it keeps lurching \nfrom one manufactured crisis--when I say ``it,'' our policies here in \nCongress on budgets, on debt, on investment, and on taxes--to the next. \nIf we lurch from one crisis to another, we will not be able to succeed \nin enabling and empowering those currently in poverty. We need to work \ntogether to invest in education, workforce training, and innovation to \nmake our workforce more competitive and open doors of opportunity for \nthose looking to get hired.\n  We also, Mr. Speaker, need to expand assistance for housing and \nnutrition as well as access to health care, especially for children. \nPoverty need not be a cycle and should not be a cycle from generation \nto generation. That is debilitating certainly for them, but we ought to \nall recognize it is debilitating for us, our communities, and our \ncountry.\n  The promise of America has always been that this cycle can be broken. \nThat is what we think about America. Even if you are born in \ncircumstances that are tough, if you work hard and play by the rules, \nyou can rise above it. We need to make sure that we give them that \nopportunity.\n  We need to take steps to make sure that hard work pays off, that \nthose who have jobs can earn enough not only to get by, but to get \nahead. This means making child care more affordable for working \nparents, enacting paid leave to care for sick loved ones, and raising \nthe minimum wage.\n  The new Speaker, Mr. Ryan, has indicated he takes very seriously the \nissue of poverty, as I said. I hope we can work together to address \nthat problem in a serious, responsible, and effective manner. Not to do \nso would be a grave disservice to the future of our country and its \npeople.\n  One area he has suggested we might find agreement is in expanding the \nearned income tax credit to childless adults, which could lift an \nadditional half a million Americans out of poverty. In addition to \nthat, we ought to index the ITC, we ought to index the child tax \ncredit, and we ought to index the opportunity tax credit so that we can \nempower and enable those who are working, those who have children that \nwe want well-cared for and safe to be more productive citizens.\n  I thank, again, Chairwoman Barbara Lee and all of the members on the \nDemocratic Whip's Task Force on Poverty, Income Equality, and \nOpportunity and the CBC's Poverty and Economy Task Force, led by my \ngood friend Representative Cleaver, for all the work they are doing to \nwage this War on Poverty with the determination and purpose this \nchallenge requires.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.\n  Ms. LEE. I thank our whip for that very important statement.\n  A couple of things I would like to just comment on, Mr. Hoyer, that \nyou mentioned. In terms of ``first, do no harm,'' a couple of years \nago--and this was with bipartisan support--in all of our appropriations \nbills, we put in language that said that we will do nothing in this \nlegislation that would increase poverty. We did that on a bipartisan \nbasis. Also, when Speaker Ryan was the chair of the Budget Committee, \nwe talked about poverty and tried to determine a way to put into \nlegislation--it was our job to develop a national strategy to eliminate \npoverty.\n\n  So what you are raising tonight I think is very important in terms of \na window of opportunity for us to work\n\n[[Page H9190]]\n\nin a bipartisan way to begin to really do this in terms of reducing and \neliminating poverty for the 46 million people who deserve to live the \nAmerican Dream. I think that this task force and yourself, really, with \nSpeaker Ryan should be able to do this on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I certainly hope she is correct, and I \nbelieve she is absolutely correct that we can work in a bipartisan \nfashion. There is nobody in this House who wants to see people in \npoverty. We may have different views of how to achieve the objective of \nempowering all of our people to seize the opportunity and to be paid a \nliving wage and to support themselves and their family in a way we want \nthem supported. We can work together--I agree with the gentlewoman--in \na bipartisan fashion on that issue. I thank her for her leadership in \nachieving that objective.\n  Ms. LEE. I yield to the gentlewoman from southern California (Ms. \nRoybal-Allard), my colleague, friend, and an individual whom I have \nknown for many, many years who has been consistent over the years on \nbehalf of supporting pathways out of poverty, the most vulnerable, our \nimmigrants, our immigrant women, our children. Congresswoman Lucille \nRoybal-Allard serves on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies, which Ranking Member Rosa \nDeLauro serves on also. She has done unbelievable work on this \nsubcommittee, again, being as consistent as she has ever been since I \nserved with her in the nineties in the California Legislature.\n  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to focus on child \npoverty. Before I do, I would like to commend my colleague, \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee, for her long and steadfast commitment to \naddressing the crisis of child poverty in our Nation.\n  According to the 2015 National Center for Children in Poverty report, \nin the United States, more than 16 million children live in families \nwith incomes below the Federal poverty level. A new study by the Urban \nInstitute found that almost 40 percent of all American children live in \npoverty for at least 1 year before they reach the age of 18.\n  America's children, who represent 23 percent of the U.S. population, \nmake up over 32 percent of those living in poverty. Sadly, my home \nState of California is an example of this human tragedy. Today, 2.5 \nmillion Californians live in deep poverty, and 33 percent of them are \nchildren whose family income is less than $12,000 a year. In my \ndistrict alone, 37,000 children live in extreme poverty.\n  The harmful conditions associated with poverty include substandard \nhousing, lack of nutrition, overcrowding, and exposure to violence, all \nof which can be toxic to a developing child's brain. Research tells us \nthat, even when experienced for a short period of time, many of the \nnegative effects of living in poverty stay with children for the rest \nof their lives. This includes higher rates of health and developmental \nproblems, poor academic achievement, and lower rates of high school \ngraduation.\n  In addition to the individual tragedy of child poverty, it ultimately \nimpacts all of us, costing our country an estimated $500 billion a year \nin lost earnings, higher crime-related costs, and increased health \nexpenditures.\n  Unfortunately, there is a deep void in awareness and government \naccountability for the devastating crisis of child poverty in our \ncountry.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  To address this lack of awareness, this year Congresswoman Barbara \nLee and I offered an amendment to the Labor HHS appropriations bill to \nfund a comprehensive National Academies of Science nonpartisan analysis \nof child poverty in the U.S.\n  Such a study would enable Congress to better understand the root \ncauses of child poverty in our Nation. It would provide invaluable \ninformation on how Congress and service providers can improve the \neffectiveness and outcomes of poverty-related programs and services.\n  Fortunately, our appropriations colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nagreed with us and unanimously supported our amendment. We are grateful \nthat it was included in the final House version of the FY16 Labor \nHealth and Human Services bill.\n  Our amendment is now part of a package of bills being conferenced \nwith Senate appropriators. It is our sincere hope that our child \npoverty amendment will be included in the conferenced Labor, Health, \nand Human Services appropriations bill for FY16.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable that, in the United States, the \nrichest country in the world, child poverty is destroying the lives of \nmillions of our Nation's children. We must address this tragedy now. I \nthank Congresswoman Lee for organizing this Special Order and for her \nrelentless leadership in the call to action to end child poverty in \nthis country.\n  Ms. LEE. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, for her very powerful statement, but also once again for \nher tremendous leadership on the Committee on Appropriations and in her \ndistrict on so many issues, especially relating to children. It would \nnever happen if it were not for Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard on \nthe subcommittee. Thank you so much.\n  Hopefully, our amendment will hold in the conference report. But, if \nit doesn't, it is certainly not because you haven't worked hard and \nhave not been committed to reducing and eliminating childhood poverty. \nI am pretty confident that we are going to win this one. Thank you \nagain for being here with us tonight and for your leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to come down and put some charts up in the \nwell and speak so that the statistics will be very visible before the \npublic as it relates to the poverty rates in the United States.\n  First, let me just say, Mr. Hoyer, our whip, talked about the 50th \nanniversary this year of President Johnson's War on Poverty. Now, this \nWar on Poverty included such initiatives as Medicare, Medicaid, Head \nStart, the Higher Education Act, and the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development. There was a very important immigration bill--you \nname it--50 years ago.\n  This legislation, the War on Poverty, really has helped to reduce our \npoverty rates in the United States. Poverty has fallen from 26 percent \nin 1967 to 15 percent in 2015. Yet, we have a long way to go. It is not \ntime to end this War on Poverty.\n  Actually, it is time to increase our efforts to make sure that the 47 \nmillion people living in poverty have access to all of these \ninitiatives that were begun 50 years ago that really have lifted \nfamilies out of poverty and have prevented families from moving into \npoverty. That is very important to remember about this 50th year \nanniversary.\n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for example, SNAP, \nthat has kept nearly 5 million Americans, including 2.2 million \nchildren, out of poverty in 2014. That is why we do not want to see any \nmore cuts to this program.\n  Social Security benefits kept 1.2 million children out of poverty in \n2013. Medicaid kept nearly 3 million people out of poverty in 2014.\n  Programs beyond the War on Poverty, like the earned income tax credit \nand the child tax credit, which Congresswoman DeLauro and Whip Hoyer \nspoke about, these two initiatives, these two policies and programs, \nhave kept nearly 10 million Americans, including 5 million children, \nout of poverty in 2014 alone. These programs strengthen our economy, \nincrease opportunity for families, and provide millions of Americans \nwith pathways out of poverty.\n  We have tried to make sure that our Republican colleagues understand \nthese facts and not gut these critical programs because they are \nextremely important. We do not need to continue to fund tax breaks and \ngiveaways to corporations and the well-connected while so many people \nare still living below the poverty line.\n  Stealing aid to the poor and handing more to the rich is really \nshameful and utterly unacceptable. We need to come together to really \nbegin to recognize that we have got to lift people out of poverty and \ncreate a level playing field so that everyone can have the opportunity \nto live the American Dream. Cuts to these programs not only cost\n\n[[Page H9191]]\n\nour government more money--the taxpayers, in the long run--but it is \nreally morally wrong to cut these programs.\n  Now, as a former food stamp recipient myself and public assistance \nrecipient, I know firsthand just how important these safety net \nprograms are. I would not be here today if it were not for that \nlifeline, that bridge over troubled waters, that these types of \nprograms extended to me when I was a single mother, on welfare, raising \ntwo amazing sons, trying to get my life together so that I could move \non and take care of my family and live the American Dream.\n  Believe me, I know. No one wants to be on food stamps. No one. \nEveryone wants a good-paying job that allows them to provide for their \nfamily and contribute to society. They want to take care of their kids. \nThere are bumps in the road, yes, and now the economy has turned around \nfor many, but not for all.\n  That bridge over troubled waters is needed now more than ever. I hope \nthat, in the negotiations in this omnibus bill, we are going to make \nsure we remember these people and not raid the programs that keep \npeople out of poverty and provide a safety net. As Mr. Hoyer said, \nlet's do no harm in this bill and let's help people move into the \nmiddle class.\n  We must recommit ourselves to combating poverty and inequality once \nand for all. It really is a disgrace when you look at these charts, \nwhen you see the percentage of people living below the poverty line, \nand this is in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world.\n  It is a challenge to all communities. Communities of color, of \ncourse, are disproportionately impacted and affected, but American \nIndians, Alaska Natives, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, \nAsian Pacific Islanders, Whites living below the poverty line in \nAppalachia and rural America. There are people living in poverty all \nover the country.\n  I come from California. Close to 17 percent of the population of \nCalifornia, mind you, is living in poverty. That is almost 2 percentage \npoints higher than the national average, and that is in California.\n  While many people believe that poverty only touches cities and urban \ncommunities, as our whip indicated, our rural communities continue to \nbe plagued with persistent poverty while lacking many of the resources \nfound in cities, such as public transit, food banks, and access to \ncritical workforce training.\n  According to the United States Census Bureau, 85 percent of our \nNation's persistent poverty counties, defined as 20 percent or more of \na population living in poverty, are in rural America.\n  Mr. Clyburn, our Democratic Assistant Leader, has laid out a formula \nfor years--10, 20, 30--which would direct and target Federal resources \nto these counties and to these areas that would lift people out of \npoverty. We need to really understand where people are and make sure \nthat our tax dollars go to those communities to lift people out of \npoverty.\n  More than one-third of rural Americans and one in four rural children \nlive in poverty in 2015. These statistics are appalling. Poverty \ntouches our population that really needs help the most, including our \nchildren and our seniors.\n  In 2015, more than 6 million seniors--now, that is 15 percent of all \npeople over 65 years of age--are living in poverty. Even worse, while \nchildren make up just 23 percent of the population in the United \nStates, they account for one-third of all Americans living in poverty. \nThat is one in five kids. That is just plain wrong.\n  I would like to inquire, Mr. Speaker. How much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 15 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. LEE. I would like to in just a minute yield to my colleague from \nFlorida (Ms. Graham), who would like to take the floor and talk about \npoverty in her own community. She has been such a tremendous voice on \neliminating poverty and working to lift those who live below the \npoverty line out of poverty.\n  We know that families around the country living on the minimum wage \nhave to make choices each and every day. She knows that. She is here to \nspeak to that. I really appreciate her presence tonight on the floor.\n  I yield now to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Graham).\n  Ms. GRAHAM. Congresswoman Lee, I really appreciate you inviting me \nand allowing me the opportunity to speak tonight on this very important \nsubject.\n  I am incredibly grateful for the work you are doing to highlight this \nissue and end poverty in America. Thank you on behalf of my district \nand all the districts across the country.\n  Twelve of the 14 counties I represent are rural counties that face \nmany unique challenges, like access to social services, access to \nquality education, and access to health care. All of these issues are \ncomplicated by a cycle of poverty. This is especially prevalent in \nareas like Gadsden County, where more than 26 percent of the population \nlive in poverty.\n  It is unacceptable for one in every four Americans to live in poverty \nin any part of our country. We must do more to help rural families \nbreak the cycle of poverty and move into the middle class.\n  One program that is successfully working to do this is the United \nStates Department of Agriculture's StrikeForce Initiative for Rural \nGrowth and Opportunity. Since its inception in 2010, StrikeForce teams \nhave collaborated with more than 500 community partners and public \nentities across 20 States to bring targeted assistance to rural areas \nexperiencing chronic poverty.\n  StrikeForce efforts have helped direct over $16 billion in \ninvestments to create jobs, build homes, feed kids, assist farmers, and \nconserve natural resources in the country's most economically \nchallenged areas.\n  As the USDA considers expanding StrikeForce into more States, I urge \nthem to bring this program to Florida, especially to north Florida and \nGadsden County. Farmers in rural communities are the backbone of our \nState, and StrikeForce will help develop our economy, create jobs, and \nfight rural poverty.\n  Again, thank you, Congresswoman Lee, for bringing attention to this \nimportant issue. I look forward to working with you to end poverty \nacross our country.\n  Ms. LEE. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida for that very \nimportant statement and for once again raising the issue of rural \npoverty and the StrikeForce and the fact that we know how to eliminate \npoverty.\n  We just need the political will to do that. I know your constituents \nare very proud of you, and you are waging a noble fight each and every \nday on their behalf. Thank you for being here this evening.\n  There are a couple more statistics which I would like to discuss for \njust a few minutes. That is the issue of raising the minimum wage. We \nknow that raising the minimum wage is not only good for our hardworking \nfamilies, but it also makes economic sense, too.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  According to the Economic Policy Institute, raising the minimum wage \nto $12 an hour by 2020 would lift more than 35 million Americans out of \npoverty--that is just to $12 an hour. But in many parts of the country, \neven $12 is not sufficient. We are mounting campaigns around the \ncountry for $15 an hour. In some communities and States, you can barely \nget by on $15 an hour, but raising it to $12 is a step forward. Just \nraising the minimum wage is a step forward.\n  So many poor people are working. They are part of the working poor. \nThey are working two jobs, and they still have to rely on SNAP \nbenefits, Medicaid, and Section 8 housing.\n  People who work should not be poor, and so we have got to have a \nliving wage. We have got to raise the minimum wage and get to a living \nwage so that everyone in our country can live the American Dream, as we \ncontinue to say, and so that opportunity can be provided for everyone.\n  Some people are working two jobs and barely can make it with children \nbecause their wages are stagnant and they are just too low to be able \nto survive in this American society. So raising the minimum wage to a \nliving wage is a critical strategy. It is a critical policy that this \nbody should embrace and pass.\n  I yield to my colleague from Georgia Congressman Johnson, who has \nbeen a\n\n[[Page H9192]]\n\nsteady voice on so many issues since he has been here in Congress, \nespecially on behalf of the most vulnerable in our society: the poor \nand the working poor. His voice and his work has certainly been a major \ncontributor in terms of our task force growing to over 100 members. \nThank you again for being a member of the task force and for what you \ndo each and every day.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and my privilege \nto serve alongside you, Congresswoman, with all of the bigness of your \nheart and the care that you have for people, particularly those who are \non their way up. You don't have anything against those who are already \nin place and doing well, but your heart is constantly on display toward \nthose who are less fortunate. I am just privileged and honored to join \nyou in that quest.\n  Today has been a great day. This morning, we celebrated the 150th \nanniversary of the passage of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in \nAmerica. And to think back 150 years and look at the 100 years it took \nfrom that point to get to the point where we could pass a Voting Rights \nAct here in America, and then from that 50-year point up to today to be \naddressed by an African American President of the United States shows \nwhat kind of values we have in this country, what kind of opportunities \nwe have in this country.\n  And so I am just filled with great tidings during this holiday \nseason; however, I am not carried off by the winds of prosperity that \nmay have come to some of us while to others the winds of prosperity \nhave passed us by for various reasons, despite all of the progress that \nwe have made as a people.\n  As it stands now, Congresswoman, it is not a Black or White thing; it \nis a people thing. We have more Caucasian Americans living in poverty \nthan we have African Americans. So poverty is not a discriminator when \nit comes to national origin, when it comes to race, or when it comes to \nsex.\n  The fact is we have more women living in poverty and we have more \nchildren living in poverty. There is nothing to be joyful about that. \nWe have more elderly people falling into poverty today.\n  My heart cries out for Caucasian Americans between the ages of 45 and \n60 who, studies show, are meeting an early and untimely death at their \nown hands--suicide. Also, alcoholism and drug abuse are ravaging that \nparticular demographic, as well as liver disease and other chronic \nailments.\n  It all, I would posit, stems from the sense of hopelessness that \npervades the people at this particular time. We see all of the \nprosperity. We see the prosperity of the few, the top 1 percent. You \ncan look at the top 10 percent and see the concentration of wealth in \nthis country. You see it, you watch the TV, and you aspire for all of \nthe goods that are displayed to you on TV, but yet there is a sense of \nhopelessness about you being able to achieve that, despite the fact \nthat you are working two and three jobs and still qualify for food \nstamps and other social services.\n  We are realizing that, despite the hard work and the effort, the \nplaying field is not level and the game is skewed in favor of the few \non top at the expense of the masses on the bottom, and so something is \nwrong with that picture. That is an imbalance that we need to correct. \nSo that is why I am so happy to work on the Out of Poverty Caucus.\n  Some say, ``Why try? It can never be done''; but I am one of those \nwho say that, if we don't try, it won't be done. If we try, it can make \na difference.\n  I think that with the proper people in place to make the policy \ndecisions that we make here in Congress, there is so much that we can \ndo to relieve poverty in this country and to offer opportunity for \npeople who only want to work hard and play by the rules. They long for \nthe day to return when they can look at their children and their \ngrandchildren and rest assured knowing that the opportunities for them \nwill be at least, if not greater than, those that existed for \nthemselves.\n  And so our job is to make things better on the ground for people. Our \nmission is to help those who need help. There are always going to be \nsome people who need it, and there is nothing wrong with helping \nsomebody who needs help. In fact, that is what living is all about: \nserving your fellow man. That is why I am here. I know that is why you \nare here, and I am just happy to serve with you.\n  I would add that it has been 51 years since 1964 when President \nLyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty, an ambitious set of \ninitiatives to increase access to education, spur job growth, and \nimprove nutrition and health to our poorest Americans. Fifty-one years \nlater, it is estimated that up to 45 million Americans live in poverty. \nIn the greatest Nation on Earth, there are 45 million starving \nchildren, impoverished seniors, and families that struggle every day to \nobtain the bare necessities to survive.\n  I know how it feels because, for 1 week, I tried to exist on the food \nstamp challenge with you, Congresswoman, and that was tough. I got off \nof it after, I think, about 5 days. To try to exist on what we give the \naverage food stamp recipient is quite tough.\n  In Georgia, 25 percent of the people who are 50 or older and whose \nincome level is less than $22,000 a year struggle with hunger. In my \ndistrict, that is an important issue, because in DeKalb County, 10 \npercent of the people live below the poverty line, and the majority of \nthose are children. In Rockdale County, it is 13 percent.\n  Ms. LEE. I thank the gentleman for his message of hope tonight and \nfor reminding us of the fact that poverty does take its toll on the \nmental health and well-being of the human spirit.\n  I want to thank all of the Members who participated. I hope we can \nmove in a bipartisan fashion to address some of the major, major issues \nthat this body knows that it can address if it so chooses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to \noffer remarks on poverty and income inequality in America in light of \nour recent budget discussions. In the world's most rich and powerful \nnation, more than 46 million Americans live in poverty. In Texas, 18 \npercent of residents live in poverty and 25 percent of children under \n18 live in poverty. In Dallas, TX, the number of low-income people rose \n41 percent between 2000 and 2012.\n  These numbers are staggering in a nation, state, and city with such \nwealth. Congress can and must do more to create opportunity for people \nwho live in poverty. Passing a strong federal budget with anti-poverty \nprograms, creating educational opportunities for students who come from \nlow-income families, ensuring children and families have adequate food, \nadvocating for a higher minimum wage, and keeping our federal health \nprograms strong are just a few examples of the ways Congress can help \nlift these individuals and families out of poverty.\n  We know that these programs work. The Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP) kept almost 5 million Americans, including \n2.2 million children, out of poverty last year. Medical kept almost 3 \nmillion people out of poverty last year and that number continues to \nincrease as more states expand Medicaid. The Earned Income Tax Credit \n(EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC) helped to lift 10 million \nAmericans, including 5 million children, out of poverty last year.\n  Anti-poverty programs not only help families rise above and stay out \nof poverty, they keep families contributing to the economy on a daily \nbasis. Rather than keeping low-income Dallasites, Texans, and Americans \non a tightrope where they are one medical emergency, job loss, or large \ncar expense away from dipping into poverty, we must bolster our \nresources. During the very year that we celebrated the 50th anniversary \nof several War on Poverty programs enacted by President Johnson, we \nmust make it easier and not more difficult for working families in this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9192-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 381\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia (during the Special Order of Ms. Lee).

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House\n\n[[Page H9193]]\n\nSubcommittee on Conservation and Forestry, I am pleased to open this \nSpecial Order to discuss forest management and wildfires.\n  Over the course of this year, many Western States, including Alaska, \nhave gone through a catastrophic wildfire season, with more than 9 \nmillion acres burned to date. This is a continuation of an \nunsustainable trend where the average number of acres burned each year \nhas doubled since the 1990s. To address this, government spending on \nwildfire suppression has also doubled; yet the total amount of spending \non forestry activities has remained the same.\n  Because the cost of wildfire suppression efforts has continued to \nclimb over the past 15 years, the U.S. Forest Service has repeatedly \nhad to transfer money from its nonfire programs to firefighting \nefforts. In fact, this year alone, more than 50 percent of the Forest \nService budget went toward wildfire suppression, taking funding away \nfrom programs and activities that promote forest health and reduction \nof underbrush, wood waste, and dead trees, which help these wildfires \nspread.\n  Fire transfers also undermine timber harvesting, which is critical \nfor the health of the forests as well as our rural communities and \ncounties.\n  In contrast to this 50 percent, only 20 years ago, the Forest Service \nwas only spending as little as 13 percent, or one-sixth, of its budget \non fire-related activities. However, this is not simply a question of \nallocating more money for fire suppression. The real solution to this \nproblem is how we maintain our forests.\n  I am pleased to be joined tonight by bipartisan members of the \nConservation and Forestry Subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee.\n  I am pleased to yield to the ranking member of that committee, \nMichelle Lujan Grisham.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Thompson, I appreciate \nthis Special Order on wildfires and forest management, and I really \nappreciate your leadership on the House Agriculture Committee as \nchairman of our Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.\n  Most recently, the subcommittee held a hearing on the 2015 wildfire \nseason and long-term fire trends, a much-needed hearing recognizing the \nconcerns and urgent needs of many of our Members who watched their \ndistricts and States burn to unprecedented levels this year.\n  What is abundantly clear from the testimony we heard, especially that \nof Forest Service Chief Tidwell, was how crippling the current wildfire \nbudget system is to the agency and how, frankly, it prevents the Forest \nService from carrying out its congressionally mandated mission.\n  The current process for funding wildfire suppression is inefficient \nand wastes taxpayer dollars. Once the Forest Service exhausts their \nwildfire suppression budget, the agency is then forced to transfer \nfunds from nonfire programs, which are often needed to prevent fires, \nin order to support the immediate, emergency needs of fire suppression.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  In the last fiscal year, FY15, the Forest Service spent $700 million \nmore than what Congress initially appropriated.\n  Since 2004, the Forest Service has needed eight supplemental \nappropriations. This is now the norm, not the exception.\n  This year's wildfire season devastated much of the Western United \nStates. The Forest Service spent $1.7 billion fighting these fires. \nMore than 9 million acres were burned, thousands of homes and other \ninfrastructures were lost, and 13 firefighters lost their lives in the \nline of duty.\n  While I am thankful New Mexico avoided any big fires this year, I \nknow firsthand how devastating fires can be. For 3 years in a row, New \nMexico endured the biggest fires the State has ever seen. The \nWhitewater-Baldy Complex, Las Conchas, and the Gila fires devastated \nour land, our resources and our communities.\n  These fires are natural disasters that require emergency response and \nrecovery and should, frankly, be funded the same way as hurricanes, \nfloods and tornados. Now, it is clear to me that Congress needs to \nurgently fix this funding problem before more communities are destroyed \nand lives are lost.\n  In addition to the ``fire borrowing'' issue, Congress also has to \naddress the rising 10-year suppression cost average for wildfires. \nRising wildfire costs means that less funding is going to nonfire \nForest Service employees and programs each year. Because of this, the \nForest Service now has fewer resources for recreation, research and \ndevelopment, and road maintenance.\n  There are also fewer resources to carry out activities and projects \nthat many say we need more of, such as NEPA analysis, timber contracts, \ntimber salvage, controlled burns, and other Forest Service management \nactivities.\n  Lack of resources often means that these projects get delayed or \ncanceled. And we aren't just talking about Forest Service projects; \nthey are projects in each of our districts that are developed by our \nown constituents and partners within each of these communities.\n  Now, I understand that the broken wildfire budget and rising costs \nare only part of the problem. Wildfires are burning bigger and more \nintense than ever before.\n  Climate change is causing more drought, higher temperatures, bringing \nnew diseases and pests to new areas, and changing the vegetation on the \nground. Our forests are not the same forests that they were 50 years \nago, or even 20 years ago.\n  Climate change is undoubtedly changing our forest dynamics, and we \nmust make our forests more resilient.\n  Fixing the broken wildfire budgeting process is the most effective \nthing Congress can do to begin to address the devastating wildfires \nthat are plaguing this country.\n  I also agree that we need more management work done on the ground, so \nlet's work together to ensure that the Forest Service has sufficient \nresources to do their work.\n  I understand that there have been talks on both the House and Senate \nside about including a budget fix in the upcoming omnibus, but that a \ndeal remains elusive because some parties are unwilling to address the \nbudget caps in order for wildfires to get treated as exactly what they \nare, as natural disasters. This would treat wildfire natural disasters \njust like every other natural disaster in this country.\n  We out west have helped fund hurricanes, tornados and flooding in the \nMidwest and in the eastern parts of the country. We should be doing the \nsame for our natural disasters out west.\n  I urge Speaker Ryan, and Chairman Price of the Budget Committee, to \nrecognize this simple, yet important distinction.\n  House leadership, Mr. Thompson, and others, I know, we can sit down \nand we can come to an agreement to fix the broken budget process and \naddress some of the management needs. I stand ready at any moment to \nhave these conversations and find a path forward.\n  I thank the chairman very much.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentlewoman, who is a great \nranking member on the subcommittee, for all of her work and for her \ncomments and words this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, having served on the subcommittee with the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Schrader), he is a great advocate for forest products, \nfor healthy forests, for economically healthy rural communities. We \nshare that passion. I am just very thankful that he was able to, in a \nvery busy schedule, make time this evening to be part of this Special \nOrder.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader).\n  Mr. SCHRADER. I thank the chairman. I want to applaud you and the \nranking member for the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee for \nhaving this colloquy here tonight.\n  I think it is really important for folks to understand the severity \nof the issue that is before us here. As my western colleague pointed \nout a moment ago, these wildfires are alive and well, unfortunately, \nand absolutely devastating, devastating at a level that we had never \nseen or expected before.\n  These disasters, not just back east with Sandy and Katrina, but the \nwildfires that we see in New Mexico and in my home State of Oregon and \nneighboring State of Washington this summer, are absolutely \ncatastrophic, and way above and beyond what we have seen in past \ndecades.\n  The firefighting situation has become untenable. The height of \nridiculousness\n\n[[Page H9194]]\n\nis to acknowledge the fact that firefighting costs have doubled over \nthe last 15 years, on a regular basis, 8 out of 10 years, as was \npointed out a moment ago, and not do anything about it.\n  The wildfires don't go away when we put our heads in the sand. They \ncontinue to devastate.\n  I would like to point out three, maybe four things I think are really \nimportant. We are talking about an omnibus bill here that everyone is \narguing over. There are certain policy riders, I submit, that have \nnothing to do with the budget.\n  There is some discussion about a fire funding fix, though, to get \nafter this budgetary disaster that we have, now every year. Why not \nbudget up front for this so that the resources can be allocated \nimmediately?\n  Secondly, not devastate the Forest Service budget, because if you \ntake it out of the Forest Service budget, even temporarily, then the \nForest Service can't do its land management work, which gets rid of the \nhazardous fuel, gets rid of the diseased trees, takes care of the pests \nto prevent the next wave of forest fires.\n  This is very simple, folks. This is very simple.\n  The funding fix also talks about working in a collaborative way to \nbuild the collaborative relationships that have eluded us so far for \nour forestry problems.\n  The fix talks about working collaboratively on the NEPA process with \nfolks, make sure it is done correctly, but in a way that the Forest \nService can manage and get it done quickly.\n  It talks about set-asides for small areas that could be categorically \nexcluded where there is already collaborative work being done on the \nurban-rural interface and, actually, some areas to promote wildlife \nhabitat.\n  I mean, this is the type of thing that actually gets at what both the \nenvironmental community and the forest community need to have.\n\n  One last big point I think that gets ignored a lot in this discussion \nis the economic loss that occurs as a result of these forest fires. We \ncould have a lot more money for tax resources if we got after these \nfires early on.\n  Right now, I have timber communities in my State where over 50 \npercent of the land is Federal forest lands that go up in smoke, that \nthey could otherwise be harvesting or reducing that fuel load by \nthinning, to promote jobs, economic development, and tax revenues.\n  I think a small investment in this budget to offset larger costs \nlater on, and adequately fight these fires, to protect rural America, \nis critical.\n  Right now, rural America is not getting its fair share. There is a \nlot of talk about 9/11 and making sure our first responders get the \nhealth care that they need and deserve for stepping in in a disaster \nsituation in New York City.\n  Where is the stepping in to help my firefighters out west? These men \nand women go into toxic situations, life-threatening situations, and \nthey get no respect just because we are out west.\n  As the ranking member pointed out, and the chairman pointed out, \nthese are devastating disasters, just as bad as tornados, just as bad \nas hurricanes. Where is the fairness to my western colleagues in \ngetting their issue taken care of?\n  This devastates the communities. These rural communities are poor \nalready. With these fires rampaging across the landscape, they get \npoorer quicker.\n  There is no Intel or Microsoft setting up in the middle of nowhere in \nthe rural parts of my State and my district. They depend on natural \nresources, the good use of natural resources, resources that can be \nused for carbon sequestration by not having these fires.\n  I find it amazing that, in a budgetary discussion, we are trying to \nsave money, not just in the short term, but in the long term, that we \nare having trouble getting this fire funding fix that is bipartisan. \nEven the White House is behind it.\n  We have an opportunity to get this done for a small amount of money \nthat will be paid back over the next few years in spades. I think it is \na shame that we can't get this thing done just instantaneous.\n  I hope the discussion tonight opens the eyes of some folks about the \ndiscrimination that is going on against rural America, particularly out \nwest.\n  And I really, really, want to thank the ranking member and the \nchairman, who I have worked with closely over the years, a true friend, \na friend of rural and forested America, for bringing this to our \nattention. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for lending your \npassion and your knowledge to this important debate tonight. And I \nshare your hope, that we raise the level of awareness.\n  We are talking a lot about western forests, but I have to tell you, \nhaving an eastern forest, I represent the Fifth District of \nPennsylvania; when these large wildfires occur out west, there is a \nlarge sucking sound of resources, both personnel and money, being taken \nout of our eastern forests.\n  These are monies that are used to make our forests healthy. These are \nmonies that are used to do timber marketing, marketing of timber and \ntimber sales so that we can generate revenue to our countries, our \nschool districts. So these monies really are taken away from active \nmanagement, and active management is the key in helping cut down on the \namount of wildfires in our forest.\n  This involves mechanical thinning, hazardous fuel reduction projects \nand, of course, a sustainable amount of timber harvesting per the \nforced Allowable Sale Quantity, or ASQ.\n  Now these various activities are essential in order to help ensure \nthat the forest doesn't become an overgrown tinderbox. Areas that \naren't properly maintained not only become tinderbox, as a risk of \nwildfires, but also for invasive species outbreaks.\n  I don't know of anyone in Congress that has more expertise on this \nthan our next speaker. He is a professional forester. He brings \ntremendous education and experience to Washington. We are real proud to \nhave him as a part of our team working on this issue, really leading on \nthis issue.\n  Our next speaker is actually the author of H.R. 2647, which has been \npassed by the House of Representatives, the Resilient Federal Forest \nAct of 2015, so I am honored to yield to the gentleman from Arkansas \n(Mr. Westerman).\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, \nand also thank him for his leadership on this issue, a very important \nissue, and one that he has a good grasp of that I wish the rest of our \nFederal Government could get a good grasp of.\n  I also would like to thank the ranking member for her remarks, and \nthe gentleman from Oregon, for his remarks.\n  We do have a national treasure in our forests. The U.S. Forest \nService manages over 193 million acres of forests and grasslands from \nMaine to Alaska.\n  The Forest Service was formed by President Teddy Roosevelt and his \nfriend, Gifford Pinchot, who was the first Chief of the Forest Service. \nThese men were true conservationists and naturalists. They understood \nthe science of the forest. They understood the value of the forest, and \nthey understood its contribution to society, so they worked to conserve \nthat for future generations.\n  Roosevelt and Pinchot hold a special place in my heart. I grew up by \nthe forests that were established by Roosevelt, and I studied at the \nYale School of Forestry that was founded by Pinchot.\n  Teddy Roosevelt once said about our natural resources, he said that \nour Nation behaves well if it treats its natural resources as assets, \nwhich it must turn over to the next generation, increased and not \nimpaired in value.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are not behaving well as a Nation. We are decreasing \nand impairing the value of our forests.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Our forests are not just an asset; they are a treasure, a treasure \nthat provides beauty, makes clean air, purifies our water, provides \nwildlife habitat, and a variety of recreational activities and \nopportunities. Our forests store carbon and provide many of the \nproducts that we live in, that we learn from, and that we use to \nsurvive every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a Republican failure, and it is not a \nDemocratic failure. It is a congressional and an agency failure that we \nhave the power to correct.\n  Wildfires continue to sweep across the country. They are burning \nhotter\n\n[[Page H9195]]\n\nand faster than in years past. More than 9 million acres of Federal \nland burned this year alone. Costs to fight fires and the number of \nfires burning grows every year.\n  As has been mentioned so many times before, the Forest Service's \nbiggest expense is firefighting. The costs of it have ballooned over \nthe years. It is not just the cost of fighting fires, as the gentleman \nfrom Oregon said, that is the cost. We are destroying a valuable asset: \n9 million acres of Federal land and timber that goes up in smoke. These \nproducts could be used. They have value to them. We are not only \nspending the money to fight the fires; we are losing valuable assets \nevery year.\n  This year, Mr. Speaker, Congress had to appropriate an extra $700 \nmillion to land management agencies to cover the cost of fire \nborrowing. The Forest Service is becoming a firefighting agency, unable \nto meet its mission of ``caring for the land and serving people.''\n  Fire borrowing is not the only problem, and I submit that it is \nactually not even the problem. It is the symptom of a problem. It is \nthe result of our current management choice that each year is becoming \nless and less management. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of \nchoosing not to manage.\n  Forests are dynamic, living organisms. They don't pay attention to \nwhat we say here in Washington, DC, or what we write in laws. The only \nthing forests know is to grow and fill their growing space and to \nabsorb the sunlight. They fill the growing space, and they quit \ngrowing. Then they become weakened. They are subject to insect and \ndisease attack. They die. We get debris on the forest floor. Lightning \nstrikes, and the forest burns. If we choose not to manage the forests, \nthen nature continues to manage. We don't have that luxury of saying \nthat we are just not going to manage the forest.\n  Our land management policies have changed for the worse simply and \nmainly because we have not been able to manage. Red tape and lawsuits \nare harming our landscapes. Forests are overgrown, and they are \nunhealthy.\n  Healthy forests will lead to smaller fires that can be contained. A \nhealthy forest puts less carbon in the atmosphere, and, in fact, it \nsequesters more carbon through new tree growth and reforestation. \nSimply by the biological growth curve, younger organisms grow faster so \nthey are pulling more carbon out of the atmosphere. They are storing it \nin their trunks, in their leaves, and in their roots.\n  The good news is the House has been behaving well. The House produced \nand passed a good piece of legislation in H.R. 2647, the Resilient \nFederal Forests Act. Now, this isn't the end-all to fix the problems \nwith our forests, but it is a great first step.\n  H.R. 2647 simultaneously ends fire borrowing in a fiscally \nresponsible manner, but it also gives the Forest Service the tools it \nneeds to create healthy forests. Healthy forests are a winning \nsituation. Everybody wins with a healthy forest. Wildlife wins, and \nsports and outdoor recreation enthusiasts win. We all win with cleaner \nair, and we all win with cleaner water. Our rural communities win with \nan economic benefit. There is not a downside to having a healthy \nforest. It is good for America to have healthy forests.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to put the policy in place so that we \ncan have healthy forests. It is time for the Senate to behave. It is \ntime for the Senate to act on H.R. 2647 so we can end fire borrowing \nand manage our forests.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. I thank you for \nyour leadership and bringing your expertise to Washington. It is great \nto serve with you, and I appreciate all the leadership that you are \nshowing, not just on this issue but so many different issues that are \ngood not just for the folks of Arkansas, but for the entire Nation. So \nthank you so much for being part of this Special Order tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, a healthy forest is so incredibly important because a \nhealthy forest represents, also, wealthy communities. Our rural \ncommunities are so dependent on the active, proper management of our \nnational forests.\n  These national forests didn't always exist. At one time, our \npredecessors--some going back 100 years or more--came to the table with \nthe local communities, and they made a commitment that for the good of \nthe Nation they would create national forests.\n  Now, let's be clear. National forests are not national parks. They \nare completely different. National forests are not managed by the \nDepartment of the Interior and the National Park Service. National \nforests are managed by the Department of Agriculture, because they were \nset aside and established so that our Nation would always have an \nabundant, ready supply of timber. Timber was one of the initial \nindustries that we had. It was so important to the past of our country, \nbut important to the future of our country as well.\n  As Mr. Westerman really articulated well, when you have a healthy \nforest, you have carbon sinks and you have filters. A lot of our \nwatersheds originate in our national forests, so it is good for clean \nwater if they are properly managed. It is good for clean air, and it is \ngood for the economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, from time to time, I spend some time as a lay pastor and \nI will fill the pulpit. When I am talking to the churches, I talk about \nhow a healthy church is like a healthy forest. If I go into a church \nand I see that everyone sitting in the pews has my hairline, a little \nbit of salt on the side here with gray hair, that is not a healthy \nchurch. It is just kind of one generation. Well, forests are the same \nway. If you want a healthy church, you need multiple generations in the \npews. If you want a healthy forest, you need multiple generations of \nforest because it is good for the wildlife, it is good for the birds, \nand it is good for the mammals, because they need different types of \nforests at different points in their maturity in order to support that \nwildlife.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the things that leads to putting pressure on \ncertain species is, when we stop harvesting trees, we stop active \nmanagement, because we know that almost every species, at different \ntimes in their life, need that kind of open area. They need time in \nyoung forest growth right through to more mature forest growth. Without \nthat, these species can't be supported.\n  So there are all kinds of reasons, let alone the economic health of \nour rural communities. That was a promise that was made by our \npredecessors when they took this land out of the private sector and put \nit into the public sector. It was done with a promise that they would \nalways do active management in such a way to generate the revenue to be \nable to backfill for those property taxes that would have been lost.\n\n  We have really failed at that as a nation. Our rural communities in \nand around our national forests are so challenged. Don't get me wrong. \nI think we have great people that are working for the Forest Service. I \nspend a lot of time with them. They are dedicated professionals.\n  I think the Chief of the Forest Service, Tom Tidwell, is an \noutstanding individual, has strong character. I like the Chief because \nhis first job in the Forest Service was when he was going to college \nand he worked summers as a firefighter. I am an old firefighter. He has \ndone all the jobs. He knows what it is to manage an active forest.\n  We have a lot of pressures, though, that the bureaucracy has placed \non him. We have a lot of external pressures with special interest \ngroups who claim they are trying to save the forests. But the end \nresult of their actions where they limit, they sue, and they prevent \nforest plans from being implemented and prevent timber management from \noccurring, they are actually killing the forests.\n  Forests are living entities. If they are not actively managed, they \nwill get sick and they will die. When they do, they become emitters of \ncarbon. When a forest is healthy, it actually absorbs carbon. It is a \ncarbon sink, as I said before.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me talk about some of the statistics that show that \nmuch of our national forest system is unhealthy. In fact, the Forest \nService has identified up to one-quarter of nearly 200 million acres of \nnational forest land as a wildfire risk. We have seen a dramatic \nreduction, Mr. Speaker, of the harvest from our national forests from \nnearly 13 billion board feet in the 1980s to roughly 3 million board \nfeet in past years.\n  Let me put that into perspective and share some statistics on that. \nLet's go\n\n[[Page H9196]]\n\nback to 1995. In 1995, Mr. Speaker, one-sixth of the Forest Service \nbudget was used for wildfire management and mitigation. It was \nreasonable. At that point, when we were using one-sixth of the Forest \nService budget, we were harvesting in 1995 3.8 billion board feet.\n  Let's fast-forward to 2015. Now, the numbers I am going to share with \nyou are from August of 2015. I readily admit I don't have the past \ncouple months in this, but at this point, the Forest Service is \nspending 50 percent of its budget on fighting wildfires--50 percent.\n  Think about 50 percent of your household, 50 percent of your family's \nbudget, your business, or a local school. To take 50 percent of your \nbudget just for this type of crisis management doesn't work. It just \ndoesn't work.\n  At the same time, Mr. Speaker, we have only projected to harvest, at \nthat point, 2.4 billion board feet. It is a big part of the lack of \nactive management. We need to provide the Forest Service tools to be \nable to help them do their jobs. The high-water mark was back in 1987 \nwhen we had 12.7 billion board feet harvested. That is a variance from \nthis year of 10.3 billion board feet.\n  We are constantly talking about the economic crisis that we are in \nhere, and we are. We have got a debt that has been out of control. I am \nvery proud to be a part of a Republican-led Congress that, for a number \nof years, on the discretionary side, we have actually reduced our \nspending, and we are starting to get our arms wrapped around mandatory \nspending. So we are doing our job.\n  But there is a need for more resources, and we recognize that. There \nis a need for more revenue. We are literally burning that revenue up in \nour national forests each and every year, dramatically. How much \nrevenue? I would have to say that, if you take, every year, 10.3 \nbillion board feet, if that is the amount that we could get our annual \nharvesting to, you have to ask yourself: How much more healthy would \nthe forest be?\n  If the forest is healthy, Mr. Speaker, so many fewer wildfires would \noccur at just an incredible cost, including the loss of lives. We have \nlost a tremendous number of American heroes, our firefighters from both \nthe U.S. Forest Service but also volunteer firefighters like myself. \nPerhaps some professional firefighters have lost their lives because of \nthe incident. It is just the crisis that we have in wildfires.\n  If we would increase our harvesting, we would increase the health of \nthe forest, and we could reduce wildfires and that risk. We would also \nincrease revenue. I am not prepared to tell you what the average value \nof a board foot in timber harvest off our national forests is. I know \nthat varies greatly.\n  Mr. Speaker, I happen to represent the Allegheny National Forest. I \nam proud to say that it is actually the most profitable national forest \nin the country. It is kind of puny compared to my colleagues out west. \nWe are about 513,000 acres, but we have got the world's best hardwood \ncherry. Our hardwoods are what increase the value. I know that is a \nwide variance on what the value of 1 board foot in 2015 of timber \nharvested in our national forests is. But whatever that number is, \nmultiply it by $10.3 billion, and that is a lot of revenue that is \nowned by the taxpayers of this country--given the fact it is their \nnational forest--that we could be bringing in.\n  Then the prosperity, Mr. Speaker. If we could unleash and get timber \nin closer to that sustainable rate, what that would do for our school \ndistricts, our kids, our families, and the jobs that would be \nstimulated in the forest products industry. It would just have an \namazing impact, Mr. Speaker.\n  Now, as we examine these issues, Mr. Speaker, it becomes easier to \nsee how everything is corrected. Trees which should have been harvested \nyears ago have been allowed to become fuel for forest fires, leading to \nthe rise in the acreage burned that we have seen in recent years.\n  There are many prospective solutions to this problem, including the \nAgricultural Act of 2014, also known as the farm bill. I am very proud \nthat all the Members were involved with the farm bill. It was a great \nbipartisan bill that we did. It includes provisions to include improved \nforest management. So we have taken action. We have enacted into law \nsome tools for the Forest Service.\n  There is just more that we need to do, Mr. Speaker. Those tools \ninclude an expedited process in the planning for projects and the \nreauthorization programs, such as the stewardship contracting and the \nGood Neighbor Authority. These all improve forest health, timber sales, \nand restoration.\n  Now, the House passed the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, \nwhich Mr. Westerman very appropriately talked about, in July.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  The goal of this legislation was to provide the Forest Service with \ndirection and the tools to address the challenges of litigation. I have \nto tell you, Mr. Speaker, we have forest plans that are about active \ntimber management, but we have these outside groups that sue the \ngovernment because the government reimburses their costs, even when \nthey settle out of court.\n  That is not why the Equal Access to Justice Act was originally \nwritten; not for some group that is not a direct stakeholder in terms \nof having property that is in the forest or adjoined to the forest. But \nit is litigation, it is funding, no doubt about it, it is the process, \nit is basic timber harvesting, and essential active management. I will \ncome back to some of those in just a bit. I want to share some outcomes \nfrom the most recent hearing that we had with the Conservation and \nForestry Subcommittee.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this important piece of legislation. I \nbelieve that it should become law. It will have a major impact on \nreducing catastrophic wildfires across the Nation.\n  The district that I represent, Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict, is the home of the Allegheny National Forest, the only \nnational forest in the Commonwealth. It encompasses more than 513,000 \nacres across four counties, and for generations, it has formed the \neconomic bedrock of small communities in that region.\n  In some ways, the Allegheny is very different from our western \nforests--I have mentioned some of those--but it has many similar \nchallenges, including a lack of timbering, reduced county budgets, and \noutbreaks of invasive species.\n  Reforming the way we deal with wildfires and forestry management will \nhave a positive effect in forests and in rural communities, not just in \nthe Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania, but, quite frankly, \nacross the Nation.\n  I look forward to hearing more from my colleagues, and taking \nopportunities in the future to host more of these Special Orders, in \nlooking at ways so that we can confront the very real challenges in \nnational forest regions.\n  I wanted to share some of the outcomes from our most recent hearing \nthat we had on this issue back on October 8. We had some great speakers \ncome in, witnesses, that provided testimony from all over the country. \nI will just share with you, Mr. Speaker, some of the things that would \nbe helpful, things that we need to consider. I am going to start in the \ncategory of increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of forest \nmanagement that we have, starting with giving an opportunity for State \nprimacy.\n  This was an idea that came out from a rancher in Washington State. \nThe States tend to have less bureaucracy, they have less of a target on \ntheir back by these outside groups that are suing. So the State's \nsuccess at increasing active timber management and a higher level of \nforest health. But State primacy is something that was an idea that \ncame out that needs to, at least, have further consideration.\n  Expanding what we call categorical exemption from NEPA analysis. That \ndoesn't mean that we are not looking at the environmental impacts. That \ncouldn't be further from the truth. For where it makes sense, what we \nneed to do is provide a categorical exemption from a full-blown NEPA \nanalysis, but we need to do that more on a landscape perspective, so a \nlandscape management. We are talking large scale, 100,000 acres or \nmore, being able to more efficiently, being able to more effectively, \nmanage the forest.\n  We have provided some categorical exemption opportunities within the \nfarm bill to the Forest Service for regular maintenance activities, \nwhere they had to spend a tremendous\n\n[[Page H9197]]\n\namount of resources just to clear a power line or to do trail \nmaintenance, or replant after a forest fire, wildfire. Quite frankly, \ntheir sister agencies: the Bureau of Land Management and the Corps of \nEngineers, they didn't have to do that. So this is just kind of common \nsense.\n  We need to protect our active management funds. We can't be dipping \ninto the funds that we use to manage the forest. That is what happened. \nThat is what I referred to as that large sucking sound. It is not just \nresources. My forest supervisor, who does a great job, she was \ndetailed. She went out west for a period of time. She wasn't on our \nforest doing her job because of the need for her expertise in the west \nduring one of those wildfires this past year in the west. We need to \nprotect our active management funds.\n  There are some things that came out: a recommendation for larger air \ntankers to be able to deal with the size and the scale of the wildfires \nthat are out there. We need to, obviously, reduce this litigation. Out \nof 311 projects this past year, 16 wound up in the courts. That is a \nsignificant number. Quite frankly, it is not necessary. Unfortunately, \nit has become a fundraising scheme for the most part. It is not \ncontributing towards forest health. It, actually, is deteriorating our \nforest health. We have an increase in invasive species. We are burning \nup our forest at a record level.\n  When you burn forest, you ruin that water filter, you impact water \nquality, you impact as a carbon sink. So we need to reduce the \nlitigation and take steps to be able to do that.\n  We do need personnel, there is no doubt about it. We have 49 percent \nfewer foresters than just in 2010. It is our professional foresters, \nthe silviculturists, who are out--of knowing how to mark the timber, of \nknowing when to harvest the timber when it is at peak value. That is an \nasset owned by the American people. We shouldn't be waiting until that \ntree blows over, burns down, or is eaten by some type of bug, invasive \nspecie, until we harvest it. We should harvest it really at its peak \nvalue. That is demonstrating a fiduciary responsibility for the \nAmerican people with this asset.\n  And then certainly we need more collaborative work. Again, H.R. 2647 \nwould achieve that.\n  So that is more efficient, more effective forest management.\n  Let me look briefly at response. We do need to fund this \nappropriately. I am a supporter of a concept that would look at larger \nfires, more widespread. I don't know how we gauge that--by acreage or \ndollar value lost or dollars needed. Those really are natural \ndisasters. They are as every bit a natural disaster as an earthquake, a \nhurricane, or a tornado. Those larger fires should be dealt with as \nnatural disasters.\n  And then other fires on a smaller scale, underneath whatever that \nthreshold is set, then let's do that through regular order with the \nForest Service budget with what we appropriate. There is a definite \ndifference. That would be a recommendation. That was something that \ncame out of a discussion.\n  And then safe harbor for mutual aid. One rancher from Washington \ntalked about a Forest Service where there was a--I don't know if it was \na State or a private individual with a bulldozer--a CAT came up to the \nForest Service line. Two situations. One time they asked the Forest \nService person, who was working under the direction of somebody in the \nbureaucracy. They welcomed him in, and they saved a tremendous spread \nof that fire. And then another time where the Forest Service personnel \nsaid: No, we have to fill out the permits first. Well, you have got the \nwildlife burning, but we have got to fill out the permits, and we have \ngot to do the paperwork. I am not judging that Forest Service employee \nbecause they were probably doing whatever they were told to do, and \nthere was more catastrophic loss there. So some type of safe harbor \nthat allows better use of mutual aid.\n\n  I want to yield to a friend of mine because it kind of speaks to the \nefficiency and the effectiveness on the Equal Access to Justice Act. \nThis is the law that we kind of talked about that really has encouraged \nradical environmental groups to file lawsuits and stop forest plans \nfrom occurring.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) to speak on the \ntopic.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Look, we are here, and I am glad to hear what \nhas come out of the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee. I just \nwanted to talk about that because you mentioned the losses in \ntransparency on that open book. It does that. It has been something \nthat has passed through this House. We just passed it again last week. \nIt really just shines the light on this access issue and the Federal \ngovernment--what we end up paying sometimes for these groups to sue and \nwhat our departments are paying out.\n  What you are talking about is a healthy management of our forests, \nbut it is also a healthy management of our resources. We are setting \nforth what we need to do as priorities in Congress. As someone from \nnortheast Georgia, with a lot of forestry land--Chattahoochee National \nForest--this is something we can work together on. We are glad to be a \npart of that.\n  The support that you have done and the leadership that you have given \nis incredible, and we want to continue to thank you for that and be a \npart of it. That is just part of our transparency issue we have with \nthe Federal Government, and also these lawsuits that have been coming \nout, and we can do that together.\n  I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. I want to commend him for \nthe work that he is doing and the work of our forestries around the \ncountry.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I appreciate the gentleman's \nperspective on that.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act was a righteous piece of legislation \nwhen it was passed. But it was passed to be able to protect those who \nare kind of landowners, who were the big brother--the National Forest, \nor the Federal Government, was impinging on your private property \nrights.\n  We all know that most individuals don't have a whole lot of money to \nbe able to defend themselves. Unfortunately, the Federal Government has \nthe pockets of every taxpayer. It was never meant to be hijacked by the \nway it has been. I appreciate the leadership of the gentlewoman from \nWyoming (Mrs. Lummis), who has been a great leader, championing kind of \njust returning to the original intent of the Equal Access to Justice \nAct. I look forward to working with the gentleman on that.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Open book access is just a great thing, and I \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have one last category I want to cover here, and that \nis how we increase the markets, because you have to have a place to \nsell timber that is harvested. There are a number of things that we can \ndo.\n  Just quickly, we need to expand our trade. That is why I am so \npleased with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The trade ambassador and \nhis chief negotiators actually have eliminated basically all of the \ntariffs that really hindered our ability to export whether it was raw \ntimber or boards or pellets. It was just very difficult in the past. \nThis trade proposal, members of the subcommittee and members of the \nfull Agriculture Committee worked very closely with the trade \nambassador to make sure that that was one of our priorities that was \nachieved, and it looks like it has been achieved. I think that is going \nto increase markets. We need to do that with all of our trade \nagreements.\n  We need to expand the use of timber products within the green \nbuilding standards, LEED standards. It is an original renewable, but it \nwas excluded from those. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  We need to develop the lamination technology that has taken timber, \nand being able to use that really for skyscraper type construction very \nsuccessfully. The research is done by our U.S. Forest Services, as well \nas our land grant universities, such as my alma mater of Penn State. \nThere is great research being done, actually supported through the farm \nbill in terms of forest services, forest products.\n  We need to encourage and develop the woody biomass of biofuels, \ntaking that timber, that fiber, to use it for chemicals, to use it for \nfuel.\n  We need to prevent the loss of market infrastructure that results in \nno\n\n[[Page H9198]]\n\nbeds or low beds for timber sales. In some parts of our country, our \nsawmills have been decimated. As small businesses, we need to help \npeople with small businesses keep that foothold that we have and regain \nit.\n  Those are just a few of the things--all not my ideas. Those all came \nout of our hearing with the October 8 subcommittee that we had on \nwildfires.\n  I very much appreciate the bipartisan participation tonight by my \ncolleagues on this very important issue. I think we have done some \nreally good things with the farm bill to help our forest products \nindustry. Again, this truly is about the health of the forest. It is \nabout revenue for the country, but it is about the prosperity of rural \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to have this Special Order.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9198-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9198-H9201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SONGWRITER EQUITY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back on the \nfloor of the House. I am thrilled tonight to be surrounded with my \nfriends and colleagues, and to be part on championing a call that is \nclose to my heart, and should be for every Member of Congress. Because \nwe are dealing with songs and songwriters and the special place that \nthey have in American life, and really in the world.\n  The amazing thing is how the songs that come from the hearts of many \nfrom Nashville, where I have friends tonight, Rob and Lance and Lee \nThomas, and the rest, they are watching others across the country are \nsongwriters, who are very interested in what goes on here. Because, \namazingly enough, here in Washington, DC, as the tentacles spread out, \nyou come to find out that, even in songwriting, Washington has its grip \non it.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I just want to point out for those who may be watching--now, this is \na quote. This doesn't come from me. It comes from Kevin Kadish. You may \nknow Kevin. If you like to listen to a little bit of music, he happened \nto have a little, small hit with Meghan Trainor, ``All About That \nBase,'' and Miley Cyrus' ``Two More Lonely People.'' He made a comment. \nHe said that no one is trying to put Pandora or Spotify out of \nbusiness. We just want a fair market value for our blood, sweat, and \ntears.\n  This is something that, for me, is very special because, over the \nnext 30 minutes, you are going to hear about a million and a half \nsongwriters, publishers, and composers across the Nation and how the \ncurrent music licensing regime is causing them to be paid well below \nmarket value.\n  Now, as a conservative, one thing I believe is that the government \nhas a role--it has a limited constitutional role--especially when it \ncomes to the ultimate of the small businesses: the entrepreneurs. Those \nare some of our songwriters and composers. The Federal Government \nshould not have its thumb on the scale, and that is what we are seeing \ntonight. So you are going to hear about that as we go along. The \ngovernment's heavy hand in this industry needs to go.\n  We have got another issue here of the Songwriter Equity Act. We have \ngot some folks I want to have talk tonight; but I want to introduce \nthis, and they are all cosponsors of this act. It is H.R. 1283.\n  When I start talking about this tonight, for those watching, there \nare three ways songwriters get paid. I am going to make it very simple. \nThere are three ways they get paid: Two of which the government has its \nthumb on and--guess what?--one of which they don't. Does anybody want \nto take a guess? Raise your hand. Not my colleagues, you know this. \nWill anyone raise his hand really quickly? Which way is the fairest \nway? It is when they are able to negotiate on their own. That is the \nsync license.\n  So, with the Songwriter Equity Act, it removes the antiquated \nevidentiary standard; it adopts a fair rate standard for reproduction, \nor mechanical licenses. Why? To ensure that songwriters, composers, and \npublishers are appropriately compensated for the use of their \nintellectual property.\n  Before I get ready to turn it over to some of my friends who are here \nwith me tonight and who are part of cosponsoring this, the issue before \nus is: We all can point back to that time. It is a song on the radio. \nThis is the time of year, this holiday season. Or it may be a long \ndrive in the summer. Or it may be sitting outside, but there is that \nsong and that special someone. That song comes on, and you hear it, and \nthe performer is performing it wonderfully. It may have been the \nperformer, or it may have been something else. But a lot of times, \nthere is someone who is sitting in a room or is sitting somewhere, and \nwhat comes out of their hand and onto a piece of paper has come out of \ntheir heart and their mind and their mouth. It has affected our hearts \nand our minds, and it has affected us even to this day.\n  You can think about those songs. That is what makes songwriters \nspecial. That is what makes this cause something that we need to fight \nfor.\n  You have heard them on the radio. Our radio stations have played \nthese songs. For a State trooper's kid, who grew up in northeast \nGeorgia, to listen to the radio, that was my escape. Between that and \nbooks, I traveled the world and always longed to see it, and those \nsongwriters took me there. This is why we are fighting today. It is \nbecause we believe that what these artists have is intellectual \nproperty. What comes out of the their minds, what comes out and is \nexpressed on paper and is then translated many times through artists' \nsinging across the world, is worth protecting. It is intellectual \nproperty. It is as much intellectual property as is this property of my \nphone in my hand, and we have got to understand that.\n  Tonight, I have some friends with me. We will have a lot of time to \ntalk about this. I want to start off up north a little bit. My friend \nfrom North Dakota, Kevin Cramer, is here. We have talked about this \nissue, and I am glad he has joined me here tonight.\n  One of the things that we talked about, Kevin, as you came on the \nfloor, you said, You know, it is just about fairness. I think that is a \ngreat way to put it. It is just about fairness. So I am happy to yield \nto the gentleman to talk about this.\n  Mr. CRAMER. I thank the gentleman, my friend from Georgia, and others \nwho have carried the ball on this issue for some time.\n  A special thanks to our friend from Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn. I \nserve on the same committee with her, and I have learned a great deal \nabout this and other things from Representative Blackburn.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was reminded of a quote by the songwriting and song \nperforming phenom Taylor Swift, who said: I think songwriting is the \nultimate form of being able to make anything that happens in your life \nproductive.\n  Certainly, with whatever happens in your life, whether it is sad or \nglorious or joyful or heavy, you can write a song. It could be \nproductive, but that doesn't mean it is profitable. If something is not \nprofitable, the productivity of it will certainly wane over time, and \nwe will be robbed of that very important piece of the music value \nchain: Where the product begins, which is in the heart and mind of the \nsongwriter.\n  One of the things I love so much about this job--and I am happy to \nadmit it to my friends in the Chamber tonight--is all of the things \nthat you are forced to learn that you never thought were important \nbefore you learned about them. It is kind of amazing. Here we are, 435 \ncolleagues, representing, roughly, 700,000 people. In my case, I \nrepresent the entire State of North Dakota. We think about things like \nagriculture and coal and oil. We think about things like highway bills, \nbut we don't necessarily think a lot about songwriting. We think a lot \nabout markets. We think a lot about fairness. We think a lot about \nregulation.\n  I was a regulator for nearly 10 years before becoming a Member of \nCongress. I regulated monopoly industries, and I was a rate regulator. \nWhen I was a rate regulator, setting the rates for electricity rates or \nnatural gas, I had a lot of tools at my disposal, not the least of \nwhich was all of the evidence that the\n\n[[Page H9199]]\n\nrecord could be filled with. In some cases, it was piles of evidence \nand lots of testimony. Everything was on the record. It is how you make \ngood decisions. In the case where regulation was required and free \nmarkets weren't as free as they would be in other products, you tried \nto apply as a regulator the evidence to a circumstance that best \nreflected the market.\n  Tonight, we are talking about something--and I appreciate \nRepresentative Collins' illustration of the government's thumb on the \nscale--where there has been a gross inequity, a gross injustice. It is \nwhere technology has certainly flourished, where innovation has \nflourished to the point at which opportunity to distribute and to enjoy \nmusic is unlike at any other time; but the songwriters have been left \nout of the innovation piece of it. They have been really biased against \nthem.\n  As I have studied this issue as it has been brought to my attention, \nI have looked at it, and I have thought, This just isn't fair. This \njust isn't fair. Frankly, the ultimate conclusion of this kind of \nantiquated regulatory policy would lead to a very important loss \nbecause people wouldn't be able to do this, not unless you think that \nGeorgia and Tennessee are the only places there are songwriters. I was \nsurprised to find out there were several hundred of them in my little \nState of North Dakota. It is amazing.\n  One thing that all of us can agree on is that small business is the \nheart of our economy and that there is no smaller business than the \nsingle genius that writes music, right? That is the smallest of small \nbusinesses. We ought to get the government, to the degree we can, out \nof the way; but to the degree it requires regulation--and we understand \nit does require regulation as we are talking about copyright and as we \nare talking about broadcasting and as we are talking about things that \nare under the legitimate jurisdiction of the Federal Government's--we \nought to at least be fair in how we do it, and we ought to be modern in \nhow we carry it out.\n  In addition to my friends, Representative Collins, Representative \nBlackburn, and others who have taught me so much about this important \nissue, I also want to thank a new friend who approached me at a concert \nthat I attended just because I love him so much and love his music. I \nhave loved it for decades. This is, I think, an important lesson of \nadvocacy and an importance lesson of stick-to-itiveness. I had the \nopportunity to meet B.J. Thomas, who was a hero of mine while I was \ngrowing up. Do you know what he did with the time that we had together? \nHe advocated not on his own behalf but on behalf of his friends, who \nprovided the fuel for his success. He did so with a heavy heart based \non the fact that his friends weren't treated as fairly and as equitably \nas he has been as a performer.\n  It touched me deeply that this man, who had nothing, really, to gain \nby this advocacy, except, I suppose, the affection of his friends, \ncared enough to tell this lone Congressman from the little State of \nNorth Dakota about this really important issue. I am grateful he \nbrought to it my attention.\n  I am grateful for your leadership on it, and I am grateful to be here \ntonight to help shed some light on it and, hopefully, move the ball \nforward a little bit further.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Representative Cramer, that is such a great \nstory.\n  For those of us with many problems and dysfunction--you hear that up \nhere all the time--to actually understand that we still believe this is \nthe greatest country in the world and that Washington, D.C., and this \nCapitol, still represent a shining beacon that goes throughout the \nworld and stands for freedom, hope, and opportunity, the story that you \njust told about B.J. Thomas, an artist who has profited off of \nsongwriting, and his taking time to talk to his Representative, that is \nwhat makes this country great.\n  That is exactly what we are talking about here, letting things be \nknown that we may not have known and seeing them in amazing places.\n  You talked about your never knowing that your State of North Dakota \nis where you might meet a songwriter. As my friends are down here \ntonight, I just want to share one thing that came to my attention right \nas we were walking on the floor. You never know where songwriting comes \nfrom. Tonight, we have a special honor because, just outside these \ndoors, protecting us here on Capitol Hill, is one of our aspiring \nsongwriters--Capitol Hill Police Officer Kevin Reumont. I hope I \npronounced that right. He is protecting Congress, and he also writes \nthe soundtrack of our lives. Can you imagine a better way to think \nabout that even in this building?\n  Mr. CRAMER. I just have to say, since you brought it up, there is \nnothing that makes me much more emotional than a really good song; but \nthe men and women who protect us in this Chamber make me as emotional \nas anything. I am grateful. It is a great story.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Thank you tonight for being a part of it.\n  It moves along. We mentioned the great State of Tennessee, with Mrs. \nBlackburn and others who have been a part of this; but my friend just \nacross the border in Chattanooga, Mr. Fleischmann, is here tonight, and \nhe has a lot to share about Tennessee and Georgia and all across the \ncountry.\n  We are just glad to have you here tonight to be a part of promoting \nas just was said, the ultimate entrepreneur, the person who is there, \nwriting the song, the small business. So I am happy to yield to the \ngentleman from Tennessee to talk about that.\n  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. I thank my colleague, Mr. Collins from the great \nState of Georgia--our sister State right to the south of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent the great State of Tennessee, as the \ngentleman alluded to--the great city of Chattanooga and the \n``Chattanooga Choo Choo,'' a great song.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. There we go.\n  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. I came to Congress, and some very creative people \ncame to see me. We get a lot of visits up here in Congress. Folks from \nall over the country come to see us. I got a knock at the door one day, \nand there were some songwriters. They were very talented men and women. \nWhat do they do? They write and perform songs. I was just so impressed. \nThese are creative entrepreneurs, and some of the stories are \noutstanding.\n  One gentleman came to see me, and he said: One day years ago, a long \ntime ago, I wrote a song and went in and saw the great Johnny Cash. He \nliked my song, and he played my song. It went well, and that was his \nclaim to fame.\n  Another gentleman came in, and he mentioned a song. He said: I wrote \nthat and played it for a fellow by the name of Frank Sinatra.\n  Now, I remember those two great performers, but these were the folks \nwho wrote the songs. This songwriter actually got to go and hear that \nrecorded. Sinatra invited him, and it became a classic.\n  I was surprised to learn, as my colleague from Georgia alluded to, of \nthe Songwriter Equity Act, but there is some fundamental unfairness \ninvolved in the process, and I wanted to talk about that.\n  Before I came to this great House, I practiced law for about 24 years \nin the city of Chattanooga. I loved practicing law, but when I was not \npracticing law, every once in a while, the judge wanted to go fishing, \nand he would let me preside as special judge. I really liked presiding \nover cases. As a matter of fact, I probably presided over several \nhundred cases over my legal career. I still keep a law license. But, as \na judge, what did I hear? I heard evidence many times, and I want to \nrefer to something that is very important in this whole debate.\n  Right now, the way that the rates are set--and I want everyone who is \nwatching this to understand this--fundamentally, the evidence cannot be \nconsidered by the judge in setting the rates for these performers.\n  What I mean by that specifically is that these judges are not allowed \nby Federal law to consider sound recording royalty rates as relevant \nbenchmarks when setting performance royalty rates for songwriters and \ncomposers. It is analogous to a judge who is hearing a case and saying: \nWell, I am not going to let you decide this, and that is not a good \nthing. These men and women come up every year. They play their songs, \nand they work very hard, and they want their share of the American \nDream.\n  Nashville is a great city. It is our capital city in the great State \nof Tennessee, and I love all of our State. I\n\n[[Page H9200]]\n\nrepresent the Third District in east Tennessee: Chattanooga and Oak \nRidge. Yet, when I travel to Nashville and when I see these men and \nwomen coming there, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of \nsongwriters, what do they want? They want that one special song, or \nhopefully more, to click, for somebody to perform that.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  And when they do, they ought to be rewarded. We ought to be \nincentivizing this because these are creative people, these are \nentrepreneurs.\n  So it is my privilege to join the distinguished gentleman from \nGeorgia who has this Songwriter Equity Act with, I believe, all of my \ncolleagues from Tennessee. I want the American people to take a look at \nthis.\n  I urge Congress to take a look at this. This shouldn't be an issue \nabout Republican or Democrat. This is an issue about giving these \nsongwriters a fair shake.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, Representative Fleischmann just \nmade a great point. I don't hear a song that comes out on a platform--\nand I think that one of the things we forget here is that this is not a \ndiscussion of how we get music, per se, and how innovators have decided \nthat--you know, through wonderful things--Pandora Spotify, Apple Music, \ntraditional radio, and the Internet--there are so many platforms, and \nthose are wonderful. What we don't want to forget is the very system \nthat has allowed them to begin is something that is taking away from \nthe heart of the very songwriter issue.\n  One of the reasons that we were talking about this is that music is \nthe most regulated sector. Seventy-five percent of a songwriter's \nincome is regulated, some of which go back, the mechanical right, to \n1909. They are still governed by player pianos. That is something that \nhas got to change, and I think this is where we are at.\n  What Representative Fleischmann brings is such a wonderful experience \nin what he has heard, and I appreciate him being a part of this. This \nhighlights, again, that specialness.\n  Whatever song may come out on a platform, I don't hear it come out \nsaying it is Republican, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, or \nwhatever. It just comes out as a song that comes from the heart and \nmind of someone that touches the soul of others, and I think that is a \nwonderful thing to be a part of.\n  Sometimes you make friends and you come together, and the great State \nof Georgia and the Big Apple come together. I was just recently there. \nIt is amazing how you find commonality in music and how you find \ncommonality in songs and songwriters.\n  I am just very honored to have as my lead sponsor on the Songwriter \nEquity Act Representative Hakeem Jeffries from New York. We share some \nbackground, but we also share a love of music.\n  Hakeem, I think--as we talk about this, there is a passion that shows \nthis is not a regional issue and it is not a genre issue. It is a \nfairness issue. I think that is something we can come around and reach \nacross the aisle and say let's look and work at how we best can do \nthis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so glad to have Representative Jeffries as a part \nof this. He is a wonderful spokesman to be a part of fairness and what \nhe does for his district, especially with the songwriting community in \nNew York, with Atlanta, with LA, with Nashville, and all over. This has \nbeen something that has brought us all together.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished \ngentleman from Georgia, for convening us here today on this incredibly \nimportant issue on the House floor and, of course, for his \nextraordinary leadership on behalf of the songwriters in America.\n  Over the years, I have gotten to know some very good country lawyers. \nI have also gotten to know some very good country preachers. My good \nfriend from Georgia is the best of both worlds. We appreciate the \ntremendous skill set that he has brought to bear here in the United \nStates Congress. We are members, of course, of the class of 2012. It \nhas been wonderful to work closely with you in your capacity as the \nlead sponsor of this very important piece of legislation.\n  Article I, section 8, clause 8, of the United States Constitution \ngives Congress, both the House and the Senate, the power to create a \nrobust intellectual property system, in the words of our Founders, in \norder ``to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing \nfor limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their \nrespective Writings and Discoveries.''\n  The Founders of this great country understood that it was important \nto create a robust intellectual property system in order to allow \ncreators and innovators to be able to benefit from the fruits of their \nlabor.\n  Songwriters, of course, are at the heart of the music ecosystem, a \nmusic ecosystem that produces a variety of different forms of music.\n  We know that there is country. There is pop. There is rock and roll. \nThere is blues. There is bluegrass. There is jazz. There is Motown. \nThere is hip-hop. There is R, which we tend to be partial to in the \nEighth Congressional District.\n  What all of them have in common is that someone had to create this \nmusic. At the heart of that creation, at the heart of the ecosystem, of \ncourse, is the songwriter.\n  Now, if the songwriter were to disappear or to be diminished in \nnumber, then the whole system of music creation collapses. In many \nways, that is what the Songwriter Equity Act is all about because of \nthe inherent fundamental unfairness in the current system by which \nsongwriters are compensated.\n  Congressman Collins and I have been able to work closely with a \nvariety of different stakeholders from throughout the Nation. \nCertainly, Nashville, Atlanta, and New York have wonderful songwriting \ncommunities.\n  The chairman of ASCAP, Paul Williams, who has been a tremendous \nadvocate, often has said before the Judiciary Committee and in other \ncontexts that songwriters may be the most heavily regulated small-\nbusiness people in America.\n  Unfortunately, that heavy regulation, as is often the case, is not \nbenefiting them. In fact, in many ways, it is suffocating the \nsongwriting community. It is not working to their benefit. It is not \nconsistent with the DNA of our Constitution as it relates to \nintellectual property, which is to enable creators to benefit from the \nfruits of their labor.\n  That is why the Songwriter Equity Act is such an important piece of \nlegislation in order to allow those songwriters, who are spread out in \nall 435 congressional districts in every great State in the Union, to \nbe able to participate fairly in the music ecosystem that is so central \nto the genres that we all know and love throughout our land.\n  Music, of course, is universal in nature. It crosses all boundaries \nof race and religion, socioeconomics, region, cultural boundaries in \nthis incredibly diverse Nation of more than 320 million people. That is \nwhy it has been so wonderful to participate in this journey as it \nrelates to trying to do the right thing for the songwriters in this \ncountry.\n  As has been pointed out by my colleague from Georgia and the other \nparticipants here, there are really two fundamental things that the \nSongwriter Equity Act attempts to correct.\n  First, it is important to make sure that the rate courts, who often \ndecide the compensation for songwriters in certain contexts, have an \nopportunity to consider all of the evidence so that they can arrive at \nan informed decision as to what makes the most sense.\n\n  It is just illogical to believe that a rate court that is walled off \nfrom certain forms of evidence, such as the compensation received by \nrecording artists, can arrive at a fair and equitable decision.\n  In fact, what we have seen is that, over time, because this wall has \nexisted, the compensation for recording artists has increased \nsignificantly. The compensation for songwriters has remained at an \nartificially low level. That is one of the things that we are trying to \ncorrect. Let all of the evidence be considered by the courts that are \ndetermining these rates.\n  Lastly, the Songwriter Equity Act is designed to bring some notion of \nmarket fairness to the compensation of songwriters who create the music \nthat\n\n[[Page H9201]]\n\nwe love. Right now, we have got artificially imposed regulatory rates \non these songwriters in a manner that is not fair, that is not just, \nnot consistent with a market-based approach that has made the United \nStates so prosperous for so many other folks.\n  That is why songwriters rightfully can say that this overregulation \nis not working for us. We would just like to be able to get the fair \nmarket value of our creations. That is what the Songwriter Equity Act \nis designed to do.\n  So I am looking forward to working closely with my good friend from \nGeorgia. He has been a tremendous leader in this regard. I am hopeful \nthat we will be able to soon advance this legislation before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  It has tremendous bipartisan support from Republicans and Democrats, \nProgressives and Conservatives. Let's advance this legislation out of \nJudiciary and onto the House floor and eventually get it to a place \nwhere it can be signed into law by the President.\n  Thank you for your extraordinary leadership.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jeffries. I think \none thing you and I both would point out in this is this is not one \nagainst another. It is not playing off. It is just being fair for all \ninvolved.\n  You have artists who enjoy a very good living based on songs that \nwere written by others. In this process and this ecosystem, we are not \nminding the platform. We are just saying to be fair in the use of it.\n  We want to see every opportunity for every songwriter to be a part, \nbut also be equally compensated, fairly compensated, not more, not \nless, just fairly compensated.\n  I think that is the one thing I want to make sure that our \nsongwriters and composers out there understand, that they are all in \nthis together. They have advocated and continue to advocate, but know \nthat we all come together. We are the beneficiaries of their genius. I \nthink that is the thing. I appreciate you so much.\n  Tonight, as we are coming sort of to an end, many people have asked \nme: Doug, how did you get involved in this? How did a kid from north \nGeorgia get involved with songwriters?\n  Well, the amazing thing is Georgia has almost 50,000 songwriters \nregistered with many--BMI is one of the groups that is registered. \nASCAP's Paul Williams is a dear friend.\n  Of course, he has a real connection to Georgia, for all the folks who \nare watching, Smokey and the Bandit. Paul has connections to so many \nthings in songwriting. This is a multimillion-dollar business, and \nthese are all small entrepreneurs.\n  I wanted to highlight that, for me, it came personal. It comes from \nlistening to my mother-in-law and her husband as they sing and they \njust go back to the old Shape note singing books of the churches in \nnortheast Georgia.\n  It goes to when my beautiful bride, Lisa, and I first started dating. \nOne of the first things we did was went to a hootenanny, and this is \nwhere everybody just brought music. They brought their instruments, \nthey brought everything, and they just began to sing. It came from the \nheart.\n  In my office, I keep a file full--and I actually have some framed--of \njust words put to paper. Songs are simply expressions of the heart that \nare yielded from the mind through the heart that come out of the mouth \nthat touch the souls of others.\n  Then there is my dad and my mom. My dad went to school with a young \nman who went on to become known as Whispering Bill Anderson. He started \nhis songwriting in my district, the Ninth District, living in Commerce, \nGeorgia, at the time, at WWJC. The radio station is still there.\n  My understanding of the story from Bill was he was on top of the \nbuilding and he wrote this song, ``City Lights,'' which was performed \nby Ray Price. He has transcended the decades because one of his last \nsongs was ``Whiskey Lullaby'' that was performed by Brad Paisley and \nAlison Krauss.\n  You see, this is about stories. Neo is one of our Georgia folks. \nStreaming companies are making a lot of money off of an outdated system \nin which they are able to pay songwriters less than the fair market \nvalue for the right to use their work. This is Neo.\n  It is time for Congress to stand with songwriters, \n#standwithsongwriters. I know there are many out there watching, on \nTwitter, Facebook. There are a lot of places where we can get this \nmessage out. This is simply about fairness.\n  As I come to a close tonight, I am reminded even today of when I was \nin Iraq just a few years ago. There were songs that I would hear as I \nwas driving around and I was meeting with some servicemembers out on \nthe gate post. We would talk about a lot of things: family, love, life, \nproblems.\n  It would always come around and something would be on the radio and a \nsong would come across. To this day, if a certain song is played--it \ncould be ``Chicken Fried'' by the Zac Brown Band--I can still believe \nthat I am still in Iraq. I still go back to those times and I see those \nyoung men and young women who are protecting us and are protecting us \nall over the world.\n  You see, that is what the songwriter does. The songwriter takes the \nmoment, crystallizes it, forms it, just as they would any product that \nthey make that comes out of their mind, flowing straight from the \nheart, out of the mouth, onto a pad, through their hand, and touches \nlives around the world.\n  It is time for Congress to look. It is time for Congress to \nunderstand that this is about small business and small entrepreneurs. \nIt is time for Congress to stand with songwriters.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9201-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9201-H9204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  2000\n                        TERROR WATCH LIST ISSUES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate my friend from \nGeorgia's thoughts and observations.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is really intriguing that our friends across the \naisle have been joining with the President in demanding that we in \nCongress give this administration, with its abuses and unaccountability \nof the IRS, using it as a political weapon to help win an election, \nthat used the ATF to sell weapons, 2,000 or so, to get them in the \nhands of criminals, and then tried to use that violence that came from \nthe weapons they forced into the hands of people that shouldn't have \nhad them as a reason to try to take away Second Amendment rights of \nlaw-abiding Americans.\n  This administration is one of the most arbitrary and capricious \nadministrations in history. Executive orders have been used for things \nthat, from the top to the bottom of this administration, they have said \nthey could not use executive orders for, including forms of amnesty. I \nthink, over 20 times, the President himself said he did not have \nauthority to just grant amnesty, and yet he turned around and did it \nanyway.\n  This administration, with that kind of history over the last 7 years, \nof being so arbitrary and in some cases being very intentional in going \nafter enemies, far beyond anything Nixon might have ever dreamed he \nmight be able to do, the thought of giving this administration the \npower to just make a list of all the people that you don't want to ever \nfly or have a gun, just make a list, we don't know exactly how you are \nmaking this list. There is no due process in creating the no-fly list. \nThere is no due process in getting oneself off the no-fly list once the \nname is on the no-fly list.\n  Katie Pavlich with townhall.com, talking of the President's speech, \nsaid:\n  ``President Obama called on Congress to pass legislation stripping \nanyone, including American citizens, on the terrorism no-fly list of \nthe ability to purchase a firearm in the United States. Sounds pretty \nreasonable, right? Nobody wants terrorists to have easy access to guns, \nand it certainly sounds bad when the argument is made that those \ncurrently on the terror watch list have the ability to do so. But \nhere's the problem: The terror no-fly list is a mangled, bureaucratic \nmess of over 700,000 names. Yes, there are names on the list that are \nconnected to terrorism, but nearly half of those names belong to people \nwho have zero links'' to terrorism.\n  Further down she said:\n  ``That list, which contained 47,000 names at the end of George W. \nBush's\n\n[[Page H9202]]\n\npresidency, has grown to nearly 700,000 people on President Obama's \nwatch. The fact that they are names, not identities, has led to \nmisidentifications and confusion, ensnaring many innocent people. But \nsurely those names are there for good reason, right?\n  ``Not really. According to the technology website TechDirt.com, 40 \npercent of those on the FBI's watch list--280,000 people--are \nconsidered to have no affiliation with recognized terrorist groups. All \nit takes is for the government to declare it has `reasonable suspicion' \nthat someone could be a terrorist. There is no hard evidence required, \nand the standard is notoriously vague and elastic.\n  ``So who ends up on the list who shouldn't and why? Take for example \nWeekly Standard Senior Writer and Fox News Contributor Steve Hayes, who \nwas put on the no-fly list after a cruise.\n  ``Stephen Hayes, a senior writer at The Weekly Standard . . . was \ninformed Tuesday that he had been placed on the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Terrorist Watchlist.\n  ``Hayes, who spoke to POLITICO by phone on Tuesday, suspects that the \ndecision stems from U.S. concerns over Syria. Hayes and his wife \nrecently booked a one-way trip to Istanbul for a cruise, and returned \nto the U.S., a few weeks later, via Athens.''\n  But the trouble is, nobody can say for sure why they are on the list, \nwhy they are not on the list, why they should not be on the list, the \narticle says, but travel to certain regions isn't the only way you can \nget put on the list without due process.\n  ``The Intercept published a 166-page document outlining the \ngovernment's guidelines for placing people on an expansive network of \nterror watch lists.''\n  I just can't help but say, Mr. Speaker, it is hard to fathom that, \nonce the wonderful American people think about what the President is \nproposing, they are going to realize you can't trust this \nadministration with your health care, you can't trust this \nadministration to keep their promises that if you like your health \ninsurance policy you can keep it, because those promises from this \nadministration weren't true. The promise: If you like your doctor, you \ncan keep your doctor wasn't true. It turns out people in the \nadministration knew all along that it wasn't true, yet they promised \npeople those things anyway.\n  So there are issues of trust. We know, even when we are not talking \nabout issues of intentional misrepresentation but just mismanagement \nand terrible policies, look at the rules of engagement of our military. \nUnder President Bush, there were just over 500 precious American lives \nthat were lost in the war in Afghanistan over 7\\1/4\\ years' time. \nThough the war had wound down, we were told by the President, \nbasically, one, things were contained in Afghanistan.\n  Nonetheless, during this wound-down war of the last less than 7 \nyears, this President's rules of engagement have contributed, not \nintentionally, but the mismanagement has helped create an environment \nfor our military members, men and women, where we have lost three to \nfour times more lives under Commander Obama than were lost under \nCommander Bush, and more time that Commander Bush was over the \noperation.\n  This is not the administration you want to trust to say: You just \nmake out a list, even though the standards are vague; we don't know how \nsomebody gets on; it is kind of up to you, judgment call on your part; \nand there is not a clear way to get off.\n  I read an article where somebody had been trying for 8 years to get \noff of that list. Nonetheless, you just go ahead, Obama administration, \nbureaucrats in cubicles, people like Lois Lerner that hate \nconservatives, you just make out your list of people you don't want to \never be able to defend themselves or their homes or their loved ones \nwith a weapon. You make out the list, and we will keep them from \nflying, and we won't let them have a gun.\n  That would be a disaster, because when most Americans realized what \nthe President was asking for, just carte blanche to put anybody he \nwanted to on the list and they could never get a gun, the American \npeople are fair. The majority pull for an underdog, and they are not \ngoing to pull for an overly abusive, bureaucratic, Kafkaesque \nadministration to take out its revenge on someone it doesn't like and \nprevent them from being able to defend themselves and their loved ones.\n  Of course, The New York Times, never an organization to let hypocrisy \nget in the way of being hypocritical, this article from Breitbart by \nAWR Hawkins points out:\n  ``On April 18, 2014, The New York Times published a scathing \neditorial on the no-fly list, describing it as `a violation of basic \nrights,' and a list unsuitable for a `democratic society premised on \ndue process.'\n\n  ``Moreover, The New York Times addressed the imprecision of the list \nby explaining that a 2007 audit showed that half the names on the list \n`were wrongly included.' Adding insult to injury, there were `71,000 \nnames' on the list in 2007, which means 35,500 people were facing a \ndenial of their constitutional rights for being on a list due to \noversight or some similar mistake.''\n  That seems to be pretty clear. The New York Times got it right in \n2014, got it wrong now. But it is interesting. I reflect on what my \nfriend, former Member of Congress Barney Frank told me one day when we \nwere on the same side of an issue. He shrugged and said: Well, even a \nbroken clock is right twice a day. I know my friend Barney Frank could \nprove that.\n  There was an article entitled, ``FBI Investigates If Terror Group \nArranged California Killers' Marriage.'' It is by Marisa Schultz and \nYaron Steinbuch, dated December 9, 2015. It pointed out:\n  ``The FBI is investigating whether the online courtship of the future \nSan Bernardino mass murderers was a match made in hell by a terror \ngroup--to set in motion the radicalized duo's evil plan, Director James \nComey said on Wednesday.\n  ``Comey told a Senate Judiciary Committee that investigators do not \nyet know if a group like ISIS hatched the love-and-hate match between \njihadists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik.''\n  Further down it says:\n  ``The top G-man also said that Farook, 28, and Malik, 29, were \nradicalized at least 2 years ago and planned their evil martyrdom \nscheme long before they were engaged and before she applied for her \nvisa.\n  ``The couple--who lived in a two-bedroom townhouse with their 6-\nmonth-old daughter and Farook's mother--killed 14 people and wounded 21 \nduring a holiday party December 2 at the Inland Regional Center in San \nBernardino. They were killed about 4 hours later in a shootout with \npolice . . . `Our investigation to date shows that they were \nradicalized before they started courting or dating each other online, \nand as early as the end of 2013, were talking to each other about jihad \nand martyrdom before they became engaged and married and were living in \nthe U.S.'. . . A U.S. Government source familiar with the shooting \nprobe said Farook may have been plotting an attack in the U.S. as early \nas 2011.''\n  That is hard to believe, Mr. Speaker, because this administration was \ndoing all these things, reaching out, not helping Christians who were \nbeing persecuted in greater numbers than ever in the history of the \nworld. No, not reaching out to specifically help Christians and Jews, \nwho were the primary targets of these radical Islamists, these people \nwho perpetrate hate crimes that this administration won't even call \nhate crimes. This is the administration that, every time it seems that \nthey reach out overseas or even, for heaven's sake, with our NASA space \nprogram, the President is directing that we have got to protect Muslims \nabove all other things.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  This is the same administration who appointed an Attorney General \nwho, after this mass murder spree in San Bernardino, came out--while \nothers like local police and other good, clear-thinking people are \nsaying, ``If you see something, say something,'' after knowing that \nneighbors saw suspicious activity by what they knew to be Muslims, \napparently, in the garage, but they were afraid of saying something \nbecause it was politically incorrect, and now, Mr. Speaker, it has been \nmade clear by the Attorney General that, if you are a neighbor in a \nposition like those of Farook and Malik and you see something you think \nis suspicious that someone with an Islamic background is doing and you \ncall that in,\n\n[[Page H9203]]\n\nour Attorney General just may, according to what she said, decide not \nto go after the Islamist terrorists, but to come after you for being a \nbigot and for showing bias or prejudice.\n  I can't imagine a more ridiculous thing to say after radical \njihadists kill Christians and Jews. Yes, apparently, there was at least \none Muslim shot, but the killing occurred because of the hate for \nChristians and Jews and the desire to create terror in the hearts of \ninfidels. So no Muslims were actually targeted by these radical \nIslamists. They were collateral damage. They should never have been \nshot.\n  Anybody that had anything to do with the shooting of a Muslim, \nChristian, Jew, atheist, Buddhist, or anything else, should be brought \nnot just to justice. But when it is an act of war like this, they ought \nto be taken out.\n  The Attorney General, on the other hand, in the immediate aftermath \nof this bloody massacre--tragic--at a Christmas party--threatens \nAmerican citizens that, if you become--in effect, what she is saying--\nnot the words, but, in effect, she is saying, if you become suspicious \nof people who are acting in the same way that you have seen on \ntelevision or in the news, acting as radical Islamists, and you report \nthat, we will come after you because you are showing bigotry and \nprejudice.\n  So, on the one hand, if you see something, say something, but if it \nis about a Muslim, then there is a good chance we will come after you, \nnot the Islamists.\n  There is a report from CNN's Zachary Cohen: ``Amnesty report: ISIS \narmed with U.S. weapons.'' This is dated today.\n  ``A new report from a prominent human rights group has found that \nISIS has built a substantial arsenal, including U.S.-made weapons \nobtained from the Iraqi army and Syrian opposition groups.\n  ``Amnesty International's 44-page report, released late Monday, found \nthat much of ISIS' equipment and munitions comes from stockpiles \ncaptured from the U.S.-allied Iraqi military and Syrian rebels.''\n  Further down:\n  ``After analyzing thousands of videos and images taken in Iraq and \nSyria, Amnesty determined that a large proportion of ISIS' current \nmilitary arsenal is made up of `weapons and equipment looted, captured \nor illicitly traded from poorly secured Iraqi military stocks.'''\n  We saw over and over, Mr. Speaker, that this administration had this \nridiculous idea--way too late after there were vetted moderate Syrian \nrebels that we could have helped--to get involved.\n  Over and over they sent heavy equipment, heavy weapons, to these so-\ncalled vetted moderate Syrian rebels who said they feel a lot closer to \nthose members of ISIS than they do the United States. And, lo and \nbehold, those heavy weapons that are being used to kill the courageous \nKurds that are fighting them are United States military weapons.\n  To this administration's credit--I have got to give it to them--there \nwas a period of about 4 or 5 months where, because the weapons they \nkept sending to the Syrians kept ending up in ISIS' hands, they decided \nto hold up shipping them more weapons because we just were equipping \nISIS. But for some ridiculous, unknown reason--it has to be \nridiculous--this administration began sending weapons back again. As \nfar as I know, they are still doing so.\n  I also think it is important to note that this administration has \npointed to George W. Bush originally saying that this was not Islamic, \nand this administration has blamed the Bush administration--normally, \nit is quite unfairly--for every problem that has arisen.\n  In fact, I believe it was in Iowa where someone told me that they \nunderstood that the President wanted to have the San Andreas Fault \nrenamed for President George W. Bush so that it would be known as \nBush's fault.\n  That is what this administration has done. Yet, they try to blame him \nfor them saying that ISIS--which wasn't around when President Bush was \nPresident. It was only created when this President created a vacuum in \nthe Middle East--that these people who claim to be Islamic are not \nIslamic.\n  I keep going back to the fact that one of the most internationally \nrecognized experts on Islam, Islamic law, Islamic studies, and on the \nKoran, got his degrees, including a Ph.D., I read, from the University \nof Baghdad in Islamic studies. His name is al-Baghdadi. He is the head \nof ISIS. As head of ISIS, he claims that ISIS is indeed Islam.\n  The President doesn't have any degrees in Islamic studies, although \nhe did apparently study Islam quite clearly as a young child in \nIndonesia. Nonetheless, I think al-Baghdadi's credentials on what is \nIslam and what is not are superior to those of anybody in the White \nHouse.\n  Caroline Glick, a writer for the Jerusalem Post, makes a great point \nin one of her articles from November 24, 2015. She says:\n  ``An attempt is being made to assert that there is no pluralism in \nIslam. It is either entirely good or entirely evil.''\n  She is making a great point about pluralism because, as she says, \n``This absolutist position is counterproductive for two reasons. First, \nit gets you nowhere good in the war against radical Islam. The fact is \nthat Islam, per se, is none of the United States President's business. \nHis business is to defeat those who attack the U.S. and to stand with \nAmerica's allies against their common foes.\n  ``Radical Islam may be a small component of Islam or a large one, but \nit certainly is a component of Islam. Its adherents believe they are \ngood Muslims and they base their actions on their Islamic beliefs.\n  ``American politicians, warfighters, and policymakers need to \nidentify that form of Islam, study it, and base their strategies for \nfighting the radical Islamic forces on its teachings.''\n  That is why my friends like Muslims Massoud and Dostam and others who \nfought and initially defeated the Taliban within about 5 months in \nAfghanistan--courageous--don't want radical Islamists governing \nAfghanistan.\n  In Egypt, a very fine, courageous man, President el-Sisi, stood up to \nimams and pointed out that you must take back Islam and denounce the \nradical Islamists that are destroying our religion. They recognize this \nis Islamic. They are claiming to be Islamic. And we have got to clean \nup our own religion.\n  Judicial Watch released information today: ``ODNI Confirms Terrorists \nTried to Enter U.S. As Syrian Refugees.'' They point out that, ``FBI \nAssistant Director Michael Steinbach has also conceded that the \nU.S. Government has no system to properly screen Syrian refugees. `The \nconcern in Syria is that we don't have systems in place on the ground \nto collect information to vet. That would be the concern, is we would \nbe vetting--databases don't hold the information on those individuals. \nYou're talking about a country that is a failed state, that is, does \nnot have any infrastructure, so to speak. So all of the data sets--the \npolice, the intel services--that normally you would go to seek \ninformation don't exist.'' That is very important.\n\n  Now I know that some people are trying to say that Donald Trump--and \nI did not endorse him. I endorsed Ted Cruz for President--but they are \ntrying to vilify Trump because he perhaps overstated it, but he has \nmade clear that we need to pause until we figure out our policy.\n  Yet, Huma Abedin, wife of Anthony Weiner, our former colleague here, \ndenounced Trump. She says Trump wants to literally write racism into \nour law books, his homophobia doesn't reflect our Nation's values, it \ngoes far enough to damage our country's reputation, and could even \nthreaten our national security.\n  Mr. Speaker, I pointed out yesterday the information that we obtained \nafter letters were sent to departments and just mentioning a couple of \nfacts about her family. And then we find out that she has these direct \nties to Abdullah Omar Naseef, who had ties to Osama bin Laden, and \nreally serious issues not just through her mother, who started the \nMuslim Sisterhood, but her late father, deceased for many years now, \nbut who is a prominent member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a brother \nwho had ties--but she had ties herself--to Naseef and others.\n  When you find out the contacts and close personal ties she herself \nhad, you wonder how in the world a person like this could be attached \nto, at the time,\n\n[[Page H9204]]\n\nFirst Lady Hillary Clinton in the Clinton years in the Clinton White \nHouse. How could that happen?\n  Of course, over the years, she has become ingratiated to Hillary \nClinton. She has been her closest confidante. Not much of anything \nhappens, as we found from the emails, without Huma Abedin Weiner being \nin the middle of it. Wow.\n  I just want to point out something else that has come out in recent \nyears. I will just read this. I don't espouse that Wikipedia is all \nthat reliable, but here is what they say about Abdul Rahman al-Amoudi: \nHe is an American former Muslim activist known for founding the \nAmerican Muslim Council. He was born in Eritrea, raised in Yemen, \nemigrated to the U.S. He formed the Council, whose aim was to inform \nand influence both Republicans and Democrats.\n  In 1998, al-Amoudi was involved with the selection of Muslim \nchaplains for the U.S. military, and acted as a consultant to the \nPentagon for over a decade.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  During this time, al-Amoudi served as an Islamic adviser to President \nBill Clinton and a fundraiser for both the Republican and Democratic \nparties.\n  More recently, al-Amoudi worked with leading conservatives such as \nGrover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.\n  Al-Amoudi became a U.S. citizen in 1996. Al-Amoudi and other Muslim \nleaders met with the then-presidential candidate George W. Bush in \nAustin in July 2000, offering to support his bid for the White House in \nexchange for Bush's commitment to repeal antiterrorist laws. He even \nspoke at a service for the victims of 9/11.\n  He is now doing 23 years in prison for supporting terrorism. He was \nhelping the Clinton administration find people for different jobs. I am \ntrying to find out, Mr. Speaker, could he have had anything to do, \nbefore he went to prison, with placing Huma Abedin as an intern with \nHillary Clinton. Mr. Speaker, I can't get an answer.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9204-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas.
