Mr. Speaker, this morning I introduced the Carbon \nCapture Act, which makes simple changes to the existing section 45Q tax \ncredit that further incentivizes carbon capture and sequestration \nprojects.\n  CCS technology will help reduce carbon emissions while simultaneously \ncreating jobs, bolstering domestic oil production, and providing \nregulatory relief for our coal industry. Yes. You heard that right.\n  The benefits of CCS are bringing folks who do not traditionally work \ntogether to the same table for the betterment of our Nation's energy \nsecurity.\n  Often people believe they are forced to choose between supporting \neconomic development or environmental stewardship. However, this bill \nis evidence that that is a false choice. Above all, CCS serves as a \ntestament to the entrepreneurial spirit and gumption found throughout \nthis great country.\n  In Texas District 11, I have seen this innovative spirit daily. These \nprojects will play an important role in west Texas' and our Nation's \nfuture energy portfolio.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H895-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H895-H896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in the weeks ahead, we will be dealing \nwith the budget resolution and we will be dealing with defense \nauthorization and appropriations.\n  Already we have seen the administration unveil a budget that is not \nonly unrealistic, but actually could be dangerous.\n  It keeps spending for all the nuclear modernization on track over $3 \nbillion, and it includes funding for a long-range, standoff replacement \ncruise missile, $2.2 billion in the future year defense program, \nultimately costing $20- to $30 billion, if not more, this to replace a \ncruise missile that the father of this device, former Secretary of \nDefense William Perry, feels is no longer relevant and has argued \nagainst.\n  There are billions of dollars for the controversial modernization of \neach leg of the nuclear triad--the land-based missiles, submarine-based \nmissiles, and the bombers--which have not been used in 65 years, have \nbeen unable to help us with the military challenges that we face now in \nthe Middle East and are going to consume huge sums of money in this \nhopelessly redundant program.\n  It is dangerous because of the cuts in the nuclear nonproliferation \nprogram of over $100 million. I mean, these are real threats to our \nsecurity.\n  We are battling ISIS now. They have already obtained some low-grade \nnuclear material in a facility near Mosul. We have had a few nuclear \nweapons gone missing and other nuclear materials unaccounted for or \nstolen.\n  We need to have these proven programs to reduce the inventory, track \nit down, and take it out of circulation. We should be expanding them, \nnot cutting them back. It continues an overall trillion-dollar spending \nthat we are going to have on the nuclear programs over the course of \nthe next 30 years.\n  Now, these are resources that are going to be at the expense of our \nconventional weapons. As I mentioned, the nuclear triad is far more \nthan we need to deter anybody in the world right now and do not help us \nwith the strategic challenges that we face today.\n  It is not going to prevent Russian adventurism in Ukraine or Crimea, \nbut it will result in our having to cannibalize the Guard and Ready \nReserve, the Army that will be paying the price for this.\n  These are conventional forces that have paid the price for the last \ntwo decades of activities and are going to be needed for both \ndeterrence and, God forbid, actual activity in the future. We cannot do \nall of this within the current budget horizon.\n  The budget gimmicks ignore that. We have a little trust fund with the \noverseas contingency account that ignores budget realities that we are \nnot going to be able to continue in perpetuity.\n\n[[Page H896]]\n\n  We ignore the long-term costs of budget programs for weapons, \npreferring to put that off to a future administration and future \nCongresses.\n  In so doing, we are playing fast and loose with the integrity of the \nPentagon with the resources and the materials that are necessary to \nsupport our troops now and in the future.\n  It is not too late for this Congress to demand a spending plan, cost \naccountability, kill the new cruise missile program, and put us on a \npath of fiscal stability and sanity while we have appropriate \npriorities for the military strength and defense of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H896-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF GEORGE COLLINS JEFFREYS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Holding) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of \nGoldsboro's own George Collins Jeffreys, who passed away on January 20.\n  Born over 90 years ago, in 1925, George lived a long and full life. \nThe eldest of four children, he attended St. Mary's School and Oak \nRidge Military Academy in Oak Ridge, North Carolina. During the Second \nWorld War, George served in the Pacific.\n  After the war, George returned home to work in the family business, \nwhich was originally established back in the 1890s by two prominent \nNorth Carolina families to market local produce, chickens, seed, and \neggs. The business was successful.\n  In the 1920s, George's father and uncle took over the business, \nrenaming it Jeffreys and Sons. The two brothers began offering beverage \ndistribution. After the end of prohibition, they became a licensed \ndistributor for Anheuser-Busch products.\n  It wasn't long before the company had grown so big that it was \ndivided into separate seed, beverage, and cabinet companies. It \ncontinued growing and expanding in Goldsboro, Greenville, and other \ncommunities.\n  Today, R.A. Jeffreys Distributing Company is the oldest Anheuser-\nBusch distributor in North Carolina as well as one of the oldest \nfamily-owned distributors in the United States.\n  R.A. Jeffreys Distributing Company services almost every grocery \nstore, convenience store, and restaurant in the area, supplying 36 \ncounties in North Carolina.\n  Now, George Jeffreys was not only respected as a business leader. He \nwas a thoughtful and generous member of his community, volunteering and \ncontributing to local schools, Scout troops, churches, and community \nprograms.\n  In addition to his company being recognized multiple times as an \noutstanding wholesaler by Anheuser-Busch, receiving the Dimensions of \nExcellence Award, George also received the Distinguished Service Award \nfrom the Tuscarora Council of the Boy Scouts of America.\n  His dedication to business and to his community were certainly \nhighlights of his long and full life. But the true foundation of George \nJeffreys' life was his family.\n  His wife Lucy and his three children--his daughters, Leigh and Ellen, \nand his son Robert--and seven grandchildren will all remember him with \nlove.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to call George Jeffreys a friend.\n  I pray for God's blessings and God's peace to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H896-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H896-H897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             END HUNGER NOW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last week during our district work period, \nI spent the night at the Interfaith Hospitality Network, a family \nhomeless shelter in Worcester, Massachusetts. This was my second time \nspending a night there in recent years.\n  It was a wonderful opportunity to hear firsthand the stories of \nfamilies who are facing tough times and to see the incredible support \nprovided by groups like IHN.\n  In today's media environment, where every development in the \nPresidential campaign gets a breaking news banner, it is easy to lose \nsight of the real issues impacting real families, and homelessness is \none of those real issues.\n  In 2015, more than 500,000 Americans were homeless on any given \nnight. Of that number, more than 200,000 were people and families and \nnearly 50,000 were veterans.\n  Even in Massachusetts, which is one of the richest States in the \nNation, homelessness continues to be a challenge in many of our \ncommunities.\n  In recent years, State budget cuts have led to a record number of \nhomeless children in Massachusetts, and the overall uptick in \nhomelessness has led to overcrowding in shelters, with thousands of \nfamilies being turned away.\n  In the richest country on the planet, it is simply astonishing that \nanyone is homeless, but the fact is this continues to be a persistent \nproblem. Fortunately, there are amazing organizations like the \nInterfaith Hospitality Network that are making a difference.\n  IHN works in partnership with the faith community to provide shelter \nand assistance to families with children who are homeless. Their \nprimary goals are to assist families by increasing their income and to \nhelp them secure permanent housing while providing critical support \nservices necessary for them to succeed.\n  It is a community bed shelter that provides private bedrooms and \nshared quality living areas for six families at a time who are \nhomeless, but don't qualify for State-funded shelters.\n  One of the points that the people I met made very eloquently was that \nsometimes life is very complicated and sometimes things don't work out \nas you expect them to.\n  Many of the families that I met during my stay included at least one \nworking parent, but they had fallen into the gap where they earned too \nlittle to make ends meet, but too much to qualify for other housing \nassistance programs.\n  Some of the residents included college-educated parents with families \nthat fell on hard times. Maybe a parent is sick or a child is sick or a \nparent got laid off from a job. Those families are not there because \nthey made poor choices. There were a series of events that led to this.\n  One thing parents at the shelter have in common is that they love \ntheir kids more than anything and they are working tirelessly to get \nback on their feet.\n  The families at IHN are not charged rent and work with a caseworker \nto budget and save money for their own apartments. The caseworker also \nhelps families access necessary health care or counseling, learn job \nskills, enroll in job training or educational classes, and assists them \nwith other life issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, IHN is a very special place. It is a home. It is \ncomfortable. It is safe. Families prepare and eat dinner together. \nChildren do their homework together, color in coloring books, and play \ngames. IHN provides a sense of normalcy during these times of turmoil \nand uncertainty for these families.\n  With each visit to the IHN shelter in Worcester, I am inspired to see \nthat within our community there are so many wonderful people who care \nabout their neighbors who are going through difficult times and who \nwant to get back on their feet.\n  The volunteers and staff are incredible people. Places like IHN \nrepresent the best of our community. There is a real need for places \nlike this.\n  Too often in this Chamber I have heard colleagues demonize and \ndisparage America's poorest families, but those who are homeless don't \nfit into a stereotype.\n  Every family faces different challenges. It is hard work to be poor \nin America. The families I met are working hard for a better life for \ntheir kids.\n  We should be helping them get back on their feet, not kicking them \nwhile they are down. Certainly we should not be indifferent to their \nstruggles.\n  To help more of these families get ahead, we must do more at the \nnational level to strengthen the social safety net and to better \naddress homelessness, food insecurity, poverty, and many other issues \nwhich deserve to be front and center.\n  Looking at the big picture, we need to be talking about how we can \nmake sure that work pays enough so that all working families can afford \nrent and a place to live and be able to put food on the table for their \nkids.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  We might start by increasing, at long last, the Federal minimum wage \nso\n\n[[Page H897]]\n\nthat it is a livable wage. If you work in this country, you ought not \nto be poor, and you certainly ought not to be homeless.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the richest country on the planet, I know we can do \nmore to solve homelessness. Spending the night at the Interfaith \nHospitality Network was a learning experience. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to do the same in their districts.\n  Those of us who serve in Congress are blessed that we don't have to \nworry about whether or not we will have a roof over our heads on any \ngiven night, but there are many families, too many families all \nthroughout this country who do. We need to do a better job of listening \nto their stories, of trying to lend a helping hand so that they can get \nout of their difficult situation and move on to a better life.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to what I said today and to do what I \ndid and spend a night in a shelter in their own district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H897-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STACIE WALLS STORY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the war on coal touches \nevery family in my home State of West Virginia. Whether you are a miner \nor not, you feel the consequences of this administration's regulations \nthat are shutting down our coal mines.\n  Closing a coal mine doesn't just affect a miner and his family. It \naffects everyone in the community, from the small town mom-and-pop \nstores who depend on customers, to our schools that depend on tax \nrevenue. A decline in coal hurts us all.\n  Stacie Walls contacted me. She is a wife of a coal miner and a mother \nin Boone County. She sees the consequences firsthand.\n  Here is what she wrote me: ``My husband has been laid off four times \nsince last April.\n  ``Because of the war on coal, my county is closing my son's school \ndue to not having the coal tax to help keep it opened.\n  ``My son's education is now going to suffer because of the war on \ncoal. I've watched many families leave the State because they must find \nwork.\n  ``There are more `for sale' signs up than there are kids riding their \nbikes.''\n  This, Mr. Speaker, is Stacie. This is Stacie's family. These are the \ntrue faces of the war on coal.\n  West Virginia's families deserve peace of mind. It is time for the \nEPA to get off the backs of West Virginians and let them do the work \nthat powers our Nation and puts food on our tables.\n  I am working every day in Congress for our coal families, for all \nfamilies. I believe in the future of West Virginia coal.\n  President Obama must stop his war on coal, and we must pass policies \nthat create jobs to ensure a future for West Virginians in West \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H897-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TWO GREAT AMERICAN HEROES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Larson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the \nBipartisan Policy Center for the establishment of the Congressional \nPatriot Award and naming Sam Johnson and John Lewis as its first \nrecipients.\n  I can think of no two people who are more deserving than Sam Johnson \nand John Lewis, both of whom serve in this Chamber with distinction, \nboth of whom I have the honor of serving with on the Committee on Ways \nand Means who do an extraordinary job on behalf of the citizenry of \nthis great Nation. For all of our membership here, we can all be proud \nto say that we served with both Sam Johnson and John Lewis.\n  I want to thank and commend Tom Cole, my co-chairman in this effort, \non behalf of our two esteemed colleagues. By now every Member should \nhave received, and the public will become increasingly aware of, an \ninvitation to this event on March 15. The event will be held at the \nLibrary of Congress. What a fitting place for us to honor our \ncolleagues. The Library will have on display photos and documents from \nthe Vietnam war and photos and documents from the civil rights \nmovement.\n  It was 50 years ago that Sam Johnson was shot down over Vietnam. It \nwas 51 years ago that John Lewis made that historic trek from Selma to \nMontgomery and crossing over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Most people \ndon't realize today that Sam Johnson was imprisoned by the Vietcong for \n7 years, 42 months of which he spent in solitary confinement, nearly \nbeaten to death but never said a word. What an incredible American.\n  John Lewis, nearly beaten to death by the Alabama police as he had \nthe temerity to lock arms and cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, faced \nwith undaunted courage an unwelcoming crowd who could never deter the \nwill of a movement that he is so identified with.\n  To have the Bipartisan Policy Center recognize a conservative, a \nprogressive, a Republican, a Democrat, people who served this Nation \nextraordinarily with their patriotism long before they ever got here, \nto have a medal named in their honor and to present that once in a \nbiennium to deserving Members of this body, past and present, is a \ngreat notion.\n  It demonstrates to the American people that at the end of the day it \nis not about conservative or liberal or it is not about Democrat or \nRepublican, it is about the great nation that we serve. There are no \nmore exemplary figures than Sam Johnson and John Lewis.\n  John McCain will be presenting on behalf of Sam Johnson. No one \nunderstands what Sam Johnson endured better than Senator John McCain. \nAndrew Young will be speaking on behalf of John Lewis. He was alongside \nof John Lewis during that historic march. No one knows better what they \nendured.\n  We are so fortunate to both have the Library of Congress but also to \nhave David Rubenstein, who will be there, who will conduct an interview \nthat evening with Sam Johnson and John Lewis. It will be a wonderful \nevening, made more special by what the Library of Congress will present \nin terms of what transpired 50 and 51 years ago respectively, but made \ngreater by the presence of everybody here recognizing the great \ncontribution of our colleagues, Sam Johnson and John Lewis.\n  I look forward to having everybody on March 15 at the Library of \nCongress to recognize these two great American heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H897-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H897-H898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HISTORIC ROSENWALD SCHOOLS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, for recently freed African Americans, \neducation denied to them under slavery was a critical component of \nunderstanding freedom.\n  In the wake of the Civil War, with the widespread awareness that \neducation was essential to the advancement of a free people in this \nsociety, African Americans flocked to schools established by the \nFreedmen's Bureau.\n  The recognition of this relationship between schools, community, and \nthe broader ideal of the American Dream led African American parents \nand teachers to be among the first Southerners to advocate for \nuniversal public education.\n  However, the dual education system that arose, determined by race and \nbased on the fiction of separate but equal, brought about a hand-me-\ndown approach to Black education in the South. This flawed duality \nresulted in the perpetuation and exacerbation of institutional \ninequity.\n  In the face of such obstacles, leaders like Booker T. Washington, \nfounder of the Tuskegee Institute, embraced and expanded on the early \nbelief in education as the great hope of a truly democratic society.\n  Washington's vision inspired many, including philanthropist and \npresident of Sears, Roebuck, Julius Rosenwald.\n  The philanthropic and educational partnership between these two men \nled to the construction of 5,000 Rosenwald schools across 15 Southern \nStates. In Arkansas, 389 school buildings were constructed in 45 of our \n75 counties, with communities pooling their often meager resources to \nfulfill Rosenwald's pledge to match their contribution.\n  For many, these buildings were not simply schools but monuments to \nBlack achievement and symbols for an ardent hope in a better future. \nRosenwald schools contributed to the education of thousands of African \nAmerican students across the American\n\n[[Page H898]]\n\nSouth, including notable figures like Arkansas poet Maya Angelou and \nour own esteemed colleague and friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nLewis).\n  In 1954, with the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of \nEducation, to which Julius Rosenwald contributed one-third of the \nlitigation costs, his carefully crafted schools became obsolete. In \nArkansas, the tensions behind this great achievement played out in the \ntumultuous 1957 Little Rock Central High crisis. The courageous \ndetermination of the Little Rock Nine hearkens back to that fundamental \nbelief in education equals freedom.\n  This is the continuing legacy of Washington, of Rosenwald, and the \ncountless parents and teachers who were determined to give future \ngenerations the means of mobility, economic advancement, opportunity.\n  In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed \nRosenwald schools as one of America's most 11 endangered places. Today \nin Arkansas, only 18 of those original school buildings remain. One of \nthose remaining buildings is in the Second Congressional District. The \nonly Rosenwald school to be built in Perry County, the Bigelow \nRosenwald School, was constructed in 1926.\n  After 38 years of service toward education, the Bigelow Rosenwald \nSchool was transformed into a community center. With a revival of \ninterest in and knowledge about the schools, efforts are being formed \naround the country to restore these embodiments of our history.\n  Aviva Kempner's documentary ``Rosenwald'' pays tribute to the man, \nhis work, and the rippling impact on the evolution of African American \neducation in our country.\n  As we celebrate Black History Month, I rise to recognize how far we \nhave come, how far we still must traverse, and pay a special salute to \nJulius Rosenwald and his contributions to the advancement of education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H898-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE EXTENDED DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention again to the \ndevastating drought that has impacted California for over 4 years.\n  Much is said about California and the success that we have had post-\nWorld War II, but a lot of it is owed to the fact that we have \ndeveloped a water system, both a Federal and State water project, that \nallows us to move water throughout California for beneficial use to \nevery region of California, and that has been a great success.\n  But today that water system is broken. It is broken because it was \ndesigned to meet the needs of 20 million people and the agriculture \nthat we had in the 1960s and 1970s. Today we have over 40 million \npeople in California, we have more intensive agriculture, producing \nhalf the Nation's fruits and vegetables--the leading agricultural State \nin the Nation--and demands for water for the environment that was not \npart of the project in the beginning.\n  I have made and will continue to make it a priority to speak on the \nHouse floor regularly regarding the devastating drought impacts and \nwill attempt to offer solutions both for the State and Federal agencies \nto maximize our ability to move water through the system where it is \nmost needed to ensure that we also make the changes at the Federal \nlevel and at the State level to fix this magnificent but broken water \nsystem today that no longer can meet all of the demands and needs that \nare subscribed for it.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Protecting and securing a reliable water supply in the San Joaquin \nValley is arguably the most important issue facing the region of 4 \nmillion people that I, along with four of my other colleagues, \nrepresent. We worry every day about job security and the future success \nof the San Joaquin Valley's economy, which are directly dependent upon \nour access to a reliable and secure supply of water that is of high \nquality. The people of the valley and the entire State of California \nhave been directly impacted by this devastating drought in one way or \nanother.\n  There are many examples of how the San Joaquin Valley, a place I \nrepresent, has been impacted:\n  Over 6,000 acres of productive agricultural land has been fallowed, \nunplanted.\n  The land in the San Joaquin Valley is subsiding because, out of \ndevastating need, families are drilling deeper wells to meet their \neveryday needs to keep what land they can in production and permanent \ncrops irrigated, and farmers are pumping groundwater at unsustainable \nrates to avoid the catastrophic impacts of pulling out hundreds of \nmillions of dollars' worth of permanent crops.\n  Unemployment in the San Joaquin Valley is twice as high as the rest \nof the country; and in 2015 alone, California lost $2.2 billion as a \nresult of the drought.\n  These devastating impacts have brought many of us to pray for rain \nand snow in the mountains, but that is not enough. We need to fix this \nbroken water system.\n  While we will continue to hope for the El Nino year to bring \nadditional rainfall amounts that are significantly greater than \naverage, we know that that is not enough.\n  With above-average rainfall and snow in the mountains, San Joaquin \nValley communities and farmers can now rest easy; right? Sadly, no. \nSince October 1, 2015, over 3.4 million acre-feet of water has gone out \ninto the ocean. That is water that could be used in the valley and in \nsouthern California. This is nearly 1.1 trillion gallons of water. To \nput that number in context, an average American family uses around 400 \ngallons of water a day.\n  My point is that only a small amount of water is being pumped out of \nthe delta to move south for the San Joaquin Valley to assist the farm \ncommunities, as well as for southern California. We have yet to recover \nfrom the devastating impacts of the drought over the last 4 years, even \nthough we have got more water this year as a result of the El Nino \nconditions.\n  The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation announced recently that, even with \nwell-above average rainfall, reservoirs in California are still below \nthe 15-year average for this time of year, and there is no Federal \nwater stored in a major reservoir, the San Luis Reservoir, for the San \nJoaquin Valley that would be available for water this summer.\n  Yet, this week, we were devastated to hear that the Bureau of \nReclamation is releasing 200,000 acre-feet out of Folsom Lake because \nof flood control purposes. We are not moving that water--not even \n100,000 acre-feet--through the system. That is just not right. This is \ndirectly due to the unwillingness of State and Federal agencies to pump \nwater at the maximum levels based the biological opinions that many of \nus believe are flawed because the science is at least 10 years old.\n  While weather patterns have had a great impact on the delivery of \nwater over the last 4 years, it has only been one of the impacts. We \nmust make a difference. We must fix this broken water system. I will \ncontinue to update the Members of the House on the challenges we face \nand on legislation that is important to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H898-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H898-H899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING ALLAN BOWLES ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of his retirement on February \n29, 2016, I rise to thank Allan Bowles for over 32 years of outstanding \nservice to the United States House of Representatives.\n  Allan began his career in the labor division on September 1, 1983. \nShortly after that, he worked as a storeroom clerk. Not long after \nthat, he made his way into the cabinet shop and began his rapid assent \nthrough the ranks from apprentice to journeyman cabinetmaker.\n  He can be proud of the many projects that were successfully completed \nduring his tenure. Some of these projects include custom cabinets made \nfor Speaker Wright and Members in leadership, such as Mr. Hoyer, Mr. \nArmy, and Ms. Pelosi.\n  Allan's list of accomplishments is indeed long. In over 32 years, he \nhas produced some of the most exemplary and useful projects, many of \nwhich are still being utilized today.\n\n[[Page H899]]\n\n  Allan's cabinetmaking expertise and craftsmanship are evident in his \nbody of work. He has worked tirelessly alongside other House employees \nto make the House more secure following the events of September 11 and \nthe anthrax incident of 2001.\n  His reputation in the shop for lighthearted humor and quick wit made \nfor long-lasting friendships and camaraderie in the shop. He brought a \nunique brand of comedy and teamwork to the cabinet shop, which serves \nthe House from behind the scenes.\n  He made a long-term commitment to excellence and improved services to \nthe House community. In addition, Allan's dedication to his craft and \ncustomer service skills made him an extremely valuable member of the \nservice team. Allan has dedicated his life to making the CAO and the \nUnited States House of Representatives a better place.\n  After his retirement from the House, he plans to enjoy country \nliving, fishing, and hunting. He also plans to keep busy working in his \nown shop in southern Maryland.\n  On behalf of the entire House community, I extend our congratulations \nto Allan Bowles for his dedication and outstanding contributions to the \nUnited States House of Representatives. We wish him many wonderful \nyears in fulfilling his retirement dreams.\n\n\n              Honoring Anthony Thompson on His Retirement\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of his retirement on March 3, \n2016, I rise to thank Anthony Thompson for over 34 years of outstanding \nservice to the United States House of Representatives.\n  Anthony began his career with the House, in November 1981, as an \napprentice cabinetmaker in the House cabinet shop. Over the next 34 \nyears, he was promoted to various positions, to include lead \ncabinetmaker, or ``third man''; assistant foreman; and eventually \nbecame manager of the House cabinet shop. His accomplishments are far \ntoo lengthy to list in this tribute; however, there are two examples of \nhis contributions that are worthy of recognition.\n  Anthony designed and constructed the first offsite House floor \nfurniture set which may be used, heaven forbid, in the event that the \nHouse Chamber is unavailable for use. He has been instrumental in the \ndesign and construction of all the succeeding sets of furniture as \nwell.\n  He was also involved in the design and construction of the House \nfloor stenographer's table that sits to my right. The table was \ndesigned with new technology in mind, while still matching the original \ndesign, look, and feel of the existing dais.\n  On a more personal note and equally worthy of recognition, Anthony \nhas dedicated his life to making the CAO and the United States House of \nRepresentatives a better place. He has passed along his many years of \ncabinetmaking experience to staff and coworkers so that they can \ncontinue the extremely high standards of quality craftsmanship that \nhave come to be expected of the House cabinet shop. Upon his \nretirement, he plans to use his extraordinary talents continuing to \nmake beautiful, one-of-a-kind pieces of furniture for the private \nsector.\n  On behalf of the entire House community, I extend our congratulations \nto Anthony for his many years of dedication and outstanding \ncontributions to the United States House of Representatives. I am \nhonored to call him a friend, and I wish him all the best in the years \nto follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H899-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ANDREW JACKSON LANGUAGE ACADEMY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight and \npay tribute to one of Chicago's most effective public schools, the \nAndrew Jackson Language Academy.\n  Andrew Jackson was opened in 1894 to serve children from the crowded \ntenement community surrounding the Polk Street station, a port of entry \nfor immigrants. That very same year, one of the first public school \nkindergartens was established in Chicago. Since 1981, this school has \noffered foreign language instruction to its students.\n  In 1988, Andrew Jackson Language Academy moved into a new, up-to-date \nfacility. The building is equipped with science and computer labs, a \nlibrary, media center, and a large outside area for play and gardening \nactivities.\n  Today 550 students from diverse racial, ethnic, and religious \nbackgrounds attend the school. Students at Jackson receive extensive \ninstruction in Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. The \ncurriculum not only emphasizes the skill of understanding and using \nthese languages, but also introduces students to the geography, \nhistory, and tradition of other cultures. As a result, students are \nmore adequately prepared for the international marketplace and for \nsuccess in the 21st century.\n  The Andrew Jackson Language Academy is a well-organized, safe, and \norderly school with an excellent student code of conduct, and the dress \ncode has been developed to promote a suitable learning environment. It \nhas a wealth of school spirit, which is promoted through the Merit \nClub, family reading night, Project Backpack for the Homeless, musical \nperformances, student ambassadors, Big Sisters and Big Brothers, a \nChinese painting workshop, and the Weigi workshop. French and Italian \nshops are ongoing. Japanese students are learning to work in class, and \nSpanish students from kindergarten through eighth grade are working \nhard on building their Spanish skills.\n  The Dads Club at Jackson is very active and sponsors a number of \nfamily events such as the annual basketball fundraiser, family skate \nnight, the daddy-daughter dance, and a number of other ways for dads to \nbe involved.\n  The Andrew Jackson Language Academy has a very strong and actively \nengaged local school council. Its chairperson is Ms. Angela Bryant; \nprincipal, Ms. Marilou Rebolledo; secretary, Ms. Margaret Kempster; \nmembers, Mr. Kevin Lopez, Ms. Mary Clare Maxwell, Ms. Tara Roden, Mr. \nJeff Sadoff, Mr. Luis Oviedo, and Mr. Stephen Smith.\n  The parents council at Jackson Language Academy is actively engaged \nand involved, led by Heather Alvarez, president; vice president, Rubi \nAlvarez; recording secretary, Emerlie Ilarde; Virgil Nita; and \ntreasurer, Pamela Alfaro.\n  I commend and congratulate all of those who work to make and keep the \nAndrew Jackson Language Academy the great Chicago public school that it \nis.\n  Someone--perhaps a philosopher--once said: It takes great souls to \nmake great schools. We thank all of those who have been involved in \nmaking the Andrew Jackson Language Academy the great school that it is. \nIt takes great souls to make great schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H899-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H899-H900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A FALLEN OFFICER REMEMBERED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of \nfallen St. Joseph, Minnesota, police officer Brian Klinefelter. It has \nbeen 20 years now since Brian was killed in the line of duty, and this \nloss is still felt in our community today.\n  On a cold night in January, Officer Klinefelter was nearing the end \nof his shift when he heard of an armed robbery over the radio dispatch \nand decided to help his fellow officers pursue the robbers. Not long \nafter, Officer Klinefelter was tragically shot and killed in his brave \nattempt to protect his colleagues and the community he loved.\n  The men and women in blue are some of the finest this Nation has to \noffer, and Officer Brian Klinefelter is proof of that. Every morning \nthey put on their uniforms, not knowing if they will safely return to \ntheir loved ones at the end of the day. The sacrifices they make are \ndone because of their selfless love of country, community, and \nneighbors.\n  The night Brian was killed, he left behind his wife, Wendy; his \nnewborn daughter, Katelyn; along with numerous family members and \nfriends. Wendy and Katelyn, we haven't forgotten you, and we have not \nforgotten Brian--the incredible life he lived and the brave sacrifice \nthat he made.\n\n[[Page H900]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H900-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1045\n        FREE HOUSTON METRO HOT LANE ACCESS FOR DISABLED VETERANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this morning I spent some time, and \nlast evening, communicating with leaders of my transit system, Houston \nMETRO, that has received numerous awards; and I applaud them for \nworking very hard, sometimes against odds, to provide mobility for the \ngreat citizens of the Houston, Harris County, metroplex area.\n  I had a particular beef, or a particular issue, that we have been \nworking on since last November, and that is to give disabled veterans \nin this very vast territory of Texas the ability to ride on what we \ncall the HOT lanes for free.\n  My premise is simple. When we ask our men and women in the United \nStates to put the uniform on, we ask, with no qualifications, meaning \nno restraints, that they are expected to defend the United States to \nthe utmost. In the course of that, some fall in battle, lose their \nlives, or are veterans who ultimately come to their demise by their age \nand illnesses. Therefore, I think it is enormously important that, when \nthey make a request that helps them in their mobility, whether it is to \ndoctors' offices and family or going back to school, there should be no \nbarriers, no restraints.\n  So today my METRO board is meeting, and I made contact again, as I \ndid this past week, with the committee, late into the night, to say \nthat there should be no delay, no barrier in allowing those lanes to be \nused for free by disabled vets.\n  I want this in the Record because I will pursue and persist, even to \nthe extent that an emergency board meeting will need to be called. \nThere just simply is no reason to delay. November, December, January, \nFebruary, and near March, there is no reason to delay.\n  I am waiting for the decision, and I will look forward to the \nDisabled Veterans of America and others reaching out to my office so \nthat together, collectively, we can make sure that not only does this \nhappen in Houston, Texas, but that it be a policy across America.\n  We should find a way to be able to assist those who have willingly, \nwithout any hesitancy, and unselfishly, put on the uniform.\n\n\n              Respect for the Three Branches of Government\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to turn the attention of my \ncolleagues to another issue of justice, and that is the fair existence \nof and respect for the three branches of government.\n  This involves vets and nurses and schools and school teachers and \nfamilies across America. It is a process that the Congress goes through \nevery year. We call it the budgeting process; and it is an act of \nCongress and the administration, we hope, working together.\n  That is the time that the Congress works on the plan for the American \npeople; and it is, of course, the time when the President works on the \nplan for the American people. It includes reports like this, an \neconomic report of the President. It includes the budget, which is the \nroadmap for the American people.\n  Let me be very clear. We are all elected; but there is one person--in \nthis instance, one man--that has been elected by all of the people, and \nhe has submitted a budget.\n  I would not ever imagine in my tenure in Congress that we would have \nthis Congress overlook a 41-year tradition for the American people, on \ntheir behalf, whether you are for it or against it: the right of the \nrepresentative of the President, in this instance, Shaun Donovan, the \nPresident's Budget Director, to make his presentation before the United \nStates Congress.\n  If I were not standing on this floor, Mr. Speaker, I might simply \nbreak down and cry, because I love this institution. I love the \nconstitutional processes documented in the Constitution of the three \nseparate branches of government. We have often disagreed, but we have \nand should never disrespect.\n  G. William Hoagland, who was the Republican staff director at the \nSenate Budget Committee for much of the 1980s and 1990s, now senior \nvice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, could not recall a \nyear, since the Martin budget process took effect in the 1970s, when a \nPresident's Budget Director was not invited to testify, Republican or \nDemocrat.\n  While the last budget of an outgoing President is usually \naspirational and sets a tone for what he or she hopes will be followed \nup by, it is not and has not been a time to not see the President's \nbudget. The President's budget is good for education and job creation \nand national security, and it does not cut, as the Republican budget \ndoes, Mr. Speaker, 46 percent in education.\n  Where is our collegiality?\n  Shame on us. Let the President's man speak on the budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H900-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He was an extraordinary lawyer. \nDuring my years as a Superior Court judge, Earl appeared before my \ncourt on many occasions. He treated each case as unique, exceptional in \nhis scholarship, compassionate for his clients.\n  At the time of his passing, Attorney Brown was a candidate for \nDistrict Court judge, a position he wanted to achieve so very much.

Mr. Speaker, 10 days ago Congress \nexpected the President to submit his plan to counter the rise of \nIslamic terrorism in the Middle East. American families deserve to know \nthat the President has a strategy to defeat ISIL and keep us safe.\n  The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act signed by the President \nwas clear that the President must submit a plan to Congress by February \n15 on how to defeat ISIL and reduce risks to American families.\n  Sadly, the President has not presented a strategy. This is another \nexample of the President's continued disregard for law and the \nConstitution. We should support our troops by giving them a clear \nmission and a clear strategy to protect American families.\n  While I am disappointed that the President has failed to submit a \nstrategy, we cannot be surprised, after he dismissed ISIL as the JV \nteam. He claimed ISIL was contained just 1 day before the Paris \nslaughter, and he incorrectly assured Americans to be confident just as \nthe mass murder was beginning in San Bernardino by ISIL terrorists.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H901-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING AWARD-WINNING ARTIST HARRY DAVIS\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS.

The \nPresident's plan is lacking key details required under the law, \nincluding the exact cost and location of an alternate detention \nfacility.\n  On the same day that the President announced his plan, Spanish and \nMoroccan police arrested four suspected members of a jihadi cell that \nsought to recruit fighters for Islamic State, including one individual \ndescribed as a former Guantanamo detainee who once fought with \nmilitants in Afghanistan.\n  President Obama's stubborn insistence on fulfilling an ill-advised \ncampaign promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay \ndistracts from ongoing threats to American national security and \nhighlights the failures of his foreign policy agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H901-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AFRICAN AMERICAN POVERTY\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Democratic Whip Task Force on \nPoverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, I rise to commemorate \nBlack History Month and highlight the disproportionate impacts of \npoverty on the African American community.\n  Sadly, our Nation has a long history of individual and institutional \nracism, from slavery and Jim Crow to redlining and overpolicing. This \nhas locked many, many families out of opportunities, even with the \nenormous progress that we have made with our great civil rights leaders \nand foot soldiers whom we honored yesterday.\n  These deplorable disparities and inequalities continue at every level \nof our society. For example, the African American poverty rate is 26 \npercent, nearly triple the poverty rate of White Americans. One in \nthree African American children lives in poverty.\n  The unemployment rate in the African American community is more than \n8 percent, twice the unemployment rate of White Americans. The median \nwealth of White households is 13 times the median wealth of African \nAmerican households, the widest gap since 1989.\n  Poverty doesn't just hurt African American families. We know that \ncommunities of color are two times more likely to live in poverty and \ntoo many rural White and Native Americans have felt persistent poverty \nfor generations.\n  These statistics paint a clear and stark picture that Congress cannot \nignore. We need to get serious about ending poverty and giving \neveryone, including African Americans and people of color, an \nopportunity to live the American Dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H901-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H901-H902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM AMOS ``BILL'' USHER\n\n  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DENHAM.

Mr. Speaker, the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act \nprevents the President from closing the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay unless he submits a plan that receives congressional \napproval. He has not. This week President Obama submitted the plan to \nclose the prison anyway.\n  There are currently 91 detainees at Guantanamo Bay. There were 242 \nwhen the President took office. His plan calls for transferring 35 of \nthe remaining detainees to other countries.\n  These detainees have been cleared for transfer by the relevant \nnational security agencies. Approximately 60 detainees will be \ntransferred to facilities in the United States on our own soil. These \nare not even specified in the plan.\n  The Department of Defense has identified many potential sites, but \nagain this has not received congressional approval. Construction for a \nnew facility on American soil would cost nearly half a billion dollars.\n  With all these things going on, with the former GTMO detainees being \nre-arrested for recruiting new ISIS members and an expiration of the \ntimeline for developing an ISIS plan to defeat ISIS, this is a \nmisplaced priority by the President.\n  We need to stick to the business of what is going to keep our country \nsafe, not fulfill some campaign promise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H902-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                     FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA WEEK\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, I rise today in recognition of Future \nFarmers of America, or FAA, Week.\n  Earlier this week, the Nation marked the birthday of our first \nPresident, George Washington. Since 1948, the week of Washington's \nbirthday has also been FAA Week due to the President's legacy as an \nagriculturalist and a farmer.\n  Agriculture is a key to not only the history and heritage of our \nNation, but also to Pennsylvania and to our Commonwealth's Fifth \nCongressional District. It is important that we help the future leaders \nof this industry continue to grow, ensuring that the future of \nagriculture is just as bright as its present and past.\n  ``I believe in the future of agriculture'' are the first words from \nthe FFA creed. Earlier this year, I met with FAA members from across \nPennsylvania, at the Pennsylvania Farm Show, where I held a forum \nfocused on agriculture issues. I was impressed with their knowledge of \nissues currently impacting farming across the Nation and was inspired \nby their vision for the future. Echoing the words of the FAA creed, I \nam sure that, with the dedication of FAA members across the Nation, the \nfuture of agriculture is in good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H902-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GUANTANAMO BAY PRISONER TRANSFERS\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. OLSON.

His reason? A political campaign promise he made nearly \none decade ago is more important than keeping Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \nbehind bars.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people want Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's last \nbreath to be in prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about legislation that \nmy colleagues and I recently introduced that works to restore our \narticle I powers of the Constitution.\n  We all learned about separation of powers in our grade school civics \nclass. As you know, this separation protects that one branch of \ngovernment doesn't overrule or overstep another. It also ensures that \nthe power of the American people is never diminished.\n  Article I specifically grants legislative powers to Congress, as \nCongress was established to be the most direct voice of the people. We \nare the people's House. It seems the President simply chooses to ignore \nthis.\n  I have consistently heard from folks in the 12th District who are \nsick and tired of this administration overstepping its boundaries and \noverstaying its welcome in their lives. Americans--myself included--are \nfrustrated with an executive branch that goes around Congress to create \nnew rules and regulations daily.\n  My biggest disappointment as a new Member of Congress is our lack of \nauthority to carry out the will of the American people in this House. \nAs an original cosponsor of H.R. 613, I strongly support this \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to join me in restoring and \nrespecting the most sacred document in our Nation's history--our \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page H903]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H903-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana.

Walker, a visionary leader who rose \nfrom being orphaned at age 7 to becoming an accomplished entrepreneur \nof hair care products and a prolific philanthropist in the Indianapolis \ncommunity. She was also America's first self-made female millionaire;\n  Or Emma Christy, Indianapolis' first female police officer, who \npatrolled the city's streets with the department's all-female unit, the \nlargest in the world in 1921;\n  Or the 1955 Crispus Attucks State Championship basketball team.

Mr. Speaker, the United States is blessed with nearly 30 \npercent of the world's coal reserves--more than twice that of the \nnearest coal reserve country, Russia, and three times as much as China.\n  Colorado is America's 10th leading coal producer. In Colorado's Third \nCongressional District, mines in communities like Craig and Delta \nprovide critical jobs and tax revenues as they responsibly produce \nreliable, affordable electricity on which countless Americans rely.\n  One thing is certain: the people who work in Colorado's mines and \ncoal-fired power plants take great pride in their communities and the \nnatural environment. They want to develop the land's abundant resources \nas responsibly as possible with as small a footprint as possible.\n  I do not support the President's Clean Power Plan and have voted to \nstop this onerous Federal overreach multiple times. However, as \nindustry continuously searches for safer and more efficient ways to \nproduce energy, we will need to incentivize the improvement of \ntechnology.

While recovery is certainly possible, early detection and \nintervention is key. Unfortunately, many people are unfamiliar with the \nsigns typically associated with an eating disorder.\n  This is why I introduced a bipartisan bill with several of my female \ncolleagues, H.R. 4153, the Educating to Prevent Eating Disorders Act. \nIt would create a pilot program in middle schools to begin educating \nschool counselors, teachers, and nurses about the symptoms of eating \ndisorders.\n  The facts are clear: education and early detection save lives.

Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, House Resolution 619, providing for consideration of \nH.R. 2406, the SHARE Act, also commonly known as the sportsmen's bill.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2406 under a structured \nrule, with 17 amendments made in order that are roughly evenly split \nbetween Democratic and Republican members of this legislative body.\n  Mr. Speaker, the SHARE Act is an important bipartisan package of \nproposals that will promote greater opportunities for hunting, fishing, \nand outdoor recreation, as well as safeguard the rights of hunters, \nanglers, and recreational shooters.\n  While similar bills have passed the House in the past two Congresses, \nthe Senate has failed to adopt them, making this legislation long \noverdue. This is especially true when considering the current \nadministration's ongoing assault on the Second Amendment, as well as \ntheir restrictions on access to Federal land. This includes restricting \nhunting and shooting on Federal lands,\n\n[[Page H904]]\n\nwhere many people go to participate in these time-honored American \nactivities.\n  The Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation recently stated that roughly \n37 million American sportsmen and -women spend over $90 billion \nannually on outdoor sport activities, highlighting the important \neconomic impact this legislation will have on small businesses across \nthe country that comprise our recreational industries.\n  Mr. Speaker, these outdoor activities are deeply ingrained in \nAmerica's heritage and culture, with the values they instill passed \ndown from generation to generation. In fact, according to a 2013 \nCongressional Sportsmen's Foundation report, hunting, fishing, and \nshooting are growing in popularity throughout the country, with almost \n40 million people over the age of 16 hunting or fishing in the United \nStates. However, over the past 7 years, we have seen the Federal \nGovernment continually find ways to block law-abiding Americans from \nexercising this most fundamental right. People all across my State of \ncentral Washington are avid hunters, anglers, and outdoorsmen. Many \nAmericans, especially in the West, look to our vast Federal lands to \nhunt, fish, and shoot.\n  Unfortunately, over the past few years, we have seen Federal agencies \nsuch as the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management \nprevent or impede access to Federal lands which should otherwise be \navailable for these purposes. Lack of access to acceptable areas to \nparticipate in these activities is often one of the main reasons why \nsportsmen and -women stop participating in these traditional American \npastimes. Ensuring the public has reliable access to our Nation's \nFederal lands must remain a priority of this Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should be fostering and growing participation in \noutdoor sporting activities--rather than trying to create regulatory \nbarriers that drive Americans away from them--which instill important \nlifelong values and principles.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  These include responsibility, firearm safety and conservation, as \nwell as patience, discipline, respect for wildlife, and most of all, \nappreciation of our country's rich natural heritage and beautiful \nnational parks, forests, and vast wilderness areas.\n  H.R. 2406 is critical to protecting our way of life and ensuring all \nAmericans have the ability to enjoy outdoor recreation and develop a \nprofound appreciation for our country's marvelous natural landscapes.\n  This legislation is comprised of a number of provisions that will \nhelp provide future generations of Americans with access to our \ncountry's Federal lands for outdoor recreation, sport shooting, \nhunting, and fishing.\n  The measure will also reaffirm the Second Amendment rights of \nAmericans to lawfully carry firearms on Federal lands.\n  Additionally, it will help prevent Federal overreach, eliminate \nregulatory impediments, and protect against the promulgation of new, \nonerous regulations that impede access or restrict lawful activities on \nFederal lands.\n  Sportsmen are natural stewards of public lands and greatly contribute \nto habitat and wildlife conservation, so I find it difficult to \nunderstand the rationale behind many of these Federal decisions.\n  Mr. Speaker, the SHARE Act also includes legislation that I \nintroduced, the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, or FLTFA, \nwhich authorizes the BLM to sell surplus lands to States, localities, \nor private entities that can be put then to economically beneficial \nuse.\n  Since its initial enactment, FLTFA reduced Federal land ownership by \nmore than 9,000 acres over the course of a decade, while also enhancing \naccess for hunting, fishing, and shooting on these Federal lands.\n  This critical program brings a commonsense approach to land \ntransactions and helps streamline land ownership patterns, all without \nspending taxpayer funds or adding to the surplus of federally owned \nproperty.\n  Additionally, the bill includes the Recreational Land Self-Defense \nAct, legislation that protects the ability of gun owners to exercise \ntheir Second Amendment rights when they are legally camping, hunting, \nand/or fishing on property owned by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Like many in Central Washington, I grew up responsibly exercising the \nright to bear arms, and I am a longstanding advocate for the protection \nof those rights, which is why I am proud to cosponsor this bill.\n  In my district, access to Federal lands is of paramount importance, \nand the SHARE Act will ensure that sportsmen, outdoorsmen, and all \nAmericans wishing to enjoy our treasured Federal parks and forests have \nthe ability to do so.\n  For this reason, I have also introduced an amendment to the SHARE Act \nthat would require the U.S. Forest Service to publish a notice in the \nFederal Register, along with a justification for the closure of any \npublic road in our forests.\n  In Central Washington and across our country, the Forest Service has \nclosed public roads with no prior notification, preventing access to \npublic areas in our region's national forests. Often, these blocked \nroadways have been in use for decades, and many local residents rely on \nthem for both everyday activities as well as for recreational purposes.\n  The first indication of a closure should not come when an individual \nis faced with an impassable roadway, but, rather, through an adequate \npublic notice from the Forest Service, which my amendment would \nprovide.\n  Our country has a deep and longstanding tradition of using Federal \nland for outdoor and recreational activities, and protecting the \nability of Americans to use our abundant Federal lands for these \npurposes must remain one of our top priorities in Congress, which is \nwhy I am committed to working with my colleagues in the House and in \nthe Senate to advance this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, for generations Americans have passed down these values \nto their children and to their grandchildren, which have deeply \ningrained hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting in America's \nheritage and our cultural fabric.\n  As I said, growing up in Central Washington, I experienced the \nimportance of these values firsthand, and they continue to play an \nimportant role in my life to this very day.\n  The rule we consider here today provides for consideration of \nlegislation that will protect these values, increase opportunities for \nhunters, anglers, and shooters, and ensure that future generations of \nAmericans have equal opportunity to access and enjoy our Nation's vast \npublic lands.\n  This is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the consideration \nof a critically important measure. I support the rule's adoption, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the rule as well as the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the gentleman, my colleague on the Rules Committee, for \nyielding the customary 30 minutes to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, for months, the Chamber's majority has been bringing \nrecycled bills to the floor to stall and waste time, knowing full well \nthese bills will not be signed into law.\n  The majority has introduced no budget. Our infrastructure is \ncrumbling. Americans are in need of new bridges, new roads, new water \nsystems, schools, housing, and much more.\n  It has been said that it costs an estimated $24 million to run the \nHouse of Representatives for a week, money basically wasted when we do \nbills like these.\n  As a matter of fact, I think if we were to add up all that money, we \nmight even be able to do high-speed rail in the United States.\n  Wouldn't that be a new venture?\n  The majority has sidestepped addressing the high cost of a college \neducation and the student loan debt crisis. They have put their heads \nin the sand concerning the threat of the Zika virus.\n  We have done nothing about the century-old water pipes crisscrossing \nthe country, even in light of the tragedy in Flint. No wonder Americans \nare so disgusted and angry. Instead of focusing on what people are \ncrying out for, we now bring up this whole package of bills that has no \nchance of advancing.\n\n[[Page H905]]\n\n  Today we have the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement \nAct. It advances an anti-conservation agenda at odds with the decades \nof longstanding tradition benefiting our uniquely American landscapes, \nwildlife, and sporting community.\n  The SHARE Act cobbles together seven separate legislative proposals, \nalong with six other titles. Now, that is some seamstress work. It is a \ngrab bag that includes provisions that would undermine the Wilderness \nAct, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other essential \nconservation laws.\n  What's more, the SHARE Act would drive the extinction of domestic and \ninternational wildlife by adding language that would block the \nadministration's efforts under the Endangered Species Act to stop ivory \ntrafficking--it basically says that you can, if you go on a safari, \nbring back elephant tusks because they are not in any danger, despite \nwhat we all hear to the contrary--and to prevent the slaughter of \nAmerican elephants, which is necessary to get those tusks.\n\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wouldn't be able to stop the \nillegal ivory trade, and the importation of polar bears would be made \npossible again.\n  But I think one of the worst things is it brings back the traps that \ncaptured so many of people's pets, small animals who died a very cruel \nand long death. Why in the world would we do that? What is sporting \nabout catching an animal, sometimes a person, or a pet, in something \nfrom which they cannot extricate themselves, and to suffer and to die?\n  Let's be clear. This bill undermines bedrock conservation laws. It \nwon't benefit the average hunter or angler. People going on safaris \nmight get something more out of it, like elephant tusks, but it will \ndestroy years of work done by animal protection advocates and \nconservationists. The delicate balance at work in our ecosystem's food \nchain is not to be trifled with, and we disrupt it at our own peril.\n  Aside from rolling back decades of work conserving our majestic \nnatural resources, the bill is a distraction from what we should be \ndoing.\n  May I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle of a piece \nof wisdom from Teddy Roosevelt, America's favorite outdoorsman and \nactually the person who is responsible for the wonderful national parks \nthat we have.\n  He said, and I quote: ``We are prone to speak of the resources of \nthis country as inexhaustible; this is not so.''\n  If he had this worry that we have today here, 100 years ago, I can \nonly imagine what he would think of this state of affairs.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule and a ``no'' vote on the underlying \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just respond that certainly there are many issues facing \nCongress today, many important things that we have to consider in many \nissue areas, but that should not preclude us from addressing a very \nimportant issue, and that is access to our national, our Federal lands \nby sportsmen, by hunters, by fishers.\n  Protecting the ability of Americans to enjoy our natural abundance of \nFederal lands, I think, is something that our President Roosevelt, who \nthe distinguished gentlewoman from New York quoted, would be very much \nin favor of. Certainly he was a proponent of enjoying those same \nFederal lands.\n  Any efforts that we can put forth to make sure that we can continue \nthose strong traditions of Americans being exposed to the great \noutdoors in this country is something that we should do all we can to \npreserve.\n  I might note, too, that this is a bipartisan-led effort in the House \nof Representatives. Passed in the last two Congresses, many of the \nprovisions of this bill have enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support, \nand this year we do have a clear path forward, as the committees in the \nother body across the rotunda are already marking up very similar \nlegislation in their work on this important issue.\n  So I feel very positive about the direction we are taking, about the \nbipartisan nature of the effort that we have here before us today, and \nI think it is an important thing that we need to address, as well as \nmany of the other things that the gentlewoman from New York discussed. \nBut certainly this is something that we can and should move forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up a resolution that will require the \nmajority to stop the partisan games and hold hearings on the \nPresident's budget proposal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, just out of courtesy to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York, I do have one Member who would like to speak on this \nbill, if that is okay with you.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Of course.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. So, with that, I would be very happy to yield such time \nas he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek).\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2406, the \nSportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act of 2015, or the \nSHARE Act.\n  The SHARE Act has 13 important provisions that will work to expand \nopportunities for sportsmen and -women to enjoy their favorite outdoor \nactivities around the country.\n  Title II of this bill, which I authored, is the Recreational Fishing \nand Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act. I grew up in northern \nMichigan and, like many of my constituents, spent my summers fishing \nand the fall hunting grouse in the UP woods.\n  These traditions--spending quality time outdoors with our kids and \ngrandkids--are the kinds of things we must make sure are preserved for \ngenerations to come.\n  This portion of the SHARE Act seeks to create an open until closed \npolicy for sportsmen's use of Federal lands.\n  As you know, nearly one-quarter of the United States landmass, or \nover 500 million acres, are Federal lands that are owned by all \nAmericans. It is important that the right to fully utilize these lands \nis ensured for future generations.\n  Over the years, legislative ambiguity has allowed antihunting groups \nto pursue an antihunting agenda that has eliminated opportunities for \nmany of these activities on our Federal lands. Groups like these are \ntaking advantage of loopholes in the law to deprive our constituents of \nthe right to fully use Federal lands.\n  Recreational anglers, hunters, and sporting organizations, many of \nwhom have endorsed this bill, are passionate supporters of the \nconservation movement. These dedicated sportsmen and -women deserve to \nknow that the land they cherish will not be closed off to hunting, \nfishing, and shooting for future generations.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. Both Presidents Clinton and Bush issued \nexecutive orders recognizing the value of these heritage activities. It \nis time we finally close the loopholes, firm up the language, and make \nsure that future generations will always be able to enjoy the outdoors, \nhunting, fishing, shooting, or just taking a walk in the woods.\n  I encourage all my colleagues today to join me in supporting this \npiece of commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York \n(Ms. Slaughter) for an opportunity to respond, since she already \nyielded back her time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. That is very kind of the gentleman, but I continue to \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I do have one more speaker who would like \nto say a few words on this issue.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the \nsponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support today's rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join with Sportsmen's Caucus Co-chair Tim \nWalz\n\n[[Page H906]]\n\nand Caucus Vice Chairs Jeff Duncan and Gene Green in introducing H.R. \n2406, the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, better \nknown as the SHARE Act.\n  This bipartisan package of legislation protects and advances hunting, \nangling, and recreational shooting traditions and also promotes fish \nand wildlife conservation efforts.\n  The SHARE Act passed the House of Representatives in both the 113th \nand 112th Congress with bipartisan support, and in October 2015 the \nNatural Resources Committee voted 21-15 in favor of the bill.\n  In addition, H.R. 2406 is supported by the Nation's leading hunting \nand fishing conservation organizations, which represent millions of \nsportsmen and -women across the Nation.\n  This commonsense proposal will expand opportunities for hunting and \nfishing and promote conservation across the United States, particularly \non Federal lands. In many parts of the country, American sportsmen and \n-women rely on access to Federal lands to hunt, fish, and \nrecreationally shoot.\n  This bill would expand access to these lands by requiring the Bureau \nof Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to keep lands open for \nhunting, fishing, and recreational shooting unless there is a specific \nreason to close them.\n  The bill also requires the National Park Service or Office of \nNational Marine Sanctuaries to consult with State fish and wildlife \nagencies prior to closing areas to fishing, and allows State fish and \nwildlife agencies the added flexibility needed to construct public \nshooting ranges.\n  The SHARE Act also protects Second Amendment rights. It ensures the \nrights of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms on lands and waters \nmanaged by the United States Corps of Engineers, which is consistent \nwith rights afforded on other Federal public lands. The bill also \nprevents the Environmental Protection Agency from unnecessarily \nregulating ammunition and fishing tackle.\n  As an avid sportsman, I am humbled to advocate for this commonsense \nlegislation. I am proud, also, to introduce it in order to advance the \npriorities of American sportsmen and -women.\n  I encourage my colleagues to ensure that America's hunting and \nfishing heritage remains a top priority for the Federal Government for \nyears to come and to pass this critical legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and to support \nH.R. 2406.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me first say I very much appreciate the \ndistinguished gentlewoman's indulgence on allowing folks to speak on \nthis issue. As you can tell, it is very important to a lot of people. \nSo I thank her very much for her polite indulgence.\n  Mr. Speaker, the debate that we have had here today underscores the \nimportance of the legislation that is considered under this rule.\n  I believe we must take a firm stand against executive overreach on \nthe infringement of Americans' constitutional rights to keep and bear \narms by protecting the Second Amendment as well as protecting the \npublic's access to Federal lands for the purposes of hunting, fishing, \nand sports shooting.\n  People all across the country are avid hunters, anglers, and \noutdoorsmen, often utilizing public lands for those purposes, and the \nSHARE Act will ensure that the Federal Government does not restrict \ntheir ability to participate in these activities.\n  Federal lands represent an important and precious national resource \nfor many mixed-use purposes. We must not tolerate efforts by Federal \nagencies such as the Forest Service or the BLM to restrict, impede, or \nprevent access to Federal lands that should otherwise be available for \nuse by our country's outdoor enthusiasts as well as sportsmen and -\nwomen.\n  By adopting this rule, providing for consideration of the underlying \nbill, the House will be taking an important step toward resolving many \nof the long overdue issues facing our country's outdoor recreational \ncommunity.\n  The SHARE Act will allow the values instilled by hunting, fishing, \nand recreational shooting to be passed down to future generations of \nAmericans, just as our parents passed them to many of us.\n  This is particularly important to me because, as a farmer, I consider \nmyself a conservationist, a steward of our resources, and believe we \nhave a responsibility to use our natural resources wisely and with \ncare, preserving them for those who come after.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule allowing for \nconsideration of a long overdue piece of legislation that ensures \nfuture generations have access to our country's Federal lands for \noutdoor recreation and sporting activities.\n  I have certainly appreciated the discussion here today, which \nunderscores the importance of this issue to so many people. I believe \nthis rule and the underlying bill are strong measures that are \nimportant to preserving our Nation's cultural heritage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 619 and \nthe underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 619 Offered by Ms. Slaughter\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 624) \n     Directing the Committee on the Budget to hold a public \n     hearing on the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request \n     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as a \n     witness. The resolution shall be considered as read. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the \n     resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening \n     motion or demand for division of the question except one hour \n     of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of the resolution specified in section 2 of \n     this resolution.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools\n\n[[Page H907]]\n\n     for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and \n     allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer \n     an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H907-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H907-H915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FRAUDULENT JOINDER PREVENTION ACT OF 2016\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3624.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 618 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 3624.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1254\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 3624) to amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent \nfraudulent joinder, with Mr. Graves of Louisiana in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Hardworking Americans are some of the leading victims of frivolous \nlawsuits and the extraordinary costs that our legal system imposes. \nEvery day, local businessowners routinely have lawsuits filed against \nthem, based on claims they have no substantive connection to, as a \nmeans of forum shopping on the part of the lawyers filing the case. \nThese lawsuits impose a tremendous burden on small businesses and their \nemployees. The Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act, introduced by \nJudiciary Committee Member Ken Buck from Colorado, will help reduce the \nlitigation abuse that regularly drags small businesses into court for \nno other reason than as part of a lawyer's forum shopping strategy.\n  In order to avoid the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, plaintiffs' \nattorneys regularly join instate defendants to the lawsuits they file \nin State court, even if the instate defendants' connections to the \ncontroversy are minimal or nonexistent.\n  Typically, the innocent but fraudulently joined instate defendant is \na small business or the owner or employee of a small business. Even \nthough these innocent instate defendants ultimately don't face any \nliability as a result of being named as a defendant, they nevertheless \nhave to spend money to hire a lawyer and take valuable time away from \nrunning their businesses or spending time with their families to deal \nwith matters related to a lawsuit to which they have no real \nconnection.\n  To take just a couple of examples, in Bendy v. C.B. Fleet Company, \nthe plaintiff brought product liability claims against a national \ncompany for its allegedly defective medicinal drink. The plaintiff also \njoined a resident local defendant health clinic alleging it negligently \ninstructed the plaintiff to ingest the drink. The national company \nremoved the case to Federal Court and argued that the small local \ndefendant was fraudulently joined because the plaintiff's claims \nagainst the clinic were time-barred by the statute of limitations, \nshowing ``no possibility'' of recovery.\n  Despite finding the possibility of relief against the local defendant \n``remote,'' the court remanded the case after emphasizing how hard it \nis to demonstrate fraudulent joinder under the current rules. The court \npractically apologized publicly to the joined party, stating: ``The \nfact that Maryland courts are likely to dismiss Bendy's claims against \nthe local defendant is not sufficient for jurisdiction, given the \nFourth Circuit's strict standard for fraudulent joinder.''\n  Shortly after remand, all claims against the local defendant were \ndismissed, of course, after its presence in the lawsuit served the \ntrial lawyer's tactical purpose of keeping the case in their preferred \nState court. When courts themselves complain about the unfairness of \ncurrent court rules, Congress should take notice.\n  In Baumeister v. Home Depot, Home Depot removed a slip-and-fall case \nto Federal Court. The day after removal and before conducting any \ndiscovery, the plaintiff amended the complaint to name a local \nbusiness, which it alleged failed to maintain the store's parking lot. \nThe court found the timing of the amended complaint was ``suspect,'' \nnoting the possibility ``that the sole reason for amending the \ncomplaint to add the local defendant as a defendant . . . could have \nbeen to defeat diversity jurisdiction.''\n  Nevertheless, the court held Home Depot had not met its ``heavy \nburden'' of showing fraudulent joinder under current law because the \ncourt found it was ``possible,'' even if it were just a tenth of a \npercent possible, that ``the newly added defendant could potentially be \nheld liable,'' and remanded the case back to State court. Once back in \nState court, the plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the innocent local \ndefendant from the lawsuit, but only after it had been successfully \nused as a forum shopping pawn.\n  Trial lawyers join these unconnected instate defendants to their \nlawsuits because today a case can be kept in State court by simply \njoining as a defendant a local party that shares the same local \nresidence as the person bringing the lawsuit. When the primary \ndefendant moves to remove the case to Federal Court, the addition of \nthat local defendant will generally defeat removal under a variety of \napproaches judges currently take to determine whether the joined \ndefendant prevents removal to Federal Court.\n  One approach judges take is to require a showing that there is ``no \npossibility of recovery'' against the local defendant before a case can \nbe removed to Federal Court, or some practically equivalent standard. \nOthers require the judge to resolve any doubts regarding removal in \nfavor of the person bringing the lawsuit. Still, others require the \njudge to find that the local defendant was added in bad faith before \nthey allow the case to be removed to Federal Court.\n  The current law is so unfairly heavyhanded against innocent local \nparties joined to lawsuits that Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Harvie \nWilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has publicly supported \ncongressional action to change the standards for joinder, saying: \n``That's exactly the kind of approach to Federal jurisdiction reform \nthat I like because it's targeted. And there is a problem with \nfraudulent jurisdiction law as it exists today, I think, and that is \nthat you have to establish that the joinder of a nondiverse defendant \nis totally ridiculous and that there's no possibility of ever \nrecovering . . . That's very hard to do. So I think making the \nfraudulent joinder law a little bit more realistic . . . appeals to me \nbecause it seems to me the kind of intermediate step that addresses \nsome real problems.''\n  The bill before us today addresses those real problems in two main \nways:\n  First, the bill allows judges greater discretion to free an innocent \nlocal party from a case where the judge finds there is no plausible \ncase against that party. That plausibility standard is the same \nstandard the Supreme Court has said should be used to dismiss pleadings \nfor failing to state a valid legal\n\n[[Page H908]]\n\nclaim, and the same standard should apply to release innocent parties \nfrom lawsuits.\n  Second, the bill allows judges to look at evidence that the trial \nlawyers aren't acting in good faith in adding local defendants. This is \na standard some lower courts already use to determine whether a trial \nlawyer really intends to pursue claims against the local defendant or \nis just using them as part of their forum shopping strategy.\n  This bill is strongly supported by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, representing America's small businesses, and the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, among other legal reform groups.\n  Please join me in supporting this vital legislation to reduce \nlitigation abuse and forum shopping and to protect innocent parties \nfrom costly, extended, and unnecessary litigation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Members of the House, H.R. 3624, the so-called Fraudulent Joinder \nPrevention Act, is not really about fraud. Rather, this measure is just \nthe latest attempt to tilt the civil justice system in favor of \ncorporate defendants by making it more difficult for plaintiffs \nto pursue State law claims in State courts.\n\n  Here is why I say that. To begin with, H.R. 3624 addresses a \nnonexistent problem. Under current law, a defendant may remove a case \nalleging solely State law claims to a Federal court only if there is \ncomplete diversity of citizenship between all plaintiffs and all \ndefendants, with an exception. If the plaintiff adds an instate \ndefendant to the case to defeat diversity jurisdiction, this \nconstitutes fraudulent joinder and, in such circumstance, the case may \nbe removed to Federal court.\n  In determining whether a joinder was fraudulent, the court must \nconsider only whether there was any basis for a claim against the \nnondiverse defendant. For the case to remain in Federal Court, the \ndefendant must show that there was no possibility of recovery or no \nreasonable basis for adding the nondiverse defendant.\n  This very high standard has ignited our Federal Courts for more than \na century, and it has functioned well. H.R. 3624 would replace this \ntime-honored standard with a thoroughly ambiguous one. The measure \nwould require a remand motion to be denied unless the court finds, \namong other things, that it is ``plausible to conclude that the \napplicable State law would impose liability'' on an instate defendant; \nthat the plaintiff had a ``good faith intention to prosecute the action \nagainst each'' instate defendant or to seek a joint judgment; and that \nthere was no ``actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts.''\n  Additionally, H.R. 3624 would effectively overturn the local \ndefendant exception, which prohibits removal to Federal Court even if \ncomplete diversity of citizenship exists when the defendant is a \ncitizen of the State where the suit was filed.\n  The bill's radical changes to longstanding jurisdictional practice \nreveal the true purpose of this measure. It is simply intended to \nstifle the ability of plaintiffs to have their choice of forum and, \npossibly, even their day in court.\n  In addition, H.R. 3624 would sharply increase the cost of litigation \nfor plaintiffs and further burden the Federal court system. For \nexample, terms like ``plausible'' and ``good faith intention'' are not \ndefined in the bill. This ambiguity will lead to greater uncertainty \nfor both courts and litigants and will spawn substantial litigation \nover their meaning and application, further delaying many decisions in \nmany cases.\n  Additionally, these standards require a court to engage in a \nminitrial during an early procedural stage of a case, without an \nopportunity for the full development of evidence. Thus, the bill would \nsharply increase the burdens and costs of litigation for plaintiffs and \nmake it more likely that they would be prevented from choosing the \nforum for their claims.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Finally, the amendments made by this bill raise fundamental \nfederalism concerns. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in our \nConstitution, matters of State law should be decided by State courts. \nThe removal of a State court case to Federal court always implicates \nfederalism concerns, which is why the Federal courts generally disfavor \nFederal jurisdiction and read removal statutes narrowly.\n  H.R. 3624, however, ignores these federalism concerns. By applying \nsweeping and vaguely worded new standards to the determination of when \na State case must be remanded to a State court, the bill denies State \ncourts the ability to decide and ultimately to shape State law. H.R. \n3624 not only violates State sovereignty, but it also violates our \nfundamental constitutional structure.\n  Accordingly, I sincerely urge my colleagues to join me in opposing \nthis problematic legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume to respond to some of the points raised by the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member.\n  First of all, it is not this bill that removes cases from State \ncourts to Federal courts. It is the United States Constitution and the \nFederal laws that have been passed by this Congress for over 200 years \nthat recognize the importance of the principle of diversity \njurisdiction and of having parties from different States in cases in \ncontroversy able to remove those cases to the Federal system, which \nrepresents all citizens, not just the citizens of one State, as State \ncourts are sometimes perceived as doing.\n  Secondly, it is not this legislation that creates the kind of \ncircumstance that the gentleman from Michigan claims it does of denying \naccess to the courts. Rather, it is the purpose of this legislation to \ntreat people fairly who have been treated unfairly in the process. If \nyou have no liability in a case, you should not be sued in the first \nplace.\n  If you are sued by a lawyer who is trying to manipulate the rules in \norder to keep a case in a court that he has forum-shopped--in other \nwords, he has picked the court that he prefers it to be in--that \nindividual or business, as quickly as possible, should be able to seek \nredress from the Federal court so as to have a determination made about \nwhether or not it is indeed a party that is ``plausibly liable,'' which \nis a Supreme Court standard to be held in the case.\n  If it is not a party, then the rules of Federal procedure would allow \nfor the removal of that case to Federal court. So we should not be \nblaming innocent parties for spoiling the plans of trial lawyers to try \nto forum-shop into a favorable jurisdiction.\n  Let me make a few other quick points about federalism.\n  Some of the rhetoric on the other side suggests that it is somehow \nstrange for Federal courts to be deciding State law claims, but as a \nmatter of history, that is totally inaccurate. State law claims are \nheard by Federal courts whenever the Federal courts have the diversity \njurisdiction that is outlined in the Constitution.\n  That has been a major part of the Federal trial court's work for far \nlonger than Federal claims have existed, and out-of-State defendants \nhave been able to remove civil cases from State courts since the \nbeginning of the Federal judicial system created by the very first \nCongress of which James Madison and many other Founders were members.\n  All the bill before us today does is protect the right of removal \nfrom being subverted by blatant gamesmanship on the part of trial \nlawyers. H.R. 3624 also protects in-State individuals and small \nbusinesses from being dragged into litigation just so the plaintiff can \nkeep the case in State court when the plaintiff's primary target is an \nout-of-State corporation.\n  Is it really unfair to say to the trial lawyer, ``when your real \ntarget is an out-of-State corporation but you want to keep the case in \nState court, you have to come up with a claim against the local in-\nState individual or small business that is at least plausible''?\n  That is the simple, fair, and modest demand that this bill makes on \ntrial lawyers.\n  Is it fair to the local individual or small business that it is \nrequired to bear the costs and other burdens of litigation when the \nclaim against it isn't even plausible?\n  No, it is not, but that is what is allowed under current law, and \nthat is what H.R. 3624 will correct.\n\n[[Page H909]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Somehow the gentleman from Virginia has misunderstood what I said or \nhas mischaracterized what I said.\n  This bill makes it too difficult to remand cases back to State courts \nto the point at which federalism concerns are raised and plaintiffs are \nfrequently harmed.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. \nCohen), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill which has come before our committee is one \nthat the President has said he will veto because the President says \nthat it is a ``solution that is looking for a problem'' or something to \nthat effect.\n  This bill will make it more difficult for plaintiffs--people who have \nbeen harmed--to get relief because their cases in State courts can more \neasily be removed to Federal courts.\n  Now, the gentleman from Virginia is exactly right in that it has \nalways been permitted. You can remove a case to Federal court if you \ncan show that the plaintiff in the State court is not a proper \nplaintiff, if you can show that there is diversity of citizenship and \nnot complete diversity.\n  The problem is that this has always been the rule, and it is the way \nthe rule is now; but the courts have not come to us and said this is a \nproblem and have asked us to correct it. We are correcting this because \nthe corporate defendants want to make it easier for them to remove \nthese cases to courts at which they will get better results. It will \nmake it more difficult for plaintiffs to get judgments in State courts, \nwhich have historically been a bit healthier. This makes it almost \nimpossible.\n  It increases litigation. It makes you, on the front end, have to show \nyour case. It increases the cost to the courts and the burden on the \ncourts. It will make the government larger because there will be more \nactivity in Federal court if this becomes law. It will take from the \nStates the right to determine their own State laws, which is generally \nthe position of my friends on the other side--being for states' rights. \nIn certain parts of our country, including in my part of the country, \nthey have been known to sometimes talk poorly about the Federal courts. \nThis gives the Federal courts more power.\n  It is an aberrant position that this side has taken, kind of like \nthey took when we had reciprocity on gun permits. Rather than having \nStates' laws be paramount, they thought the Federal law should \nsuperimpose it. We have got a situation by which the idea of States' \nlaws being sovereign and States having more authority and giving more \npower to the States falls second to being for things that corporations \nand the NRA desire. In those cases, states' rights come second, and \nthat is an unusual aberration.\n\n  This bill will probably not pass the Senate, but if it does, it will \nbe vetoed, and it won't be overridden.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. COHEN. Yesterday we had a program at which we honored the foot \nsoldiers of the civil rights movement. One of the Republican Senators \nconfessed: ``I should have done more.'' I hear that from a lot of folks \nfrom the South. They go to Selma and they march and they say they \nshould have done more.\n  Meanwhile, one can do something today because there is a Voting \nRights Act that needs to be extended or amended and approved to give \npeople the ultimate thing that America is most well-known for, which is \nthe right to vote in a democracy.\n  Voting rights are in peril in our country, income inequality \ncontinues, and millions of Americans of both parties are voting for \ncandidates who appeal to those folks. Race relations between police and \nminority communities are fraught, young people have tremendous burdens \nof student loan debt, and our infrastructure is in danger.\n  Let's deal with those issues and let's make Congress great again.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck), the chief sponsor of this \nlegislation and a member of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. BUCK. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, in many cases a trial lawyer's main target is a \nnational business, but if the only defendant in the case is an out-of-\nState business, the case can be heard in Federal court rather than in a \nlocal State court, which trial lawyers often prefer.\n  By also suing a local defendant in addition to the national \ndefendant, who are the true targets of the lawsuits, trial lawyers can \nkeep their cases in the preferred State courts.\n  Trial lawyers who sue innocent local people and small businesses \nsimply to keep the lawsuits in their preferred State courts usually \ndrop their cases against these innocent local parties but only after \ntheir cases are safely back in State courts and only after the innocent \nlocal parties have had to spend time and money in dealing with the \nlawsuits. That is not right. Trial lawyers shouldn't be able to subject \ninnocent local people and small businesses to costly and time-consuming \nlawsuits just to rig the places in which their lawsuits will be heard.\n  This unfairness led respected Federal appeals court Judge J. Harvie \nWilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to publicly support \ncongressional action to change the standards for joinder to allow \njudges greater flexibility in making the right decisions on questions \nof removal to Federal court and to give Federal judges greater \ndiscretion to determine earlier in the case whether a local party \njoined to the lawsuit is there for a good reason or for fraudulent \nreasons.\n  H.R. 3624 is precisely the kind of remedy urged by Judge Wilkinson, \nwho has said:\n\n       That is exactly the kind of approach . . . that I like \n     because it is targeted; and there is a problem with \n     fraudulent jurisdiction laws as it exists today, I think, and \n     that is that you have to establish that the joinder of a non-\n     diverse local defendant is totally ridiculous and that there \n     is no possibility of ever recovering. . . . That is very hard \n     to do. So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little \n     bit more realistic . . . appeals to me because it seems to me \n     the kind of intermediate step that addresses some real \n     problems.\n\n  H.R. 3624 would protect innocent local defendants in two main ways.\n  First, the bill allows Federal judges greater discretion to release \nlocal defendants from a case where it is not plausible to conclude, as \na legal matter, that applicable State law would impose liability on the \nlocal defendant. The term ``plausible'' is taken from the Supreme \nCourt's jurisprudence that interprets rule 8 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, and the Court's decisions provide substantial guidance \nas to the meaning of the term.\n  Initially, in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, the Court distinguished \nbetween plausible claims and claims that are speculative:\n\n       Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to \n     relief above the speculative level.\n\n  Later, in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the Court stated:\n\n       The plausibility standard . . . asks for more than a sheer \n     possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. This \n     standard demands more than an unadorned, `the defendant \n     unlawfully harmed me' accusation or threadbare recitals of \n     the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \n     conclusory statements.\n\n  Professor Martin H. Redish, one of the Nation's foremost scholars of \nFederal court jurisdiction, has written:\n\n       The Twombly/Iqbal plausibility standard represents the \n     fairest and most efficient resolution of the conflicting \n     interests in the context of pleading.\n\n  It will similarly provide a fair and efficient approach in the \ncontext of fraudulent joinder.\n  Second, the bill codifies a proposition that the Supreme Court has \nlong recognized: that in deciding whether joinder is fraudulent, courts \nmay consider whether the plaintiff has a good faith intention of \nseeking a judgment against the local defendant.\n  Consistent with Supreme Court precedent, courts continue to find \nfraudulent joinder when objective evidence clearly demonstrates there \nis no good faith intention to prosecute the action against all \ndefendants.\n  As the Federal court in Faulk v. Husqvarna Consumer Outdoor Products \nN.A., Inc., said:\n\n       Where the plaintiff's collective litigation actions, viewed \n     objectively, clearly demonstrate a lack of good faith \n     intention to\n\n[[Page H910]]\n\n     pursue a claim to judgment against a nondiverse local \n     defendant, the court should dismiss the nondiverse defendant \n     and retain jurisdiction over the case.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The language of this provision is taken almost verbatim from an \noften-cited decision in the Third Circuit, In re Briscoe: ``The court \nsaid that joinder is fraudulent if `there is . . . no real intention in \ngood faith to prosecute the action against the defendant or seek a \njoint judgment.' ''\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this simple, commonsense bill \nthat will protect innocent local parties from being dragged into \nexpensive and time-consuming lawsuits for the sole reason of furthering \na trial lawyer's forum shopping strategy.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Nadler), a veteran member of the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the so-called \nFraudulent Joinder Prevention Act.\n  The main purpose of the bill is to make it easier to remove State \ncases to Federal courts where large corporate defendants have numerous \nadvantages over consumers, patients, and injured workers.\n  This bill is yet another attempt by the Republicans to tilt the legal \nplaying field in favor of large corporations. It will clog the Federal \ncourts, drain judicial resources, upset well-established law, and delay \njustice for plaintiffs seeking to hold corporations accountable for \nharming consumers or injuring workers.\n  This bill is part of a general effort by the Republicans to close off \naccess to the courts to ordinary Americans. With every step the \nRepublicans take, whether it be to put forward bills to make class \naction suits more difficult, to remove more local cases to Federal \ncourts, to reclassify more lawsuits as frivolous and subject to \nmandatory sanctions, or to oppose legislative attempts to limit \nmandatory arbitration clauses, they are transforming our system of \njustice.\n  Our courts are being turned into a forum where only very rich people \ncan get justice, where corporations can easily escape liability, and \nwhere consumers and the injured can get no relief, and it is all tilted \none way.\n  There is nothing in this bill or in any other bill put forward by the \nother side that will help ordinary consumers hold big corporations \nresponsible for actions that harm the little guy.\n  Under this so-called Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act, anytime there \nis a case with at least one instate, nondiverse, and out-of-state, \ndiverse, defendant, the defendants will use this forum shopping bill \nlaw to delay justice.\n  These attempted removals will result in contentious disputes over \nwhether the court has jurisdiction. It will drain court time, as the \ncourts will have to engage in almost a minitrial, reviewing pleadings, \naffidavits, and other evidence submitted by the parties since this bill \nturns a simple procedural determination into a merits determination.\n  At a minimum, the bill will allow corporate defendants to \nsuccessfully force the plaintiff to expend their limited resources on \nwhat should be a simple procedural matter.\n  Under this bill, this preliminary decision would become a baseless, \ntime-consuming merits inquiry of the case before a second time-\nconsuming merits inquiry on the substance. While large corporations can \neasily accommodate such cost, injured workers, consumers, and patients \ncannot.\n  I am amazed by some of my colleagues who, with this bill, will bring \neven more cases to our Federal courts. I don't need to remind you that \nour Federal courts are facing an enormous number of judicial vacancies \nwith no end in sight due to delays in confirmations in the other body.\n  Yet, this bill would increase the workload of the Federal courts with \ncases based on the flimsiest of Federal jurisdiction. It makes no \nsense. This bill will take up valuable Federal court time with State \nclaims based on State law, preventing the Federal courts from hearing \nand managing cases that are properly before them.\n  Finally, despite its name, this bill is not about fraud. Indeed, the \nproponents cite no example that alleges actual fraud.\n  I would say this is a bill in search of a problem. I would say that, \nif I didn't understand, the true purpose of the bill is not to stop \nfraud, but to further tilt the scales of justice in favor of big \ncorporations over the needs of ordinary Americans.\n  For these reasons, I oppose it. I urge all of my colleagues to oppose \nthis bill as well.\n  We should defeat this bill and start making Congress great again.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, just a few minutes ago the Judiciary \nCommittee ranking and chairman were in a hearing that exuded bipartisan \nexpressions for fixing the challenges that we have, with the location \nof data and international requests for data being held by America's \ntechnology companies. It was an interesting and open discussion, which \nI want to evidence on the Record.\n  The Judiciary Committee is continuing and has had over the years \nbipartisan approaches to a number of difficult questions, which we have \nsolved, including our approach to criminal justice reform. I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for that.\n  I also want to acknowledge that we have some challenges, as was \nevidenced by comments from the gentleman from Tennessee, on the \nrestoration of the Voting Rights Act. We find ourselves again in a \nchallenge that I hope can be fixed.\n  First, I want to make it very clear that I practiced law for a number \nof years and served as an associate municipal court judge and as well \nwas a quasi-prosecutor on the Select Committee on Assassinations which, \nI allow, this body did research when that select committee was in place \nthe issues of the investigations of Dr. Martin Luther King's \nassassination and John F. Kennedy.\n  So I know the importance of lawyers, of which I have the greatest \nrespect and of which I am one. I understand that trial lawyers are \nrepresenting both defendants and plaintiffs and corporations come into \nthe court with trial lawyers. So I am a little taken aback by any \nsuggestion that the words ``trial lawyers'' have a negative \nconnotation.\n  Anyone who wants to win a case in a courtroom must have a lawyer, and \nyou would want to make sure that they are a trial lawyer. As well, you \nwant to make sure that you have the rights of due process.\n  So I would make the argument that trial lawyers go into court, \nwhether they are representing corporations or plaintiffs. Corporations \nin many instances may be defendants.\n  In that case, I will tell you you are making it far more difficult by \npushing cases into the Federal court under H.R. 3624. It is more \nexpensive and they take longer, making it difficult for workers, \nconsumers, and patients generally to have their cases closer to home in \nState courts.\n  However, there may be an instance where a corporation is a plaintiff \nand you will have the same blocking of that corporation by this bill.\n  If this bill was enacted, it would tip the scales of justice in favor \nof corporate defendants or others that make it more difficult for \ninjured plaintiffs. It would effectively eliminate the local defendant \nexception by diversity jurisdiction. I heard someone say--and it bears \nrepeating--it is a solution looking for a problem.\n  The current standard used by the courts to determine whether the \njoinder of a nondiverse defendant is improper, however, has been in \nplace for a century. We have no evidence that this has put anyone in a \nposition of not getting due process. That is our goal in the court \nsystem.\n  The fraudulent joinder doctrine is well established and, in fact, \nwill only be found if the defendant establishes that the joinder of the \ndiversity-destroying party in the State court was made without a \nreasonable basis. We have a system, but this particular bill reverses \nthis longstanding policy by imposing new requirements.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, if I might, further taking away a defendant's \nresponsibility to prove that Federal jurisdiction over State cases is \nimproper\n\n[[Page H911]]\n\nalters the fundamental precept of a party seeking removal.\n  I ask my colleagues to recognize that we have bipartisanship on this \ncommittee.\n  I oppose this legislation and ask my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding and rise in strong opposition to \nH.R. 3624, the ``Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act of 2016.''\n  H.R. 3624 is the latest effort to deny plaintiffs access to the forum \nof their choice and, possibly, to their day in court.\n  H.R. 3624 seeks to overturn longstanding precedent in favor of a \nvague and unnecessary test that forces state cases into federal court \nwhen they don't belong there, and gives large corporate defendants an \nunfair advantage to pick and choose their forum without the normal \nburden of proving proper jurisdiction.\n  If enacted this bill would tip the scales of justice in favor of \ncorporate defendants and make it more difficult for injured plaintiffs \nto bring their state claims in state court.\n  H.R. 3624 would effectively eliminate the local defendant exception \nto diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1441(b)(2), which currently \nprohibits removal to federal court even when there is complete \ndiversity when a defendant is a citizen of the state in which the \naction is brought.\n  The current standard used by courts to determine whether the joinder \nof a non-diverse defendant is improper, however, has been in place for \na century, and no evidence has been put forth demonstrating that this \nstandard is not working.\n  Rather, the ``Fraudulent Joinder Doctrine,'' is a well-established \nlegal doctrine providing that: fraudulent joinder will only be found if \nthe defendant establishes that the joinder of the diversity-destroying \nparty in the state court action was made without a reasonable basis of \nproving any liability against that party.\n  H.R. 3624 reverses this longstanding policy by imposing new \nrequirements on federal courts considering remand motions where a case \nis before the court solely on diversity grounds.\n  Specifically, it changes the test for showing improper joinder from a \none-part test (``no possibility of a claim against a nondiverse \ndefendant'') to a complicated four-part test, requiring the court to \nfind fraudulent joinder if: There is not a ``plausible'' claim for \nrelief against each nondiverse defendant; There is ``objective \nevidence'' that ``clearly demonstrates'' no good faith intention to \nprosecute the action against each defendant or intention to seek a \njoint judgment; There is federal or state law that clearly bars claims \nagainst the nondiverse defendants; or There is actual fraud in the \npleading of jurisdictional facts.\n  What should be a simple procedural question for the courts, now \nbecomes a protracted mini-trial, giving an unfair advantage to the \ndefendants (not available under current law) by allowing defendants to \nengage the court on the merits of their position.\n  By requiring litigation on the merits at a nascent jurisdictional \nstage of litigation based on vague, undefined, and subjective standards \nlike ``plausibility'' and ``good faith intention,'' and by potentially \nplacing the burden of proof on the plaintiff, this bill will increase \nthe complexity and costs surrounding litigation of state law claims in \nfederal court and potentially dissuade plaintiffs from pursuing \notherwise meritorious claims.\n  Further, taking away a defendant's responsibility to prove that \nfederal jurisdiction over a state case is indeed proper alters the \nfundamental precept that a party seeking removal should bear the heavy \nburden of establishing federal court jurisdiction.\n  The bill is a win-win for corporate defendants.\n  At its most harmful, it will cause non-diverse defendants to be \nimproperly dismissed from the lawsuit.\n  At its least harmful, it will cause an expensive, time-consuming \ndetour through federal courts for plaintiffs.\n  Wrongdoers would not be held accountable for the harm they cause, \nwhile the taxpayers ultimately foot the bill.\n  For example: large corporate defendants (i.e. typically the diverse \ndefendants) would be favored by the bill because, if the nondiverse \ndefendant is dismissed, they can blame the now-absent in-state \ndefendant for the plaintiff's injuries.\n  Smaller, nondiverse defendants would also be favored because the \ndiverse defendant does all the work for them.\n  The diverse defendant removes the case to federal court and then \nargues that the nondiverse defendant is improperly joined.\n  If the federal court retains jurisdiction, the nondiverse defendant \nmust be dismissed from the case.\n  If one or more defendants are dismissed from the case, it is easy for \nthe remaining defendant to finger point and blame the absent defendant \nfor the plaintiff's injuries.\n  Even if a federal court remands the case to state court under the \nbill, the defendants have successfully forced the plaintiff to expend \ntheir limited resources on a baseless, time-consuming motion on a \npreliminary matter.\n  While large corporate defendants can easily accommodate such costs, \nplaintiffs (i.e. injured consumers, patients and workers) cannot.\n  Regardless of whether the case is remanded to state court or stays in \nfederal court, this new, mandated inquiry will be a drain on the \nlimited resources of federal courts.\n  By mandating a full merits-inquiry on a procedural motion, H.R. 3624 \nis expensive, time-consuming, and wasteful use of judicial resources.\n  Lastly, by seeking to favor federal courts over state courts as \nforums for deciding state law claims, this bill offends principles of \nfederalism.\n  The ability of state courts to function independently of federal \ncourts' procedural analysis is a necessary function of the success of \nthe American judiciary branch.\n  For these, reasons I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. \n3624, the Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson), another distinguished member of the House \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I return to the floor today for \nthe second time in as many months to speak against another crony-\ncapitalist, Republican-led bill to benefit big business.\n  H.R. 3624, the Fraudulent Joinder Protection Act, as it is so called, \nis a solution in search of a problem.\n  Current Federal law already provides Federal courts with ample tools \nto address possible forum shopping. This crony-capitalist legislation \nwould add needless complications for civil litigants seeking redress \nfor violent claims in the State courts.\n  Two, it further stretches the already limited resources Federal \ncourts are experiencing due to Republican-passed, budget-cutting \nsequestration measures.\n  Currently America is burdened with a Republican Party-caused judicial \nvacancy crisis in this Nation's Federal courts, where there are over 81 \nFederal court judicial vacancies around the country, including the one \nleft vacant by the passing of Justice Scalia.\n  Republicans--who control the Senate and who, in the press conferences \nand meetings they have held this week, have fully exposed their plot to \nadd to this judicial crisis--are refusing to fill that vacancy on the \ncountry's highest Court, and they have an ulterior purpose for doing \nso.\n  That purpose, ladies and gentlemen, is because they know that justice \ndelayed is justice denied. They want to gum up the works of the Federal \ncourts by defunding the Federal courts while at the same time bogging \nthem down with State court matters that should be left to the States, \nand then what it results in is crony capitalists being able to avoid \nbeing held accountable in the State or Federal courts.\n  So this Congress should not further burden the Federal courts, which \nare already strapped for time and resources, when State courts are more \nsuited and capable of hearing State--not Federal, but State--law claims \nas State courts have been empowered to do since this country was \nformed.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Walker). The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. The 10th Amendment in this country means \nsomething. It means something to Republicans, and it means something to \nDemocrats. Sometimes we disagree on what it means and what impacts it \nshould have.\n  But there is no doubt that the Federal court system has its body of \nlaw and the citizens should be able to bring their claim into their \nState courts, as they have been doing since this country's foundation.\n  They use the 10th Amendment when it is convenient to them, and then \nthey violate it when it is not convenient. That is not the way that \nconscientious Republicans should operate. I challenge them to stop this \nencroachment on states' rights.\n  This legislation presumes that Federal courts are not currently \npreventing forum shopping in civil suits,\n\n[[Page H912]]\n\nbut there is absolutely no credible evidence that Federal courts are \nfailing to do their duty.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this crony-capitalist legislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I thought you might be interested in knowing that 21 different \norganizations strongly oppose H.R. 3624, the Fraudulent Joinder \nPrevention Act, including: the American Association for Justice, the \nCenter for Effective Government, the Center for Justice and Democracy, \nthe Consumer Federation of America, the D.C. Consumer Rights Coalition, \nMain Street Alliance, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, \nthe National Disability Rights Network's lawyers, the National \nEmployment Lawyers Association.\n  I include in the Record the letter containing the list of groups that \nstrongly oppose H.R. 3624.\n\n                                                February 23, 2016.\n     Re Groups Strongly Oppose H.R. 3624, ``The Fraudulent Joinder \n         Prevention Act''.\n\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The House will soon be \n     voting on H.R. 3624, the ``Fraudulent Joinder Prevention \n     Act.'' This bill would upend long established law in the area \n     of federal court jurisdiction, place unreasonable burdens on \n     the federal judiciary, and make it more difficult for \n     Americans to enforce their rights in state courts. The \n     undersigned organizations strongly oppose the bill as harmful \n     and unnecessary.\n       Under our system of government, federal court jurisdiction \n     is supposed to be very limited. State courts should not be \n     deprived of jurisdiction over a claim they should properly \n     hear, so the burden is always on the party trying to get into \n     federal court to show why it should be there. When a case is \n     properly in state court, only complete ``diversity'' can \n     support removing it to federal court, meaning that no \n     plaintiff in a case may come from the same state as any \n     defendant.\n       H.R. 3624 would undermine this fundamental precept and \n     force state cases into federal court when they don't belong \n     there. The bill would do this by transforming the centuries-\n     old concept called ``fraudulent joinder,'' which is a way to \n     defeat complete diversity; i.e., when non-diverse defendants \n     are in case. Despite its name, joining such defendants is \n     rarely ``fraudulent'' and has been accepted practice for over \n     a century. As Lonny Hoffman, Law Foundation Professor of Law \n     at the University of Houston Law Center, explained in \n     testimony to this committee, under current, ``well-settled \n     law, fraudulent joinder will only be found if the defendant \n     establishes that the joinder of the diversity-destroying \n     party in the state court action was made without a reasonable \n     basis of proving any liability against that party.'' Current \n     law ``strikes an appropriate balance among competing policies \n     in how it evaluates the joinder of non-diverse defendants.''\n       However, H.R. 3624 would dramatically change this \n     longstanding, efficient and well-functioning law. The bill \n     alters the fundamental precept that a party seeking removal \n     has a very heavy burden to establish federal court \n     jurisdiction. At a preliminary stage, the court is required \n     to engage in exhaustive fact finding on the merits even \n     before summary judgment. The bill instructs the court to use \n     subjective and vague criteria, like ``objective evidence \n     clearly demonstrates that there is no good faith intention'' \n     or ``based on the complaint . . . it is not plausible to \n     conclude,'' creating uncertainty as courts struggle with how \n     to interpret and apply this new standard. The bill provides \n     no evidentiary standards to help courts make such a complex \n     decision. And requiring the court to engage in extensive \n     factual adjudication at this early stage raises significant \n     7th Amendment ``right to jury trial'' constitutional \n     concerns. As Professor Hoffman put it in testimony to this \n     committee, although the bill is short in length, its \n     provisions are ``anything but modest; if enacted, they would \n     dramatically alter existing jurisdictional law.''\n       The process contemplated by this bill would be not only \n     unfair to and incredibly expensive for the plaintiff, but \n     also an enormous waste of judicial resources. There is no \n     reason for these state based claims to be heard in federal \n     court other than corporations' desire to engage in forum \n     shopping. Yet, there is no evidence whatsoever that national \n     corporations, who choose to avail themselves of the \n     marketplaces in states across the country, complying with \n     multiple state laws in the process, should then have a \n     problem appearing in state court.\n       H.R. 3624 will have a destructive impact on our state and \n     federal judiciary. Professor Hoffman said in his testimony, \n     ``Finally, by divesting state courts of jurisdiction and \n     deciding merits questions that state courts now routinely \n     resolve, proponents appear deaf to the serious federalism \n     concerns that the bill raises.''

This bill is an unnecessary intrusion into the \n     province of the federal courts.\n       H.R. 3624 addresses a federal district court's \n     consideration of a plaintiff's motion to remand a case to \n     state court, after a defendant has removed the case from the \n     state court in which it was filed to federal district court \n     on the theory that the plaintiff had fraudulently joined a \n     non-diverse defendant for the purpose of defeating federal-\n     court jurisdiction. The purpose of the bill, as made clear in \n     the September 29, 2015, hearing, is to assist defendants in \n     keeping cases in federal court after removal. The bill \n     purports to effectuate this purpose by specifying that the \n     federal court consider evidence, such as affidavits, and by \n     specifying four findings that would require a federal \n     district court to deny a plaintiff's motion to remand.\n       Congress should not get into the business of micro-managing \n     the motion practice of the federal courts without strong \n     evidence that current court procedures are not serving their \n     purpose: facilitating justice. In this case, however, the \n     hearing provided no support for the assumption that the \n     district courts are not denying motions to remand in \n     appropriate cases. Witness testimony that different courts \n     state different standards for reviewing such motions does not \n     support a call for congressional action, unless the existence \n     of different standards is leading to unjust results. The \n     testimony, however, did not demonstrate that the courts' \n     current approach results in injustice, and it did not explain \n     how results would differ under the standard proposed in the \n     bill and why any difference would be an improvement. Simply \n     put, the bill is a supposed fix for an imagined problem. The \n     House should hesitate before taking the step into \n     micromanagement of the federal courts' consideration of one \n     specific type of motion, where that motion has existed for \n     more than a century and evidence of a problem is so flimsy.\n       Thank you for consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert Weissman,\n     President, Public Citizen.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2016.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n H.R. 3624--Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act of 2016 (Rep. Buck, R-CO)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3624 because it is \n     a solution in search of a problem and makes it more difficult \n     for individuals to vindicate their rights in State courts.\n       Federal law currently permits defendants to remove to \n     Federal court a civil case initially filed in State court \n     where the plaintiffs and defendants are citizens of different \n     States and the case's value exceeds a certain monetary \n     threshold. H.R. 3624 purports to address a problem called \n     fraudulent joinder, where plaintiffs fraudulently raise \n     claims against a same-state defendant in order to defeat the \n     Federal court's ability to hear the case.\n       Existing Federal law already provides Federal courts with \n     ample tools to address this problem, and the proponents of \n     H.R. 3624 have offered no credible evidence that the Federal \n     courts are failing to carry out their responsibility to \n     prevent fraudulent joinder. The bill would therefore add \n     needless complexity to civil litigation and potentially \n     prevent plaintiffs from raising valid claims in State court.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 3624, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H913]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, it is not often that the House has the opportunity to \nprotect innocent local people and businesses from costly and meritless \nlawsuits and holding them to a good faith standard in litigation all by \npassing a bill that is just a few pages long, but that is the \nopportunity the House has today.\n  I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck), a member of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, for introducing this vital measure, and I \nurge all my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, this manager's amendment simply makes a few \ntechnical changes to the bill; namely, striking references to multiple \ndefendants and replacing them with references to single defendants to \nmake clear that even if one instate defendant has a legitimate \nconnection to the case, the case can remain in State court.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this technical and clarifying \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Members of the House, I oppose the manager's amendment, \nsomething I rarely ever do. While I don't take issue with the changes \nto the bill that the manager's amendment makes, this amendment fails to \naddress any of the concerns that I raised about the underlying bill \nbecause the bill is flawed in its very conception.\n  There is no real problem that this bill addresses. Existing \nfraudulent joinder law adequately addresses the improper joinder of \ninstate defendants, and the bill's proponents have offered no evidence \nto the contrary.\n  This unnecessary bill instead creates great uncertainty and delay in \nthe consideration of State law claims with its ambiguous new \nrequirements. It will also spawn much litigation, leading to increased \ncosts that will be borne disproportionately by plaintiffs.\n  This bill, in addition, violates State sovereignty by significantly \ndiminishing the ability of State courts to decide and shape State law \nmatters.\n  Those are my objections to the manager's amendment. I hope it will be \nvoted down.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I also oppose the underlying bill, which I call the \nwrongdoers protection act for multistate and multinational \ncorporations, and for that purpose I add this amendment.\n  It is no coincidence that these corporate wrongdoers want to force \nconsumers to fight them in the Federal court. That is the effect of \nthis bill, to enlarge Federal court diversity jurisdiction.\n  It is no coincidence that the corporate wrongdoers want to fight \nthere. It is not because they think the Federal judges are better \nlooking or that\n\n[[Page H914]]\n\nthe Federal judges are more polite or that the decor is nicer in \nFederal court. No. They want to go there because they are more likely \nto beat consumers in Federal court cases.\n  After a generation of bad decisions by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, Federal court has become candy land for corporate \nwrongdoers, generations of bad decisions that invite and exhort \ndistrict judges to forget about the 7th Amendment in the Bill of \nRights. You remember what that says. It was written by James Madison. \nIt was announced as approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, \nwhose statue stands right outside this Chamber. It says this: ``In \nsuits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty \ndollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.''\n  There is nothing ambiguous about that. But since the 1980s, there has \nbeen this steady drumbeat of Supreme Court of the United States \ndecisions encouraging and emboldening Federal court judges to decide \nand dismiss cases without the trouble of a jury trial.\n  Their toolkit is enormous: motions to dismiss, motions for judgment \non the pleadings, motions for summary judgment, motions for directed \nverdict, motions for judgment as a matter of law.\n  Cases do get thrown out every day without the trouble of jury trials, \nand the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial is not preserved. That is \nwhy wrongdoer corporations prefer to be in Federal court. So that is \nthe backdrop, Mr. Chairman.\n  On top of that, I want to give you some very strong reasons why this \nunderlying bill is bad. Number one, it is discriminatory. Unless you \nare a multistate or multinational corporation, this bill doesn't help \nyou. If you are an individual sued in State court, you get no help. If \nyou are a small-business owner only doing work in your State, you are \nout of luck. This doesn't provide you any help. Only multistate, \nmultinational corporations get help, and that is why I call this the \nwrongdoers protection act for multistate and multinational \ncorporations.\n  Number two, it is burdensome. Representative Johnson from Georgia \nalready made this point. The Federal courts are already overworked and \nunderstaffed. The civil caseload already is growing at 12 percent a \nyear--much of that, by the way, contract cases filed by corporations. \nThere are currently 81 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. There is no \nreason to add to this burden.\n  Number three, this bill is ironic. We have a crowd in this House that \nconstantly preaches about states' rights and the need to cut back on \nthe Federal Government. But a bill like this comes along, and they drop \nthat states' rights banner like it is a hot potato and pick up the coat \nof arms of the multistate, multinational corporations.\n  Number four, and maybe most importantly, the underlying bill is \nwrongheaded because these cases, called diversity cases, are filed in \nState court under State law; and ever since the 1930s in the Erie \nRailroad case, if you take these cases and handle them in Federal \ncourt, the Federal judges have to follow State law, not Federal law. \nMr. Chairman, there is nobody better at interpreting State law than \nState court judges. It stands to reason.\n  I offer this amendment that is on the desk to exempt consumer cases \nagainst insurance companies for bad faith in insurance practices. If \nthe majority is going to persist and present this gift, this enormous \ngift to the multistate and multinational corporate wrongdoers, at least \ninclude this amendment and give a couple of crumbs to the average \nAmerican consumer trying to defend himself or herself in court.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUCK. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be roundly opposed for the simple \nreason that not only does it not protect any victims, but it also \nvictimizes innocent local parties in the types of cases covered by the \namendment.\n  The purpose of this bill is to allow judges greater discretion to \nfree innocent local parties--that is, innocent people and innocent \nsmall businesses--from lawsuits when those innocent local parties are \ndragged into a case for no other reason than to further a trial \nlawyer's forum-shopping strategy.\n  These innocent local parties have, at most, an attenuated connection \nto the claims by the trial lawyer against some national company a \nthousand miles away, and these innocent local parties shouldn't have to \nsuffer the time, expense, and emotional drain of a lawsuit when the \nplaintiff cannot even come up with a plausible claim against it. The \nbase bill protects those innocent local parties from being dragged into \na lawsuit brought against some other party for no other reason than to \nkeep the case in a State court the trial lawyer prefers.\n  Now, enter this amendment, which denies the bill's protections to \ninnocent local parties joined to a lawsuit simply because the legal \nallegations in the case fall into one arbitrary category rather than \nanother. That is terribly unfair.\n  If this were any other kind of bill designed to protect innocent \npeople, no one would argue that it shouldn't apply when the lawsuit \nrelates to a bad faith suit against an insurance company. Innocent \npeople are innocent people, and they should be protected from being \ndragged into lawsuits, regardless of the nature of the case.\n  Now, let me say a little something about this amendment based on my \ncareer as a prosecutor.\n  As a prosecutor, I deeply respected all the rules we have developed \nin this country to protect the innocent. These are rules of general \napplication, such as rules protecting people's rights to have their \nside of the story told and rules protecting people from biased or \ninaccurate testimony. I would have been appalled if anyone ever \nsuggested that these general protections designed to protect innocent \npeople from criminal liability should be suspended because the case was \none of assault or battery or murder or somehow related to insurance.\n  Our country is rightfully proud of its principles providing due \nprocess and equal protection, but those concepts are meaningless if \nthey are only selectively applied to some cases but not others. For the \nsame reason, we should all be outraged at the suggestion that rules of \nfairness designed to protect the innocent should be suspended in civil \nlaw because the case involves one particular subject or another. But \nthat is exactly what this misguided amendment does.\n  Further, courts could read this amendment as not even allowing them \nto consider the fraudulent joinder argument for cases within its \ncoverage, no matter how clear it was that there was no valid claim \nagainst the local defendant under State law.\n  This bill defines and limits fraudulent joinder. It does not license \ncourts to make up their own fraudulent joinder doctrines for cases not \nwithin its coverage. Under that reading, claims could be made against \nlocal insurance agents with no factual basis supporting the lawsuit.\n  The amendment would also allow a plaintiff's lawyer to drag an \nindividual insurance adjuster into a lawsuit even when the applicable \nState law makes absolutely clear that only insurers, not individual \npeople, are subject to bad faith claims.\n  How does a sponsor explain to a person like Jack Stout why a lawyer \npulled him into a bad faith lawsuit targeting State Farm? Mr. Stout was \na local insurance agent who merely sold a policy to the plaintiff, met \nand spoke with the plaintiff once, and had nothing to do with \nprocessing the plaintiff's homeowner insurance claim.\n  A Federal district court in Oklahoma found he was fraudulently joined \nand dismissed the claim against him. But under this amendment, this \ninnocent person could be struck back into the lawsuit.\n  How does the sponsor explain to a person like Douglas Bradley why a \nplaintiff's lawyer named him as a defendant in a bad faith lawsuit \nagainst an insurer? In that case, the complaint included Mr. Bradley, \nan insurance agent, as a defendant in the caption referred to as \ndefendant, singular, not defendants throughout, and did not even \nmention Mr. Bradley in the body of the complaint.\n\n[[Page H915]]\n\n  A Federal district court in Indiana dismissed the claim against him \nas fraudulently joined, but under this amendment, this innocent person \ncould be sucked back into the lawsuit, and that is not fair.\n  For all these reasons, this amendment should be soundly rejected.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, to respond to my colleague from \nColorado who has just cited two cases where, under existing law and \nprocedure, fraudulent joinder of bad faith insurance claims was claimed \nand actually succeeded, the proof is right there.\n  The statute does not need to be amended. It is working already. That \nis why we don't need to include bad faith insurance cases in the \nWrongdoers Protection Act for multistate and multinational \ncorporations.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n  Mr. BUCK.

Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the \ndesk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mrs. Watson Coleman moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3624 to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendments:\n       Page 5, line 2, strike the close quotation mark and the \n     period which follows.\n       Page 5, after line 2, insert the following:\n       ``(5) This section shall not apply to a case in which the \n     plaintiff seeks relief in connection with the sexual abuse \n     and exploitation of a minor.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nNew Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the \nbill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If \nadopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as \namended.\n  My amendment would simply ensure that those who have filed a suit in \nconnection with sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor are exempt from \nthe changes that this law makes.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is an assault on the ability of everyday \nhardworking Americans to seek justice, and despite its misleading \ntitle, this bill has absolutely nothing to do with fraud and will do \nnothing to prevent it.\n  This is just one more step by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to offer corporations every opportunity imaginable to take \nadvantage of workers, consumers, and patients.\n  By making it easier to move cases to Federal court, we make it easier \nfor big corporations to play the long game, waiting out plaintiffs with \nlimited financial resources, with limited capacity to travel far from \nhome for hearings, and with limited ability to sit through the \nsignificantly longer Federal process.\n  The current law has been around for centuries, based on the obvious \nlogic that a State case belongs in a State court.\n  The new burden that this bill would place on the average American is \nsimply outrageous. The least that we can do is protect children who \nhave already been victimized by sexual assault.\n  My amendment is simple. It would ensure that we allow those who have \nfiled lawsuits in connection with the sexual abuse or exploitation of a \nminor to continue to operate under the completely operational and \nalready efficient system currently in place.\n  Most importantly, it will protect victims who have already \nexperienced incredible emotional and physical trauma from being dragged \nthrough a long and costly court process far from home just to benefit \nsome multinational corporation out to maximize its profits.\n  This isn't a hypothetical situation. In one case heard in Washington \nState, plaintiffs were minors who were sexually exploited by instate \ndefendants and by an out-of-State defendant who advertised the sexual \nservices of the minors on the defendant's Web site.\n  When those plaintiffs brought claims against the defendants for \nsexual exploitation, assault, battery, unjust enrichment, and civil \nconspiracy, the out-of-State defendant attempted to move the case to \nFederal court. Federal courts rejected that defendant's arguments, and \nthe case remained at the State level. But if this bill is allowed to \npass, that would no longer be the case.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is reprehensible. Unfortunately, it is only \nthe latest in a long line of efforts to put corporations beyond \nreproach and outside of any accountability. Let's at least ensure that \nyoung people, who have already been victimized, don't experience any \nfurther mistreatment for the sake of shareholders' profits.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I seek time in opposition to the motion \nto recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Buck) for bringing this outstanding legislation before \nthe House. This is very common sense. It solves a very practical \nproblem, and most importantly, it protects the innocent. I want to \nquote him with regard to this motion to recommit. He says:\n\n       As a prosecutor, I deeply respected all the rules we \n     developed in this great country to protect the innocent. \n     These are rules of general application, such as rules \n     protecting people's rights to have their side of the story \n     told and rules protecting people from biased or inaccurate \n     testimony.\n       I would have been appalled if anyone ever suggested that \n     these general protections, designed to protect innocent \n     people from criminal liability, should be suspended because \n     the case was one of assault or battery, murder, or somehow \n     related to insurance.\n       Our country is, rightfully, proud of its principles \n     providing due process and equal protection, but those \n     concepts are meaningless if they are only selectively applied \n     to some types of cases, but not others. For the same reason, \n     we should all be outraged at the suggestion that rules of \n     fairness, designed to protect the innocent, should be \n     suspended in the civil law because the case involves one \n     particular subject or another.\n\n  But that is exactly what this motion to recommit does.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  The problem with all of the arguments made by opponents of this bill \nis that those arguments rely on trapping completely innocent local \npeople in lawsuits they don't deserve to be in. That is wrong, and that \nis unfair. Innocent local people and small businesses deserve \nprotections from being dragged into lawsuits that are really directed \nagainst other larger parties, regardless of the nature of those \nlawsuits against other parties.\n  In the end, this bill doesn't require much of trial lawyers. It tells \ntrial lawyers not to sue local innocent people\n\n[[Page H917]]\n\nand businesses just so they can further their own forum shopping \nstrategies. It tells trial lawyers they need to have a plausible case \nbefore they can wrap up innocent local people and businesses in costly \nand time-consuming lawsuits.\n  It tells trial lawyers their lawsuits must be based on good faith. \nBut, apparently, those very modest demands of civility and fairness are \ntoo much to ask, according to opponents of this bill who would prefer \nto dilute it with irrelevancies and distractions.\n  It is not often that the House has the opportunity to protect \ninnocent local people and businesses from costly and meritless \nlawsuits, rein in forum shopping abuses by trial lawyers, and hold them \nto a good faith standard in litigation, all by passing a bill that is \njust a few pages long. But that is the opportunity the House has today.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to take that opportunity now. Reject this \nmotion to recommit and, in so doing, expand the opportunities of all \nlocal citizens and small businesses that would otherwise be smothered \nby costly and meritless lawsuits. Pass this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution 619 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2406.\n  The Chair appoints the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1616\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2406) to protect and enhance opportunities for recreational \nhunting, fishing, and shooting, and for other purposes, with Mrs. Black \nin the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) and the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, before the House today is the Sportsmen's Heritage and \nRecreational Enhancement Act of 2016, better known as the SHARE Act. It \nis a package of commonsense bills that will increase opportunities for \nhunters, recreational shooters, and anglers; eliminate unneeded \nregulatory impediments; safeguard against new regulations that impede \noutdoor sporting activities; and protect Second Amendment rights. \nSimilar packages were passed with strong bipartisan support in both the \n112th and 113th Congresses.\n  Outdoor sporting activities, including hunting, fishing, and \nrecreational shooting, are deeply engrained in the fabric of America's \nculture and heritage. Values instilled by partaking in these activities \nare passed down from generation to generation and play a significant \npart in the lives of millions of Americans.\n  Much of America's outdoor sporting activity occurs on our Nation's \nFederal lands. Unfortunately, Federal agencies like the U.S. Forest \nService and Bureau of Land Management often prevent or impede access to \nFederal lands for outdoor sporting activities. Because lack of access \nis one of the key reasons sportsmen and -women stop participating in \noutdoor sporting activities, ensuring the public has reliable access to \nour Nation's Federal lands must remain a top priority.\n  The SHARE Act does just that. One of the key provisions in the bill, \nthe Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage Opportunities Act, will \nincrease and sustain access for hunting, fishing, and recreational \nshooting on Federal lands for generations to come. Specifically, it \nprotects sportsmen and -women from arbitrary efforts by the Federal \nGovernment to block Federal lands from hunting and fishing activities \nby implementing an ``open until closed'' management policy.\n  Another provision in the package will give State and Federal agencies \nthe tools to jointly create and maintain recreational shooting ranges \non Federal lands. In addition, the bill allows the Department of the \nInterior to designate hunting access corridors throughout our national \nparks so that sportsmen and -women can access adjacent Federal lands to \nhunt and fish.\n  The package also protects Second Amendment rights and the use of \ntraditional ammunition and fishing tackle. It defends law-abiding \nindividuals' constitutional right to keep and bear arms on lands \nmanaged by the Army Corps of Engineers and ensures that hunters are not \nburdened by outdated laws preventing bows and crossbows from being \ntransported across national parks.\n  Finally, the package prevents the implementation of onerous \nconstraints by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on lawfully possessed \ndomestic ivory products and eliminates red tape associated with the \nimportation of 41 lawfully harvested polar bear hunting trophies.\n  This important legislation will sustain America's rich hunting and \nfishing traditions, improve access to our Federal lands for responsible \noutdoor sporting activities, and help ensure that the current and \nfuture generations of sportsmen and -women are able to enjoy the \nsporting activities our country has to offer and what we hold dear.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important \nelection.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Natural Resources,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, 22 February 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During the week of February 22, 2016, \n     the House will be debating H.R. 2406, the Sportsmen's \n     Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act of 2015. The bill \n     was referred primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, \n     with an additional referral to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, among other committees.\n       At the request of Vice Chairman Cynthia Lummis, I ask that \n     you allow the inclusion of the text of H.R. 3279, the Open \n     Book on Equal Access to Justice Act, as passed by the House \n     of Representatives, as part of a manager's amendment to the \n     bill. Mrs. Lummis is a cosponsor of the measure and has \n     discussed this course of action with the bill's author. The \n     Senate counterpart to H.R. 2406 already includes such a \n     provision, and I believe it would be a substantial \n     improvement to the bill and bolster its purpose of increased \n     sportsmen's opportunities to hunt, fish and recreationally \n     shoot. If the amendment is adopted, this action would in no \n     way affect your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the \n     amendment, and it will not serve as precedent for future \n     amendments. In addition, should a conference on the bill be \n     necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee \n     on the Judiciary represented on the conference committee on \n     this matter.

Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop: I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     2406, the ``Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement \n     Act of 2015,'' which the House is scheduled to debate this \n     week. As a result of your having consulted with us on the \n     inclusion of the text of H.R. 3279, the ``Open Book on Equal \n     Access to Justice Act,'' as part of your Committee's \n     manager's amendment to H.R. 2406, I agree to allow the text \n     of H.R. 3279 to be included in the amendment.\n       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by allowing the inclusion of the text of \n     H.R. 3279 in the manager's amendment, we do not waive any \n     jurisdiction over subject matter contained in H.R. 3279 or \n     similar legislation, and that our Committee will be \n     appropriately consulted and involved as H.R. 2406 moves \n     forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our \n     jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek \n     appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving H.R. 2406, and asks that \n     you support any such request.\n       I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this \n     matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 2406.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Natural Resources,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 2016.\n     Hon.

I ask that you not seek a sequential referral of \n     the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader \n     this week. This concession in no way affects your \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will \n     not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, \n     should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support \n     your request to have the Committee on Ways and Means \n     represented on the conference committee.

Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop: I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     2406, the ``Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement \n     Act of 2015,'' which the Committee on Natural Resources \n     recently ordered reported favorably. As a result of your \n     having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 2406 that fall \n     within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, I agree to discharge our Committee from further \n     consideration of this bill so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.\n       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2406 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our \n     Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as the \n     bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our \n     Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an \n     appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks \n     that you support any such request.\n       I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this \n     matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor \n     consideration of H.R. 2406.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, I rise to oppose H.R. 2406, with great respect for my \nfriend, the gentleman from Virginia. I respect very much what \nRepresentative Wittman and others are trying to do.\n  The best I can do to describe H.R. 2406 is a missed opportunity. Many \nof the titles in the bill are inoffensive, but others would \nsignificantly hinder conservation efforts that benefit hunters, \nanglers, and other lovers of the outdoors.\n  I myself am an avid hiker, Madam Chair. I just completed 25 miles on \nthe Appalachian Trail in the snow last week in Representative \nGoodlatte's district. I am up to 1,288 miles on the Appalachian Trail. \nI would love to see conservation efforts that protect the long-term \nlegacy of the Appalachian Trail like the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n  Simply put, this bill doesn't include the sporting community's top \nlegislative priorities. The Natural Resources Committee Democrats have \nbeen clear from the beginning that we are open to discussions that \ncould lead to compromise legislation--legislation that would indeed \ninclude many of the pieces of this bill, but also additional titles \nthat would earn it broad bipartisan support.\n  In a letter several days ago, Ranking Member Grijalva wrote to the \nchair expressing optimism that a noncontroversial outcome could still \nbe achieved and requesting negotiations to produce a bill that would \npass the House without opposition. Unfortunately, this request was \ndenied.\n  So I would love to have this bill on the suspension calendar, but not \non the suspension calendar I would like to detail nine specific \nobjections.\n  Objection 1, this bill omits the top two priorities of the outdoors \ncommunity, the permit reauthorization of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and the permit reauthorization of the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act.\n  LWCF has provided funding to help protect some of Virginia's most \nspecial places: the Rappahannock River Valley, Back Bay National \nWildlife Refuge, Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Historic District, and \nthe Appalachian Trail.\n  Studies have shown that for every dollar of LWCF invested, there is a \n$4 return to communities. The broader outdoor recreation conservation \neconomy is responsible for more than $600 billion in consumer spending \nevery year.\n  This is one of the Nation's premier programs. Over the years, LWCF \nhas been responsible for more than 40,000 State and local outdoor \nrecreation projects: playgrounds, parks, refuges, and baseball fields. \nThere is strong bipartisan support. I believe 88 percent of Americans \nwant Congress to preserve it. So now is the perfect opportunity to do \nthat.\n  We have had hearings in the Committee on Natural Resources on \nRepresentative Chairman Bishop's bill. We need hearings on \nRepresentative Grijalva's H.R. 1814, which has more than 200 bipartisan \ncosponsors. This bill was the perfect opportunity to include that bill.\n  It was also the perfect opportunity to do the North American Wetlands \nConservation Act, NAWCA. It is a voluntary, nonregulatory conservation \nprogram. Farmers, ranchers, and other private landowners support the \nprogram, and every project is voluntary. It fosters conservation \nefforts by the non-Federal sector.\n  Over the years, nearly 5,000 corporate, small business, nonprofit, \nState, and local entities have tripled NAWCA dollars by providing \nmatching funds. The 50 State wildlife agencies are all active partners \nin it, and demand for NAWCA continues to exceed available funds. So \nthis was debated and thoroughly vetted in the 112th and the 113th \nCongresses. It was unanimously reauthorized by Congress in 2006, and \nthis was a great vehicle to do that.\n  Objection 2, title X, I believe, which is the ivory title, this would \ngut the administration's proposed ivory rule. Last year, the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service seized a 1-ton stockpile of illegal elephant \nivory, most of which was seized from a Philadelphia antique dealer \nnamed Victor Gordon.\n  For at least 9 years, Gordon imported and sold ivory from freshly \nkilled African elephants in violation of U.S. law and the laws of the \ncountries where the elephants were poached and the ivory was stolen. \nWhile a ton of ivory was confiscated, there is no way to know how much \nGordon had sold during the previous decade or where it is now.\n  How did he get away with it for so long?\n  The ivory was doctored so it looked old enough to pass through a \nloophole in enforcement of the African Elephant Conservation Act, a law \nthat was passed by us in 1989 to end the commercial import and export \nof ivory.\n  The Obama administration's proposed ivory rule would close that \nloophole and prevent U.S. citizens from being involved--knowingly or \nunknowingly--in elephant poaching and the trafficking crisis. Ending \nthe commercial ivory trade does not mean taking away the people's \nmusical instruments, ivory-handled pistols, or family heirlooms. Museum \ncollections, scientific specimens, and sport-hunted trophies will also \nbe allowed to move freely. Neither the Fish and Wildlife Service's \ndirect order nor the forthcoming Endangered Species Act rule restrict \npossession or transport within the United\n\n[[Page H923]]\n\nStates, and transport into and out of the country will still be allowed \nwith the appropriate documentation.\n  Further, items up to 200 grams--7 ounces--of ivory can still be \nbought and sold, and that is more ivory than is in any piano or ivory-\ngripped pistol.\n  What the rule will do is stop profiteering off elephant parts in this \ncountry. As long as ivory has monetary value, people will kill \nelephants to get it. Eliminating value will eliminate demand, and it is \na necessary component of the broader U.S. strategy to reduce wildlife \npoaching and trafficking.\n  I am disappointed that Ranking Member Grijalva's amendment to strike \nivory was not made in order in the Rules Committee, but I understand no \none wanting to vote on this floor to be in favor of killing more \nelephants. Regardless, the inclusion of that provision in this bill \nbefore us today shows that somehow we are unaware or unconcerned with \nthe fact that poachers are slaughtering nearly 100 African elephants a \nday.\n\n  Objection 3, Madam Chair, is section 302 of SHARE Act that would \nallow polar bear trophies. It creates a loophole in the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act to allow a handful of wealthy trophy hunters to import \npolar bear trophies into the U.S. in defiance of current law.\n  If passed, this will be the fourth major carve-out by Congress since \n1994 for Americans who have hunted polar bears in Canada. Although the \nnumber of polar bears affected by this loophole will be relatively \nsmall, the cumulative effect of the carve-outs has been detrimental to \nan imperiled species.\n  And these trophy hunters were not caught up in government bureaucracy \nor red tape. All the individuals hunted the bears after the George W. \nBush administration proposed the species for listing as threatened \nunder the Endangered Species Act despite repeated warnings from \ngovernment agencies, hunting groups, and the conservation community \nthat the trophies could face a bar on importation and that these \nhunters were hunting at their own risk.\n  Granting this request would create a dangerous precedent by \nencouraging hunters to race for trophies the moment any species is \nconsidered for listing when such species most need protection, knowing \nthey can rely on Congress later to let them import their trophies.\n  Objection 4, the provision gives States the veto power on Federal \nfishing management and national marine parks, sanctuaries, and \nmonuments.\n  I flew to Homestead, Florida, this past spring, Madam Chair, for \ntheir public hearing on the Biscayne Bay, a national marine that was \nset aside by the park service. It was a small, small percentage of the \ntotal Federal lands and waters. About half the fishermen there were for \nit and half the fishermen were against it, but it missed the fact that \nthese were not State waters and that we in Congress have a \nresponsibility to the entire Nation, not just for any one county or one \nregion.\n  Our oceans cover more than 70 percent of the Earth, and 99 percent of \nthat water is open to fishing, but in some cases science shows that we \nmust protect certain areas. We all want more people to have more \nfishing opportunities, but the fish have to be there.\n  I was impressed by something the director of NOAA told me a couple \nyears ago, that the fishing marine reserves in the Pacific set aside by \nGeorge W. Bush, you can now see them from space because the fish have \nrecovered so quickly within those reserves, that the fishing vessels \noutline the perimeter of the reserve, which you can see from 100 miles \naway.\n  Objection 5, title 15 bars the Forest Service from restricting dog \ndeer hunting on certain national forest lands in Louisiana, \nMississippi, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The aim is to allow for a \ncontinued hunting of deer with dogs, which is an extremely \ncontroversial practice that pits landowners against hunters.\n  Landowners complained. This didn't come from overzealous \nenvironmentalists or Federal regulators. It came from landowner \ncomplaints to the Forest Service to ban deer dogging in the Louisiana \nKisatchie National Forest.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Congress should let expert land managers manage land and other \nresources valued by all Americans. This decision to ban hunting deer \nwith dogs was necessary to create balance among multiple users of the \nforest, and Congress should respect that.\n  Objection 6 is title IV that creates the Recreational Lands Self-\nDefense Act. This bill would actually prohibit the Army from developing \nor enforcing any regulation that prohibits an individual from \npossessing a firearm at recreation areas administered by the Corps of \nEngineers. It is just hard to believe that we are going to restrict the \nArmy from regulating gun use on Army property. If the Army is in charge \nof lands management, it should be able to determine whether firearms \nare appropriate on a site.\n  Army lands abut family homes and other sensitive sites. We should not \nlightly permit access in places where an accidental shot could wind up \nin someone's backyard or in a sensitive location. Accidental shots are \nreal. A longtime family friend--a West Point graduate and a retired \nArmy colonel--was sitting at his desk when a bullet, an accidental \nbullet, came through the window, hit him in the back of the neck, and \nhe is a quadriplegic today.\n  Objection 7 is title IX that changes a successful program, the \nFederal Land Transaction Facilitation Act. On the Natural Resources \nCommittee, we have heard much from the majority, appropriately, about \nhow we need to deal with the incredible infrastructure deferred \nmaintenance backlog that we have on lands that we own. Basically, that \nwe shouldn't buy more until we take care of what we already have. This \nwould allow the existing act to take 100 percent of the land from land \ntransactions and spend it on deferred maintenance.\n  This violates the whole original idea of the act: that we would sell \nFederal land to get more Federal land back. Furthermore, it makes these \nexpenditures subject to appropriation. So if we bring in X million \ndollars in land sold, we don't have to buy or even use that X million \ndollars on new deferred maintenance. It could just go to--wherever.\n  I am disappointed that the bipartisan land-for-land FLTFA version \nthat sportsmen in 165 groups have championed for a decade isn't \nincluded in the SHARE Act today.\n  Objection 8 is title VI. Currently over 75 percent of all Federal \nland is open to hunting and fishing, but title VI deems all Bureau of \nLand Management and Forest Service land open for hunting unless it is \nclosed by the head of the agency through a long closure process. Right \nnow, they can be closed by local land managers.\n  Once again, I find this a little ironic because so much of the theme \nfrom the majority, which I respect, is to move decisionmaking back \nclose to the communities that are actually affected. In this case, they \nare moving it away from the communities and to Washington, D.C., to \nclose these lands. It also undermines the Wilderness Act, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System \nAdministration Act.\n  Finally, Madam Chair, objection 9 is trapping. The SHARE Act would \ndramatically expand the use of body-gripping traps on Federal public \nlands, including in sensitive wilderness areas. The provision takes the \nstep, unprecedented in Federal law, of adding trapping to the \ndefinition of hunting, then creating a presumption that all these \nFederal public lands are open. Millions of acres of land would be open \nto trapping.\n  Even under current law, roughly 6 million targeted animals are killed \nin traps every year, according to Association of Fish and Wildlife \nAgencies. Held in a painful leghold trap, a beaver, a bobcat, a fox, \nwill try desperately to break free in the hours or days until they \nsuccumb to dehydration, predators, or death at the hands of trappers. \nTraps are dangerous and they are indiscriminate in snaring not only \ntargeted areas, but threaten endangered species, pets, or even \nunsuspecting children and adults.\n  Leghold traps have already been prohibited or severely restricted in \nnine U.S. States in over 80 countries. Congress should be acting to \nprotect the public, endangered species, and pets from dangerous and \nindiscriminate body-gripping traps, not expanding their use into \nadditional areas. Really,\n\n[[Page H924]]\n\nhow can trapping be described as sportsmanlike?\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and \nfor his work on behalf of American sportsmen.\n  Madam Chair, three overarching goals should guide our Federal land \npolicy. First, to restore public access to the public lands; second, to \nrestore sound and proven scientific management to the public lands; and \nfinally, to restore the Federal Government as a good neighbor to the \nlocal communities impacted by the public lands.\n  This measure does all three. It removes the arbitrary and capricious \nrestrictions that are increasingly imposed on hunting and fishing by \nvarious Federal agencies; it enlists sportsmen in the long-neglected \nmanagement of overpopulated species; and it gives more funds to States \nfor recreational activities on public lands while encouraging greater \nparticipation by the public in developing these policies.\n  Outdoor sporting activities, including hunting and fishing and \nrecreational shooting, are deeply engrained in the fabric of America's \nculture and heritage that are now under attack by the radical left.\n  In 2011, over 37 million Americans hunted or fished across the \ncountry. These traditional outdoor activities contributed over $90 \nbillion to the U.S. economy in 2011, much of it in the gateway \ncommunities to our public lands. Unfortunately, Federal agencies like \nthe Forest Service and the BLM often prevent or impede public access \nfor outdoor sporting activities. This is a large and growing class of \ncomplaints that my office fields in a district that includes five \nnational forests in the Sierra Nevada of California.\n  One of the key provisions of this bill will increase and sustain \naccess for hunting and fishing and recreational shooting on public \nlands by implementing an ``open until closed'' management policy. It \nalso requires Federal agencies to report to Congress on any closures of \nFederal lands to these pursuits. Another provision would provide State \nand Federal coordination to create and maintain recreational shooting \nranges on the Federal lands.\n  This bill protects the property rights of those who have acquired \nivory products and other trophies over generations, long before any of \nthis hunting was banned, and often passed on down through the \ngenerations within a family. It does absolutely nothing to imperil the \nprotected species under current laws.\n  The purpose of the public lands can be found in the original Yosemite \nGrant Act of 1864: public use, resort, and recreation for all time. The \nSHARE Act recognizes our Nation's hunting and fishing heritage; it \nstrengthens the fundamental right of public use; it secures the vital \nrole that recreational hunting and fishing play in resource management; \nand it guarantees the freedom to sustain that heritage for the many \ngenerations of Americans to come.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2406. This bill is \nbeing described as a simple package to support hunting and fishing on \nFederal lands.\n  For fishing and hunting to be sustained, it must be done with a mind \ntoward conservation. Unfortunately, this bill fails to achieve this \nneed, and it threatens the very environment that supports the animals. \nOf course, by doing so, it endangers the sustainability and long-term \nviability of hunting and fishing, also.\n  Furthermore, this bill ignores scientifically based best practices, \nleaving these lands at risk. While there are numerous bad provisions in \nthe bill, including allowing ill-advised ivory and polar bear \nimportation and actually preventing scientifically based regulations, \nthis bill is particularly troubling because it limits Federal \nmanagement, lead ammunition, and fishing tackle.\n  We hear every day about the dangers of lead. The devastating impacts \nof lead poisoning are not just restricted to people. I have seen these \ndangers firsthand, as they are extremely apparent in my district on the \ncentral coast of California.\n  As anyone from California knows, the California condor, the largest \nNorth American land bird and an iconic species along the central coast, \nwas on the brink of extinction, in large part due to lead poisoning. A \nlooming threat to this species remains, so we must stay vigilant. In \nfact, this danger is so imminent that published research shows that the \nspecies is unlikely to survive unless we continue to substantially \nreduce the threat of lead in the environment.\n  The source of this lead is not a mystery. It is in large part the \nresult of lead from hunting and fishing equipment. Lead poisoning is a \nterrible and cruel way for any animal to die. While the risk to condors \nis immediate, this risk is not limited in any way to this one species.\n  Continuing to pollute our lands and waters with lead ammunition and \nfishing tackle makes absolutely no sense. But the bill before us would \nkeep the Federal Government from doing anything to address this issue. \nIt is so dangerous and shortsighted.\n  That is why I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee which would \nhave removed this dangerous language from the bill; but unfortunately, \nwe will not be able to fix this problem on the floor because my \namendment has been blocked from a vote. Despite its name, the SHARE Act \nwould do little good and a great deal of harm. This is a bad bill.\n  I urge my colleagues strenuously to oppose it.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise).\n  Mr. SCALISE. Madam Chair, I want to thank my friend from Virginia for \nyielding and for his leadership in bringing the SHARE Act forward.\n  I rise in strong support of this legislation that protects the rights \nof sportsmen and protects the rights of gun owners.\n  Madam Chair, I am proud to come from Louisiana, which is called the \nSportsman's Paradise. We have great traditions of hunting and fishing \nthroughout our State.\n  If you look at the barrage of regulations that have come out from \nthis administration over the years, it has attacked so many different \nfundamental aspects of our society, so many things that make our \ncountry great. Of course, the right to hunt and fish is something that \nis not only a fundamental right for people, but it is actually \nsomething that brings families together. It is one of the great \ntraditions that we love to share with our children. Our parents brought \nus hunting and fishing.\n  Yet if you look at some of the regulations coming out of these \nFederal agencies today, it is actually undermining those rights. What \nthis bill is targeted at is restoring those rights, to make sure, for \nexample, when you have got agencies like the Corps of Engineers that \nare trying to arbitrarily shut off lands for the ability of people to \ngo hunt, they shouldn't be able to do that. In fact, under this \nlegislation, they won't be able to continue doing that. No unelected \nbureaucrat should be able to limit the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n  Something else we have seen, Madam Chair, is the Environmental \nProtection Agency, unfortunately an agency we hear a lot about around \nthis town, that is out there threatening jobs, taking away the ability \nfor people to do things that are important to their everyday lives.\n  The EPA has been threatening to ban lead ammo and tackle. In this \nbill, we block the EPA from being able to ban lead ammo. Again, this is \nsomething that is fundamental to our rights as sportsmen, as hunters \nand fishermen, to be able to enjoy the fruits of our land.\n  There are over 50 sports organizations that are supporting this \nlegislation. I just want to read from the National Rifle Association's \nInstitute for Legislative Action: ``The SHARE Act would give law-\nabiding gun owners more access to carry firearms on land managed by the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, protect lead-based ammunition, and promote the \nconstruction and maintenance of public target ranges.''\n  Madam Chair, it is important legislation. I encourage all of our \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page H925]]\n\nto support it and pass it over to the Senate.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Walz).\n  Mr. WALZ. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.\n  I rise in support of the SHARE Act and the Sportsmen's Heritage and \nRecreational Enhancement Act.\n  I thank my co-chair on the Sportsmen's Caucus, Mr. Wittman, for his \nwork on this bill. Like so many you have heard here today, we, as a \nNation, are blessed with an abundance of opportunities in the outdoors. \nLike so many, I take advantage of them: hiking, biking, hunting, and \nfishing.\n  For those who do participate in hunting and fishing, it truly is a \npassion, it is a way of life, and it is a heritage that we share with \nour parents. I don't think there is one of us who participated in it \nwho doesn't remember a crisp autumn morning, waking up with our father, \ncooking breakfast, and going out to the field with the dew on the grass \nand the Sun coming up. To this day, I don't remember if we necessarily \ngot a pheasant, but I remember my dad, and I remember talking about it.\n  It was on those trips that I think we understood that hunting and \nfishing, as a way of life, is not in a vacuum.\n  Hunting and fishing in Minnesota, 1.7 million Minnesotans participate \nin hunting and fishing. That contributes $3 billion to our economy and \ncreates 48,000 direct jobs. If you take that across the Nation, it is \n$90 billion a year to our economy. That is not in a vacuum either, \nbecause we have a really unique system of conservation in this country: \nuser pays and public benefits. Every shell and cartridge that is \npurchased and every fishing rod and boat that is purchased has an \nexcise tax in it that goes back into the very conservation.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  The people who are out hunting and fishing understand as well as \nanyone, if you don't have the proper habitat, you don't have the \npheasants.\n  An organization like I belong to, Pheasants Forever, has literally \nput in all of the money and has leveraged this in order to turn tens of \nthousands of acres of the prairie back to virgin prairie, which are now \nabundant with game for people to take advantage of. Those are the types \nof things that make sense.\n  I understand the concerns that the gentleman expressed, and I \nunderstand that this is not a perfect bill. But I can tell you that it \nhas been worked on for a long time and that it is a starting point.\n  There is a realization and an understanding that we have to \ncompromise on issues. We are going to have to work with the Senate, and \nwe are going to get this in front of the President.\n  Yet, I think most of us agree that our goal with this is to allow \nAmericans to continue to have their constitutional rights and their \nabilities to do those activities they want, whether that be hiking, \nwhether that be mountain biking, whether that be hunting, or whether \nthat be fishing and, at the same time, to make sure that there is an \neconomic engine in it that contributes to the ability to keep those \nlands up.\n  I ask my friends to approach it with an open mind and to understand \nthat this is truly deeply engrained in this culture. There are \ncommonalities here. We have the same goals, to make sure these are \navailable for our children.\n  If we can come together and work on this, we have to take this first \nstep. We are becoming a more populated country, and there are fewer \nopportunities for people to get out there. Many people are not \nlandowners themselves; so, the public lands are the only places at \nwhich these activities can take place.\n  There is enough out there. If we manage it right, we can share the \nland, as the act says, and we can do those activities that mean a lot \nto us and continue them for future generations.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I thank Mr. Wittman and Mr. Walz for \nworking with our committee to bring this bipartisan bill together to \nprotect hunting and shooting heritages.\n  One of the things that I, as well as many of my colleagues, hear \nrepeatedly from our constituents is the complaint that land management \nagencies have blocked access to Federal lands. That especially goes for \nhunters and anglers and target shooters.\n  Our national monuments alone have already closed 928,000 acres to \nhunting and recreational shooting. Most of those areas are, \nunfortunately, easily accessible. You don't have to walk miles to try \nand get to them.\n  There are some who condemn this by saying that the vast majority of \npublic lands is still open for hunting and shooting. The problem is the \nproximity.\n  The ones that are being closed are those that are easily accessible \nto especially those people who live in urban areas who don't have to go \nmiles and miles to do it.\n  In addition to that, the problem is that the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Forest Service make no assessment on the impact of \nclosing lands to shooters or to anglers.\n  They don't identify where the displaced recreationalists are being \nable to go, how far they have to travel, or what kind of access would \nbe available to them. At a minimum, this bill forces them to take that \ninto consideration.\n  I wish it were tougher language that would force them to make some \nkind of accommodations. But at least for the first time they are \nactually going to consider those issues, because hunting and fishing \nand shooting are part of the multiple-use mandate for our public lands. \nThere is no question about it.\n  I also want to make a couple of points very clear in that the \nlanguage in title IV that deals with this bill, that deals with the \nArmy Corps lands, allows law-abiding American citizens to carry \nfirearms on Army Corps recreational lands.\n  The Army Corps is not the Army. There is a difference between the \ntwo. We are not talking about military lands, but recreational lands.\n  What this does is make these recreational lands that are owned by the \nArmy Corps of Engineers compliant and parallel to the laws we have for \nthe Forest Service as well as for the BLM and the Park Service, as it \ndeals with carrying weapons as long as they are in compliance with \nState and Federal law.\n  Many Members think this is, basically, a hunting issue. It is not. \nThe primary reason for this language has to do with the fundamental \nright of self-defense, and it does make it consistent.\n  I want to make two final points here.\n  The Natural Resources Committee strongly encourages the Bureau of \nLand Management and the U.S. Forest Service to develop agency-wide \npolicies, in consultation with the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage \nConservation Council and the Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership \nCouncil, that reflect the intent of this act. These policies should \nensure that there is more access to America's Federal lands for \nhunting, fishing, and recreational shooting.\n  These councils represent the interests and needs of sportsmen and -\nwomen who depend on having access to Federal lands for outdoor sporting \nactivities.\n  I will also be reaching out to the Bureau of Land Management and to \nthe Forest Service for regular updates on the progress being made in \ndeveloping these policies within 30 days of each respective council \nmeeting.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's compliance and understanding.\n  Vote for what is good about this bill, not for what is not there.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), my colleague and good friend.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting \nme to speak on this bill.\n  Madam Chair, I, too, am a passionate advocate of public spaces, of \noutdoor recreation, and I understand the importance of protecting some \nof our Nation's most pristine places.\n  My constituents enjoy hunting and fishing and are involved in \nexploring the great outdoors. That is why it is unfortunate that what \nwe have before us today is a piece of legislation that is unduly \npartisan and special-interest-oriented and is not speaking in terms of \nthings that could have brought us\n\n[[Page H926]]\n\ntogether in something that could have been a lovefest.\n  Why aren't we making a permanent reauthorization of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund and making sure that it is funded?\n  Yesterday we had hundreds and hundreds of women from the Federated \nGarden Club of America, just one more group adding its voice to \nsomething that is supported by people who hunt, people who fish, people \nwho hike, people who enjoy the opportunity of what the Land and Water \nConservation Fund represents.\n  Instead, we are veering off. We are in the process now of having \nlegislation in this bill that does pose serious problems in terms of \nenvironmental protections. I will give one specific example in terms of \nwhat is happening in the area of ivory.\n  Voters in Washington recently voted overwhelmingly to ban on a State \nlevel traffic in ivory. You are going to see this fall in my State of \nOregon that an initiative is going to be approved that is going to \nclose loopholes in terms of allowing trade in my State for ivory.\n  This has nothing to do with grandma's antique piano or somebody who \nhas an ivory-handled pistol that has been in the family for years. We \nhave a thriving international trade in ivory that is resulting in the \ndestruction of a species. We are losing 100 elephants a day.\n  At the rate we are going, by the end of the decade--within 10 years--\nthere will be no more wild African elephants. The trade in ivory fuels \nsome of the most heinous acts by some of the most vicious people in the \nworld.\n  Terrorists use these funds for their horrific activities, \nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa, poisoning wells so that the animals \nare dying by the dozens, hacking off the tusks at that site.\n  We have to stop the trade in ivory. The United States is the second \nlargest destination. We have China that is finally stepping up and \nworking with us. We should not make it harder for the United States to \ncrack down on the ivory trade.\n  There is no reason for a civilized society to continue trading in \nthings like ivory tusks and products. It enables this black market to \ncontinue. People will find their way into it, and we will continue to \nslaughter elephants every single day.\n  What we should be doing is not restricting what the Federal \nGovernment is doing. We should be tightening it further like we will do \nin the State of Oregon.\n  I find it a little frustrating that people are talking about \nprotecting traditional ammunition and fishing lure. I mean, there are \nsome people who might say, in Flint, Michigan, using lead in the pipes \nis a traditional way of plumbing, but we figured out that that \ntraditional mechanism is actually poisoning people.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. There are, in fact, alternatives if what you want to \ndo is kill animals with guns. We don't need to do lead-based \nammunition, which ends up in the environment. It ends up not just in \nwhat you are killing. It doesn't go away. It persists and adds to lead \npollution.\n  There is no reason that we can't make changes in these policies that \nwe know are destructive, that we know there are viable alternatives to \nthat actually protect the environment.\n  As people work through this legislation and hear from animal welfare \ngroups, sports people, and environmentalists and as they look at the \nproblems that are associated with it, it is not a consensus, bipartisan \nbill.\n  It is an approach that actually leads us in the wrong direction. It \nis not rational. It is not popular. It is not based in sound policy. I \nstrongly urge its rejection.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like respond just briefly to the gentleman's remarks \nconcerning ivory.\n  If you look at the current state of regulatory efforts by the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, for those nations that have sustainable \nelephant populations, it would actually make it much, much more \ndifficult to manage them and it would actually encourage more poaching.\n  We want to make sure that we allow the legal trade of legally \nharvested elephants. In doing that, that makes sure that African \nnations can put in place sustainable programs for the harvesting of \nelephants, where there are overpopulations, to make sure that they have \nthe wherewithal to put people on the ground to stop poaching.\n  This is a sustainable effort, I believe, that is critical, and these \nregulations will actually stop that.\n  Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nBenishek).\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 2406, the \nSportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act of 2015, or the \nSHARE Act.\n  This legislation is vital in ensuring that Federal agencies like the \nU.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management can no longer \ncontinue to prevent or deny full access to Federal lands for activities \nlike hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting.\n  Access to public, Federal lands for these heritage activities is not \nonly an important part of our shared American value, it is also a \nsignificant contributor to national, State, and local economies.\n  In 2011, in the State of Michigan alone, over 1.9 million hunters and \nanglers spent over $4.8 billion in hunting and fishing. To put this in \nperspective, spending by sportsmen and -women in Michigan generates \nover $576 million in State and local taxes each year. That is enough to \nsupport the average salaries of over 10,000 police officers.\n  Madam Chair, when I was a kid, my family owned a small hotel and bar. \nI worked by making beds, by filling ice buckets, and by hauling beer in \norder to save for college. Our business depended on hunters in the fall \nand winter and on fishermen in the summer. Without those sportsmen, we \nwould have had no small business.\n  There are small businesses like this all over northern Michigan and \nacross America today. There are also grandparents, parents, and \nchildren all across the country who are excited for their next hunting \nand fishing adventures.\n  That is why we must make sure that we do everything possible to \nensure access to public lands for hunting, fishing, and recreational \nshooting for all Americans, including for future generations to come.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the SHARE Act.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) for \nhis leadership and for the service that he has given to this Congress. \nWe are so delighted to have him join us. I thank the manager as well, \nhis colleague from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Madam Chair, in coming from Texas and knowing many of those who seek \nrecreational hunting, fishing, and participation on lands, private and \nFederal, one wonders whether or not we could have found a way to deal \nwith the concerns of our friends of whom I support: environmental \ngroups and the Humane Society and just a litany of individuals from the \nAtlantis, the Alaska Wilderness League, the Alliance of the Wild \nRockies, the Humane Society International, the Endangered Species \nCoalition, the Environmental Investigation Agency, the National Audubon \nSociety, the Kentucky Heartwood, and just a whole array of individuals, \nthe names of whom I will offer into the Record at another time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  This bill comes and specifically interferes with what I believe is \nthe important protection, if you will, of items that impact our \nwilderness.\n  This bill undermines the NEPA Wilderness Act and the National \nWildlife Refuge System Administration Act to solve a problem that does \nnot exist. It blocks the administration's rule to restrict trade in \nAfrican elephant ivory and protects African elephants from being \nslaughtered for their tusks. It adds indiscriminate and inhumane \ntrapping practices to the legal definition of hunting and does not \ninclude a long-term reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, a high priority for hunters and anglers.\n  My simple question is: Couldn't we have found some common ground and\n\n[[Page H927]]\n\nnot be supporting legislation that, for one, my amendment on polar \nbears will, in fact, impact; that the wealthy trophy hunters who shot \nbears had full knowledge of the pending rule? This is an issue that \noccurred when 41 polar bears were killed as the Fish and Wildlife \nService finalized a rule listing them as threatened under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The polar bears are vulnerable. They are not yet under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, but they are vulnerable. So we have individuals who want \nto take advantage and seek to utilize the loophole. That is my \nopposition to this legislation, that it does not find a balance.\n  What it does do is it puts our animals in jeopardy, animals that make \nfor the ecosystem in a positive way.\n  So I would ask my colleagues really to go back to the drawing board \nand come forward with a bill that actually protects animals, allows \nsport but does not undermine the whole ecosystem, undermine the \nstructure of protecting animals, and certainly, in the memory of \nCecil--although a lion--continue to kill our vulnerable species of \npolar bears just to have trophies.\n  I urge opposition to this bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2406, the Sportsmen's \nHeritage and Recreational Enhancement Act of 2015 (SHARE Act).\n  While several of the proposals are non-controversial, the bill \nincludes provisions that would seriously undermine the Wilderness Act, \nthe National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act, \nand fails to include important, bipartisan program reauthorizations \nsought by outdoor enthusiasts.\n  There are many for reasons for opposing this bill but I list just a \nfew:\n  More than 75 percent of all federal lands are already open to \nrecreational hunting, fishing and shooting, making the bulk of this \nlegislation unnecessary.\n  Undermines NEPA, the Wilderness Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem Administration Act to solve a problem that does not exist.\n  Blocks efforts to crack down on poachers and protect elephants from \nbeing slaughtered for their tusks.\n  Adds indiscriminate and inhumane trapping practices to the legal \ndefinition of hunting.\n  Does not include a long-term reauthorization of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, a high priority program for hunters and anglers.\n  Does not include important, bipartisan program reauthorizations that \nwould provide critical funding for wetlands conservation and expanding \nhunting and fishing access; programs supported by hunters and anglers.\n  Exempts ammunition and sports fishing equipment from the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act (TSCA) despite the fact that EPA has no plans to \nregulate this equipment under the Act.\n  Mr. Chair, H.R. 2406 simply patches together a slew of legislative \nproposals, allegedly to enhance access to federal lands for hunting, \nfishing and recreational shooting.\n  The bill is opposed by virtually every leading environmental \norganization and the President has announced that it will be vetoed if \npresented to him for signature.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this unwise and \nunnecessary legislation.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2406, the \nSportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act; specifically, \ntitle IV of the bill, which includes the Recreational Lands Self-\nDefense Act. This legislation is vital to preserving and expanding the \nSecond Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\n  In 2010, legislation was enacted that allows campers, hikers, and \nsportsmen who are legally allowed to possess a firearm to protect \nthemselves and their families on land operated by the National Park \nService or the Fish and Wildlife Service. Unfortunately, this law left \nmillions of acres overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers closed \nto those who want to legally arm and protect themselves.\n  Every year, millions of Americans camp, hunt, and hike on Federal \nlands. They are often in remote locations with no easy access to \nemergency services or law enforcement. These Americans deserve to have \npeace of mind and the ability to protect themselves while recreating.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers' interpretation of the law preempts State \nfirearms laws; thus, preventing Americans from exercising their Second \nAmendment rights. Even if someone is permitted by the State to carry a \nfirearm, they cannot do so while on the Corps' 11.7 million acres or \ncamping at one of the Corps' 90,000 campsites.\n  Title IV will prevent the Corps from prohibiting law-abiding American \ncitizens from carrying a firearm as long as they are not prohibited \nfrom owning a firearm and the possession of the firearm is in \ncompliance with the State they are located in.\n  This title in the SHARE Act will provide uniformity and clarity for \nhunters, campers, and hikers who want to merely protect themselves, and \nit will preserve the right to bear arms on recreational Federal lands.\n  I want to thank Congressman Wittman for introducing this legislation \nand including the Recreational Lands Self-Defense Act in the underlying \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the SHARE Act.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I inquire how much time the minority side has \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Walker). The gentleman from Virginia has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2406, the \nSHARE Act. Passage of this bill will increase opportunities and reduce \nregulatory burdens for all sportsmen and sportswomen.\n  I want to highlight two specific provisions in the SHARE Act that I \nsponsored. This legislation will authorize the Wildlife and Hunting \nHeritage Conservation Council, which will serve as an official advisory \nboard to the Department of the Interior and the Department of \nAgriculture on policies that benefit recreational hunting and wildlife \nresources. Authorization of the council is vital to ensuring that \nhunters maintain an advisory role in future administrations. This \nlegislation will provide levels of certainty and stability necessary to \nensure the council's ability to engage in assisting the Federal \nGovernment in devising and implementing long-term solutions that are \nnecessary to address policy issues important to sportsmen and \nsportswomen.\n  The legislation also directs the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to create a new permit that authorizes a crew \nof five or fewer people to film for commercial or similar purposes on \nFederal lands and waterways at an annual cost of $200. Aside from this \nset fee, no additional fees may be added during their time filming and \nphotographing.\n  We want to rectify disparity in application and approval regulations \nbetween smaller crews and their larger, well-funded counterparts while \nfilming on public lands. The financial burden is often too great and \nunfairly limits their ability to access our national parks and \nwaterways.\n  As the former co-chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus and \na cosponsor of the SHARE Act, I believe this legislation will serve to \nthe betterment of current and future generations of hunters and \noutdoorsmen and -women.\n  I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his work on this legislation, \nand I urge the passage of the SHARE Act.\n  Mr. BEYER. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chair, in closing, I would like to thank the co-chairs of the \nCongressional Sportsmen's Caucus, Mr. Wittman and Mr. Walz, for putting \nthis together.\n  I clearly resist the idea that our opposition comes from the radical \nleft. The 37 million hunters and fishermen out there are not Democrats. \nThey are not Republicans. They are both. They are not conservative or \nliberal. They represent all Americans.\n  Representative McClintock and Chairman Bishop talked about the \n928,000 acres, BLM and Forest Service, which are closed now. I very \nmuch respect that that seems like a big number and that perhaps there \nshould be movement on that.\n  I think the question is: Should those decisions be made by State and \nlocal land managers or moved to Washington, D.C., to the head of the \nForest Service, to the head of BLM? I think it is weird that, in this \nbody, we are talking about moving things to Washington for the decision \nto be made.\n\n[[Page H928]]\n\n  In fact, in the hearing we had on Chairman Bishop's Land and Water \nConservation Fund reauthorization, much of it was about moving the \ndecisionmaking back to States and local governments. Perhaps there is a \nway to think about opening up these 928,000 acres with more input from \nState and local governments in the time to come.\n  On ivory and trafficking, Representative Wittman and I had a good \nconversation about how we really don't want it to address heirlooms \nthat have been in the family for generations. That is not what the \nObama rule is trying to do. We are looking at preventing trafficking.\n  Every 15 minutes every day, an elephant is killed. I would love to \nexplore the economic argument that somehow this ivory rule will make \nAfrican elephants more endangered. What we are trying to do is cut off \ndemand.\n\n  Finally, Majority Whip Scalise talked about being hostile to hunting \nand fishing. I do think it is probably silly to think of the Army Corps \nof Engineers as a radical leftist organization. We want them to open \nthe lands appropriately, but this is probably not the legislation to do \nit.\n  I think many of these provisions will likely be dead on arrival in \nthe Senate. If it passes, as it is likely to do with the majority, I am \nlooking forward to working with Representative Wittman, Representative \nWalz, and others to get a good, bipartisan bill at the end of the day \nthat we can all support for the hunters and fishermen of the United \nStates.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for \nhis perspectives on this and for the good conversation we have had in \ntrying to find common ground to make sure that we are, indeed, \nsupporting the great outdoors and the sportsmen and -women that enjoy \nthe great outdoors. I thank him for his efforts there and look forward \nto continuing to work with him.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Wittman \nfor his leadership on this issue. As a vice chair of the Congressional \nSportsmen's Caucus, I commend the caucus co-chairs, Chairman Wittman \nand Tim Walz, as well as my fellow vice chair, Gene Green, for the \ngreat work they have done to contribute to the SHARE Act's Sportsmen's \npackage on the floor today.\n  The Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus is the largest bipartisan caucus \nin Congress. By offering commonsense policy solutions that expand the \njoys of hunting, angling, as well as shooting sports and, really, \naccess to public lands and all the great outdoors, our goal is to be \nthe voice of millions of American sportsmen and -women who treasure \nthis unique feature of American heritage.\n  The SHARE Act is supported by the Nation's leading hunting and \nfishing conservation organizations, making it a bipartisan win for the \nsportsmen and -women of America. It includes the Recreational Fishing \nand Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act; the Hunting, Fishing, and \nRecreational Shooting Protection Act; the Target Practice and \nMarksmanship Training Support Act; and the Hunter and Farmer Protection \nAct. These, along with many other hunting and fishing conservation \nprovisions, will strengthen America's bond to the blessings given to \nour great country.\n  Most important to our role as leaders of the Congressional \nSportsmen's Caucus is to promote policies that bring more potential \nhunters, anglers, and recreational shooters into the sportsmen's \ncommunity. Sportsmen and -women are leading contributors to the \nconservation of the great American outdoors.\n  As a sidebar, I would just ask folks to really research the \ncontribution that hunters make in the whole African elephant goal, \nbecause the lack of the hunter in that equation means there is more \npoaching; and I think, ultimately, that will be detrimental to the \nAfrican elephant and detrimental to the goals of those who want to \nprotect that.\n  In conclusion, I request your support for this bill to ensure that we \ncan protect this sacred institution of American heritage.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his leadership as vice \nchairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus.\n  We have heard a lot of, I think, good efforts today in wanting to \nensure that our sportsmen and our sportswomen have access to Federal \nproperties, to make sure they can enjoy outdoor sports. I think that is \nabsolutely critical. That is what this bill is about. It is about \nclarifying to make sure that it is the legislative body that does the \ndirecting, not the bureaucrats. I want to make sure there is a balance \nthere because we hear each and every day from our constituents about \nwhat they feel needs to happen with their land.\n  We must remember this land belongs to the taxpayers, and we must find \nresponsible ways to make sure that there is access to that land for \neveryone. I want to make sure that we do that. I believe that this bill \nachieves that.\n  I understand, too, that we want to make sure that their voices are \nheard. Many times from the side of these agencies, they will consider \ncomments, but many times the comments aren't included. This ensures \nthat Congress has a role in defining what those opportunities are. I \nwant to make sure those voices are heard. I can't help but believe that \neveryone here is in favor of making sure that their voices are heard \nand that opportunities exist across all these Federal lands for our \noutdoorsmen, our sportsmen and -women of this Nation.\n  I want to make sure, too, that we are clear that all of us are \nagainst stopping the illegal trafficking of ivory. All of us here want \nto make sure that stops. I think there are reasonable and thoughtful \nways that do that that don't inhibit the sportsmen who want to go there \nto be part of the legal process to harvest an elephant in the areas \nwhere there is an overpopulation. The dollars there are used to support \nlocal populations in that area, villages.\n  None of that animal is wasted. Every bit of it is used. The fees that \nare collected for hunters are put into stopping the poaching effort \nthere. I think those are sustainable models to make sure that elephant \npopulations continue in those areas and that we, indeed, have the \nability and resources in Africa to stop those efforts by poachers.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I think sustainable hunting is a way to do that. In any way impeding \nthe flow of ivory back into the United States from legal hunting \noperations doesn't allow us to do that. Making sure, too, that it is \nsimple and straightforward for owners of ivory to continue to own that, \nespecially those pieces that are family heirlooms, and not have to go \nthrough a long, drawn-out bureaucratic process to prove that something \nis yours that has been passed down through family history where you may \nnot have documentation to do that.\n  These efforts that U.S. Fish and Wildlife agencies are putting \nforward would make it in many instances very, very difficult for \nindividuals and families to demonstrate that. Let's make this process \neasy and let's get at the issue, and that is the illegally harvested \nivory that is coming out of Africa to the United States.\n  We talked, too, about access elements. We heard the number used that \n99 percent of our ocean waters are open to fishing, to recreational \nfishing. But remember that the entire ocean is different in its \nhabitats. So fish live in certain areas. I would argue that the 1 \npercent that is being closed off many times is the most productive area \nfor fishermen. It is where the habitat rests. It is where the fish are.\n  So if you were to say, don't worry about it, you can hunt the entire \nSahara Desert, that wouldn't mean much to sportsmen. The same that you \nare saying if you are allowed to fish these other areas that don't hold \nthe habitat that allow fish to live in those areas also doesn't keep in \nmind making sure that recreational fishermen have access to the place \nwhere fish live. So I want to make sure that that is clear when we talk \nabout these numbers, 99 percent versus the 1 percent.\n  Remember, this bill is not about what is not included. It is about \nreally making those opportunities available for those men and women who \nhunt, fish, and use the outdoors. I am in full\n\n[[Page H929]]\n\nsupport of LWCF. I am in full support of NAWCA. I do believe that we \nought to reauthorize those pieces of legislation, and I do believe that \nthere are mechanisms to do that. I believe that the vast majority of \nfolks on our Committee on Natural Resources, as well as in Congress, \nwant to see those things happening.\n  The difficulty always is in taking one bill and adding a bunch of \ndifferent elements to it. I think those bills are important enough that \nthey deserve their own level of debate and own level of attention about \nwhat we do in reauthorizing those bills.\n  I think folks outside the 90 square miles of Washington look at us \nand say, you know, why are you putting all these other elements into a \nbill rather than debating them individually?\n  I think we can put too much into a piece of legislation where it \nbecomes confusing and it doesn't get after the true purpose behind the \noriginal bill. We tried to put together pieces that were similar in \nscope but didn't include other areas that really deserve their own \nlevel of debate.\n  So that is the reason that LWCF and NAWCA was left out of this, not \nby any intention to say we shouldn't address those, but by \nunderstanding that we have a responsibility to try to keep these \npackages of bills as simple and straightforward as we can.\n  Also, when we talk about lead, remember that the lead we talk about \nis in things like fishing sinkers. Remember, fishing sinkers are used \nin water. The gentlewoman from California talked about the issue with \nCalifornia condors. Well, California condors are not an aquatic bird, \nso I don't think we have to worry about them swimming in water and \ngetting hold of these fishing sinkers.\n  The same way with bullets. I understand there are a few instances \nwhere they might have found a bullet associated with ingestion with a \nCalifornia condor, but the vast majority of shooting sports are put \nforth in legal ranges where the lead ends up in the ground. It ends up \nin the ground at a shooting range. Remember, that is the exact area \nwhere the lead came from. So returning it to the ground where we know \neventually through the years it does indeed decay, it does indeed break \ndown, those things are legal and I think environmentally responsible \nways that lead is used in both hunting and fishing. Let's not stop \nthose efforts. I want to make sure that those things happen.\n  If there are specific issues related to the California condor, I \nthink we ought to address that, but these carte blanche one-size-fits-\nall efforts to say let's ban lead across the spectrum in the shooting \nsports, for hunting, and for fishing doesn't get at those root issues \nand it creates unnecessary burdens on folks who are using those in a \nlegal way and in a way that doesn't affect our fish and wildlife \npopulations. So I want to make sure that those things continue.\n  I do believe that there are many more areas of agreement than \ndisagreement on this bill. I think that we have talked to folks on many \naspects of this. It is different in its scope with the Senate bill, and \nI look forward to its successful passage out of this House and for our \nability to bring it to a conference committee in the Senate and to work \nthrough those particular differences between the House and the Senate \nbill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2406, \nthe SHARE Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I support H.R. 2406, the \nSportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act or SHARE Act.\n  Recreational hunting and fishing are some of the oldest traditions in \nAmerica. I went on my first hunting trip in the early 70's and have \nloved gaming ever since. The sport was a great way to bond with my \nfather-in-law and a great tradition to pass on to my own son.\n  I am not alone in enjoying this great tradition. Sportsmen and women \ncontribute billions of dollars to the U.S. economy, support thousands \nof jobs and enrich our culture. Texas is home to 2,713,000 hunters and \nanglers, making it the second biggest state for sportsmen and women in \nthe nation.\n  H.R. 2406, the SHARE Act, is supported by more than 50 of the \nnation's leading conservation groups and includes provisions that will \nexpand access for hunters and anglers and protect the environment \nthrough conservation efforts.\n  The SHARE Act will protect access to BLM and U.S. Forest Service land \nfor hunting and fishing, reauthorize the Federal Land Transaction \nFacilitation Act and allows fish and wildlife agencies added \nflexibility to construct public shooting ranges.\n  Ensuring future generations of Americans have access to these great \ntraditions must be our priority going forward.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2406, the SHARE \nAct. This legislation would protect 2nd Amendment rights and prevent \nunnecessary federal regulations from limiting access to outdoor \nsporting activities.\n  Activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting \ncontribute billions of dollars to our economy. But, it's impossible to \nput a dollar value on what they mean to millions of American families.\n  For many Texans--myself included--hunting and fishing are more than \nsimple hobbies. They are family traditions that get passed down through \ngenerations. These traditions bring us together and teach invaluable \nlessons about gun safety and environmental responsibility.\n  Passing the SHARE Act will protect 2nd Amendment rights and help \nensure that our sporting traditions can continue for generations to \ncome.\n  I call on all my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHill) having assumed the chair, Mr. Walker, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2406) to \nprotect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, fishing, \nand shooting, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution \nthereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H929-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE FALLEN SOLDIERS OF THE 14TH QUARTERMASTER DETACHMENT \n                     DURING OPERATION DESERT STORM\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS.

These brave men and women were supporting operations to \nliberate the people of Kuwait. Even though 13 of these soldiers gave \ntheir lives 25 years ago today--another 43 were wounded--the impact of \ntheir sacrifice and their loss has not faded and will not be forgotten.\n  We owe these soldiers and their families a debt of gratitude that can \nnever be repaid, and we sympathize with the pain endured by those they \nleft behind.

Mr. Speaker, we are nearing the end of Black History \nMonth. We had a special program yesterday recognizing foot soldiers of \nthe civil rights movement. It reminded me of a man who is a foot \nsoldier up here in Washington, Wade Henderson.\n  Wade Henderson is the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference \non Civil and Human Rights and the Leadership Conference Education Fund. \nHe announced he is going to be retiring after 20 years as the head of \nthat organization at the end of this year.\n  Wade Henderson has worked with Republicans and Democrats both to \nbring about change in our country. He was largely responsible for work \non the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act\n\n[[Page H930]]\n\nwhen it passed and had been working on trying to get it renewed in this \nCongress. He worked in a major way on the Fair Sentencing Act that took \naway the disparity in crack and cocaine sentences that was wrongful.\n  Before he came to his position at the Leadership Conference, he was \nactive in the NAACP here in Washington, where he was the bureau \ndirector, and he worked on other issues with the ACLU and other groups \non civil and human rights.\n  When Wade Henderson came to the Capitol, he was a voice of \nconscience. He and Hilary Shelton, together with the NAACP, are two of \nthe most conscientious men I know. They have served this country well. \nI will miss him in his retirement. I appreciate the remaining time he \nhas. He is a foot soldier.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the efforts \nbehind an incredible breakthrough in humanity's understanding of the \nuniverse: the first detection ever of the existence of gravitational \nwaves.\n  Gravitational waves are invisible ripples in the fabric of space-\ntime. Albert Einstein theorized their existence 100 years ago as part \nof his theory of general relativity.\n  After more than a decade of work by researchers at two identical \nobservatories--one in Livingston, Louisiana, and another in Hanford, \nWashington, located in my congressional district--Einstein's theory of \nthe existence of gravitational waves has direct evidence as scientific \nfact.\n  On February 11, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave \nObservatory, or LIGO, Scientific Collaboration officially confirmed \nthat the world's most sensitive instruments at these observatories had \ndetected gravitational waves for the first time. The gravitational wave \ndetected by LIGO's team was the result of the collision of two black \nholes 1.3 billion years ago.\n  Congratulations to my constituents and the entire LIGO team on their \nhistoric discovery, which will continue to add to the scientific \nunderstanding of the universe for generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H930-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BACKDOOR KEY TO THE IPHONE\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Benjamin Franklin said: ``Those who \nwould give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, \ndeserve neither liberty nor safety.''\n  A Federal judge now has ordered that Apple take an unprecedented step \ndeveloping a backdoor key for an iPhone.

Americans' \nconstitutional right of privacy is under attack by the spying eyes of a \npowerful government.\n  My legislation, H.R. 2233, End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans \nAct, specifically prohibits the government from either mandating or \nrequesting that a backdoor key be installed in the private phones of \ncitizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, privacy must not be sacrificed on the altar of temporary \nsafety and false security.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H930-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF OFFICER JASON MOSZER\n\n  (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. CRAMER.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and \nextend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, let me start off with some \nsobering news. I call it the body count.\n  Last year, 2015, in the United States, there were 41,000 suicide \ndeaths in this country. There were 45,000 deaths from drug overdoses. \nMany of those folks suffered from depression. There were an estimated \n1,200 homicides by people who are seriously mentally ill. About half of \nall deadly police encounters occurred with someone who is mentally ill.\n  There is an unknown number of mentally ill who died 25 years sooner \nbecause they tend to die of chronic illnesses. There is about one \nhomeless person per day in Los Angeles who dies. We know about 200,000 \nhomeless people in this country are mentally ill.\n  It is a sad case in any numbers. But if you add those numbers up, \neven the most conservative version is that there were some 85,000 \ndeaths last year related to mental illness--and it is probably much \nhigher--and more have died from mental illness-related problems than \nthe total United States combat\n\n[[Page H931]]\n\ndeaths of the entire Korean War and Vietnam Wars combined.\n  That is sobering, but it is worse. It is worse because we could \nprevent a large number of these mental illness problems. We could save \nmany of those with mental illness from their early demise. We could \nsave their families from suffering. But, unfortunately, the Federal \nGovernment is the problem.\n  Let me lay out this evening in this Special Order some of the \nparticular problems that we have.\n  In particular, for those who are low income, Medicaid itself is one \nof the biggest discriminators against people with mental illness \ngetting treatment.\n  First, consider this. Fifteen percent of Medicaid recipients have \nserious mental illness. That is far more than the general population. \nSerious mental illness is things like schizophrenia, bipolar illness, \nschizoaffective disorder, and severe depression.\n  Thirty-one percent of those on SSI have serious mental illness. \nTwenty-six percent of those with Social Security disability have \nserious mental illness.\n  In the general population, by the way, there is only about 1 percent \nwith schizophrenia. About 2.6 of the general population have been \ndiagnosed as bipolar.\n  So look at how much higher those numbers are among the poor. That \nmakes sense. Because mentally ill people are three times more likely to \nhave low income as a result of their mental illness. Low-income \nindividuals are three times more likely to have mental illness, many as \na result of being poor.\n  Poverty and homelessness are both associated with serious mental \nillness. Both are associated with inadequate primary care and \npreventative care. But here are some ways that Medicaid makes it harder \nfor people with mental illness to get care.\n  First of all, there is a rule called the same-day doctor rule. If you \ntake someone to the doctor and the internist or family physician is \nvery concerned that person has a mental illness, they are told they \nhave to come back another day before they can see the psychiatrist.\n  That is a serious problem. Because when you have the warm handoff in \nthe doctor's office, you have 95 percent that will return versus less \nthan half if they have to come back another day. And treatment is the \nkey to getting better.\n  There is a 16-bed rule from the Institute of Mental Diseases which \nsays that, if the hospital has more than 16 beds and you are between \nages 22 and 64, we are not paying for it.\n  The problem with that is that serious mental illness tends to emerge \nin 50 percent of the cases by age 14 and in 75 percent of the cases by \nage 24.\n  So at the very time when problems are emerging, the very time when \nsomeone may have their first serious crisis that may require some \ninpatient care, they are told there will be no room.\n  Only 45 percent of Medicaid recipients with schizophrenia actually \nget evidence-based care. Only 35 percent of those with a bipolar \ndiagnosis who are on Medicaid get evidence-based care.\n  Listen to this statistic. Ninety-two percent of low-income children \nand foster children are prescribed drugs off label--those are drugs \nthat are not approved by FDA--according to an HHS Inspector General's \nreport, and many of those prescriptions, according to the report, are \ndone without clinical justification.\n  The homeless with schizophrenia have a rate of hospitalization for \ncomplications of hypertension almost twice as high as others. Fifty \npercent of individuals with schizophrenia are noncompliant with \ntreatment regimens during their illness and don't adhere to \nmedications. They need assistance in doing so.\n  Also, half of those with serious mental illness have at least two \nchronic physical health conditions, such as chronic pulmonary disease, \ninfectious disease, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal problems, \nand these people are generally in poorer health.\n  So what happens is that those with serious mental illness and a \nnumber of other clinical aspects have compromised physical symptoms and \nwe don't have a place to treat them.\n  We used to have 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s. Now \nwe have less than 40,000. During that same time, the population of the \nUnited States climbed from 150 million to over 300 million today.\n  So where do people who have an acute mental health crisis go? Sadly, \nwhether it is acute or chronic, about 200,000 of our homeless are \nmentally ill. Twenty-eight percent of them get some of their food out \nof a garbage can.\n  We also have a large portion of those with mental illness filling our \nprisons. When we closed down those psychiatric hospitals, some got \nbetter. But, basically, we traded the hospital bed for the prison cot, \na blanket over a subway grate, an emergency room or a gurney or a slab \nin some morgue.\n  The incarceration rate among the seriously mentally ill is 16 percent \nof the population. Some 60 percent of the incarcerated may have some \nlevel of mental illness.\n  And then what happens in the area of violence? Well, in general, \npeople with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the \npopulation. But when untreated serious mental illness occurs, they are \n16 times more likely to be perpetrators of violence.\n  As I said before, there are over 1,000 homicides a year, and we have \nno idea how many are victims of crime. Estimates are it is 6 to 10 \ntimes greater.\n  What happens if a person with mental illness is not treated? The \nlonger a person waits for treatment for a psychotic episode, the longer \nit takes a person's illness to come into remission. That means it costs \nmore.\n\n  For bipolar illness, the sooner a person starts lithium, the greater \ntheir improvement. It means it would cost less if we treated them. \nDelusions, hallucinations, and other severe symptoms increase the \nlonger treatment is withheld.\n  As far as the costs go, the cost of schizophrenia alone far exceeds \nthat of coronary artery disease. The mortality rates of schizophrenia \nare far more than breast cancer.\n  The costs of serious mental illness in this country are about $55 \nbillion in direct costs and $70 billion in indirect costs, but there is \nalso the added cost of emergency room care, added cost of primary care, \nand the cost of treating their other medical problems.\n  The deinstitutionalization move in this country is associated with \nmuch higher suicide rates, such that, while our country has made great \nstrides in reducing mortality rates over the last couple of decades in \nheart disease, auto accidents, HIV/AIDS, stroke, and cancer, we have \nseen huge increases in suicide rates and drug overdose deaths.\n  As a Nation, we should be ashamed of that. As a Congress, we should \nbe ashamed if we do nothing about this. That requires a great deal of \nchange on our part. That means we are going to have to do something to \nhelp people with mental illness get treatment.\n  Half are simply not compliant and don't adhere to their medication. \nThey get worse. Their medical problems get worse. The Medicaid bills \nget higher. Half of those with serious mental illness, as I said, have \ntwo or more chronic physical health conditions, and it gets worse for \nthem.\n  There are several things we must do to treat this. Tonight we are \ngoing to hear from a number of Members of Congress. First, my friend \nJim McDermott of the State of Washington will speak. We will talk about \na number of the issues before us and what we must do in Congress.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott).\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. I want to first begin by acknowledging Congressman \nMurphy. He has taken on an extremely difficult issue. It takes courage \nto bring that kind of issue to the floor of the House.\n  More than half a million Americans with serious mental illness \ncontinue to fall through the cracks of a broken and outdated system.\n  As Congress begins the consideration of how to address this national \ncrisis, it is important that we take some stock of history.\n  Prior to the 1960s, commitment was based on a medical model where two \nphysicians made a determination that a patient needed treatment. I did \nthat when I came out of the military in 1970 in Seattle.\n  When the first attempt at comprehensive mental health reform began in \nthe 1960s in California, it signaled a shift from the medical model to \nthe legal model.\n\n[[Page H932]]\n\n  Ronald Reagan had been elected Governor and was interested in \nreducing the population in the mental hospitals in California. The \nresult was the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act in the California State \nAssembly.\n  This act set a new standard, making it increasingly difficult to \nobtain commitment to a hospital. That standard was that a patient must \nbe suicidal, homicidal, or gravely disabled. Gravely disabled means \nthat they can't take care of their basic needs.\n  I moved to California in 1968 shortly after that bill was passed to \nserve as the chief psychiatrist at the Long Beach Naval Station, where \nI saw servicemen and -women and their families. For the 2 years I was \nin California, I had almost no success in getting civil commitment for \npeople that I felt were suicidal.\n  I was overruled by State employees charged with the duty of \nevaluating the need for civil commitment. The real pressure was so \ngreat on them and the court system that it was nearly impossible to get \nanyone into treatment in a secure facility. The hospitals in the State \nwere quickly emptied, and literally thousands of mentally disabled \npeople went out on the streets.\n  At the same time, in Congress, the mental health center movement was \ntaking hold. The Community Mental Health Act was signed into law in \n1963. The bill promised adequate funding would go to mental health \ncenters to effectively treat most of these patients on an outpatient \nbasis.\n  But things didn't go as planned. The political reality resulted in \ninsufficient money going to the mental health system. This had a \ndevastating effect and led to more patients wandering the streets in \nneed of treatment.\n  When I finished my time in the military and went back to Washington \nState, I went to the legislature and saw a similar movement was \noccurring in my State. Remembering what had happened in California, I \nargued against changing that commitment standard, but the majority \nruled and a similar law was passed.\n  As a result, we closed one of the three mental hospitals in the State \nof Washington--Northern State Hospital--with the assurance that the \nmoney we saved from closing that hospital would go to the mental health \ncenters. We saved $11 million. $3 million went to the mental health \ncenters, and $7 million or $8 million went elsewhere.\n  As a result, the streets of the State of Washington began to see all \nkinds of homeless people laying on the street and so forth. As a \nresult, some of the most vulnerable patients were left without a \nsupport structure.\n  Many became homeless or were imprisoned. In the end, we simply \nreplaced hospital beds with prison beds, as Congressman Murphy has \nalready pointed out. Right now there are 10 times more mentally ill \npatients in jails and prison than in State hospitals.\n  Turn the clock forward to 1979. I was a jail psychiatrist in King \nCounty, which, in effect, was the second largest mental hospital in the \nState. I had over 200 patients who belonged in treatment, not in jail.\n  This had a tremendous cost on our society. All across this country--\nand Washington is no different than anywhere else you go in this \ncountry--it has a human cost as well as a financial cost.\n  The average cost per year for a prisoner without mental illness in a \njail is $22,000 a year. For a mentally ill patient who is a prisoner, \nthe cost is more than double that, at $50,000 a year. It costs 20 times \nmore to imprison a mentally ill patient than to provide that same \npatient with treatment.\n  These statistics are deplorable, and the process continues to remain \nin place across this country. There are some places that have done \nthings on their own and made efforts to improve how they care for \nbehavioral health patients.\n  In Dixon, Illinois, recently two young people died. It is a town of \n20,000 people. The sheriff said: I am going to do what they are doing \nin Gloucester, Massachusetts, in the ANGEL program.\n  He made the statement to the community: Anybody who is addicted to \nheroin or opioids, come in. We won't arrest you. We won't prosecute. We \nwill treat you. Twenty seven people showed up in that jail.\n  He said, amazingly, another thing happened. The jail was empty \nbecause crime went down dramatically. Most of those people were out \ncommitting crimes to buy drugs.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Now, this program encouraged those suffering from addiction to go to \nthe police, where they would be directed to drug rehabilitation and not \nprosecuted. Since then, many individuals have had effective treatment.\n  We need to treat addiction as a disease state and not as a criminal \noffense or some moral failure. And the same is true with mental \nillness. A comprehensive mental health reform bill would go a long way \nto that effort.\n  Now, out on the floor here, again and again, we pause for a moment of \nsilence. Some awful thing has happened someplace in this country, in my \ncity, in 25 cities across this country, and we stand here for 1 minute \nand commemorate the tragedy with a moment of silence. After that pause, \nwe do nothing.\n  Virtually all mentally ill patients are more likely to be victims of \nviolent crimes rather than perpetrators, and we must recognize there \nare tragic situations that can be prevented with treatment and early \nintervention.\n  I understand--I have been involved in this my whole professional \nlife--that the most contentious issue is whether or not the society has \na right to detain a citizen and treat them in the most medically \neffective way.\n  Many fear a return to the indeterminate confinement of people like in \nthe 1960s. I saw that in Chicago when I was in medical school. None of \nus want to see that happen--not me, most of all. But certainly no one \non this floor wants that to happen in this society.\n  The balance between personal liberty and the needs of a society is a \nchallenging one to strike; but difficult as it may be, we have to rise \nto that challenge. That is why I commend Congressman Murphy for \nbringing it out here and beginning the debate that ought to go on in \nthis society.\n  If a mentally ill person is a danger to themselves or others, there \nneeds to be an ability to commit that person long enough for the \ntreatment to take effect. We need to listen to those who know the \npatient best. In many cases, it is not their doctor.\n  We often hear stories from families who have tried desperately to get \ntreatment for their loved ones, or from police officers who have tried \ndesperately to get treatment for people. We, as doctors, can't possible \nmake the best assessment without hearing from family, friends, and \nthose who live with patients and play an integral role in their lives.\n  Giving patients and families the help they need will dramatically \nimprove and even save lives. That is why we need to work together, on a \nbipartisan basis, on a bill that Mr. Murphy has brought out.\n  Is it a perfect bill? No, but it is a bill from which we can work and \nreach an agreement to try and help the needs of our society. We have \nhad enough moments of silence on this floor. It is time to act.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank Dr. McDermott. He has been, \nreally, a champion of mental health issues in his career and on this \nbill as well.\n  I want to point out, the bill he is referring to is our Helping \nFamilies in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. It is bipartisan. It \nhas 183 cosponsors today--50 Democrats, the rest Republicans--because \nwe all recognize that when you are dealing with someone with mental \nillness, in the 40 years that I have practiced as a psychologist, I \nhave never once asked any of my patients what party they are.\n  We know that mental illness affects people regardless of gender or \nrace or age, certainly not by party.\n  We also know, however, that getting care is tougher. Studies have \nsaid that if you are Black, your chances of getting treatment for your \nmental illness are even tougher. In fact, in Los Angeles County, 9.6 \npercent of the population is Black, and yet they constitute 31 percent \nof the L.A. County jail prisoners, and they have a lower likelihood of \ngetting psychiatric medication.\n  Although most crimes committed by people with mental illness tend to \nbe nonviolent, after they have repetitive incarcerations, they tend to \nserve four times longer sentences when they are\n\n[[Page H933]]\n\nmentally ill than someone who is not. So that is what we mean when we \nsay we have filled our prisons and we have increased our costs with \nthis.\n  I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), to also \ntalk about the things we need to do and our problems with mental \nillness.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Murphy for this time and \nfor bringing this issue to the floor of the House. I thank my friend, \nMr. McDermott, from Washington, for his views.\n  Congressman Murphy's bill opens a bipartisan conversation on how best \nto address the challenges that have been facing mental health services \nand our citizens in this country for decades.\n  President John Kennedy implemented a groundbreaking, community-based \ntreatment model for individuals with mental health illnesses. However, \nin the decades following his service, the Federal Government has missed \nopportunity after opportunity to effectively address the needs of \nAmericans with mental illness. Over the years, we have seen our \nprisons, our hospitals, and our homeless shelters bear the brunt of \nproviding services for our Nation's mentally ill.\n  One-third of the homeless are mentally ill, some 200,000. Sixteen \npercent of incarcerated Americans, some 300,000, have mental illness. \nAnd mental disorders are some of the most costly health conditions we \nface in our country.\n  As noted, many of our incidents of mass violence have mental illness \nas a factor. Now most States still rely on the standard of imminent \ndanger for commitment of mentally ill individuals. This is, in part, a \nresult of past Supreme Court decisions, most importantly, in 1975, \nO'Connor v. Donaldson, which has been used consciously many times to \noppose involuntary commitment and argue that committing individuals who \nare not imminently dangerous to themselves or others is \nunconstitutional.\n  Congressman Murphy's bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health \nCrisis Act, holds our Federal agencies accountable and requires that \nour States follow evidence-based practices that have proven to reduce \nhospitalization, homelessness, and violence.\n  This bill also provides alternatives to institutionalization for \nAmericans with severe mental illness; and for those that need to be \ninstitutionalized, it requires States to include need-for-treatment \ncommitment standards in their civil commitment laws in order to remain \neligible for certain Federal block grant programs. This will help \nclarify commitment standards for our States and will ensure that we no \nlonger wait until it is too late to potentially commit dangerous \nindividuals and those who need help.\n  It is important that we seize this opportunity for future generations \nof Americans, and I commend my colleague for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman so much for his \nkindness and his support for this legislation.\n  As has been said, whenever one of these tragic killings occur or when \nsome tragedy occurs, we have our moment of silence, and then we do \nnothing.\n  We have a chance to do something. America demands it. I know that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans expect us to do something more than \ntalk about it, particularly when so many family members are struggling.\n\n  As we closed many of these institutions, what we ended up with is \nfamilies themselves being the ones that are being told, here's your \nson, your daughter, your brother, your sister, your mother or father; \ngo take care of them. By the way, we are not going to give you much \ninformation on them. We are not going to provide you much support, \nunless that person, indeed, is a danger to themselves or others.\n  I have heard from many family members that they have called the \npolice when they have had troubles at home, struggling.\n  By the way, with mental illness, when someone's out of control, we \ncall the police. With other illnesses, you call paramedics because we \nrecognize that that is a disease that needs help, like when someone is \nhaving a heart attack or something else. But with mental illness, out \nof our fear, out of our stigma, or other things, we call the police, \nand the police are oftentimes not fully trained to do this. Then we \ntell the parents, well, good luck, and take care of them. We are not \ngoing to give you much information.\n  That whole grand experiment of closing down the hospitals, which \nthose asylums needed to be closed down, but the stopping institutional \ncare and stopping all treatment, that whole process has actually shown \nmore failures than successes, especially when we have not provided \ncommunity-based treatment.\n  We provide treatment for so many other diseases, but when it comes to \nmental illness, we fall far short. And we somehow have this idea, this \nmisguided and self-centered and projected belief of our own, that \npeople are at all times fully capable of deciding their own fate and \ndirection, regardless of their deficits and diseases, and that the \nright to self-decay and self-destruction overrides the right to be \nhealthy.\n  But remember what I said earlier about people with severe mental \nillness and having so many other chronic illnesses and somehow going \ninto the slow-motion death spiral, we walk right by and pretend that \nthat is okay. It is not, and it shouldn't be. Somehow, in so doing, we \ncomfortably abdicate our responsibility to action and live under this \nperverse redefinition that the most compassionate compassion is to do \nnothing at all.\n  It further bolsters those most evil of prejudices we have that the \nperson with disabilities deserves no more than what they are. We will \nleave it up to them. Under that approach, there are no dreams; there \nare no aspirations; there is no goal to be better that can even exist. \nIndeed, to help a person heal is some head-on collision with this \nbigoted belief we have that the severely mentally ill have no right to \nbe better than they are, and we have no obligation to help them.\n  This is the corrupt evil of this hands-off approach and, in some \ncases, the antitreatment model and the things that we have lulled \nourselves into, this somnolence where we become comfortable with \ncrossing the street or stepping over a homeless person, when we fear \nthose, when we hear the title, the term, ``mental illness.'' It is this \nperversion of thought embedded in the glorification that to live a life \nof deterioration and paranoia and filth and squalor and emotional \ntorment trumps a healed brain and the true chance to choose a better \nlife.\n  What a sad state of affairs our Nation has to become easy with that, \nand what a sad statement it is about this Congress for taking so long \nto take action on this. I don't know how we look ourselves in the \nmirror and continue to delay this.\n  A number of my colleagues also feel very strongly about this issue of \nmental health. I yield now to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nAbraham) to take a few minutes to talk about his perspectives of what \nwe need to do with mental health.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I want to first say thank you for Dr. \nMurphy's persistence and determination for bringing this legislation to \nthis point. It has been an act of love on his part, and I greatly \nappreciate it.\n  Dr. Murphy, also, great thanks for your continued work with our men \nand women in uniform in the mental health field as you continue to do \ntoday. It is much appreciated.\n  As a family doctor in rural Louisiana, I have witnessed firsthand the \nhardships mental illness can put on families, individuals, and friends. \nI am sure every American has a story of how someone that they know and \nlove has been affected by mental illness. It is not a partisan issue, \nas has been said here just recently.\n  Thankfully, the study and treatment of mental health has improved \ndramatically in the last 50 years, leading to better outcomes and \nbetter lives. But, as our knowledge of mental health improves, we must \nroutinely ensure that our government is keeping up.\n  It has been over 15 years since Congress last passed comprehensive \nmental health reform. During that time, the size and authority of our \nFederal mental health bureaucracy has grown to the point where the \namount of coordination required to function effectively is too immense.\n  How much has it grown?\n  A recent report from the independent Government Accountability Office\n\n[[Page H934]]\n\nfound that there are now a total of 112 Federal programs intended to \naddress mental illness--112. As you can imagine, the report also found \nthat there is serious fragmentation and lack of coordination among \nthese programs.\n  As history continues to prove time and time again, when the size of \nbureaucracy increases, the effectiveness decreases; but when mental \nhealth bureaucracy fails, it fails individuals, it fails families, and \nit fails communities.\n  Unfortunately, the President's solution this year is to throw more \nmoney at the problem and increase the bureaucracy. His 2017 budget \nproposes to add $500 million in mandatory spending to the same Federal \nprograms that have been proven to be inefficient, uncoordinated, and \ninadequate. This is a shortsighted response to a long-term challenge. \nWe must do more than throw money at a problem and hope for a solution.\n  Congressman Murphy's Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act has \ntaken inventory of these Federal programs. It refocuses the programs \nthat work and removes the ones that don't, greatly increasing program \ncoordination across the Federal Government. This is only one of the \nmany reasons why I have cosponsored this comprehensive bill, and I \nwelcome rigorous debate on this floor on the rest of the bill's merits.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Finally, I thank again Dr. Murphy for his dedication and leadership \non this mental health issue. The time, effort, and attention to detail \nthat he has put into this comprehensive reform bill is what the \nAmerican public should expect from elected officials. I strongly \nencourage and support his efforts.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your \ncomments and your support for this bill and, of course, your practice \nin the field and understanding our needs.\n  A couple of points you made there I want to elaborate on. You said \nthat there are 112 Federal programs identified scattered across 8 \ndepartments that deal with mental health. There are 26 programs for the \nhomeless.\n  But many of these programs have not met since 2009, and according to \nthe General Accounting Office report, it is uncoordinated. A patchwork \nquilt would be a compliment because a patchwork quilt is at least \nstitched together and our mental health approach is not.\n  Part of this bill is to create an office for the Assistant Secretary \nof Mental Health and Substance Abuse Disorders. That doctor would then \nbe charged with meeting regularly with these programs and agencies to \nget them to work together.\n  Where there is unnecessary redundancy, get them to merge. Where there \nis exemplary programs, let's expand it. But, above all, get treatment \nback to the States and back to the communities where they can do the \nmost good with evidence-based programs that work.\n  I will elaborate more on these in a minute, but first I want to call \nupon my friend, Chris Gibson, from New York for a few minutes.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Dr. \nMurphy, for organizing this Special Order, but also for his strong \nleadership in an area that is so important to all Americans. I also \nwant to thank him for his service to our Nation.\n  Indeed, I rise to give a voice for so many of my constituents who are \ncalling on this House to strengthen Federal mental health policies.\n  I think this is important not only in terms of these policy changes \nthat we are talking about this evening, but, quite candidly, also about \nthe mindset. I think we need to think about this issue area \ndifferently.\n  Misconceptions out there, I hear this often from my constituents, how \nwe need to change the way that we think. Too often we think of mental \nhealth as a permanent state, that individuals are either well or not \nwell, when, in fact, what we have learned is that, over the course of \nour life, mental health is really a spectra. Sometimes we are \nflourishing, and sometimes we are challenged.\n  For me, this is certainly a personal issue. My closest adviser is my \nbeautiful wife, Mary Jo, who is a licensed clinical social worker. I \nget the benefit of her counsel on a regular basis.\n  I also look to Dr. Murphy as somebody who has spent over 40 years in \nthis field. I also want to thank Grace Napolitano, who is also a leader \nof the Mental Health Caucus. I have worked together with her as we push \nforward these very important initiatives.\n  I want to say that I do think we have made some progress. In a moment \nhere, I will talk about some of the details of that. I think that we \nare making some progress particularly with neuroses, anxiety, and to \nsome degree, depression.\n  But, candidly, we are not making progress at all with regard to \npolicy when it comes to very severe mental health issues. In part, Dr. \nMcDermott addressed this earlier.\n  We know that, in the 1960s and the 1970s, there were a series of \nexposes, very severe issues that were going on in our psychiatric \nhospitals. Consequent to that we went through a process of \ndeinstitutionalization.\n  But we have learned that, when we did this and put nothing in behind \nit--and I certainly can understand a lot of abuses that were going on \nand understood the need to take action to roll back and to really make \nsure that we don't have those abuses.\n  But what we have learned is that it was a mistake not to put policy \nin behind that. We see this all the time. It has been mentioned already \nthis evening, the issues with homelessness, the issues with mass \nviolence.\n  Inasmuch as we know most with very severe mental illness are not \nviolent, we also know that, when we have these very tragic events, \nthat, at times, these are correlated with severe mental illness without \nFederal support, without any support. So that is part of the calling \nfor this evening.\n  The American people want to know: Is our Congress listening? We are \nlistening. That is part of the reason why Doc has organized this \ntonight to express this to the American people, that we know this is a \nvery important priority.\n  I want to provide some overview of some of the actions we have taken. \nFirst of all, last year I was at the White House when the President of \nthe United States signed into law the Clay Hunt suicide awareness and \nprevention bill.\n  Corporal Clay Hunt was a great American hero. He served our country \nvery honorably and courageously in Iraq and Afghanistan and lost his \nlife to mental health disease. His family has taken up the standard and \nare working really hard to move us forward on that.\n  This bill that the President signed into law last year--a very \nbipartisan bill--is going to help strengthen mental health support for \nour servicemen and -women and our veterans.\n  Likewise, the James Zadroga 9/11 healthcare bill for our first \nresponders also includes a provision in there that strengthens mental \nhealth. So we are supporting our veterans, and we are supporting our \nfirst responders. These are important bills that have been enacted into \nlaw.\n  We have also passed in this House an important bill called the Female \nVeteran Suicide Prevention Act, and we are calling on the Senate to \npick this up so that we can also send that to the President.\n  While we have made progress in some of these areas, we have much more \nto do in so many other areas. I want to talk about the Mental Health in \nSchools Act.\n  I think this is a very important and certainly a challenging period \nin the lives of Americans in the teenage years and so many emotions all \ngoing through. We need to provide support.\n  What we have found in some pilot programs in New York is, when we \nhave social workers in schools, this absolutely stems incidences of \ndrug abuse and crime because we are dealing with this in the area where \nwe really need that support: mental health.\n  We have a bill that will address this that will scale that, and I \nhope that we can get more support here in the House.\n  In addition to our teenagers, I also have a bill that helps with our \nsenior citizens. It is a very simple bill. It basically just adjusts \nMedicare so that, for seniors looking for counseling, they will get \nthat support.\n  Finally, of course, the bill that we are all rallying around tonight, \nH.R. 2646, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act--I think we \nhave\n\n[[Page H935]]\n\nheard about some of the important dimensions of this bill.\n  I just want to highlight the fact that I think that this bill is \ngoing to help us with the very severely mentally ill, particularly \nthose suffering from psychosis.\n  We have heard tonight how we have a shortage of inpatient care. We \nhave got to address this because, if we don't address it, we end up \nseeing it in the penal system. That is absolutely the wrong approach to \nthis, and it is costing the taxpayers as well.\n  So, in addition to that, we see more coordination among agencies and \nsuicide awareness and prevention programs strengthened.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I will close with this. This is a very important \nissue, and the American people are counting on us to take action. I \nthink we have got a series of bills that we can rally around--\nbipartisan bills--that will truly make a positive difference.\n  So let me end where I began and just thank Dr. Murphy for his great \nleadership and call upon my colleagues to support his bill and these \nother bills as we move forward.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank my friend from New York in his \nongoing support for these issues dealing with mental illness.\n  Now I would like to call upon my friend from the State of Oregon, \nEarl Blumenauer, who has been a great champion on these issues as well. \nMany times we have conversed about this. I appreciate my friend's \nguidance and support on this issue.\n  I know your heart is in this and you are dedicated to it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Blumenauer.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your courtesy in permitting me to join \nyou this evening, and I appreciate the conversation that we have had.\n  Dr. McDermott's experience in the 1960s and 1970s really touched me. \nI started in my political career when I was much smarter than I am now \nand was part of the deinstitutionalization movement in my State of \nOregon, where it was quite clear that we could provide better quality \nservices that were less intrusive and more cost-effective through a \nprogram of deinstitutionalization. It made perfect sense on paper.\n  What happened--and, luckily, karma intervened. I was a local official \nwhen it hit full force. The commitments that had been made to help with \nmedication, to help with housing, to help with counseling, and to be \nable to provide the support services weren't ironclad guarantees.\n  It was easy for subsequent legislators to erode them, and people were \nout on their own. This was a process that took place across the \ncountry, and we have seen the impact, as Dr. McDermott mentioned.\n  I really appreciate you sinking your teeth in here to bring this \nforward. There are some elements that are clearly controversial. I have \nfound over the course of 2 years that we have been talking about this a \nwillingness to engage in conversation and to be open to refinement \nbecause we are all seeking the same objectives.\n  One of the things that has just become clearer and clearer to me is \nthat there needs to be stronger provisions to deal with assisted \noutpatient treatment programs. We used to call it involuntary \ncommitment.\n  It strikes me that we would not have a cancer patient just sort of \ncast loose on their own to sort of fend for themselves.\n  But we have some of the most vulnerable members of society, in many \ncases, who are not capable of fully comprehending the situation they \nare in.\n  In fact, in some cases, part of the illness they suffer from is that \nthey don't think that they are sick, that we make it much more \ndifficult than it should be, in some cases, impossible, for people who \ncare about them most to be able to participate in treatment.\n  I appreciate your willingness to work with us to strike the balance.\n  I see this as part of a much larger movement. In my community, we are \nfinally opening a facility this fall to get people with mental problems \nout of emergency rooms, where they actually can't be treated. They can \njust be warehoused at, actually, great expense and risk to the \nemployees in the emergency room.\n  I am convinced that, if we are able to work together to tease out the \nexpenses--Dr. McDermott talked about how incarcerating people and \ntreating them behind bars, where so many people with mental illness end \nup, is 20 times more expensive than treatment.\n  Being able to hit that sweet spot, to be able to balance treatment, \nto be able to have intervention with appropriate safeguards, to empower \nthe families, and to be able to help people on a path to treatment like \nwe would do with any other illness is very, very important.\n  I would hope that we would be able to continue this conversation. I \nhope that there will be other Special Orders where we have a chance to \ninvolve people who want to explore and maybe refine some of these \nelements, to be able to answer questions about the necessary \nprotections and have the give-and-take that sometimes is hard to do \nwhen we are in sort of a formalized setting.\n  I have appreciated your willingness to tackle tough issues, to be \nopen to suggestions, to be willing to engage others, but, most \nimportantly, that this Congress not go home without having legislation \nto meet our responsibilities to refine and focus our mental health \nprograms to get more out of the resources that we have, to provide new \ntools for families, and I think build on a foundation.\n  I think the bill that you have introduced is a great start. I am \nencouraged that you have sparked a very robust conversation and that \nthere are other bills that are moving forward. But I hope we can build \non this to be able to get across the finish line.\n  I look forward to continuing our conversation, whether it is here \ntonight, in another evening, or with our colleagues, to make sure that \nwe are doing what we should do to correct a situation that is a \nnational tragedy, that is unnecessary, that is wasteful and inhumane.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  I will add to that in the sense that about 10 people per hour die \nrelated to mental illness, and it is probably much more than we know \nof.\n  I thank you for your good counsel, too. I may have been doing this 40 \nyears, but I have a lot to learn in the field of mental health.\n  I have learned a great deal from colleagues and from people like Paul \nGionfriddo of Mental Health America or the leaders of the American \nPsychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and \nfrom Fuller Torrey. There is a whole host of names in this country who \ncontinue to write about and talk about this and show us research on \nthis.\n  Osteopaths, physical therapists--you name the field--and social \nworkers are out there talking about the problems that we have with \nthis. You are right. It is the most compassionate thing to make some \nchanges on this.\n  I know one of my colleagues who is also in the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee with me, Susan Brooks, would like to comment on this as well \nand talk about our needs now, what we need to do in mental health.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. I want to thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania, Dr. Murphy, for introducing this important legislation \nand arranging for this Special Order today.\n  As I am sure it has already been stated, one in five Americans \nstruggle with mental illness. One in five. This is a critical situation \nin the country, as we have just heard, a national tragedy.\n  That is why we must address it with a comprehensive, community-based, \nmental health care proposal like the one we are talking about here \ntoday, and we must do it in a bipartisan way.\n  So I am very pleased that we have colleagues from the other side of \nthe aisle here as well this evening talking about it.\n  We have all seen the tragic headlines about people who lose their \nbattle with mental illness and their families who are often powerless \nto help them or prevent them from harming themselves or others.\n  According to researchers, about half of the people with schizophrenia \nand 40 percent of people with bipolar disorder don't believe they are \nmentally ill. These individuals have the right to refuse therapy and \nmedication, and under current law, their families are only able to \nintervene when their condition becomes suicidal or extremely dangerous.\n\n[[Page H936]]\n\n  So in practical reality, my young adult children in their 20s, if \nthey struggle with serious mental illness, I could be completely shut \nout from their diagnosis and treatment, unable to help them before \ntheir condition became completely debilitating.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  As a mother, as a parent, this is heartbreaking. It is further \nevidence that something has to change. We have all talked to too many \nfamilies, whether it is at ceremonies remembering their lives when they \nhave taken their lives or when they have overdosed. That is too late. \nThis bill is important for all parents in America, the loved ones, the \nfamily members who desperately want to help but are unable to do so.\n  But it is also important to every American regardless of whether or \nnot they have a personal connection to mental illness. It is critically \nimportant when we look at our criminal justice system.\n  Sixty years ago--and I think we talked about this a little bit \nearlier--there was one psychiatric bed for every 300 Americans. Fast-\nforward 50 years later, that number has shrunk to one psychiatric bed \nfor every 3,000 Americans. Today, it is even less. The people, as you \nhave mentioned, who work in our emergency rooms and in our criminal \njustice system are paying the price. Those people who work there are \npaying the price.\n  The National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that between 25 and \n40 percent of people with mental illness will be jailed or incarcerated \nat some time in their lives. I am a former criminal defense attorney \nand a prosecutor. I can tell you not with respect to treatment, but \ndealing with them, either if they had been arrested or if we needed to \nprosecute them, I have seen the statistics--and these are real people.\n  Our courts, jails, and prisons are full of people with mental \nillness. Most of them are not getting the treatment they need. In our \nState prisons and local jails, more than half of the women and three-\nquarters of the men have at least one mental health diagnosis. In \nFederal prisons, about half of all inmates, regardless of gender, \nstruggle with some form of mental illness.\n  We must reform the way we care for and treat people with mental \nillness. We can't rely on the prisons and jails to serve as the de \nfacto mental health institutions that they have become, and we must \nmake families the partner to ensure that patients with serious and \ndebilitating illness can maintain a comprehensive regimen of care.\n  I applaud the work of my colleague, Dr. Murphy, the only psychologist \nserving in Congress, for his leadership and for crafting the Helping \nFamilies in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. I am not going to go \nthrough all of the proposals because you have so many people. I am so \npleased that you have people. I am sure that you have talked about all \nthat is in the bill.\n  But I must say, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nproposal. It does focus on the programs that will help families and \npatients. It will improve that connectivity between primary care \ndoctors, mental health professionals, and the patients and families. It \nwill help with the existing shortage of in-patient psychiatric beds. It \nwill bring accountability to programs like SAMHSA, to make sure that \ntheir resources are being used in the most effective and consistent way \nfor patients.\n  I just want to applaud Dr. Murphy and all of those who care deeply \nabout mental illness, because I don't want to go to more of these \nceremonies of family members who are remembering their family members \nwho have died from suicide or who have died from an overdose. Thank you \nfor your work.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mrs. \nBrooks.\n  I might say that we have all heard those stories from families. I am \nsure there are families watching tonight, Mr. Speaker, who will \nconsider contacting a Member of Congress and share that story as well. \nNothing is more painful than to hear the story of a parent like you \ndescribed, a nightmare of a parent to be told that their child has a \nproblem and there is nothing the government will let them do about it. \nHow difficult that must be.\n  While waiting for my other colleague, Doug LaMalfa, of California, to \ncome forward, I want to mention a couple of things on the bill that \nhave been referenced.\n  As I said before, the bill has an assistant secretary for substance \nabuse and mental health disorders that would organize the programs. It \nwould drive evidence-based care for programs such as response after an \ninitial schizophrenic episode, assisted outpatient treatment, and \nassertive community treatment, or programs like the National Child \nTraumatic Stress Network, which is an exceptional program. It is a \ngovernment-funded program that does exceptionally good, high-quality \nwork.\n  We know that we have to build a mental health workforce to take care \nof our extreme doctor shortage. There simply aren't enough \npsychiatrists, psychologists, or clinical social workers. When we have \n9,000 child and adolescent psychiatrists, we need 30,000. We have too \nfew clinical psychologists and others who want to work with those with \nserious mental illness.\n  As I said earlier, we have to fix the shortage of mental health beds, \nplaces that treat people who are in crisis, instead of putting them in \njail, sending them back on the street, or strapping them to a gurney in \nan emergency room, giving them a five-point tie-down and some chemical \nsedative. We have to eliminate that same-day doctor barrier which says \nyou can't see two doctors in the same day. We have to empower parents \nto be part of the treatment plan, because right now they are still \nharnessed and kept away from them.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for some of \nhis comments.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Murphy. I really appreciate him \nholding this Special Order, his dedication, and his persistence in \nmoving this issue along. It is very important because mental health is \nan issue that is getting more and more rampant in our communities.\n  We really have some challenges in northern California with it and the \nlack of available treatment. I just had a doctor visit my office \nyesterday from Siskiyou County who, had she had this ability, had that \ncounty had these resources available in the way that your bill \nprescribes, tragedy would have been prevented with an attempted suicide \nand a suicide that actually happened in that same family. It is really \ninexcusable after a point that we are not able to channel the resources \nand have the effectiveness of the program that you are seeking.\n  Previously, in Nevada County, California, we witnessed a devastating \nshooting at a nearby health clinic that took the lives of three \nindividuals back in 2001. The shooter, who suffered from mental \nillness, had repeatedly refused treatment, despite his family's best \nefforts to get him help. This is where the system, again, is broken.\n  Outdated laws leave individuals suffering with severe mental illness \nto fend for themselves, only to have intervention step in when it is \ntoo late. Does it really take an attempted suicide, does it really take \na drug overdose, to get attention, instead, when people that have this \nand know about these triggers would be able to get them the help they \nneed with the right implementation? We need to break down those \nbarriers and provide that pathway.\n  The Assisted Outreach Treatment program, for example, helps patients \nand families experiencing severe mental health issues to get the \ntreatment they need before a crisis occurs. Patients are able to live \nat home and meet their therapist on a regular basis while having access \nto lifesaving medications. Success rates are testimony to the \neffectiveness of the program in terms of compassion and effectiveness. \nAgain, in one of my counties, Nevada County, where this program is in \neffect, hospitalization was reduced 46 percent, incarceration reduced \n65 percent, homelessness reduced 61 percent, and emergency contacts and \nemergency needs reduced 44 percent.\n\n  Of the patients who entered the program overall, 90 percent said it \nmade them more likely to keep their appointments and take their \nmedication, and 81 percent said it helped them get well and stay well. \nThis is what it is all\n\n[[Page H937]]\n\nabout: to give them hope and to put them in the mainstream of society \nwhere they can function well and be successful. Forty-nine percent \nfewer abused alcohol, 48 percent fewer abused drugs.\n  Yet, instead of investing in programs such as this, we continue to \nspend billions on duplicative behavioral wellness programs that allow \nfar too many Americans to fall through the cracks.\n  We have got to do more to care for our neighbors in this country. I \nrise today in support, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \ngentleman's legislation. We cannot stand by anymore and allow the \nstatus quo because, as we know too well, the cost of inaction is too \nhigh for those who suffer from it and for the families and the \ncommunities. This is going to be very effective in helping to channel \nthat and having a success we can all be proud of.\n  Thank you for the time and for your persistence.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nhis support.\n  While waiting for my friend John Katko of New York to come forward, I \nwant to reflect on how long it has taken us to do this.\n  What we used to do up through the 1800s is just throw people in jail. \nThen along came an activist by the name of Dorothea Dix, who saw the \nabysmal conditions in our prisons for the mentally ill, saw them \nchained to walls in squalor and filth, beaten and abused. She spoke up \nto have institutions built that would be better respites for them. \nIndeed, that took place for awhile, but then they became overcrowded, \nand that was part of what we shut down.\n  As my other colleague talked about, Mr. Blumenauer mentioned that \nthen we thought, well, we have other outpatient care for them. That \npromise never came through.\n  This legislation would, as I mentioned before, allow us to have more \nproviders in psychology, psychiatry, social work. It would also merge \nthe mental health and substance abuse dollars to allow States to use \nboth. We have got to be treating mental health and substance abuse \ndollars, not to cut either one, but to make sure that a person with \nsubstance abuse disorder and mental illness can be treated.\n  It would bring accountability of spending Federal funds for grants. \nOur bill would establish a national mental health policy lab within \nSAMHSA, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and \nset scientific objective outcome measures.\n  It would also have an interagency serious mental illness coordinating \ncommittee, which could coordinate the Federal spending in mental health \nand make suggestions to the Assistant Secretary's office and to \nCongress and bring together government offices with experts in the \nfield to develop reforms in the mental health system.\n  We want to have alternatives to institutionalization and jail \ndiversion. Assisted outpatient treatment is one version; assertive \ncommunity treatment is another one. We are making sure that we provide \nthe wraparound services for the mentally ill person instead of dumping \nthem into jails and leaving them there only to get worse. And we want \nto advance early intervention and prevention programs, where this bill \nestablishes most of its funding there to make sure we have those \nprograms.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), someone whom I \nhave also gotten to know pretty well over this bill, with his own \npassion for this issue as well.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Murphy.\n  I rise today to talk about one of the most serious challenges facing \nour country, and that is the mental health issue. It is a problem that \naffects the rich and the poor, old and young, employed and unemployed. \nIt can strike anyone.\n  For far too long, the issue of mental health has stayed in the \nshadows in our country. If we want to directly face the challenges that \nthe American people face in their everyday lives, we cannot allow the \nsilence to continue. That is why I so enthusiastically support your \nbill, Doctor.\n  A short time ago, I met with some of my constituents in upstate New \nYork that were part of a drug treatment, education training, and \nrehabilitation program. One of the individuals told me of his personal \nbattle with mental health.\n  About 10 years ago, his sister died of cancer, and his marriage broke \ndown soon thereafter. He couldn't sleep because of the trauma and \nstress, which led to anxiety and depression, and he didn't know what to \ndo. As he was doing yard work one day, someone he knew walked past and \nsaid he could provide something to help him sleep. It was heroin. He \ntried it. Pretty soon he was hooked, and his life was ravaged for years \nand years. In fact, it took 7 years of him being pushed to the brink by \ndrugs for him to seek help--7 years, 7 lost years.\n  Six years later, he has found paid work, probably for the first time \nsince his addiction. He told me that if we lived in a culture where the \ntrauma of grief and the need to get help for mental health problems \nwere more clearly recognized, things could have been much different for \nhim. Just think how much better it would have been for him and think \nhow much better it would have been for others in the country.\n  The reality is that, for many people today, mental health is a huge \nissue. With the awareness of the mental health issue increasing, I \nfervently hope that the acceptance and understanding of the individual \nsuffering from it will as well.\n  We cannot prevent all mental health issues. There are no cures for \nall conditions. But we can help the culture change in our country. This \nbill goes a long way towards doing that, and I commend you for that, \nDoctor.\n  We can insist that everyone counts and that everyone matters and that \nno one dealing with any form of illness should ever feel ashamed. That \nis how you bring real change to America.\n  Before I close, I want to note that the second leading cause of death \namong individuals 24 years or younger in this country, as the doctor \nwell knows, is suicide. The 10th leading cause of death in this country \nfor all adults is suicide. It is an epidemic. It is not treated as such \nin this country, and it is high time that we do so.\n  For every suicide in this country, there are 12 suicide attempts. \nThink of the costs to our society. Think of the costs and the burdens \non families, the burdens on the health industry who have to deal with \nthis. We must do a better job, and we have to do a better job.\n  That is why I am proud in my district that soon after I was elected \nlast year, we formed a mental health task force. We are enthusiastic \nabout a lot of things and a lot of changes it is going to bring about, \nbut there is nothing we are more enthused about than this bill.\n  Doctor, I commend you for this. I hope that we get this passed in the \nHouse, and I hope we get this bill moving once and for all.\n  Again, I commend you, Congressman Murphy, for your steadfastness on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana \n(Mr. Bucshon).\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I am here to support Dr. Murphy's \ntremendous work in the area of mental illness. It shows that one person \nreally can make a difference. Dr. Murphy is leading the charge for our \ncountry to change the way that we deal with our mental health programs.\n  I have got direct experience with this. I have a high school friend \nwho suffered from schizophrenia and eventually lost her family as it is \nrelated to that. I have had two high school friends who suffered from \nsevere depression and ended up suicidal and subsequently did take their \nown lives.\n  This is critical legislation. With people like Dr. Murphy working \nhard to get this done, we really can make a difference on behalf of \npeople with severe mental illness in our country.\n  I commend you, Dr. Murphy, for the strong work. Continue to push. I \nam hopeful we can get this through the House of Representatives this \nyear.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, let me close with these \nstatements.\n  With 60 million Americans out there with some form of mental illness \nthis\n\n[[Page H938]]\n\nyear and 10 million or so with severe mental illness, they all have \nfamilies. I hope those families wake up and speak up. I hope they \ncontact their Member of Congress.\n  I know that mental illness can be treated, but it cannot be treated \nif we ignore it and it gets worse. I don't want more tragedies here. I \nhate to wish any of these tragedies on my colleagues in Congress, but I \nknow it will happen. We will be here again for moments of silence. We \nwill have more Members that face this suffering in their own families \nand in their communities, and we should not allow that.\n  I hope that soon we can call forth H.R. 2646, the Helping Families in \nMental Health Crisis Act, because to delay it is to cause more harm, to \ndeny it is to cause more death. Let's finally do something to help turn \nthis problem around with mental health in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H938-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H938-H941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1830\n                    WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, next Tuesday the Supreme Court will \ntake up Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which is a case that \nchallenges Texas' outright offensive effort to strip women of their \nright to choose.\n  Last night the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed a similar law \nto move forward in Louisiana, all but guaranteeing the closure of three \nof four abortion clinics in that State unless the Supreme Court \nintervenes there as well.\n  The men who have passed these laws--to be very clear, the Texas State \nLegislature is 80 percent male, and Louisiana has just made it up from \ndead last this year at 85 percent--claimed that it would increase the \nmedical accountability and safety of facilities that provide abortion.\n  That is the new message, the new veil, that covers these laws with \nthe air of legitimacy: We want to make your abortion safer. So every \ndoctor needs to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and every \nclinic needs to function like an emergency center.\n  It sounds logical until you hear what the folks behind these laws \nhave to say after the laws have passed.\n  In Texas, then-Governor Rick Perry said: ``The ideal world is one \nwithout abortion. Until then, we will continue to pass laws to ensure \nthat they are as rare as possible.''\n  One of the authors of the bill said that she was especially proud \nthat ``Texas always takes the lead in trying to turn back what started \nwith Roe v. Wade.''\n  The first problem here is the same one we have dealt with over and \nover and over and over again, because Roe v. Wade isn't something you \nturn back. It wasn't an executive order. It wasn't even a law passed by \nCongress.\n  It was a legal challenge 40 years ago that required the Supreme Court \nto consider whether or not women had the right to make decisions about \ntheir bodies. They decided and set a precedent that every woman in this \nNation had the constitutional right to an abortion.\n  What is more, the Court made it clear that States cannot use laws to \ncreate an undue burden for women who are seeking to exercise that \nright. The Court affirmed that decision once more in 1992.\n  Women in Texas now have firsthand experience of what happens when \nStates ignore the Supreme Court. From what I can see, there is no way \nthat the Texas law can be considered anything other than an undue \nburden, which brings us to the second problem: There is absolutely no \nlogical, medical reason to suddenly require these clinics to meet the \nstandards of a hospital.\n  These laws are opposed by a host of leading medical groups, including \nthe American Medical Association and the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, professionals who know better than \nanyone what kinds of skills and resources should be necessary for an \nabortion, which is one of the safest medical procedures out there.\n  I find it incredibly hard to believe that whole organizations of \nphysicians would oppose any of these laws if they really did make \nclinics safer, Mr. Speaker, but I digress.\n  In Texas, the full implementation of the bill that is being \nchallenged next week would force more than 75 percent of abortion \nclinics in that State to close.\n  In fact, with the limited implementation they have had to date, the \nnumber of clinics has been cut in half. If it is allowed to go into \neffect, only 10 clinics will remain to serve the 5.4 million Texas \nwomen of reproductive age.\n  What is even worse is that, while these laws are being masqueraded as \nefforts to make abortions safer, they are forcing more women down the \ndangerous path of attempting to end their pregnancies on their own.\n  A study by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project found that women who \nreport barriers to abortion are more likely to self-induce an abortion, \nputting their lives at risk in the process. This sounds like 1955, not \n2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, these laws are an absolute farce, and it is time to stop \nthe sham. Women deserve to make the choices that work for them. If that \nmeans having an abortion, they should be able to do it safely, without \ntraveling hundreds of miles or without waiting weeks to be seen.\n  My colleagues and I are here on the floor tonight because we stand \nwith the women in Texas, with the women in Louisiana, and with the \nwomen across this country, women who want to make their own decisions \nabout when, where, and how to make decisions that will change their \nlives, women whose voices are seldom represented in the legislative \nbodies, which are filled with men who are ready to take away their \nrights.\n  It is now my pleasure to yield to the illustrious Member from the \nState of Texas, someone who has been a constant fighter for everyone's \nrights, including women's rights, Congresswoman Jackson Lee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from New \nJersey, and I thank her for her leadership. As well, I thank my \ncolleagues who are here on the floor of the House who have joined us.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me associate myself with the comments by the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey as they relate to Louisiana.\n  Let me be clear. As I stand here as a constituent of the State of \nTexas, as a Representative of the State of Texas, and as a woman who \nlives in Texas, that Texas State Law HB2 has led to the closure of more \nthan 20 abortion facilities in the State, taking the total number of \nproviders down from 40 to 19, its true purpose being to take away \nwomen's rights to make their own healthcare decisions.\n  It could not be more blatant, again, to take away every woman's right \nto choose. No one stands on this floor tonight to promote and coddle \nabortion, but we do stand on the floor to protect a woman's right to \nchoose her health and to protect her sacred right of making such \ndecisions with her God, her family, and her physician.\n  How do HB2 and other bills have the right to interfere with that?\n  Let me also cite for you that a U.N. working group concluded that \nwomen in the United States inexplicably lag behind international human \nrights.\n  Pointing to data and research on public and political representation, \neconomic and social rights, and health and safety protections, experts \nin the U.N. working group boldly acknowledged that there is a myth that \nwomen in the United States already enjoy all of the expected standards \nof rights and protections afforded under America.\n  Isn't that shameful? Under America, we are still denied our rights.\n  The reality is women in the United States are experiencing continued \ndiscrimination and daunting disparities that prevent the true ability \nfor them to fully participate as equal members of society.\n  We stand here this evening to acknowledge one striking issue that \nwill\n\n[[Page H939]]\n\nbe argued at the Supreme Court next week, and that is this case--HB2--\nthat has shut down clinics and has denied to women that any other \naccess be open to them with this particular legislation. So we are \nadvocating, as it goes to the Supreme Court, that this is an issue of \nhuman rights equals women's rights.\n  In America, we face a real problem of hypocrisy. Isn't it interesting \nthat we say that we believe in the rights of families and in the \nsacredness of one's religion and in one's choice between one's family, \ndoctor, and God, yet, Danielle Deaver was denied an abortion even as \nthe uterus crushed the fetus.\n  This family wanted children. This family wanted to be able to have \nthis child. Unfortunately, due to medical reasons, this young lady \nneeded to have this baby taken. She was 22 weeks pregnant.\n  The real crime is that this was not allowed to take place in a legal \nmanner because just 1 month earlier Nebraska had enacted the Nation's \nfirst fetal pain legislation that banned abortions after 20 weeks. It \nis not one that she wanted. It is not one that she desired.\n  It was because of health care and need and the fact that a tragedy \nhad happened to her and her family; yet, she was denied. Women's rights \nequal human rights.\n  With respect to the Texas case, the Supreme Court is scheduled next \nTuesday to hear the case of Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which \nwill challenge the Texas law that has stripped thousands of women of \naccess to their constitutional right.\n  Whole Woman's Health is the most consequential reproductive case in \nthe last two decades that challenges the longstanding precedent of \nupholding a woman's constitutional right to access to safe and legal \nabortion services.\n  It is not a supporting of abortion, but a supporting of the right to \nchoose. It is protective of women's health, of the life of the mother, \nand of the fact that you engage with your family, with your God, and \nwith your physician.\n  Ever since the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which was affirmed \nagain in 1992 in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas made clear that women have a constitutional right to safe, legal \nabortion care and that States do not have a right to unduly interfere.\n  The Casey decision explained these matters involving the most \nintimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices \nthat are central to personal dignity and autonomy and that are central \nto the liberty protected by the 14th Amendment.\n  The so-called experts who testified in favor of HB2 have been \ndiscredited by multiple Federal courts and have been exposed for \nsubmitting testimony written by an anti-abortion activist with no \nmedical training.\n  Texas' HB2 has led to the closure of more than 20 abortion facilities \nin the State, taking the total number of providers down from 40 to 19.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I close, let me give an additional personal anecdote \nthat has taken place in the State of Texas. That is, of course, the \nmasquerading of going into the Planned Parenthood offices that have \nprovided these clinics and that have provided health care to college \nstudents and to those in rural communities where there are no doctors, \nOB/GYNs, or facilities to handle the medical needs of these women.\n  Remember what I said. Women's rights are human rights, and human \nrights are women's rights, so said by then-First Lady Hillary Rodham \nClinton. It is true today.\n  As I have shown in documents, the United Nations working group has \nchallenged whether or not we are providing women the same rights in \nAmerica as men. That is a daunting question and an unfortunate answer \nbecause the U.N. working group has said no.\n  In the backdrop of this great discussion and of the Texas HB2, we had \nthe circumstances of people falsifying who they were, stealing the ID \nof this person's high school classmates and imitating that he was \nlooking for fetuses for research.\n  Interestingly enough, all of them were calling for the indictment of \nthe Planned Parenthood personnel. Yet, an unbiased grand jury in Texas \ndid not indict those innocent persons who were having a discussion \nabout what was legal, but they indicted those who falsified their \ndocuments and tried to mislead people.\n  Again, this case will be argued in the backdrop of so many who are \ntrying to undermine women's rights. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to find ways to address the illogical, unfair, and unjust \ndisparity by reviewing and responding to unwarranted restrictions that \nresult in the disparate access to these constitutionally protected \nrights.\n  One day I hope that we will learn and have as our constitutional \npremise that the Constitution works and that women's rights are human \nrights.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Gentlelady for yielding, and I commend the \nProgressive Caucus for standing firm in defense of our hard-fought \nwomen's rights, which in truth, are constitutionally protected American \nrights.\n  We face a real problem in America with hypocrisy.\n  As a country founded on principles of liberty, justice and equality, \nand a global leader in formulating international human rights \nstandards, the United States fails to meet these basic standards for \nwomen who are denied equal access to legal rights and protections.\n  The United Nations Working Group on Discrimination against Women in \nLaw and Practice (U.N. Working Group) recently issued a sobering \nstatement and assessment detailing a picture of women's missing rights \nin America.\n  Upon visiting several states throughout the country, including my \nhome state of Texas, the U.N. Working Group concluded that women in the \nUnited States inexplicably lag behind international human rights \nstandards.\n  Pointing to data and research on public and political representation, \neconomic and social rights, and health and safety protections, experts \nin the U.N. Working Group boldly acknowledged that there is a myth that \nwomen in the United States already enjoy all of the expected standards \nof rights and protections afforded under America.\n  The reality is women in the United States are experiencing continued \ndiscrimination and daunting disparities that prevent the true ability \nfor them to fully participate as equal members of society.\n  One of the most alarming deficiencies for women in America is the \ninability to access basic health care and the imposition of devastating \nbarriers to reproductive health and rights.\n  Too many women are suffering dire and deadly consequences.\n  Between 1990 and 2013, the maternal mortality rate for women in the \nU.S. has increased by 136%.\n  Black women are nearly 4 times more likely to die in childbirth, and \nstates with high poverty rates have a 77% higher maternal mortality \nrate.\n  Our global experts and allies acknowledge that even though women's \nreproductive rights in America are constitutionally protected, access \nto reproductive health services are severely abridged by states \nimposition of sweeping barriers and restrictions.\n  For instance, in many states, women must undergo unjustified and \ninvasive medical procedures; endure groundless waiting periods; be \nsubjected to harassment, violence or other threatening conditions that \nremain constant throughout all reproductive health care clinics; and \nforced to forgo treatment or engage in lengthy and costly travel due to \nclosure of clinics faced with burdensome licensing conditions.\n  These restrictions disproportionately discriminate against poor \nwomen.\n  The United States can and should do better!\n  It is unacceptable that women in America are facing a health care \ncrisis so dire that the global community is denouncing it as a human \nrights violation.\n  Sadly, the direction States are taking will only further dismantle \nwomen's access to affordable and trustworthy reproductive healthcare.\n  While clinics are shutting down at drastic rates throughout the \ncountry, devastating restrictions and barriers imposed throughout Texas \nstrike at the core of this abomination.\n  A Texas statute known as HB2 (House Bill 2), was enacted several \nyears ago under false claims to promote women's health, when in fact it \nonly set in motion dangerous restrictions on women's access to \nreproductive health care.\n  In addition to constant attacks on funding for reproductive health \ncare clinics, abortion providers in Texas were forced to undergo \nimpossible million dollar renovations and upgrades.\n  Denying hundreds of thousands of women health care services in Texas, \nnearly half of all reproductive health care clinics were forced to shut \ndown, and now only 10 remain in the second largest state in the \ncountry.\n  Taking an important step toward restoring the constitutional rights \nof millions of women, the Supreme Court recently granted certiorari of \nWhole Woman's Health v. Cole to decide the fate of these remaining \nclinics and the\n\n[[Page H940]]\n\nlives of women in Texas, and throughout the nation.\n  I am proud to say that I, and a number of my colleagues, signed on to \na number of amicus briefs submitted to the Supreme Court, detailing the \nhardship and injustice Whole Woman's Health v. Cole presents.\n  While we await the decision of the Supreme Court, in Whole Woman's \nHealth v. Cole, we can only hope that the court will help turn the tide \nof attacks and diminution on women's rights.\n  No woman in America should be denied the dignity of being ability to \nmake choices about her body and healthcare.\n  Access to safe, legal and unhindered healthcare must be realized by \nall women.\n  These simple facts can no longer be denied, and hypocrisy can no \nlonger be tolerated.\n  A woman's right to choose to have an abortion is a constitutionally \nprotected fundamental right.\n  More than 40 years ago in the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 \nU.S. 113, (1973), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the right to \nprivacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extends to a \nwoman's decision to have an abortion.\n  More recently, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), \nthe Supreme Court upheld Roe v. Wade and further explained that states \ncould not enact medically unnecessary regulations meant to create \nsubstantial obstacles for women seeking abortion services.\n  Yet, fairness and access to exercise constitutionally protected \nfundamental rights is trampled on and denied to millions of women.\n  We cannot ignore the hypocrisy of imbalanced protection and access to \nfundamentally protected rights for women in America when it is easier \nto purchase and lawfully possess a firearm--even for a person on the \nterrorist watch list--than it is for a woman to exercise her \nconstitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is neither fair nor right and it should not be \nrewarded.\n  As our nation continues to push back against horrific acts of \nviolence at the hands of dangerous and irresponsible gun owners and gun \ndealers, and our nation's number one provider of women's healthcare \ncontinues to experience violent and devastating attacks on its services \nand facilities, it is time we find common ground as we look to resolve \nthese polarizing issues that have all too often collided.\n  A woman's right to choose to have an abortion and an individual's \nright to possess a firearm are both constitutionally protected \nfundamental rights.\n  I will be working with my colleagues to find ways to address this \nillogical, unfair and unjust disparity by reviewing and responding to \nunwarranted restrictions that result in disparate access to these \nconstitutionally protected rights.\n  Namely, if a woman is required to wait several days, undergo a \nphysical examination, receive counseling and education about \nalternative options before making the decision to terminate a \npregnancy, an individual purchasing a deadly weapon should be required \nto jump through the same restrictive hoops and apparent safety \nmeasures.\n  I hope one day we can come to an agreement in America that it should \nnot be harder for a woman to exercise her fundamental right to choose \nthan it is for a person on the terrorist watch list to lawfully \npurchase and possess firearms.\n  At a minimum, I urge my colleagues to take a hard look at our \nconstitutional protections and founding principles to resolve the \ngrowing crisis and unacceptable conditions of inferiority in America.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the Congresswoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley).\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Congresswoman Watson Coleman \nand my pro-choice colleagues for inviting me to participate in this \nvery timely and important conversation.\n  As we await to hear the Supreme Court's oral arguments next week in \nthe case of Whole Woman's Health, we must reflect on not only the \nserious implications of this particular case, but on the attacks on \nchoice that have happened across the country this past year.\n  The case against Whole Woman's Health threatens to take the number of \nclinics in Texas down from 19 to just 10 for the 5.4 million women of \nreproductive age in Texas.\n  It will also set a legal precedent for years to come--perhaps \ndecades--and it will shape the continued debate on a woman's right to \nchoose.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Clearly, this unacceptable assault on women's health places an undue \nburden on the women of Texas when accessing abortion and family \nplanning services.\n  I was proud to sign onto the Amicus brief with 162 congressional \ncolleagues in support of Whole Woman's Health. This case, in \nparticular, is a high profile and extreme example of the attacks that \nare becoming all too common across the United States.\n  While abortion still remains legal in the years since Roe v. Wade, \nopponents of choice have attempted with varying degrees of success to \nchip away at a woman's right to choose, this despite the fact that \nabortions are at their lowest rates since Roe.\n  Last year, we saw ideological attacks against Planned Parenthood from \nanti-choice activists attempting to mire the organization in scandal \nand force its closing. Those attacks stemmed from the illegally \nobtained and questionably edited so-called sting videos filmed by these \nsame anti-choice activists.\n  Unsurprisingly, Planned Parenthood has been cleared of any wrongdoing \nin every State that has conducted an investigation. And to top it off, \na grand jury in Missouri has indicted those responsible for filming the \nvideos. It goes to show this campaign against Planned Parenthood has \nbeen nothing less than a fraud.\n  While I fundamentally support a woman's right to choose, it is \nimportant to point out that the clinics forced to close in Texas and \nacross the U.S. serve women in ways far beyond providing safe \nabortions. In many cases, especially for low income and minority \ncommunities, these clinics serve as a primary healthcare provider. The \nservices they provide include birth control, STD testing, cervical \nscreenings, mammograms, counseling, and health education.\n  It is crucial that we understand reproductive rights and choice is \nnot a women's issue. It is a civil rights issue, and it is an American \nissue.\n  In the City of Chicago, which I represent, women have widespread \naccess to reproductive health services. But women in neighboring States \nlike Indiana are often forced to cross State lines to find a clinic \nwhere she can have a safe abortion. This reality is unacceptable. Civil \nrights should not be dependent upon your ZIP Code.\n  The decision in Whole Woman's Health will ultimately hold national \nimplications. As a man, I am proud to stand up for choice. As a male \nMember of Congress, I take my responsibility to protect choice for \nwomen very seriously.\n  Statistics show women's economic output is dramatically impacted for \nthe better when they determine the timing and spacing of their \npregnancies. When she is able to plan pregnancy, a woman is more likely \nto advance in education and the workforce. Conversely, unplanned \npregnancies too often force women to leave school and to delay or \nabandon career ambitions outright in order to care for children before \nthey are ready and with limited support and resources.\n  In order for our society to ever truly be equal, women must have \ncontrol of their bodies and determine with their partner if and when \nthey want to have children. Here in Congress, most of us were afforded \nthe right to plan our families. Should we deny this right to the \nconstituents we serve?\n  The future of millions of young women depend on the decision to be \nhanded down in cases like Whole Woman's Health, and it is my sincere \nhope that the Court remains consistent in recognizing a woman's right \nto privacy and protects her right to make her own choices about her \nhealth.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nWashington (Ms. DelBene), who is a member of the select panel that will \nundoubtedly be examining some of these issues.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, 43 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that women have a \nconstitutional right to decide whether and when to have a child. \nAmericans overwhelmingly think that was the right decision, and I \nagree.\n  But according to Bloomberg, at no time since 1973 has a woman's \naccess to reproductive health care been more dependent on her income or \nZIP Code. Politicians across the country are passing dangerous laws to \nblock women from exercising their constitutionally protected right to \nchoose, and their efforts are working.\n\n[[Page H941]]\n\n  That is why the case before the Supreme Court is so important. As the \nJustices weigh the Whole Woman's Health case, I hope they recognize \nthat these shameful attacks undermine Roe v. Wade, put women's health \nat risk, and must be struck down. A woman's right to make her own \nhealthcare decisions means nothing without the ability to exercise that \nright.\n  If the Court upholds these harmful laws, it could pave the way for \nsimilar restrictions at the Federal level, and Republicans are already \ntrying. We cannot let that happen.\n  Women deserve better. They deserve the freedom to make their own \nhealthcare choices.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey \nfor leading this Special Order hour on this very important issue.\n  As my colleagues have mentioned, the Supreme Court is scheduled to \nhear Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt next Tuesday, challenging HB2, \na Texas law that has already led to the closing of more than 20 \nabortion providers in the State.\n  Now, this is just the most recent example of the attack which is \nunderway all across this country on women's health, not just in the \nState of Texas, but in many other places around our country. As was \njust mentioned, politicians are passing laws and enacting regulations \nto deny women full reproductive health care.\n  In fact, just last Sunday, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed a law \ndefunding Planned Parenthood. During his time in office, half of Ohio's \nabortion clinics have closed.\n  One in three women will have to make a decision in their lifetime if \nan abortion is the right decision for them. I am very proud to be a \nmember of the Pro-Choice Caucus in the Congress. I know this is an \nextremely personal decision for women, a decision that should be made \nbetween a woman and her physician, and a decision the government has no \nright to intrude upon, a constitutionally protected right as \nestablished in our law. It is absolutely critical that women in every \npart of this country have access to full reproductive health care, \nincluding safe abortion services.\n  If the Court upholds Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, there will \nbe only ten clinics available to the women in the State of Texas. Some \nwould have to travel 7\\1/2\\ hours roundtrip to get the health care that \nthey need.\n  This is settled law in our country. The Court addressed this issue in \nRoe v. Wade and again in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. It reminds us of \nthe importance of the decision that our Supreme Court will make in \nconnection with this case that they will hear on Tuesday.\n  Doctors are being required, under Texas provisions, to affiliate with \nnearby hospitals, and it also limits abortions to ambulatory surgical \ncenters. These measures are designed to reduce or even eliminate, in \nsome circumstances, access to abortion services. Although there are \narguments made that these are medically necessary or they are, in fact, \nintended to improve women's health, Nancy Northup, who is the president \nof the Center for Reproductive Rights, said it best when she said, the \n``laws . . . pretend to be about women's health but actually are \ndesigned to close clinics.'' And that is exactly what they intend to \ndo.\n\n  These regulations and requirements are very disputed medical value. \nThere are things like limits on nonsurgical drug-induced abortions, \nmandated building standards for clinics, or 2- or 3-day waiting \nperiods. All of these things are intended to infringe upon a woman's \nright to choose and to make it more difficult for women to access full \nreproductive health care.\n  We all have responsibility in the Congress to stand up against this. \nI am proud to join my colleagues tonight to say that we will continue \nto fight to ensure that women have access to all of the reproductive \nhealth care they need and that we will resist any effort to infringe \nupon this important constitutional protection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Adams).\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for \nher leadership.\n  It frightens me that in 2016, we are still fighting the same \npolitically motivated battles to roll back women's rights. It has been \n43 years since the landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade made \nabortion a constitutional right.\n  Year after year, GOP lawmakers and anti-choice extremists have tried \nto tear it down. States like Texas have passed egregious laws to \ndisenfranchise women and infringe on their ability to access safe and \nlegal abortions.\n  Their State law has cut the number of abortion providers in Texas in \nhalf, increasing delays and severely limiting access and, frankly, \npunishing women for exercising their civil liberties.\n  This obvious war on women has got to stop. No law should control a \nwoman's right to make decisions about her own body--no government, no \nlegislature, no Congress. A woman's personal decision should be between \nher and her doctor and nobody else. Every woman deserves equal access \nto all forms of safe and affordable reproductive health.\n  As the Supreme Court prepares to hear this case, I will continue to \nstand with women in North Carolina and women across the country in the \nfight to protect a woman's right to choose.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, we thank you for this opportunity \nto raise what is a very important issue in 2016. Women are being \nattacked on several fronts, whether it is on cases that are being \nbrought before courts or whether it is in this House. We have got to \nrecognize that this decision, the decision for a woman to make with \nregard to her reproductive rights, have already been established. And \nwe as Congress and we as a society of lawmakers and policymakers need \nto do all that we can to facilitate those rights to ensure that we do \nnot discriminate against people. To discriminate against women in this \nregard is illegal, and it is unacceptable.\n  It is time for us to recognize our responsibility to be stewards of \nthe laws which have been put before us and to uphold the Constitution \nthat we have pledged to support and to uphold and to recognize that the \nabridgement of a woman's right is the abridgement of a civil right, and \nthat is unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H941-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H941-H944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Katko). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, the safety of Americans, the security of \nAmerica, should never be jeopardized for any reason, but certainly not \nsimply for the purpose of fulfilling a campaign pledge.\n  The President recently released a plan about closing Guantanamo Bay, \nand it demonstrates to me--and I think to the American people--that his \nplan is misguided, as well as his priorities.\n  The proposal to close Guantanamo proves that his priority lies in \nleaving behind a legacy rather than protecting the American people and \nAmerican national security. As a matter of fact, it presents nothing \nmore than another attempt to fulfill a campaign promise and distracts, \nbased on the timing, from the administration's failure to defeat ISIS.\n  Perhaps it explains why the administration missed a separate \ncongressionally mandated deadline last week for a plan to counter \nradical Islamic extremism. So he missed that deadline but was on time \nfor an incomplete plan to close Guantanamo and the detention facility \nfor terrorists that remains on that post.\n  Now, Congress is a coequal branch of government. It is coequal to the \nPresident, equal in power, equal in representation of America's \ninterests, and it\n\n[[Page H942]]\n\nhas come to a different conclusion than the President. We have \nabsolutely strong and justified reasons for our concern.\n  Mr. Speaker, last September, the Director of National Intelligence \nreported that 30 percent of transfer detainees are confirmed or \nsuspected to be reengaging in terrorist activities. Thirty percent. \nThey are not necessarily in some prison overseas; 30 percent of them \nare out running around conducting terrorist activities.\n  The director's report clearly shows that the detainee transfer \nprocess is deeply flawed. It poses a real, significant, unnecessary, \nand unacceptable risk to the security of our Nation.\n  Just this week, Spanish and Moroccan police arrested four members of \na jihadi cell that sought to recruit for ISIS fighters, including one \nformer Guantanamo detainee who once fought against Americans in \nAfghanistan. I mean, that is this week. I guess he is part of the 30 \npercent or maybe it is 30-point something now, and I suspect it will \njust keep going up the more we release.\n  The President claims that Guantanamo, GTMO, weakens our national \nsecurity by furthering the recruiting propaganda of Islamist terrorist \ngroups, essentially saying we can't keep these people in prison because \nit makes the terrorists mad and it makes them want to do more terrorist \nthings.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  I guess we shouldn't put gang members in prison either, because their \ngang buddies would then be mad and want to conduct more gang activities \nin their communities. Now, based on that logic, we should let all these \npeople out.\n  Al Qaeda has waged war against the United States long before \nGuantanamo, long before the detention facility was constructed in Cuba; \nright? It didn't exist when the World Trade Center was first bombed in \n1993, when the U.S. Embassies in East Africa and Tanzania and Kenya \nwere bombed in 1998. It didn't exist when the USS Cole was attacked in \n2000, and it certainly didn't exist on 9/11 when Islamists attacked our \ncountry.\n  Islamist terror organizations have been and will be at war with \nWestern culture regardless of whether GTMO remains open or is closed. \nOf that, you can be sure.\n  The President claims cost savings. His plan, he says, to move or \ntransfer detainees abroad and to the U.S. would lower costs between \n$140 million and $180 million annually, which is absolutely nothing to \nsneeze at. I will let everybody know: I had a hearing today in Homeland \nSecurity where they wasted $180 million on human resources programs--\nthat is $180 million gone--and 300-some-odd-million dollars for \nemployees at the Department of Homeland Security that are home on leave \nbecause of doing something improper, while they adjudicate the issue.\n  While it is expensive, let's compare the cost, the immediate impact \nof not having these terrorists in prison.\n  The 9/11 attacks cost our country over $230 billion initially. So we \nare looking at $140 million to $180 million annually to $230 billion \ninitially, and that doesn't include the damage made to the airline \nindustry or the additional costs that our whole country has had to \nendure due to increased security, whether it is at the airport, whether \nit is at the grocery store, or whether it is in your home. And it \ncertainly doesn't include the cost to our freedoms.\n  The President's proposal fails to provide the critical details \nrequired by law, the law that he signed. His proposal failed to provide \ncritical details, including the exact cost and the location of an \nalternate facility. Where does he want to put it and how much does it \ncost? These are required by law, and he hasn't enumerated them. Yet he \nhas had 7 years. This is a campaign pledge. He has had 7 years to come \nup with this information. Somehow this is Congress' fault? I don't \nthink so. He is just simply unwilling or unable to state where he is \ngoing to keep these dangerous terrorists that are currently at \nGuantanamo Bay in Cuba.\n  Common sense tells us that the administration is simply avoiding \nfueling a political outcry when he specifies where these individuals \nare going to be held, because where he has even implied where they are \ngoing to be held, there has been a significant outcry, and it has been \nbipartisan.\n  Citizens of the United States don't want these terrorists in their \nneighborhood. They don't want them in their town. They don't want to be \naround them. That is exactly what the problem is with his proposal. The \nplan is just more politics and not any substance. It fails to satisfy \nthe requirements mandated by Congress in the law that he, himself, \nsigned.\n  You might ask who is still at GTMO. I mean, it has been years now \ngoing on. Who is still there? I want to remind everybody, Mr. Speaker, \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, the terrorist attacks \non the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the hijacking of United \nAirlines flight 93, that is who is there.\n  Or Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi, who supported al Qaeda's terrorist network \nas a facilitator, financial manager, and media committee member. This \nsupport included the movement and funding of 9/11 hijackers to the U.S. \nto participate in terrorist attacks orchestrated by Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed. He is affiliated with a number of high-level al Qaeda \noperatives. That is who is in that prison. Do you want him in your \nneighborhood? Do you want them in your neighborhood?\n  It is against the law to transfer these terrorist detainees to \nAmerican soil. It is against the law. The President signed this law. A \nbipartisan majority in Congress has, year after year after year, \nreaffirmed restrictions on transferring these detainees to American \nsoil.\n  As a matter of fact, the provisions of this were first included in \nthe annual National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA, in a Democrat-\nled Congress in 2009. So it is not partisan. In fact, the most recent \nNDAA passed with the same provisions with 370 votes in the House and 91 \nvotes in the Senate before once again the President signed the law \nhimself. He is simply attempting to make this a partisan issue by \nseeking to contradict the will of the American people through their \nduly elected representatives.\n  Ultimately, the plan is simply not safe. The American people don't \nwant GTMO terrorists in their communities, in their backyard, and for \ngood reason. These terrorists should be tried. They should be tried \nunder the military tribunal provisions already laid out in the $10 \nmillion-plus courtroom facility that the taxpayers already paid for. \nMany of us have visited it. It is sitting right there on the post. We \nare waiting for these detainees to go to that courtroom that we paid \nfor and be tried. That is fine with us. That is fine with Members of \nCongress, and that is fine with the American people. We don't need to \nbring them to America to do that. Congress is going to uphold its \npromise that any plan that seeks to transfer these dangerous war \ncriminals does not happen.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber), my good friend.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nPerry), my colleague, for organizing this Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely important that the American people need \nto learn about the President's proposal and what impact it is going to \nhave on our country.\n  Folks, closing GTMO and transferring these dangerous terrorists to \nUnited States soil is a terrible and an illogical idea. Instead of \nputting America first, the President once again continues to weaken our \nnational security by pursuing decisions apparently geared toward \nsolidifying some form of his legacy. I am just not sure who he is \ntrying to impress here.\n  Did you know that as many as one in three--the gentleman from \nPennsylvania said 30 percent and rising; with the latest figures I \nhave, 33 percent--one in three former GTMO detainees have returned or \nare suspected of returning to terrorist organizations? One in three, \nMr. Speaker. In baseball, that is a .333 batting average. That is good \nenough to get you into the Hall of Fame in many instances.\n  Speaking of Hall of Famers, Mr. Speaker, the most infamous former \nGTMO detainee, one of their hall of famers, if you will, is Ibrahim al \nQosi, once the cook for none other than Osama bin Laden himself.\n  Al Qosi pled guilty to charges of conspiracy and providing material \nsupport\n\n[[Page H943]]\n\nto al Qaeda. Al Qosi was transferred from GTMO to Sudan, his home \ncountry, after 2 years. Well, since his release, he has become an \ninfluential leader within--you guessed it--al Qaeda in Yemen.\n  What was the President thinking would happen? Well, the President's \nplan includes ``transferring the bulk of remaining detainees to other \ncountries and moving the rest because they are deemed too dangerous to \ntransfer abroad to an as yet undetermined detention facility in the \nUnited States.''\n  Mr. Speaker, a recent poll from Rasmussen confirms that the \nmajority--56 percent, in fact--of the American people widely disapprove \nof the President's irresponsible plan to close GTMO. For those who side \nwith the President's plan and attempt to rationalize the fact that \nthese dangerous and deadly terrorists will be in supermax facilities, \nlet us not forget about the prison break that happened in one of those \nfacilities in New York just last year.\n  The two men who escaped weren't masterminds. They weren't terrorists \nof the first order like these guys are. Can you imagine what \nmasterminds who plot terror, who love death and violence almost as much \nif not more than we love life and liberty, can you imagine what these \nmasterminds of terrorism could do? Who knows how much help they could \nget from the outside, what their hall of famers could help them do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not willing to find out what they can do with the \naid of their hall of famers on the outside, and I don't think the \nAmerican public is willing to find out, either. Fortunately, as the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania said, Congress has already taken preventive \nmeasures by including language in the recent National Defense \nAuthorization Act, the NDAA, that would bar Guantanamo detainees from \nbeing transferred to the United States, and the President signed this \nlegislation into law.\n  For the President to close GTMO, current law must be changed. Oh, I \nforget. He doesn't seem to be hampered by the idea of current law. New \nlegislation would have to be written, Mr. Speaker. It would have to be \napproved by Congress and sent to the President's desk again. Let me \njust tell you: I, for one, will not support any measure that will allow \nthese dangerous terrorists to be transferred to the United States. \nAmerica and Americans are far too precious to take this kind of risk.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my \nfriend, for hosting this Special Order hour tonight.\n  I want to read something that was written by Michelle Jesse, where \nSecretary of State John Kerry testified in front of a Senate committee \nhearing, I think it was yesterday. It was pointed out to the Secretary \nthat this very guy who was the cook of Osama bin Laden, al Qosi, had \nindeed gone back to terrorism and to trying to kill Americans yet \nagain.\n  I guess Mr. Kerry in seven simple words probably dismantled the \nPresident's argument about why it was a good idea, maybe unwittingly, \nmaybe unknowingly. But when it was pointed out to him that that \nterrorist was back on the battlefield seeking to destroy Americans and \nkill Americans again, Mr. Kerry's simple response was: ``Well . . . \nhe's not supposed to be doing that.''\n  Mr. Speaker, you can't make this stuff up.\n  I want to thank the gentleman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. PERRY. I thank my good friend from Texas and agree with him that \n30 percent is way too high. One is too many, but 30 percent is way--way \ntoo high.\n  I yield to my good friend from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. I want to thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for his leadership on this issue. We both are on the \nCommittee on Homeland Security, so we are acutely aware of some of the \nterrorist dangers that are out there because we hear it in a lot of \ncommittee meetings, classified briefings, and other things.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time that Congress act proactively against a \nPresident who holds a personal legacy above the law. Law does not bend \nto legacy. Law is obeyed, respected, and even honored for the order it \nbrings to our Nation.\n  Disturbingly, this principle of our Founders seems to be at odds with \na growing segment of politicians. That is why I introduced House \nResolution 617. House Resolution 617 gives authority to the Speaker of \nthe House to initiate litigation against any executive branch official \nshould they file an illegal order by transferring detainees to U.S. \nsoil. This commonsense approach provides a constitutional check on the \nPresident.\n  Now, whether in Charleston, Colorado, or Kansas, he should not bring \nAmerican families, neighbors, and communities into close proximity with \nsome of the most dangerous terrorists in the world.\n  Unfortunately, the President has forgotten about the people. He has \nforgotten that they don't travel in armored motorcades. They have no \nsecurity details guarding their every step, looking around every \ncorner.\n  I know my constituents are fearful of this proposal by the President \nbecause the folks in Charleston, South Carolina, have been fearful. The \nNavy brig the President is proposing to bring these terrorists to is a \nvery, very short distance from an elementary school.\n  I would also call on the candidates for President of the United \nStates when they are campaigning around South Carolina, ask them a \nquestion: Do they support housing terrorists in our neighborhoods--that \nis a legitimate question--near our children who are at schools or near \nour churches where we worship?\n  Mr. Speaker, the language that prevents transferring detainees to \nU.S. soil was actually put in by a Democratic Congress and passed in \nbipartisan fashion ever since. It was further reaffirmed in last year's \nNDAA. It is against the law for the President to transfer detainees--I \nam going to stop using the word ``detainees''--terrorists. It is \nagainst the law for a President of the United States to transfer \nterrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the United States, to our soil.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  That is in the law. It has been in the law since the Democrats \ncontrolled this body. We just reaffirmed it this year. This isn't a \nRepublican or Democratic issue. It is bipartisan. It is against the \nlaw.\n  Now, I visited GTMO. When I was a freshman in Congress 5 years ago, I \nwent down there to see it for myself. Some of the biggest names on the \nterrorist roster are located there due to the brave efforts of our men \nand women in combat to capture these guys on the battlefield.\n  We have released a lot of them. Thirty percent, as you heard the \ngentleman from Texas say, of the terrorists that we have released have \nreturned to terrorism or we suspect they have return to terrorism. That \nis based on intel.\n  Thirty percent is a large number of the number that we have released. \nWhether it is South Carolina, Colorado, Kansas, or any other State, no \nState should be a terrorist dumping ground for this administration.\n  So let's follow the law. Let's follow the law passed in a bipartisan \nmanner through the United States Congress. Let's force the President to \nfollow the law.\n  Because, if he doesn't, let's pass H.R. 1617 and give the Speaker of \nthe House the legal grounds and the authority to file a lawsuit to put \nan injunction in place to keep him from violating the law, violating a \nlaw, by the way, that he signed.\n  Mr. PERRY. I think sometimes it seems like the President would like \nAmericans to be more concerned with the rights of terrorists than their \nown rights.\n  I wonder about and think about all those MPs, all those members of \nthe services that go down and do a tour at Guantanamo and have horrific \nthings happen to them and still act professionally in the face of these \nterrorists every single day. That is who we should be thinking about, \nthose people and the American people and their rights.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority \nwhip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for \nleading this Special Order to highlight, Mr. Speaker, what is at stake \nin this latest proposal by President Obama.\n  As you can see from the passion that my friend from South Carolina \njust exhibited, this is an issue that rivets throughout the country. \nPeople understand what is at stake. People across\n\n[[Page H944]]\n\nAmerica know that there are bad people around the world that want to do \nus harm.\n  ISIS is on the move. They are not a JV team. They are not being \ndetained. In fact, they are recruiting Westerners. In fact, they are \nrecruiting Americans into the battle.\n  So you look at Guantanamo Bay. And this is something that, for \nwhatever reason, has become a rallying cry for the political left. They \nwanted to close it down.\n  They wanted to bring those terrorists into the United States, to give \nthem taxpayer-funded rights that the President can't even identify, but \nthat everybody acknowledges they don't deserve. We don't need that kind \nof threat here.\n  When you look at the President's proposal this week, I think he has \nmade it clear that he has put the political priorities of the far left \nelements over the safety and security of the United States of America. \nThis would put Americans at risk by bringing these terrorists into the \nUnited States.\n  Just go look at what kind of people are being held at Guantanamo Bay. \nThese are the worst of the worst. These are people who have plotted and \nactually carried out attacks against American servicemen and -women. \nThey have killed Americans in the battlefield, killed our troops. These \nare the people who have carried out those attacks.\n  So they are being held at GTMO, as it is called, because that is the \nbest place to ensure that we don't have to see them again on the \nbattlefield.\n  Over 100 of those who have already been released have gone back into \nthe battlefield, in many cases, to kill American soldiers. Why would \nthe President want to give them extra rights? Why would the President \nwant to bring them into the United States of America?\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we rise today and highlight this to point out, \nnumber one, what the President's intent really is and what the \nPresident is trying to do. This is something the President has asked \nCongress to take up.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are making it very clear it is not going to happen. \nThis House will not allow these terrorists being detained at Guantanamo \nBay to enter into the United States to undermine America's national \nsecurity.\n  They are over there for a reason, which is because of terrorist \nattacks they have not only plotted, but carried out, against Americans. \nSo, Mr. Speaker, they belong in Guantanamo Bay. Under this House, they \nare going to stay in Guantanamo Bay and not be brought into the United \nStates.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for this Special Order \nthat he is leading.\n  Mr. PERRY. I thank the majority whip for his passion and his remarks. \nWhile he talks about the battlefield, we are going to hear from \nsomebody that has been to the battlefield.\n  The other thing about these terrorists that are spending their time \nin Guantanamo Bay is that they turned America into a battlefield in New \nYork City.\n  I yield to my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I would like to congratulate the gentleman from \nPennsylvania on his recent promotion to general and for all of his \nservice not just here in Congress, but also in uniform.\n  This week President Obama sent an incomplete plan to Congress to \nclose the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This plan would \nsend terrorists back home overseas and even bring high-risk terrorists \nto detention centers here in the United States.\n  There are still so many unanswered questions with regard to the \nPresident's proposal, for example, what happens when we capture the \nnext 2 or 10 or 30 terrorists? Where are we going to question them? \nWhere are we going to detain them? What is the exact placement inside \nthe United States for those detainees currently in GTMO? Also, what \nlegal protections and rights will detainees have if we bring them into \nthe U.S. and into our civilian court system?\n  Make no mistake. These detainees at GTMO are the worst of the worst \nof the worst. All the variables left out of the President's plan shows \nthat this really isn't a plan. It is a political campaign pledge from 8 \nyears ago.\n  The facility at Guantanamo Bay has not only served as a place to keep \nsome of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, but also as a \ntactical and strategic facility where intelligence is gathered to \nprevent potential attacks against our country and ensure U.S. national \nsecurity.\n  While the President was speaking this week, it was reported that a \nformer prisoner at Guantanamo Bay was one of four terror suspects \naffiliated with ISIS who was arrested for his alleged role in plotting \nterror attacks in Spain. Just one week earlier another former prisoner \nat Guantanamo was pictured in a number of videos that called for jihad \nagainst the Saudi Kingdom and the Western world.\n\n  These two cases are not just coincidence. Just a few months ago the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence reported that one-third \nof freed Guantanamo prisoners are either suspected or confirmed of \nreturning to terrorist activities. One-third.\n  The President is willing to compromise the security and safety of \nAmerican lives for the sake of his own legacy. Bringing dangerous \nterrorists to U.S. soil is a dangerous political move that could not \ncome at a worse time, as groups like ISIS continue to spread across the \nMiddle East, Europe, and the rest of the world. Again, Guantanamo is a \nkey strategic and national security asset.\n  For the sake of our national security, I will do everything in my \npower to ensure that the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay remains \nopen. I would rather have terrorists in GTMO or dead than in U.S. \ndetention facilities or back on the battlefield.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. PERRY. Folks, there you have it. The case has been made. At this \npoint, it is essentially irrefutable. You can't see what the upside is \nto bringing these people to the United States and closing the facility.\n  Al Qaeda, ISIS, radical Islamists, are not going to stop. They are \nnever going to stop. It certainly has nothing to do with where people \nare detained. It has nothing to do with that.\n  They hate the West. They hate America. That is not going to change \nanytime soon. Allowing these people, these terrorists, to live within \nour community is not going to solve any part of that equation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President has had 7 years to come up with a plan, 7 \nyears for specifics, and, yet, he came this week and provided none of \nthose specifics.\n  Earlier this year I asked the President about the details and about \nthe transfer already conducted of these terrorists to other countries: \nWhat are the details? What has American given? How much has it cost us?\n  I didn't realize at the time that we have already transferred \ndetainees to 55 countries around the world. We have no idea, as \nAmerican citizens, from the most transparent administration in \nhistory--so-called by the administration--what the details of those \narrangements are, but we do know this. These terrorists have been \ntransferred to the likes of Yemen, Pakistan, Libya, Iran, and Iraq.\n  What kind of judgment is that, Mr. Speaker? We are sending terrorists \nfrom a detention facility to terrorist nations, nations where terrorism \nthrives, and expecting them not to reengage, expecting them not to join \nthe fight.\n  They are going to join the fight and they are coming after us. The \nPresident needs to quit being selfish and needs to be responsible with \nthe security of his country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H944-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H944-H947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ORIGINAL BLACK HISTORY MONTH RESOLUTION OF 2016\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

I also want \nto thank the leadership for allowing us to have this time tonight to \ntalk about Black history.\n  More specifically, tonight we are going to talk about Black history \nas it relates to hallowed grounds, the sites of African American \nmemories. But before going there, I think it appropriate to note that \nthe House of Representatives has passed Black history resolutions since \n2007.\n  In 2007, the 110th Congress, we had a resolution that passed. It \npassed by voice vote. In 2008, the resolution passed 367-0. In 2009, it \npassed 420-0. In 2010, 402-0. Since 2010, of course, we have not taken \nvotes on any resolutions, generally speaking.\n  I am honored to speak at this time of hallowed grounds, sites of \nAfrican American memories. I am honored to do so because there are many \npersons who have made great sacrifices so that many of us would have \nthe opportunities that we have. Many persons have suffered great pain \nso that some individuals can have great gains.\n  Tonight we will discuss some of the pain because pain is associated \nwith hallowed grounds.\n  There are some things that we should never forget. We should never \nand cannot forget--nor should we--Pearl Harbor. This is a place where \nwe have hallowed grounds. I have been to Pearl Harbor, and I know of \nthe memorial that is there.\n  We should not forget 9/11 and the World Trade Center. Hallowed \ngrounds exist on the site where the World Trade Center was taken down.\n  Because atrocities can sometimes create these hallowed grounds, we \nwill sometimes find that things that we have to say are not always \nappealing, but the truth is that we cannot sanitize history.\n  Efforts to sanitize history will only create what we call his story, \nsomeone else's version, but it is not the true history.\n  Tonight we will not sanitize, but we will, in fact, be truthful about \nsome of those hallowed grounds. Some of them have atrocious events \nassociated with them.\n  Let us start with hallowed grounds, places, sites, if you will, of \nBlack history and some of the memories--not all good--associated with \nthe African American lives that have been lost in this country, \nunfortunately.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Let us start with Mother Bethel AME Church in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, established in 1794. This is a place that is, without \nquestion, of hallowed ground, because this place is the home of one of \nthe Underground Railroads to freedom.\n  It was the Union Station, if you will, of the Underground Railroad to \nfreedom, where slaves would be stationed and they could receive \nsanctuary as they were moving from this country to Canada and moving to \nfreedom.\n  This church was founded by the Honorable Richard Allen, who was a \nformer slave himself, and became the founder of the AME Church. In \nfact, he was the first bishop of the church.\n  This site, if you will, had many people who were, but for the people \nwho were there to give them aid and comfort, who were lost and were \npeople who were trying to find their way on freedom's road, the \nUnderground Railroad, if you will, to freedom, the Underground \nRailroad.\n  Well, I am going to quote now Harriet Tubman, because Harriet Tubman \nreminded us of something that is important as it relates to African \nAmerican history and some of the incidents that we will talk about.\n  Harriet Tubman reminded us that she freed 1,000 slaves, but she went \non to say: ``I could have freed another thousand if they had only known \nthat they were slaves.'' If they had only known that they were slaves, \nthey, too, could have been freed.\n  The point that she was making is--and was--that people who are held \nin servitude can become so conditioned to their servitude that they \ndon't really understand the condition that they are actually existing \nunder and, as a result, they accept it.\n  Harriet Tubman did not. Those who were part of the Underground \nRailroad to freedom did not accept servitude, and they wanted to have \nfreedom; and this place, this church, Mother Bethel, was a place of \nfreedom and a sanctuary for those who were seeking new opportunities \nand a better life in a better place.\n  Another site, another place for us to remember the hallowed grounds \nthat led to freedom, Seneca Village in New York City. The time of its \nexistence was from 1825 to 1857. It was the site of a free middle class \ncommunity. It was a small village, founded by Black people in 1825. And \nit is interesting to note that 10 percent of the African American \nvoters who lived in New York lived in Seneca Village--10 percent.\n  There were other persons living there as well. The Irish were there. \nThe Germans were there. These were immigrants as well.\n  The unfortunate circumstance about this hallowed ground, however, is \nthat it was razed. Seneca Village was razed so that Central Park could \nrise. And the unfortunate circumstance further is that the stain of \ninvidious eminent domain is Central Park's shame. It is so unfortunate \nthat people were forced to leave their homes so that Central Park could \nhave a home.\n  Another site that we will mention tonight is Freedmen's Town, the \nhistoric district in Houston, Texas. Freedmen's Town was one of the \nfirst and the largest of the post-Civil War Black urban communities in \nthe United States. It was settled by emancipated slaves in 1866. \nAlthough African Americans lived in Houston before and during the Civil \nWar, Freedmen's Town represents the first community of free Black \nHoustonians in the city. It was, however, more than just a community. \nIt was, indeed, a town. It had the infrastructure. It had the streets \nthat were made of brick. It had lawyers and doctors. It had persons who \nwere teachers, professionals, artisans, tradesmen.\n  I had the privilege of going into Freedmen's Town not so long ago to \nthe home of one of the prominent lawyers who lived there at that time.\n  Preserving Freedmen's Town has become quite a challenge, but there \nare people in the community and Fourth Ward who are committed to its \npreservation. I will mention one such person. This would be Ms. Gladys \nHouse, who has worked tirelessly to maintain the character and \ninfrastructure in Freedmen's Town.\n  Another site would be Greenwood, the Greenwood community, also known \nas Black Wall Street. This was in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was the site of a \nrace riot in 1921. This riot lasted from May 31 to June 1, when the \nunthinkable--the unthinkable--occurred. The unthinkable occurred \nbecause of an allegation of a Black male assaulting a White female. A \nsexual assault was alleged. I don't know that it was ever proven. I \nhaven't been able to find anyplace in the readings and the research \nthat I have done to substantiate the fact that it was proven. But it \nwas alleged, an attempted sexual assault, if you will.\n  This attack on this community of African Americans led to 10,000 \npeople being left homeless--10,000--35 or more city blocks were \ndestroyed by fire, and estimates range from 39 to 300 people having \nbeen killed by various sources. We have found this to be the \ninformation that we can share. The residents rebuilt the community \nwithin 5 years. However, the community later declined because of \ndesegregation in the mid-20th century.\n  This incident, however, is something that we can never forget, just \nas we can't forget Pearl Harbor, just as we can't forget 9/11. The \nincident was something that took place and had the blessings of the \nconstabulary. The police actually helped set fire to the property of \nthe people who lived there. Later, a police chief apologized, and this \nwas done in September of 2013. An apology was given for the attack that \ntook place many years before, between May 31 and June 1 of 1921.\n  Hallowed ground.\n  We should remember the Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market in Money, \nMississippi, because on August 28, 1955, Emmett Till was murdered in \nMoney, Mississippi. He was murdered because of an allegation of his \nhaving accosted a White female.\n\n[[Page H946]]\n\n  In these times, we don't like to discuss it. I know that it makes \nsome uncomfortable. But during these times, it was dangerous for Black \nmen to speak in an unkind way to a White female. In fact, it was unkind \nfor them to look at White females in a certain way. As a result, many \nBlack men lost their lives because of allegations that were never \nproven with reference to flirting or attempted rape, in many cases.\n  Well, as the case was with Emmett Till, he was a 14-year-old child \nfrom Chicago. He did not know the ways of the South. His mother had \ngiven him warnings before he left, but her admonitions were not enough. \nAt some point, he went into this store, and the owner's wife alleges \nthat he made a pass at her, if you will. Some said he whistled; others \nsaid he winked. There are many accounts, but it was never proven that \nhe did anything.\n  After learning of this alleged incident, the owner of the store, with \na friend, literally went into the home of Emmett Till, went into his \nhome and took him from his home. They took him away and they beat him. \nThey took him to a river, the Tallahatchie River, and after actually \nbludgeoning his eyes out, they threw him in the river, and his body was \nlater discovered. His mother was so shocked, and the country was so \nshocked by what happened, that it instigated a movement in the country. \nMuch of the movement led to the civil rights movement.\n  But the one thing that happened that his mother did that made a \ndifference for many of us who are alive today was she allowed him to \nhave an open casket so that the world could see the horrors of \ninvidious segregation.\n\n  In 1955, what happened, his death, led to the passage of the Emmett \nTill Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. His death in 1955 led to \nthe passage of this act in 2007. It was introduced by Congressman John \nLewis, and it authorizes $13.5 million annually, over a 10-year period, \nfor Federal investigations of civil rights violations resulting in \ndeath prior to 1970.\n  However, it is interesting to note, and I hope that all within the \nsound of my voice will hear this, the bill has never been funded. The \nbill has never been funded.\n  The next site that we shall visit will be the National City Lines, \nand we will talk about bus No. 2857 in Montgomery, Alabama. The time of \nthe Montgomery Bus Boycott was 1955 through 1956. It lasted 381 days. \nThis bus boycott took place because of invidious discrimination alleged \nand occurring--excuse me, because it actually happened--against Ms. \nRosa Parks.\n  Ms. Parks was a passenger on the bus and was required to give up her \nseat, which she refused to do not because she was tired of working, but \nbecause she was tired of invidious discrimination, if you will. She was \ntired of having to surrender her seat to persons simply because of her \nhue, the hue of her skin, so she refused to get up from her seat, and \nher actions started a boycott that lasted 381 days.\n  But there was also a lawsuit that was filed, Browder v. Gayle, and \nthat lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme Court. The boycott and the \nlawsuit complemented each other.\n  Many times you need the protest movement to let those who are in \npower know that you are not satisfied with your circumstances, and they \nprotested for the 381 days. The Supreme Court ruled, and they ruled \nthat this type of segregation was unconstitutional. As a result, Dr. \nKing became very prominent in the country. Ms. Rosa Parks, of course, \ndid, as well as Reverend Abernathy.\n  Another site, the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, and \nJanuary 10, 1957, was the date the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference was born at this church. This church was a church home of \nmany of the civil rights leaders that participated in many of the \nboycotts that took place. It was after the successful Montgomery Bus \nBoycott that Dr. King invited other leaders to associate themselves \nwith him and the civil rights movement at this church. The church \nbecame a national historic site in 1980.\n  Another site that we should remember in memorializing and making note \nof historic places that are a part of hallowed grounds for African \nAmericans would be Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, \nArkansas.\n  September 1957, this was the date that a desegregation effort took \nplace, and there was much resistance to this desegregation. This \noccurred 3 years after the ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. There \nwere nine young children who tried to attend this all-White Little Rock \nCentral High School, and these nine young children were accosted; they \nwere threatened.\n  The violence that you could see on the faces of the persons who did \nnot want innocent children in their school is something that you will \nremember. If ever you have an opportunity to review some of the old \nnews reels, you can see the anger that I speak of. President Eisenhower \nended up having to use Federal troops to desegregate this school. The \nevent was heavily televised, and the news stories are available for \nthose who would like to see.\n  Another site would be the Woolworth's Store, the five-and-dime, in \nGreensboro, North Carolina. This was the place where four young Black \nmales decided that they were going to have a sit-in.\n  Sit-in simply means that they were going to either be served, or they \nwould sit there until they were served or removed.\n  These students showed the kind of resistance that inspired others \naround the country to take up the same cause, to decide that they too \nwould engage in sit-ins. While this was not the first sit-in, it is one \nof the most famous, if not the most famous sit-in, and the Woolworth's \nStore was finally desegregated in 1965.\n  Hallowed grounds.\n  Another site to remember is the Birmingham jail in Birmingham, \nAlabama. April 16, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King wrote his ``Letter from \nBirmingham Jail,'' one of the most celebrated pieces of literary \nhistory. This letter has been studied by historians and is considered \none of his most important works.\n  He, in this letter, defines the nonviolent civil rights movement. It \nwas this letter that was published in the Liberation Magazine in June \nof 1963 that led many people to understand the horrors of the civil \nrights movement, the horrors that civil rights workers suffered during \nthe civil rights movement, and some of the suffering that people were \nenduring who were living under segregation.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Another site to remember would be the Lincoln Memorial on the \nNational Mall in Washington, D.C. August 28 of 1963 is when Dr. King \ngave his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech.\n  This march was one of the most successful in the country's history. \n200,000 to 300,000 people attended. This march helped to popularize the \nmovement and support necessary for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  Another site to remember as we review hallowed grounds, sites of \nAfrican American memories, would be the 16th Street Baptist Church. On \nSeptember 15 of 1963, a dastardly terrorist act occurred right here in \nthe United States of America in Birmingham, Alabama.\n  Terrorists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church, killing 4 young \ngirls, and 22 others were wounded. The church was repaired and reopened \non June 7 of 1964. In 1980, it was added to the National Registry as a \nhistorical place.\n  Another site of hallowed grounds is the Edmond Pettus Bridge. Much is \nalways talked about when we talk about hallowed grounds with respect to \nthe Edmund Pettus Bridge because, on March 7, 1965, about 600 peaceful \nprotesters were attacked and assaulted by the constabulary.\n  They were beaten back to the place where they started their march. \nThe Honorable John Lewis was a member of this group of persons, \npeaceful protesters, who wanted to march from Selma to Montgomery. This \nviolence against the marchers was televised.\n  One of the things that we have noticed as we reviewed these sites and \nthese incidents, these atrocities, is that television helped to change \nthe American psyche because people had an opportunity by way of \ntelevision to see what others were actually experiencing, very much \nakin to what we are seeing now with cell phones and some of the things \nthat are happening to persons at the hands of the constabulary.\n  Much of what people would say others did not believe. But when you \nhave\n\n[[Page H947]]\n\nthe actual pictures to see the representation by way of pictures, it \ncan make a difference in the psyche of people.\n  As a result of this march, many having suffered, we found that the \ncivil rights law of 1965 was passed. This was done because people \nsuffered and because the Edmund Pettus Bridge became a place for us to \nmemorialize as hallowed grounds.\n  Moving forward, the civil rights acts, many of them--the history of \nthose who were able to accomplish things by way of the courts is all \npredicated upon a lot of suffering that took place in this country. Too \nmany people suffered so that I could have the opportunity to be here \ntonight to talk about these hallowed grounds.\n  I feel that it is my duty to do this. I know that talking about these \nthings can create a good deal of discomfort for people. We ought to \nfeel a certain amount of discomfort because what happened was, without \nquestion, something that this country should never want to see happen \nagain and should never have happened ever to anyone.\n  But we must remember our history just as we are going to remember \nPearl Harbor, just as we are going to remember 9/11, and just as we are \ngoing to remember World Wars I and II.\n  We have to remember the history in this country, the atrocities that \noccurred against African Americans as they were trying their very best \nto live peaceful lives. Hallowed grounds, the sites of African American \nmemories.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for the time tonight to bring up \nthese hallowed grounds and to talk about Black History Month, \nespecially as it relates to some of the things that happened in this \ncountry.\n  But I also want to say this, Mr. Speaker. Notwithstanding all of the \nthings that I have said and all of the memories that I have recounted, \nit is important for us to note that the country has truly come a long \nway.\n  I still contend that, notwithstanding all of the atrocities, this is \na great place for Americans of all hues to find their way in the world.\n  This is a special country. I love my country, but I don't forget the \nthings that happened in my country to cause us to memorialize certain \nplaces as hallowed ground.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/house-section/article/H947-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR \n           THEIR SELFLESS RECOVERY EFFORTS IN NORTHEAST TEXAS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
