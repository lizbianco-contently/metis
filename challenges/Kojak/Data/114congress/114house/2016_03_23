Mr. Speaker, Nick Castle was a bright, energetic \n23-year-old who decided to teach in China, following his graduation \nfrom UC Berkeley.\n  Tragically, Nick became seriously sick after becoming a Peace Corps \nvolunteer in China in 2012. He was the victim of an inefficient, under-\nequipped, and unresponsive Peace Corps-led medical team there.\n  After being prescribed a broad antibiotic, Nick began to experience \ndrastic weight loss, but was told he was fine. He was then confined to \nbed, but his doctor never recommended he go to the hospital.\n  After experiencing dangerously low blood pressure, Nick was finally \nsent to the hospital. As the ambulance made its way to him, it got \nlost. Then, after picking him up, Nick stopped breathing before the \nambulance arrived at the hospital. Nick died a few weeks later, in \nearly 2013.\n  Investigations revealed the Peace Corps medical team misdiagnosed his \nillness. This heartbreaking death of a young man serving our country \nand the world could have been avoided had the Peace Corps staff \nassisted in having a properly trained, equipped, and responsive team.\n  Mr. Speaker, Peace Corps volunteers are America's angels abroad. They \nare some of the best that we have. They are the spirit of humanitarian \nassistance, and America must make sure to take care of these amazing \npeople when they serve in lands far, far away so that there are no more \ndeaths like Nick Castle's.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n[[Page H1556]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1556-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       CRISIS IN FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the ongoing crisis in my hometown of Flint, \nMichigan, is a real tragedy. This failure of government has affected \n100,000 people--adults and children--who, after months and months, \nstill do not have clean drinking water.\n  It is my view that the State of Michigan bears the principal \nresponsibility for this crisis and should step up and do more. It was \nthe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality that failed to a great \nextent.\n  I know there are Members who share my view that there is \nresponsibility at every level of government. We could argue about how \nwe apportion that responsibility, but in the meantime, people in Flint \nstill can't drink the water, and they need help. They deserve help from \nthe State and from the Federal Government. They are citizens of \nMichigan, but also citizens of the United States, who are facing a \ndisaster, a crisis, and have every right to expect that their \ngovernment will step in to help them, especially when it is clear that \nit was the government that made the decisions that led to this crisis.\n  So I ask that we not recess until we take up legislation to provide \ndirect help to the city of Flint. It is something that I think is our \nmoral responsibility. It is unconscionable that we would leave this \nbody without acting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1556-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR V.

Mr. Speaker, today the High Court is \nconsidering the Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, a most important \ncase regarding religious liberty and the First Amendment.\n  The Little Sisters of the Poor is a religious institution dedicated \nto assisting the elderly poor, but an unfair and unjust dilemma has \nbeen forced upon them. They must choose whether to violate their \nreligious beliefs by complying with the HHS mandate or pay massive \nfines.\n  The government cannot compel people to violate their conscience and \ntheir religious faith. But today we are watching the government force \npeople to choose between their faith or a government decree. To place \ncitizens of this country in this inescapable position is not only \nreprehensible, but also a direct violation of the Free Exercise Clause \nof the First Amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I pray that the Court be granted the wisdom and \ndiscernment necessary to resolve this case in support of religious \nliberty and conscience rights. People must not be forced by the \ngovernment to violate their faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1556-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LATIN EXPRESS BAND 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a legend since 1976 on \nthe Dallas-Fort Worth music scene. The Latin Express Band is \ncelebrating its 40th anniversary.\n  The Latin Express Band, founded by Carlos and Leo Saenz, comes a long \nway from their humble roots of playing high school dances. Over the \npast 40 years, they have played in music venues throughout the Dallas-\nForth Worth metroplex and the country. In 2001, they were one of the \nmusic groups invited to perform at the Presidential Inaugural Ball. \nThey were recently inducted into the Tejano R.O.O.T.S. Hall of Fame in \n2008.\n  Along with their musical accolades, the Latin Express Band has \ninspired future generations of local musicians through their support of \nmusic education for children, youth, and adults.\n  On March 31st, the Saenz brothers will perform at Forth Worth's \nhistoric Casa Manana Theatre in honor of Cesar Chavez' birthday. Carlos \nand Leo have come a long way from their days playing at Sadie Hawkins \ndances back in the day, and I am honored to recognize their \nachievements.\n  Congratulations to the Latin Express Band.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1556-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n\n  (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the decision by the \nU.S. Supreme Court earlier this week regarding the Second Amendment.\n  By overturning the decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, the \nCourt has reaffirmed not only that Americans have the right to self-\ndefense, but also that stun guns are covered under the Second \nAmendment.\n  The case began when a woman named Jaime Caetano was continually \nthreatened by an abusive ex-boyfriend who, at one point, put her in the \nhospital. At the urging of a friend, she began carrying a stun gun for \nprotection.\n  After an incident that a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend \nfailed to prevent, the threat of a nonlethal device prevented any harm \nof Ms. Caetano. Yet, Massachusetts had previously outlawed the \nownership of stun guns, and she was arrested.\n  Massachusetts' highest court sided against the Supreme Court's Heller \ndecision, which set clear standards for the Second Amendment. The \nSupreme Court Justices clearly saw the foolishness in the State court's \ndecision and reversed it this week, reasserting that the right to bear \narms ``extends to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even \nthose that were not in existence'' when our Nation was founded.\n  This is a reminder that the rights of all Americans must be defended \nvigilantly by every generation. I commend the Supreme Court for its \ndecision and Justice Alito for his concurring opinion that gives \nindividuals in all States a necessary nonlethal option for protection \nagainst violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1556-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF CONXITA MARTORELL CARRION\n\n  (Mr. GUTIERREZ asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a great woman of \nPuerto Rico, Conxita Martorell Carrion. Along with my wife Soraida and \nmy family, we are deeply saddened by her loss.\n  Conxita was raised in Barcelona, but truly adopted Puerto Rico as her \nhomeland. She loved Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans like few people I \nhave ever met. From the beaches to the narrow streets of Old San Juan, \nthe island was deeply loved by Conxita.\n  Conxita and Richard raised a beautiful family, but what I remember \nmost about her is her passion and compassion for her adopted island \nhome, and especially how she donated her time and love to shelter \nabused and battered girls.\n  She is in the thoughts and prayers of all Puerto Ricans.\n  And now, just a line or two in Spanish.\n  (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)\n  Mr. Speaker, my wife and our daughters will deeply miss the great \ngenerosity and welcoming spirit Conxita Carrion shared with our family. \nHere in the House I wanted to offer my humble thanks and my sincerest \ncondolences to her husband Richard and their family.\n  Sr. Presidente, mi esposa y nuestras hijas profundamente extranaran \nla gran generosidad y el espiritu acogedor que Conxita Carrion \ncompartio con nuestra familia.\n  Aqui, en la camara quisiera ofrecer mi humilde agradecimiento y mis \nmas sinceras condolencias a su marido Richard y a su familia.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

If you live in Branch County, you know Mary. \nShe is family.\n  Over the last 40 years, Mary has spent countless hours volunteering \nat\n\n[[Page H1557]]\n\nthe Community Health Center of Branch County. She also helped lead the \neffort to restore the beautiful Tibbits Opera House, and is a \npassionate advocate for this iconic theater.

Res. 658\n\n       Whereas, on March 22, 2016, at least three Islamist \n     terrorists conducted coordinated attacks against two sites in \n     Brussels, Belgium, resulting in the loss of more than 30 \n     innocent lives and the severe wounding of many more innocent \n     civilians;\n       Whereas a number of American citizens are among those \n     wounded;\n       Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has \n     claimed responsibility for the attacks;\n       Whereas the brutal attacks at the Brussels airport and the \n     Maelbeek metro station are the latest in a series of assaults \n     by ISIS in Europe, including the November 13, 2015, terrorist \n     attacks in Paris, France, that were deliberately aimed at \n     killing and maiming as many innocent people as possible;\n       Whereas Belgian first responders and law enforcement \n     reacted swiftly and heroically, caring for the wounded and \n     taking immediate measures to prevent additional attacks and \n     the further loss of life;\n       Whereas at least two of the terrorists were killed in the \n     suicide bombings, and Belgian intelligence and law \n     enforcement are pursuing others possibly connected to these \n     attacks and to those in Paris;\n       Whereas Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called the \n     attacks ``a black moment'' for the country and urged his \n     fellow citizens to stay united in their response;\n       Whereas Belgium and its capital Brussels are the symbolic \n     center of the alliance between the United States and Europe \n     that was created following the devastation of World War II, \n     including by hosting on its territory the headquarters of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the \n     institutions of the European Union;\n       Whereas Belgium and the United States have maintained \n     strong ties based on shared values since Belgium's \n     independence in 1831;\n       Whereas Belgium was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and \n     has been a steadfast ally of the United States in the decades \n     since;\n       Whereas, on September 12, 2001, for the first time in the \n     history of the Alliance, Belgium joined our NATO allies to \n     invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty that states \n     ``an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or \n     North America shall be considered an attack against them \n     all'';\n       Whereas Belgium has been a steadfast partner of the United \n     States in the international effort to defeat ISIS and other \n     terrorist threats;\n       Whereas the coordination of these attacks, following the \n     terrorist assaults in Paris and in several other countries, \n     demonstrates that ISIS members continue to plan and execute \n     attacks, targeting United States interests and allies;\n       Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation, \n     law enforcement engagement, and information sharing on \n     emerging threats and identified Islamist extremists is \n     essential to enhancing security for the people of the United \n     States, Europe, and our allies around the world;\n       Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Brussels strengthens \n     our resolve to defeat ISIS and its terrorist affiliates which \n     pose a growing threat to international peace and stability; \n     and\n       Whereas we stand in solidarity with our Belgian allies in \n     their time of national mourning, ready to provide assistance \n     in bringing to justice all those involved with the planning \n     and execution of these attacks, as well as identifying and \n     disrupting any plans to undertake similar assaults in the \n     future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks \n     in Brussels on March 22, 2016, which murdered more than 30 \n     innocent people, and severely wounded many more;\n       (2) expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences for \n     those killed and injured in the attacks and for their \n     families and friends;\n       (3) pledges support for the Government of Belgium in its \n     efforts to bring to justice all those involved with the \n     planning and execution of these terrorist attacks;\n       (4) declares that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n     (ISIS) poses a fundamental threat to the universal value of \n     freedom in all countries;\n       (5) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign \n     fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North \n     Africa and the threat posed by these individuals; and\n       (6) expresses its readiness to assist the Government and \n     people of Belgium to respond to the threat posed by ISIS and \n     its terrorist affiliates.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. \n658, condemning the series of terrorist attacks in Belgium carried out \nby Islamic extremists yesterday.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), \nchairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution, \ncondemning the terrorist attacks in Brussels carried out by Islamist \nextremists yesterday.\n  ISIS terrorists have once again struck in Europe, and this time in \nBelgium. The murderers coldly chose crowded areas at the Brussels \nAirport and at the metro system in order to kill and maim as many \ninnocent men, women, and children as possible. And the latest numbers \nare 31 dead and 270 wounded, including a number of Americans.\n  ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, the latest in a \nseries that includes an horrific attack in Brussels, the attack in \nParis, a double suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, and the boast of \nresponsibility for downing a Russian passenger jet in Egypt's Sinai \nPeninsula. The list of atrocities is far\n\n[[Page H1558]]\n\nlonger, including those by ISIS affiliates elsewhere, such as the \nrecent attack in Ivory Coast.\n  As these and other assaults show, ISIS is rapidly expanding its reach \nbeyond its bases in Syria and in Iraq. Over 30,000 fighters from more \nthan 100 countries have joined ISIS, including more than 250 Americans. \nWe had a young Yazidi girl tell us that she was taken as a concubine by \none of these Americans who had been recruited 4 years ago on the \nInternet by ISIS.\n  More than 4,500 of this terrorist diaspora hold Western passports and \nare but a plane ride away, a plane ride away from the United States and \nfrom Europe.\n  This resolution puts the House on record as condemning the attacks in \nBrussels and extends our sympathies to those affected by this tragedy, \nand it reaffirms our support for the people of Belgium in their time of \nnational anguish.\n  But we must do more than just express our sorrow. We must take \ndecisive action to eliminate the threat, including expanding \ninformation-sharing with our friends and allies, putting stronger \nborder checks in place, combating the online propaganda and hate speech \nof ISIS extremists, and sharpening coalition efforts to destroy ISIS \nitself.\n  I will remind the Members that our committee, the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, has held a series of hearings on this. When ISIS came out of \nRaqqa in the first place and headed towards the border and headed \ntowards Fallujah, that was the time to hit this so-called JV team.\n  This group of guys in pickup trucks, as the President called them at \nthe time, were an open target on the open desert as they headed to \nFallujah and, after that, as they headed to city after city after city \nwithout us using our airpower to hit them early on. They finally took \nMosul and, with it, they took the Central Bank of Iraq.\n  At this point, they have to be destroyed, and it is going to take a \nstrategic plan to make certain the United States leads in that effort. \nWe need to get it done.\n  Mr. KEATING. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 658, a resolution \ncondemning yesterday's tragic attack in Brussels, Belgium.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Texas, Judge Ted Poe, chairman \nof the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, on which I \nserve as the ranking member, in expressing my deepest condolences to \nthe victims, families, and loved ones of those affected by yesterday's \nbrutal attacks.\n  The resolution before us today strongly condemns the terrorist \nattacks perpetrated in Brussels yesterday and expresses the sympathy of \nthe House of Representatives for the people of Belgium. With the \nstrength of the U.S. intelligence community, we pledge our support for \nthe Belgian Government in its efforts to investigate and to bring to \njustice all those involved with the planning and execution of these \ndeadly plans.\n  Belgium remains one of our strongest allies, a nation with which we \nhave worked closely in bilateral and multilateral arenas. Belgium was \non our side as an active participant in the International Security \nAssistance Force in Afghanistan, as a leader in the European Union \nmission in Mali, and as an ally in the 2010-2011 NATO operations in \nLibya.\n  As host of the European Union and NATO headquarters, Belgium--\nBrussels, in particular--represents both a symbolic and a concrete role \nin promoting transatlantic cooperation between our two countries and \nour allies.\n  It is not by accident that the Maelbeek metro station and the \nBrussels Airport were selected as the site for such heinous violence. \nNearby, a mere stone's throw from the Maelbeek station, sits the \nheadquarters of the European Union and numerous government offices, \nincluding the U.S. Embassy, which is less than a mile away.\n  Daily, hundreds, if not thousands of civil servants and public \ninterest sector workers cross through the station on the way back and \nforth to work. And at Brussels Airport, dozens of innocent travelers \nand family members were drawn into a bloodshed that has spread from \nIraq and Syria to the surrounding region and beyond.\n  I visited both while in Europe last year on a security codel, and I \nsaw, firsthand, the strong police presence providing a sense of \nsecurity for Brussels residents and visitors.\n  Due to the bravery, courage, and preparedness of Belgian law \nenforcement authorities and emergency response teams, many families \nwere spared the pain of losing a loved one. And we honor, today, their \nquick action and their bravery.\n  These terrorist attacks are misguided attempts to divide the global \ncoalition that has come together to degrade and defeat ISIS and their \naffiliates. From Ankara, to Istanbul, to Beirut, to Baga, we recognize \nthat the prominent sentiment across the Middle East identifies ISIS \nrhetoric and actions as contrary to the tolerance and teachings of \nIslam.\n  While this remains an open investigation, the nature of yesterday's \nattacks hit close to home. Whether it is New York City, San Bernardino, \nor whether it is Boston--where I saw, firsthand, the resilience in \nspirit come forward that any physical attack can never conquer--we see \nthat same spirit and resolve in the people of Brussels and Belgium \ntoday.\n  The flow of foreign fighters, the traveling that they do, and the \nextenuating threat that they pose have been our top security-related \nconcerns here in Congress. Congress and the administration have taken \nactions to address these issues and prevent the risk of such an attack \nhere at home. We have tightened security restrictions for travelers \nfrom visa waiver countries who are known to have traveled to Iraq and \nSyria. We have sealed intelligence-sharing gaps between Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement, as well as our international partners in the \nintelligence community. And we are in the process of an unprecedented \ntop-to-bottom review of airport security threats that will ensure our \nairports are safer than ever.\n  The international community, including governments and prominent \norganizations throughout the Middle East and Muslim-majority nations, \nhave spoken out against these heinous attacks. With passage of this \nresolution, the U.S. Congress joins these communities around the world \nin its condemnation of the terrorist attacks yesterday in Brussels.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKeating) for his comments, for his support of this legislation, and \nalso for the privilege to work with him on our Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, where we have had numerous \nhearings on the issue of ISIS and other terrorist groups that are \nlurking throughout the United States and the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, the attacks began shortly before 8 a.m., with an \nexplosion at a departure terminal at the Brussels Airport. The area was \nbetween two American airlines--American Airlines and Delta Air Lines--\nAmerican companies. It was believed to be a luggage bomb, followed by \nanother bomb shortly thereafter.\n  Then, at 9:11 a.m., Brussels time, a bomb tore through the last car \nof a subway train as it was pulling out of a station in central \nBrussels.\n  Belgian officials have said that the bombings killed at least 10 at \nthe airport and at least 20 at the subway station. More than 230 others \nwere wounded. Details are still surfacing, but we now know that at \nleast 10 Americans were wounded in the attacks. One of those was a \nmember of the United States Air Force.\n  Later in the afternoon, a news agency affiliated with ISIS issued a \nreport bragging and claiming responsibility for the murders. Reports \nsaid that the attacks were in retaliation for Belgium's participation \nin a coalition against ISIS.\n  Mr. Speaker, ISIS, this group that is relatively new in the terrorist \nindustry, has already committed 70 terrorist attacks worldwide in 20 \ncountries, as of January 1 of this year, and yet this is one more. \nThese attacks in Belgium occurred just 4 days after the capture of one \nof Europe's most wanted terrorists,\n\n[[Page H1559]]\n\nSalah Abdeslam, the sole survivor of the 10 men who carried out the \nNovember horrific attacks in Paris that killed 130 people.\n  The attacks in Belgium made it clear to all that ISIS still maintains \noperational networks in Europe, capable of carrying out attacks abroad, \neven as security services are on highest alert. The bombing in downtown \nBrussels occurred just steps away from major institutions, as the \nranking member, Mr. Keating, has pointed out.\n  Brussels is the capital of Belgium. It is the headquarters of the \nEuropean Union. It is the headquarters of NATO. This bombing attack \noccurred near the U.S. Embassy that is there. This area, Brussels, \nBelgium, stands and represents, really, the free world's endeavor to \nwork together under democracy and liberty and those ideals that we \nvalue. It was no accident that Brussels was picked for the attack.\n  The fact that ISIS could operate cells in Europe and manage to strike \nat the heart of European society only a few months after the Paris \nattacks should make us cognizant that our current strategy against ISIS \nis really not successful. ISIS has been able to hold on to territory \nfor close to 2 years. It is from this territory in Iraq and Syria that \nit trains its fighters, recruits foreigners, and plans to launch \nattacks against not only Europe, but other countries, like the United \nStates.\n  Words claiming progress and success against ISIS are meaningless when \nconfronted with devastating carnage like what we saw in the United \nStates, in San Bernardino, and what occurred in Paris and now in \nBrussels. The United States must change its strategy against ISIS. We \nmust allow ISIS no safe haven anywhere in the world. We must take away \ntheir capabilities to strike American cities.\n  This resolution shows that the people of the United States stand \nalongside our European and Belgian allies in solidarity. The American \npeople extend their deepest sympathies to those affected by the \ntragedy. Let the people of Belgium know that the United States will \nsupport them through this time in every way possible, and we must be \nmore united in the face of this terrorist onslaught that threatens the \nvery freedoms that we hold dear.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my colleague and fellow New Englander.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank both the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from \nTexas for their extraordinary leadership on this important resolution.\n  Yesterday, the world saw the face of evil in a series of cowardly and \ndespicable terrorist acts that claimed the lives of 34 innocent people \nin Brussels.\n  I, too, extend my thoughts and prayers to all of the families \naffected by this horrific violence.\n  At the same time, Mr. Speaker, here in Congress, we must renew our \ncommitment to keep Americans safe from terrorism, continue to support \nour intelligence services and law enforcement agencies in their \ncritical work, and do all that is necessary to defeat and destroy these \nterrorists wherever they are.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Today the United States and the entire world are standing shoulder to \nshoulder with the people of Belgium. The ISIS terrorists who \nperpetrated these attacks did so in an attempt to strike fear into the \nheart of anyone who does not share their radical world views.\n  We have seen these same tactics tried before in our own country: in \nSan Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, the Pentagon, the World Trade \nCenter, and in a field in Pennsylvania.\n  But for each time they have tried, terrorists have failed to shake \nthe resolve of those they have targeted, and we will not allow them to \nsucceed this time.\n  The motto of the country of Belgium is ``eendracht maakt macht,'' \n``unity makes strength.'' Let there be no doubt.\n  We stand today united and strong with the people of Belgium. We will \ndo whatever it takes, no matter how long it takes, to help Brussels \nrebuild and to bring all those responsible to justice.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Engel), the ranking member of the full committee.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts and \nthe gentleman from Texas. I am pleased to join with them on this \nmatter. I am pleased to support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, we are sending a clear message \nthat we stand with the people of Belgium. Like my colleagues and like \nso many around the world, I am angry, I am outraged, and I am deeply, \ndeeply saddened by the terrorist attacks that ripped through Brussels \nyesterday.\n  My heart goes out to those whose loved ones were killed or injured, \nand I am mindful there are families here in the United States that have \nbeen directly touched by this violence and that we are still uncertain \nhow many Americans are themselves victims.\n  For me, as a New Yorker, let me speak personally because September \n11, 2001, is a scar and a stain that will never go away as long as I \nlive and as long as other New Yorkers live.\n  We know how it feels when hatred and violence take aim at our home. \nWe know what it feels like when innocent people are killed by pure \nevil. So today we grieve with our brothers and sisters in Belgium.\n  But in the midst of grief, we cannot lose focus on our work to stop \nthis kind of violence. We need to stand with our Belgian friends not \njust in spirit, but in action, to figure out who was responsible for \nthese attacks, how they were able to carry them out, and what it will \ntake to hold them accountable.\n  We need to look for new areas for collaboration in terms of \nprevention, surveillance, and information sharing. Along with our \ncoalition partners, we need to press ahead in our effort to destroy \nISIS, which has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attacks.\n  How horrific, the thought that human life is so worthless to these \nterrorists. It is just absolutely amazing that they claim to be \nreligious people but, instead, they are pure evil.\n  ISIS terrorists and other violent extremists target democratic \nsocieties because they want to shatter our spirit and force us to live \nin fear. We will not allow them to succeed.\n  Going forward, we will work with our Belgian partners and our other \nallies to move past this tragedy to fight terrorism, to enhance \nsecurity, and to promote justice and democracy around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same. Again, I commend my good colleagues from Massachusetts and \nTexas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers and just will \nbriefly close.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague from Texas.\n  In a Congress that is often divided, we speak as one. In a country \nthat is sometimes divided, today we speak as one. With the citizens of \nthe world who value freedom and abhor violence and value human life, we \nspeak as one.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I thank \nagain the ranking member of our full committee as well as the chair of \nthe full committee for joining with us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, our hearts do go out to the people of Brussels and the \npeople who were killed and their families that are throughout the \nworld, including those that are injured from the United States. We \ncannot bring back those lives from yesterday, but we can do something \nabout the murder that occurred yesterday in Brussels.\n  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the ISIS terror network is \nsuccessful. ISIS exists for one reason, to murder people and, because \nof that murder and violence that they incur, to scare and to bring fear \nand terror to countries that are attacked by ISIS.\n  As I mentioned earlier, they have committed terror attacks in now 20 \ncountries. To some extent, it seems to me that it is working because \nevery time there is a terrorist attack, free\n\n[[Page H1560]]\n\npeople react in the sense that we find more security.\n  I am concerned that we are getting into the bunker mentality, people \nafraid to go anyplace and afraid to leave. Why? Because some terrorist \nattack may occur.\n  It is obvious that we need to react to the crimes and these murders \nas a people that are affected by it. But we can't just be defensive \nagainst ISIS and other terrorist organizations. We can't just defend \nourselves.\n  We have to eliminate ISIS. They are at war with the world and people \nwho don't agree with them. They are at war. Now, we probably need to \nunderstand that their goal is to not only kill and maim, but to cause \nfear--fear--individual fear. They use every possible way they can do \nit, from social media to bragging about the murders on YouTube.\n  So we, as a people, need to understand that we are going to have to \neliminate ISIS. We are going to have to track them down, go get them, \nand eliminate them. You can't negotiate with these people. That is out \nof the question.\n  So we either just react and try to defend ourselves when they commit \ncrimes or we go after them. So I hope that the United States presents a \nbetter strategy and lets those folks know that, to just kill anybody \nthat disagrees with ISIS, their days are numbered because we are going \nto go eliminate them. We have to.\n  Because they have attacked us, our response must be more than \ndefensive. We must be offensive. We must let them know: you can't do \nthis. You can't kill people because you don't like them, no matter \nwhere that occurs in the world.\n  So I would hope that the United States, with our partners in other \ncountries, finds an overall strategy that is successful and that \neliminates these people who kill because of a perverted sense of their \nreligion.\n  But today we do mourn the loss and we show the support of our country \nwith our neighbors across the seas for the crimes that have been \ncommitted against them.\n  As the ranking member has pointed out, this is an issue that is \ntotally supported by both sides of the House. The Foreign Affairs \nCommittee works together on almost all issues, and this is another \nexample of that.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise n strong support of H. Res. 658 \nand in remembrance of the innocent victims who lost their lives, and \nthose who were seriously injured, this morning in the barbaric attacks \nperpetrated by terrorists in Brussels, Belgium.\n  Our hearts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the \nvictims and our thanks and appreciation go to the first responders who \nselflessly came to the aid of their fellow members of the human family.\n  Brussels will emerge from today's attacks stronger than ever and more \nfirmly committed to the values and principles that have made it so \ngreat.\n  And as Brussels recovers and responds, I hope its people take comfort \nin the certain knowledge that the people of the United States stand in \nsolidarity with them.\n  Today's attacks are a reminder of the common danger the free, \ndemocratic, and peace loving nations of the world face from those who \nreject the norms of civilized society and abuse the liberties and \nfreedoms afforded them by free societies.\n  Those responsible for today's crime against humanity should make no \nmistake; they will be held to account in this life and the next.\n  But today our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Brussels, \nwhich represents everything terrorists despise: a symbol of the modern \nworld where persons of differing faiths, creeds, races, and cultures \nlive together in peace, harmony, and freedom.\n  That symbol is recognizable to Americans because it also represents \nthe American heart and spirit.\n  The terrorist attacks in Brussels were horrific acts on innocent \ncivilians perpetrated by depraved individuals who misuse the peaceful \nreligion of Islam for their own misguided purposes.\n  Their horrible and heinous acts are their responsibility, and theirs \nalone, and for which they can be assured that they alone will be held \naccountable.\n  But that will come another day; today I ask a moment of silence for \nthe victims killed and injured in the terrorist attacks in Brussels.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) that the House suspend the rules and \nagree to the resolution, H. Res. 658.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1560-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1560-H1569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSTANDARD MERGER AND ACQUISITION REVIEWS THROUGH EQUAL RULES ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

ACTIONS BY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES \n                   OR THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.\n\n       ``(a) Whenever the Attorney General of the United States \n     has brought an action under the antitrust laws or the Federal \n     Trade Commission has brought an action under section 7, and \n     the Attorney General or Federal Trade Commission, as \n     applicable, has reason to believe that any State attorney \n     general would be entitled to bring an action under this Act \n     based substantially on the same alleged violation of the \n     antitrust laws or section 7, the Attorney General or Federal \n     Trade Commission, as applicable, shall promptly give written \n     notification thereof to such State attorney general.\n       ``(b) To assist a State attorney general in evaluating the \n     notice described in subsection (a) or in bringing any action \n     under this Act, the Attorney General of the United States or \n     Federal Trade Commission, as applicable, shall, upon request \n     by such State attorney general, make available to the State \n     attorney general, to the extent permitted by law, any \n     investigative files or other materials which are or may be \n     relevant or material to the actual or potential cause of \n     action under this Act.'';\n       (2) in section 5--\n       (A) in subsection (a) by inserting ``(including a \n     proceeding brought by the Federal Trade Commission with \n     respect to a violation of section 7)'' after ``United States \n     under the antitrust laws''; and\n       (B) in subsection (i) by inserting ``(including a \n     proceeding instituted by the Federal Trade Commission with \n     respect to a violation of section 7)'' after ``antitrust \n     laws'';\n       (3) in section 11, by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in enforcing \n     compliance with section 7, the Federal Trade Commission shall \n     enforce compliance with that section in the same manner as \n     the Attorney General in accordance with section 15.\n       ``(2) If the Federal Trade Commission approves an agreement \n     with the parties to the transaction that contains a consent \n     order with respect to a violation of section 7, the \n     Commission shall enforce compliance with that section in \n     accordance with this section.'';\n       (4) in section 13, by inserting ``(including a suit, \n     action, or proceeding brought by the Federal Trade Commission \n     with respect to a violation of section 7)'' before \n     ``subpoenas''; and\n       (5) in section 15, by inserting ``and the duty of the \n     Federal Trade Commission with respect to a violation of \n     section 7,'' after ``General,''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT.\n\n       The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in section 5(b), by inserting ``(excluding the \n     consummation of a proposed merger, acquisition, joint \n     venture, or similar transaction that is subject to section 7 \n     of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18), except in cases where the \n     Commission approves an agreement with the parties to the \n     transaction that contains a consent order)'' after ``unfair \n     method of competition'';\n       (2) in section 9, by inserting after the fourth \n     undesignated paragraph the following:\n\n[[Page H1561]]\n\n       ``Upon the application of the commission with respect to \n     any activity related to the consummation of a proposed \n     merger, acquisition, joint venture, or similar transaction \n     that is subject to section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \n     18) that may result in any unfair method of competition, the \n     district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction \n     to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person or \n     corporation to comply with the provisions of this Act or any \n     order of the commission made in pursuance thereof.''.\n       (3) in section 13(b)(1), by inserting ``(excluding section \n     7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) and section 5(a)(1) with \n     respect to the consummation of a proposed merger, \n     acquisition, joint venture, or similar transaction that is \n     subject to section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18))'' \n     after ``Commission''; and\n       (4) in section 20(c)(1), by inserting ``or under section 7 \n     of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18), where applicable,'' after \n     ``Act,''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on H.R. 2745, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission \nAct, marking the beginning of a dual antitrust enforcement regime in \nthe United States.\n  Because both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission enforce our Nation's antitrust laws, companies may and often \ndo have different experiences when interacting with one agency relative \nto the other.\n  One area in which the disparity can be the most striking and \ntroubling is in the merger review process. When a company wishes to \nmerge with or purchase another company, it must notify both antitrust \nenforcement agencies of the proposed transaction.\n  The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission then \ndetermine which agency will be responsible for reviewing the \ntransaction. As there are no fixed rules for making this determination, \nit can appear that the decision is made on the basis of a flip of the \ncoin.\n  There are two substantive differences that companies face based on \nthe identity of the antitrust enforcement agency that reviews the \ncompany's proposed transaction.\n  The first difference arises if the agency seeks to prevent the \ntransaction by pursuing a preliminary injunction in Federal court. A \ndifferent legal standard is applied to a preliminary injunction request \nbased solely on the identity of the requesting antitrust enforcement \nagency.\n  The second difference lies in the process available to each antitrust \nenforcement agency to prevent a transaction from proceeding. The FTC \nmay pursue administrative litigation against a proposed transaction \neven after a court denies its preliminary injunction request. In \ncontrast, the Department of Justice cannot pursue administrative \nlitigation.\n  There is no justification for these disparities in the merger review \nprocesses and standards. The bipartisan Antitrust Modernization \nCommission recommended that Congress remove these disparities, and the \nbill before us today, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews \nThrough Equal Rules Act, or SMARTER Act, does just that.\n  I applaud Mr. Farenthold of Texas for introducing this important \nlegislation that will enhance the transparency, predictability, and \ncredibility of the antitrust merger review process.\n  By enacting the SMARTER Act into law, Congress will ensure that \ncompanies no longer will be subjected to fundamentally different \nprocesses and standards based on the flip of a coin.\n  Notably, the legislation has garnered the support of former and \ncurrent FTC Commissioners, including former Chairman David Clanton, \nformer Commissioner Josh Wright, and sitting Commissioner Maureen \nOhlhausen.\n  The SMARTER Act is an important step toward ensuring that our \nNation's antitrust laws are enforced in a manner that is fair, \nconsistent, and predictable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this good \ngovernment bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called SMARTER \nAct, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules \nAct, which really should--I mean, it is a misnomer.\n  We should rename this bill. Instead of that, we should rename it the \nSadly More Acronyms for Really Terrible and Esoteric Requirements Act.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  I know a lot of people around the country are wondering: Well, what \nis this all about? It must be important that they are doing this.\n  I will tell you what is important about it. It is a piece of \nlegislation that would impact the largest and most consequential of \ncorporate mergers, of multinational corporate mergers. Those things \nhave to go through a review process with our Federal Trade Commission. \nAlso, the Department of Justice has an antitrust division.\n  What this piece of legislation would do would be to gut one of the \nagency's--the FTC's--ability to oversee and deal with merger review \nissues that affect the largest and most consequential of their mergers, \nof these big corporate mergers.\n  Does this piece of legislation benefit the people? Or does it benefit \nthe 1 percent of large multinational corporations that, I guess, need \nhelp avoiding regulatory authority by our government?\n  Well, it looks like that is what it is. It is something that is going \nto help out big business at a time when people in this country are very \nangry about the fact that the playing field is not level. The \ncorporations and the wealthy have been doing pretty well over the last \ncouple of generations, but people are seeing their wages stand right \nthere where they were. They are working harder, they are more \nproductive, but yet they can't even take a vacation. They can't even \nafford to take a day off to see about a sick child.\n  This is why people are so angry. It is because they look at Congress \nand they see us doing this kind of work benefiting 1 percent of the \nlargest multinational corporations when there are other things like \npassing a budget, dealing with the Zika crisis which is unfolding, \ndealing with the Flint water crisis, dealing with the opioid addiction \ncrisis in this country.\n  We can't even pass a budget. Here we are going to pass the so-called \nSMARTER Act today, and then we are going to go home for almost 3 weeks. \nThey call it a district work period, but it is actually a period where \nfolks are out campaigning, trying to retain their seats. People are \nangry about that.\n  Congress first established the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 to \nsafeguard consumers against anticompetitive behavior by empowering the \nCommission with the authority to enforce, clarify, and develop \nantitrust law. President Woodrow Wilson later described the creation of \nthe Commission as specifically providing for tribunals that would \n``determine what was fair and what was unfair competition; and to \nsupply the business community not merely with lawyers in the Department \nof Justice who could cry, `Stop!', but\n\n[[Page H1562]]\n\nwith men in such tribunals as the Federal Trade Commission who could \nsay, `Go on,' who could warn where things were going wrong and assist \ninstead of check.''\n  Today, under the process of administrative litigation, also known as \npart 3 litigation, the Commission does just that. Under this authority, \nit may seek permanent injunctions in its own administrative court in \naddition to its ability to seek preliminary injunctions in Federal \nDistrict Court. This authority is a unique mechanism that takes \nadvantage of the Commission's longstanding expertise to develop some of \nthe most complex issues in antitrust law.\n  But the SMARTER Act would upend this century of precedent and \nexpertise by creating a uniform standard for preliminary injunctions in \ncases involving significant mergers and other transactions and, \nalarmingly, eliminating the Commission's ability to administratively \nlitigate antitrust cases.\n  Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that divergent standards for \nenjoining mergers may undermine the public's trust in the efficient and \nfair outcome of merger cases. They also state that the outcome of a \ntransaction comes down to a coin flip between the agencies to determine \nwhich will review a transaction. That claim is ridiculous and it is not \nborne out by the evidence.\n  The American Antitrust Institute, a consumer-oriented antitrust \norganization, conducted a lengthy study of workload statistics compiled \nby both antitrust agencies and found that the concerns of the bill's \nsponsors are without foundation.\n  Jonathan Jacobson, a leading antitrust attorney who served on the \nAntitrust Modernization Commission, testified that in his 39 years of \npractice, the outcome of a merger has never turned on the differences \nthat the SMARTER Act seeks to address in antitrust law.\n  Indeed, of the 3 percent of transactions requiring second requests \nfor information from the antitrust agencies, only about 1.5 percent of \nthose cases are stopped or modified. An even smaller percentage of \nthese cases go to trial for an administrative hearing. We should \nhesitate before making wholesale changes to the law based on \ntheoretical concerns involving about 1 percent of mergers, which also \nhappen to be some of the largest and most consequential.\n  In the absence of any meaningful evidence suggesting a material \ndifference in the enforcement of the antitrust laws, it is difficult to \nupending longstanding antitrust practices at the FTC for consistency's \nsake alone based on speculative harms. But even assuming that there are \nmaterial differences in cases brought under these standards, we should \nstrike a balance in favor of competition by lowering the burden of \nproof in cases brought by the Justice Department, not by raising the \nCommission's burden for obtaining preliminary injunctions.\n  Courts already require a lower burden of proof in cases brought by \nthe Commission and Justice Department precisely because both are expert \nagencies equipped with large staffs of economists who analyze numerous \nmergers on a regular basis and who may only bring cases that are in the \npublic interest. To the extent that we should address perceived \ndifferences in the standard for preliminary injunctions in merger \ncases, legislation should favor increased competition, not the \ninterests of merging parties.\n  The SMARTER Act would eliminate the FTC's authority to \nadministratively litigate mergers and other transactions under section \n5(b) of the FTC Act. Leading authorities in antitrust across party \nlines have expressed serious reservations with eliminating the \nCommission's administrative litigation authority.\n  For instance, Bill Kovacic, a former Republican chair of the \nCommission, has referred to this aspect of the bill as ``rubbish,'' \nnoting that the Commission has used administrative litigation to win a \nstring of novel antitrust cases that courts have ultimately upheld \nwhere the ``Commission has had to fight for every single foot along the \nway.''\n  Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the FTC, likewise wrote last \nCongress that eliminating the FTC's administrative litigation authority \nwould ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the FTC.''\n  Mr. Speaker, 2015 was the year of the merger, megamergers, \nmergermania. There was over $3.8 trillion in merger spending, a record \nthat far exceeded expectations. While fewer than 20 percent of mergers \nraise competition concerns, it is clear that a vote for H.R. 2745 is a \nvote for concentrated, private economic power. At a time of increased \nconsolidation in key industries, we can't afford more Republican \nattacks on government, which is what H.R. 2745 is, plain and simple.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold), a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the vice chair of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial, and Antitrust Law.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be here today to be \nthe sponsor of the SMARTER Act.\n  This is just good government. We have a situation now that if you \nwant to merge your company with another company, you could go before \nthe Federal Trade Commission or you could go before the Department of \nJustice.\n  Now, you would think that the Clayton Act that governs antitrust law \nwould say: All right. Well, we are going to get treated the same, no \nmatter which way we go, the law is the law.\n  But that is not how it works. A big piece of this is the procedural \naspect of it. If your merger is reviewed by the Department of Justice \nand they have a problem with it and they need a preliminarily \ninjunction to stop it, they go to Federal Court before a judge, as the \nFounding Fathers intended, the executive branch agency, and there is a \ndispute, and it is litigated in front of a Federal court.\n  But if you go before the Federal Trade Commission, they could go to \nFederal court like the Department of Justice, but they can also go to \ntheir own court. They have got their own court with an FTC employee as \nthe judge. Now, we have got administrative law courts that work, but \nthey can also do both.\n  You have got a situation that the merger could be delayed. In these \nbusiness transactions, as in life, time is money. Just the threat of \ngoing through this administrative process has the effect of giving the \nFTC the ability to extract concessions that the DOJ wouldn't.\n  Look, we need to be treated fairly no matter which agency reviews it. \nThis is the main gist of the SMARTER Act. Let's make it the same if you \ngo to the DOJ or the FTC.\n  This isn't just something that we, Republicans, pulled out of our \nhats. This is a recommendation from the bipartisan Antitrust \nModification Commission. They have testified that this is part of what \nthey think needs to be done to make a better, more efficient \ngovernment.\n  Listen, nobody wants to be tied up in red tape. As you go through a \nmerger and you draw the short straw and end up in front of the FTC, you \nhave got another spool of red tape that you could very possibly get \nrolled up in. I don't think that is fair and I don't think the American \npeople think that is fair.\n  Now, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson), says this guts the antitrust laws. It doesn't. \nIt just makes them fairer. It makes the review the same no matter where \nyou go. It is commonsense, good government.\n  I don't have anything else to say. I don't see how you can be against \nfairness.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the Honorable \nBill Pascrell from New Jersey, who serves on, by the way, the Budget \nand the Ways and Means Committees here in Congress, I would like to \npoint out that we have got a severe problem that we are confronting \nthis morning. It is the big, bad FTC, which is treating the big \nmultinational corporations unfairly. It is abusing them, and something \nneeds to be done. The American people are demanding it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPascrell) so that he can explain further how important this bill is to \nthe American people.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n\n[[Page H1563]]\n\n  This bill is terrible. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with \nprotecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. What I just heard \nfrom the gentleman is that this is all about getting rid of red tape. \nBaloney. This is about money, this is about keeping money in your own \npocket and protecting yourself against the consumers.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Concessions we are talking about here.\n  The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with protecting consumers from \nanticompetitive mergers. That is what the job is. Corporate mergers can \nmake industries more efficient and bring benefits to customers, but in \nsome cases, they have the potential to increase costs and hurt \ncompetition. Mr. Speaker, if you deny that, then you don't have the \nfacts, and I am going to lay them out right now.\n  Government should not be in the business of setting prices for \nhealthcare services or anything else for that matter--for airline \ntickets, cable Internet services, or anything else. I hope we agree on \nthat. That is why we need to rely on robust market competition--to keep \nthe prices of goods and services down and ensure that consumers are \ngetting a fair deal.\n  I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, with due respect, \nthat we are pretty good fans of competition; yet here we are, after \nBloomberg dubbed 2015 the ``Year of the Mergers,'' weakening a key FTC \ntool to ensure healthy competition in a variety of markets.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been particularly concerned with this issue, and \nI mentioned four areas here. I am very, very concerned about the \nmergers we have seen in many sectors of the healthcare industry. Read \nmy lips: look at the facts through the Speaker. In my left hand, a \nrecent report by the Health Care Pricing Project, which was written up \nin The New York Times late last year, found that monopoly hospitals \nhave prices that are 15.3 percent higher than hospitals in an area with \nfour or more hospitals--even after controlling for costs in each area.\n  Don't you really believe in competition, or do you just say that? Is \nthat simply a bumper sticker, a slogan, or do you mean that?\n  Two pending mergers in the insurance industry, between Anthem and \nCigna and Aetna and Humana, set the stage for major consolidation in \nthis industry as well. In other words, what this report did was \nestablish the fact--I hope you are interested in the facts--that the \nreason we have increasing healthcare costs--a major reason--is for the \nmerger and the reduction in competition in health care.\n  Then there are the mergers that are motivated by U.S. tax dodging, \nMr. Speaker, and we have talked about this, which have major \nimplications on competition but also on the United States tax base. One \npending merger would see a major United States company slash its United \nStates tax bill by moving its headquarters overseas and creating the \nlargest drug company in the universe.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Working Americans across the country do not have the \nbenefit of hiring consultants, of shifting their earned income around \nthe globe to find the lowest tax rate. And you are standing there, \nsaying you want to help the consumer? It is just the opposite.\n  Many multinational corporations do just that. Corporate inversions \nallow companies to renege on the obligation to America, eroding the \nUnited States tax base and hurting American competitiveness. Who are \nyou with anyway? If you live in a neighborhood and one house--let's say \nthe biggest house on the block--doesn't pay its property taxes, what \nhappens? Everyone understands that the rest of the houses on the block \nhave to make up the difference.\n  The Treasury has taken steps to address inversions, but it is up to \nCongress to pass legislation that addresses this problem immediately. \nIn the meantime, the bill before us today would weaken the FTC's \nability to monitor and enforce against unfair, anticompetitive mergers, \nand they are all over the place. I blame, partially, the \nadministration, as the former Attorney General did nothing about \nmergers. While people were trying to get him to resign for other \nreasons, that would have been a darned good reason.\n  This is not Republican or Democrat, my friends. These are simply the \nfacts, and I can tell you this one report will very, very much \ncrystallize what those facts are.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from New \nJersey's commitment to the free market, because I think we all believe \na free and fair market is in the best interest of America and in the \nbest interest of every American consumer, but we have got to take a \nlook at the procedure.\n  This is, primarily, procedural in nature so that those companies that \nare seeking mergers, whether they go through the FTC or through the \nDepartment of Justice, are simply treated the same. If the gentleman is \nconcerned about the fact that there are too many mergers--that we are \ngetting bigger and bigger companies and that it is stifling \ncompetition--that is a legitimate conversation for us to have in the \ncontext of changing the law with respect to monopolies, mergers, and \nacquisitions.\n  What we are trying to do here is not change that law, but make that \nlaw fairer and applied equally, regardless of whether one is in front \nof the Department of Justice or whether one is in front of the Federal \nTrade Commission. If the gentleman takes that argument, then he is \nsaying, right now, the FTC has an advantage in stopping these mergers \nbecause it has all of these other procedures in place, as opposed to \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Why should one get stuck with a tougher row to hoe based on which \nagency one goes in front of? That is just not fair.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, what we need to understand is that we are \nnot only talking about the FTC, we are talking about the Justice \nDepartment, which oversees these mergers regardless of whether we are \ntalking about health or airlines, which is a catastrophe. I only \nbrought up health care today. We are having that discussion you just \ntalked about.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, I think the gentleman has a \nproblem with the fact that there are so many mergers and that he thinks \nit is anticompetitive and not good for folks. That is an opinion that \nthe gentleman is, certainly, entitled to, but that is, I think, out of \nthe scope of what this bill is trying to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill takes existing law and says, look, let's apply \nit the same regardless of which agency one is before. I think that is \nthe difference there. I would be happy to meet with the gentleman in \nhis office and see if we can find some ways that we can agree so that \nwe might reform the overall antitrust system.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am mainly concerned about this piece of \nlegislation because you have determined--you have defined--a \nnonexistent problem while applying a less consumer friendly standard. \nThat is my position.\n  What I brought up here is part of the mix. It is putting it in \ncontext as to what has happened. The consequences of what has happened \nare higher prices for us--for you and me--and I know you are concerned \nabout that.\n\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, my point is that, if the \ngentleman thinks we have too many mergers, let's change the law, but \nlet's have a fair procedure. What this bill is designed to do is to \nhave a fair procedure for those who are engaged in that activity.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute \nto the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my friend from \nTexas.\n  We went through a period of time in the first decade of this century \nof U.S.\n\n[[Page H1564]]\n\nprosecutors and attorneys looking at the subject of deferred \nprosecutions. I am talking about justice here. That is the bottom line. \nThat is what we are talking about here.\n  Instead of bringing corporations to trial that had violated the law--\nand I am not an attorney. I am not the reason for two of my sons being \nattorneys, but I am not an attorney--they worked out a proposition. \nThis is what they are trying to do, and this is what this is all about, \nif I could draw a comparison, which is you slap a corporation on the \nwrist, it pays a fine, and the fine becomes the cost of doing business.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is going in the wrong direction. It is attacking a \nproblem that does not exist instead of attacking a problem that does \nexist.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I am anguished in listening to the pleas of my friend from Texas to \nhelp these megamergers, to help these big, multinational corporations. \nThey need us so badly because the big, bad FTC is treating them too \ntough. It is too rough on them. Therefore, we have to make the law \nfairer for them. They have all of these silk stocking lawyers off of \nWall Street, but we need to help them. We are not doing anything else \nhere in Congress other than helping multinational corporations, hearing \nthe plea that these folks need help when it is the folks in Flint, \nMichigan, who need help, who are crying out for help, but their voices \ncan't be heard in this Congress because we are too busy trying to \nprotect these big, multinational corporations.\n  The only thing we want to do, according to my friends, is to \nharmonize the standard of proof between the DOJ and the FTC so that the \nbig, bad corporations which need our help only have to deal with one \nstandard of proof. They are not telling you what they are really \nwanting to do, which is to gut administrative review by the FTC, under \nsection 5(b) of the FTC Act. That is where the real harm comes in, but \nthey don't want to tell you about that. They don't want to let you know \nwhat kind of impact that has when a prescription drug company seeks to \nmerge again with another large company and make a humongous company \nthat is too big to fail and, also, too big to regulate your drug prices \nout there.\n  Why are your drug prices going up? What kind of policies are we \nimplementing here in Congress to protect them? Absolutely none. We are \nmaking it easier for prices to go up with insurance, in the travel \nindustry, in trying to get a hotel. In trying to book a hotel room on \nthe Internet, they have got it all rigged up because there are only a \ncouple of companies you can go through to get the room.\n  These are the policies that are affecting the lives of the people \nwhom we represent. I don't represent many big, multinational \ncorporations. I don't think I have any, as a matter of fact, in my \ndistrict, but I guess there are some folks around here who have a bunch \nof them.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 10 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 20\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, since I have one speaker remaining, I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from the great State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman \nfrom Georgia, and I thank the chairman of the full committee and the \nauthor of this bill.\n  I rise in combination of speaking on this bill, but also offering my \ndeepest sympathy to the people of Brussels, the people of Belgium \nwhich, some would say, is the heart of the civic participation of \nEurope--they are certainly dear friends of the United States--though we \nwould mourn any who have been impacted by the dastardly deeds of \nterrorism.\n  I know in our committee, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Goodlatte are working on \nthese issues. I would hope that we could move the no fly for foreign \nterrorists bill as quickly as possible as we make our way through these \nissues of determining how we disrupt the ideology and then the actions \nthat result in the deaths of innocent persons. So I offer that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am struck by the name of this bill because I don't \nknow who gets smarter. I know that the consumers get poorer and that \nthere are opportunities for victimizing the consumers. This bill does \nnot create equal rules or implement smarter legislation.\n  But if I might take up the comment about the increasing cost of \nprescription drugs, that is clearly a result of not allowing the FTC to \npursue and to proceed because it is our arm of equalizing and balancing \nthe consumer.\n  On this day, when we acknowledge the sixth anniversary of the \nAffordable Care Act that has brought health insurance to 20 million \npeople, we know that what we need to fix is the rising cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  So this bill is about attacking the administrative authority of the \nFederal Trade Commission. It is an unnecessary measure that would \nfundamentally undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and \nability to prevent anticompetitive mergers.\n  As a law student, I remember in my antitrust classes how the FTC was \nhighlighted as one of the anchors of balance and the anchors of \nprotection of innocent civilians.\n  Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of \npower by eliminating the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws \nin larger merger cases and by blocking its ability to use its \nadministrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction.\n  Why is that? The FTC is where you can engage and have discussion. The \nbill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same enforcement \nprocess as the DOJ. There is more ability for the little guy to be \nheard at the FTC.\n  This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative \nlitigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and \neffectively removes a very core and functioning character of the \nagency, lets more people in the door to express themselves for or \nagainst this merger, how it impacts, with less resources needed to get \nin front of an administrative agency than dealing with the Department \nof Justice.\n  Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with \nCongress' intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and \npolicymaking body as a distinct and independent shield from political \nand executive interference.\n  As enforcers of section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and DOJ \nhave the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and \nacquisitions that substantially lessen competition. That saves money \nbecause competition helps save money. These agencies serve to \ncomplement each other. Why make them the same? They are not twins.\n  Based upon historical experience and coordinated development, the FTC \nserves to protect consumers and consumer spending, health care, \npharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, food safety, \namong other things. The DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on \nlarger corporate industries, like telecommunications, banks, railroads, \nand airlines. Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, \nthey work together.\n  Don't take away the consumers' arm. That is the FTC. This bill takes \nit away and puts the little guy under and the big guy up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2745, the Standard \nMerger and Acquisition Reviews through Equal Rules Act--otherwise known \nas the SMARTER Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about creating equal rules or \nimplementing ``smarter'' legislation.\n  Rather, it is about attacking the administrative authority of the \nFederal Trade Commission (FTC).\n  H.R. 2745 is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally \nundermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to \nprevent anti-competitive mergers.\n  As we all know, the FTC was created by Congress with the specific \nintent of creating an independent antitrust enforcement agency and \nsupplemental authority to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n  Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of its \npower by eliminating\n\n[[Page H1565]]\n\nthe agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger \ncases, and by blocking its ability to use its administrative \nproceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction.\n  The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same \nenforcement process as the DOJ.\n  This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative \nlitigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and \neffectively removes the very core and functioning character of this \nagency.\n  Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with \nCongress's intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and \npolicymaking body as distinct and independent shield from political and \nexecutive interference.\n  As enforcers of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and the \nDOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and \nacquisitions that would ``substantially lessen competition'' or ``tend \nto create a monopoly''.\n  Under this enforcement authority, these agencies serve to complement \neach other, and have developed over the years to specialize in \nparticular industries and markets.\n  Based upon historical experience and coordinated developments, the \nFTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending--e.g., \nhealthcare, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, and \ncertain high-tech industries like computer technology and internet \nservices.\n  Whereas, the DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger \ncorporate industries--e.g., telecommunications, banks, railroads, and \nairlines.\n  Thus, while the FTC and the DOJ have operated with a shared \nresponsibility of enforcing federal antitrust laws, these two federal \nagencies are unique and each retain exclusive authority of certain \nconduct.\n  Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, the FTC and \nDOJ rely upon each other to coordinate agency jurisdiction and \nharmonized standards and practices.\n  The SMARTER Act is simply unnecessary as it fails to put forth any \nmeaningful effort to enhance or rectify any expressed concerns \ngoverning these longstanding agency operations.\n  In particular, in 2002 Congress sought to review and amend antitrust \nlaws and policies in light of changing economy and rise in \ntechnological advances.\n  In 2007 a report issued by the Antitrust Modernization Commission \n(AMC) set forth specific recommendations for the FTC to eliminate real \nor perceived disparities in the review process for merger transactions.\n  According to the AMC, Congress should seek to ensure that the same or \ncomparable standard is used when seeking a preliminary injunction \nagainst a potentially anticompetitive transaction.\n  However, the SMARTER Act goes beyond this recommendation and seeks to \nchip away and carve out the entire administrative adjudication \nauthority of the FTC.\n  In order to identify potential violations of the Clayton Act, the FTC \nand the DOJ review proposed merger transactions pursuant to the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the HSR Act), which provides \nadvance notice and sets forth guidelines on large merger and \nacquisition transactions.\n  The heart of this concern is the alternate means in which the FTC and \nthe DOJ carry out their enforcement role during this HSR pre-merger \nprocess.\n  Namely, H.R. 2745 is curiously motivated by the preliminary \ninjunction process utilized by the FTC and the DOJ to halt proposed \ntransactions that would violate the Clayton Act if completed.\n  Additionally, the DOJ typically consolidates the preliminary and \npermanent injunction proceedings, while the FTC typically only pursues \nthe preliminary injunction.\n  While some argue that proposed transactions reviewed through the FTC \nwould be treated more leniently than those reviewed through the DOJ, \nthis assertion was not fully substantiated by the AMC.\n  The pre-merger review process and the injunction standards utilized \nby the FTC and the DOJ are the very procedural steps that characterize \nand distinguish the respective enforcement roles of these agencies.\n  This supposed area of concern addresses only a small fraction of \nproposed transactions, as the vast majority of merger and acquisition \nproposals are found to not be in violation of the Clayton Act during \nthe review process.\n  The FTC and the DOJ review over a thousand merger filings every year.\n  Yet 95% of those merger filings present no competitive issues or \nchallenged transactions.\n  As reported by the American Antitrust Institute (AAI), the overall \nconcerns purported by the bill's sponsors are simply without \nfoundation.\n  In contrast, the overall work of the FTC has an incredible impact on \nAmerican consumers, communities and corporations and will be severely \nimpacted if disrupted.\n  As highlighted by the FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in her testimony \nbefore the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial and Antitrust Law, the FTC prioritizes the protection of \nconsumers and the prevention of anticompetitive market practices.\n  In fact, the FTC exists to ensure fair competition and to prevent \nenormous concentrations of economic power that hurts consumers and \nsmall businesses.\n  For example:\n  In the past year, the FTC has challenged over 28 mergers, (although \nin most it was able to negotiate a remedy to allow the merger to \nproceed).\n  At the consumer level in my home state of Texas, the FTC secured an \n$82,000 settlement against an auto-dealer found in violation of the \nFair Credit Reporting Act in September 2015.\n  Also last year, the FTC ordered the largest divestiture ever in a \nsupermarket merger, requiring Albertsons and Safeway to sell 168 \nsupermarkets in 130 local markets throughout several states, ensuring \nthat communities continue to benefit from competition among their local \nsupermarkets.\n  The FTC has also taken an aggressive stance on stopping \nanticompetitive mergers and conduct in the healthcare market by halting \nsuch practices through administrative litigation.\n  In September 2015, the FTC secured a $1.1 million settlement to \nconsumers who lost money to a health insurance telemarketing scam.\n  And in the last two years, the FTC took action in 13 pharmaceutical \nmergers, ordering divestitures to preserve competition for drugs that \ntreat diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, as well as widely used \ngeneric medications like oral contraceptives and antibiotics.\n  Just last week on March 18, 2016, after a thoroughly vetted \ninvestigation, the FTC approved a final order preserving competition \namong outpatient dialysis clinics in Laredo, Texas.\n  That is, the FTC cleared U.S. Renal Care, Inc.'s (the country's third \nlargest outpatient dialysis provider) $640 million purchase of dialysis \ncompetitor DSI Renal, on the condition that three of DSI's outpatient \nclinics in Laredo, Texas, be handed over to a third party. Absent this \nagreed divestiture, the acquisition would have led to a significant \nincrease in market concentration and anti-competitive effects. The \nlikely result, according to the FTC, would have included the \nelimination of direct competition between U.S. Renal Care and DSI \nRenal, reduced incentives to improve services or quality for dialysis \npatients, and increased ability for the merged company to unilaterally \nincrease prices.\n  Notably, the DOJ has also been successful in securing investigations \nand halting suspected harmful merger practices on a much larger scale \n(in the health care and airline industry as of recent).\n  In June 2015, the DOJ put pressure on several multibillion dollar \nhealth insurers seeking to engage in large merger transactions with \nnear certain suppression of market competition in the healthcare \nindustry.\n  In August 2015, the DOJ issued civil investigative demands on several \nmajor US airlines seeking to halt any potential unlawful mergers.\n  These cases demonstrate the need for continued protection of the FTC \nand its ability to effectively carry out injunctions on harmful merger \nand acquisition activities, as well as anticompetitive business conduct \nthat harms consumers and restrains market activity.\n  The ability of the FTC to function independently is a necessary \nfunction to the success of both the FTC and the DOJ.\n  The far-reaching and elusive SMARTER Act fails keep the foundational \nintegrity of these agencies and should be opposed.\n  I urge all Members to vote against this serious threat to our \nfundamental protections of consumers and fair economic competition.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime to close.\n  It is not often that I come to the floor to argue a bill and to \ndebate and nobody on the other side shows up to participate in the \ndebate. I have been feeling kind of lonely over here.\n  I guess that people are too embarrassed on the other side to come \nhere and defend this legislation at this particular time, as we get \nready to depart for what will be just about 3 weeks, while we are \nleaving dangling and hanging important issues, like a budget for this \ncountry that was promised to us back at the beginning of the year. It \nwas supposed to be regular order. It was supposed to be that we are \ngoing to do a budget.\n  After the budget is done and we have our top lines and bottom lines \nin place, then we will embark upon the appropriations process and we \nwill pass all of\n\n[[Page H1566]]\n\nthe 12 appropriations bills for the first time in years and we will get \nback to regular order around here. They can't even produce enough votes \nto pass a budget.\n  So what do we do then? We revert to trying to protect and coddle and \nmake things easy for big multinational corporations that want to get \nbigger. They want to get bigger so that they can get a lock on the \nmarket, they have no competition, and then they can set whatever price \nthey want to set and the American people are left having to pay.\n  What can you do when you need your prescription medication and there \nis no competition, no other similar drug, and you only have one player \nin the room; therefore, you have to pay whatever they are holding you \nover the barrel for.\n  The American people are sick and tired and they are angry about \nhaving been held over a barrel year after year after year as this \nCongress continues to coddle and protect and make things good for big \nbusiness.\n  Well, what about the working people of this country? When are we \ngoing to do something about making sure that they don't have to pay \nthese increased bills that they would have to pay for things like hotel \nrooms, insurance, medical care, prescription drugs, nursing homes, and \nfood?\n  I don't even want to talk about the price of gas that is going to go \nup this summer. Despite the fact that we have a glut in the oil market, \nyou are going to be seeing your gas prices rise. Why? Because you are \ngetting out on the road and trying to go on vacation. It is getting \nmore and more difficult to do that because wages haven't gone up.\n  So this Congress continues to make it easy for big corporations to \nincrease their profits while doing nothing to raise wages for the \nregular working people of this country.\n  Now we are getting ready to go on another 3-week district work \nperiod. I have a lot of work to do in the district trying to explain to \nthe people of my district why we are not getting down to business and \ndoing the things that they expect this Congress to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues in this body oppose the \nSMARTER Act and do what is right for the American people.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Let's look at the arguments, the straw men that have been set up by \nthe other party claiming that this legislation does a manner of things \nthat it simply does not do.\n  First, they say enacting the SMARTER Act only benefits large \ncompanies that wish to merge, but the SMARTER Act protects small and \nmidsize companies which also come under the Federal Trade Commission's \nscrutiny.\n  This legislation is not designed to help big companies get bigger. \nIndeed, large companies have the resources to hire the lawyers, \neconomists, lobbyists, and other regulatory professionals to wrestle \nwith the FTC.\n  It is the small- and medium-size companies that would benefit from a \nfair process and an assurance that they would have their day in court.\n  The FTC does not always focus its attention on the large companies. \nIn fact, a Wall Street Journal article from 2013 documents how the FTC \npursued anticompetitive practices of the Music Teachers National \nAssociation, a nonprofit with about a dozen employees.\n  In short, this nonprofit was a collection of piano teachers. So if \nyou think the FTC only engages with conglomerates, you are mistaken. \nThey will even prosecute your after-school piano teacher.\n  The SMARTER Act ensures that, if the FTC does focus its efforts on \npiano teachers, on the small- and medium-size companies, they will have \nthe benefit of a fair process.\n  Then they make the argument that the SMARTER Act will make it more \ndifficult for antitrust enforcement agencies to stop a merger, but the \nSMARTER Act only changes the process. It does not have any substantive \nimpact on merger reviews.\n  The SMARTER Act does not make any substantive changes to antitrust \nlaw. Rather, the legislation only standardizes the process between the \ntwo antitrust enforcement agencies.\n  The witnesses at the committee hearings on the SMARTER Act testified \nthat the legislation only affects the process and not the substantive \nstandard.\n  As Deborah Garza, former chairwoman of the Antitrust Modernization \nCommission stated:\n\n       No one on the AMC believed at the time, and I do not \n     believe today, that this legislation would make it difficult \n     or impossible for the FTC Commission to do its job. The \n     Justice Department has done very well in pursuing its merger \n     enforcement agenda working with the standards that apply to \n     it. And I firmly believe that the FTC can do so as well.\n\n  Indeed, even the current Department of Justice Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the antitrust division stated:\n\n       I do not think there is a practical difference in how the \n     courts assess the factual and legal basis for enjoining a \n     merger challenged by the FTC on the one hand and the \n     Department on the other.\n\n  Let me also quote from a letter written by 15 leading antitrust \nprofessors who wrote to Congress expressing their support for the \nSMARTER Act:\n\n       The FTC is a very impressive agency that plays a valuable \n     role in antitrust enforcement. The SMARTER Act does nothing \n     to undermine the FTC's authority. It simply ensures that the \n     merger review processes and standards are equally applied to \n     merger parties, regardless of which agency reviews the \n     transaction.\n\n  The gentleman from New Jersey complained about what was going on with \nthe review of proposed mergers by health insurance companies. Guess \nwhat. Who is doing those reviews? Not the FTC. The Department of \nJustice. It doesn't make any sense.\n  What does make sense is that there are lots of companies going \nthrough lots of things caused, in part, by ObamaCare forcing healthcare \nproviders, insurance companies, and others to look at mergers and \nacquisitions. When they do so, the public should have the right to know \nthat justice is being done.\n  This is not about big business or small business. This is about \nmaking sure that the laws are fairly and equally applied. When that \nhappens, we should have this legislation at hand so that we have the \nassurance that we are going to have justice done. The FTC should \noperate by the same merger review processes and standards that the \nDepartment of Justice does.\n  I believe in the vigorous prosecution of antitrust practices and \ntransactions by the Department of Justice and the FTC. I would not \nsupport the SMARTER Act if I thought that it would disadvantage our \nantitrust enforcement agencies.\n  The Congressional Record demonstrates that the SMARTER Act only makes \nthe process more fair and predictable while providing the antitrust \nenforcement agencies with the same powers to prosecute antitrust \npractices.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The SMARTER Act is a commonsense process reform that ensures fairness \nand parity in the narrow field of merger reviews. The bill was \nrecommended to Congress by a bipartisan commission and is supported by \nformer top Department of Justice antitrust enforcement officials and \npast and present FTC Commissioners of both political parties.\n  This legislation will help America continue to serve as a leader and \ninnovator in competition law, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2745, the ``Standard Merger and \nAcquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015'' or SMARTER Act, \nwould require the Federal Trade Commission to use the same merger \nenforcement procedures as the Justice Department's Antitrust Division \nfor proposed mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other similar \ntransactions.\n  I oppose this flawed bill for several reasons.\n  Most importantly, H.R. 2745--by weakening the Commission's \nindependence--undermines Congress's original intent in creating the \nFederal Trade Commission in the first place.\n  For good reasons that are still relevant today, Congress established \nthe Commission to be an independent administrative agency.\n  Although the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 empowered the Justice \nDepartment to enforce antitrust laws, Congress determined that more \nneeded to be done to address the wave of mergers and anti-competitive \ncorporate abuses that continued notwithstanding the enactment of that \nAct.\n\n[[Page H1567]]\n\n  Accordingly, Congress created the Commission in 1914 as an \nindependent body of experts charged with developing antitrust law and \npolicy free from political influence, and particularly executive branch \ninterference.\n  To this end, Congress specifically gave the Commission broad \nadministrative powers to investigate and enforce laws to stop unfair \nmethods of competition as well as the authority to use an \nadministrative adjudication process to develop policy expertise, rather \nthan requiring the Commission to try cases before a generalist federal \njudge.\n  Yet, rather than strengthening the Commission's independence and \nenforcement authority, the SMARTER Act does the opposite.\n  Of greatest concern is the bill's elimination of the administrative \nadjudication process for merger cases under section 5(b) of the Federal \nTrade Commission Act.\n  By doing so, the SMARTER Act would effectively transform the \nCommission from an independent administrative agency into just another \ncompetition enforcement agency indistinguishable from the Justice \nDepartment and, thereby, arguable redundant.\n  The Commission's administrative authority is key to its distinctive \nrole as an independent administrative agency. But the SMARTER Act--by \neliminating the Commission's administrative authority--opens the door \nfor the ultimate elimination of the Commission.\n  And, you do not just have to take my word for it. Former Republican \nCommission Chairman William Kovacic, while expressing support for the \nbill's harmonization of preliminary injunction standards, says that the \n``rest of the SMARTER Act is rubbish.''\n  He continued, ``Let me put it this way: behind the rest of [the \nSMARTER Act] is the fundamental question of whether you want the \nFederal Trade Commission involved in competition law.''\n  Similarly, current Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez observes that \nthe bill would have ``far-reaching immediate effects'' and \n``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the Commission, as \nwell as the potential for significant unintended consequences.''\n  Consumers Union also opposes the SMARTER Act not only because it is \ncompletely unnecessary, but also because the bill could ``create \nunintended hurdles to effective and sound enforcement'' and ``set the \nstage for further tinkering--both of which risk undermining what is now \na coherent, consistent, well-established, familiar enforcement \nprocedure within the'' Commission.\n  Finally, the SMARTER Act is problematic because it may apply to \nconduct well-beyond large mergers, which could further hinder the \nCommission's effectiveness.\n  In particular, the SMARTER Act would eliminate the Commission's \nauthority to use administrative adjudications not just for the largest \nmergers, but for non-merger activity, like a ``joint venture'' or \n``similar transaction.''\n  I recognize that the bill's authors have tried in good faith to \nrespond to some of the concerns expressed by me and by the Commission \nduring the last Congress and I appreciate those efforts.\n  Moreover, I recognize that the Commission itself last year changed \nits procedural rules to make it easier to end the use of administrative \nlitigation where it loses a preliminary injunction proceeding in court.\n  I continue to have concerns, however, about the bill's prohibition \nagainst the Commission's administrative litigation authority with \nrespect to all merger cases.\n  Accordingly, I must oppose the SMARTER Act, even in its rewritten \nform, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to H.R. 2745.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 653, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. DOGGETT. I am.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Doggett moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 2745) to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the \n     bill back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. PROTECTING CONSUMERS AGAINST HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   COSTS.\n\n       (a) This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not \n     apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs \n     of pharmaceutical drugs.\n       (b) The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.12 et seq.) and Federal Trade \n     Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 et seq.) as in effect \n     immediately before the date of the enactment of this Act \n     shall apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the \n     costs of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for many months now so many of us Democrats \nhere in the House have been pleading with our Republican colleagues to \nrecognize that there is a very serious cost to the American people of \nprescription price gouging; such a serious matter that, overwhelmingly, \nin the fall, when the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed healthcare \nconcerns of Americans, the number one issue was soaring, unaffordable \nprescription drugs.\n  We have not been very successful in getting their attention on this \njust to recognize the severity of the problem--not even getting to the \npoint of agreeing on what legislative action this Congress, this \nadministration might take in order to address this problem.\n  We got another indication of the severity of the problem and the way \nthat people across America are being impacted by the Republican failure \nto address prescription price gouging in the latest survey done this \nyear by AARP, their RxPrice Watch report, which found the average \nretail price among 622 prescription medicines that are widely used by \nseniors more than doubled from less than $6,000 in 2006 to over $11,000 \nin 2013. That is an incredible increase.\n  It is not just seniors who are impacted, but working families, people \nall over the United States, by the fact that prescription drug prices \nare rising much faster than the cost of living and other health care.\n  Now, we have been asking for months that Republicans recognize the \nseverity of this problem. I have asked in the Committee on Ways and \nMeans. We cannot even get a hearing on the subject.\n  Our colleagues have asked, in the Commerce Committee, how about a \nhearing to look at what is happening to the American people on these \noutrageous prescription price increases that just keep increasing and \nincreasing? The Commerce Committee has refused to hold a hearing on it.\n  The Committee on Appropriations has been asked to review and consider \nthis problem. They won't hold a hearing on it.\n  The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, under the \nleadership of Elijah Cummings as the ranking Democrat, asked for a \nsubpoena. Finally--and it is appropriate for this bill, they call it \nthe SMARTER Act, and Republicans are always so much better at naming \ntheir legislation than what is in it--we had a smart aleck who got \nsubpoenaed, the guy who thought it was okay to raise the price of an \nover 60-year-old drug by over 5,000 percent in 1 day, having a big \nimpact on people who needed it for reduced immunity from any number of \nkinds of treatments, a 5,000 percent increase, and they at least were \nwilling to get him over video to make his various smart-aleck remarks \nabout his ability to do that.\n  Competition by itself is not solving the problem with the soaring \ncost of prescription drugs. But trying to maintain competition, if \nRepublicans won't recognize how endangered so many Americans are by \nprescription price gouging, we ought not to go backwards, and that is \nwhat I fear this bill would do.\n  Let me give you a precise example. On November 18, the Federal Trade \nCommission, which would be impacted by this bill, approved a final \norder that was concerned with the merger on generic drugs that treat \ncertain types of ulcers and thyroid conditions. This is the merger, an \n$8 billion merger between Endo International and Par Pharmaceuticals.\n  The FTC was concerned about the effect on competition and raising \nprices and gouging consumers even more than is occurring already. I do \nnot want to impair in any way their ability to initiate litigation, to \nbe involved, to see that competition remains--to the limited extent it \nis now--and not see seniors or working families with a sick child or \nanyone who gets a sad diagnosis of a life-threatening disease and then \nfinds themselves facing financial ruin even if they have insurance, to \nsee\n\n[[Page H1568]]\n\none of the few tools we have to deal with these anticompetitive \nprovisions eliminated by this bill.\n  This is the last amendment on the bill. It will not send the bill \nback to committee. It will at least preserve this one narrow area. If \nRepublicans won't recognize the problem, at least don't go make it \nworse.\n  They could be bringing up bills to this floor like the one that had \nbipartisan support about 8 or 9 years ago. Former Representative John \nDingell had a bill so that we would begin to have Medicare negotiate \nprices with these pharmaceutical companies. Twenty-four Republicans \neven joined us. That is the kind of bipartisan action we need.\n  At least approve this motion to recommit. Let the bill move forward, \nbut without gouging consumers on prescription drug prices even more \nthan they are today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \nmotion to recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that, because of \nObamaCare and government regulation, the cost of prescription drugs is \ngoing up--and going up too fast. We definitely need to reform our \nhealthcare system, starting with repealing ObamaCare and putting in \nplace real patient-centered reforms to our healthcare system, but that \nis not what this legislation is about today.\n  The SMARTER Act is predicated on a very simple notion: the results of \nan antitrust merger review should not be dependent on which antitrust \nenforcement agency happens to review the deal. The outcome should not \nbe determined by the flip of an agency coin. The SMARTER Act is a \nprocess reform that ensures that all parties have their day in court \nand are subject to the same standards, regardless of which antitrust \nenforcement agency reviews their merger.\n  The motion to recommit defeats this simple reform by carving out an \nexception for one area. Why, if we are seeking justice, why, if we are \nseeking a fair standard for all people before these antitrust review \nagencies, would we take this particular area and say, no, we are not \ngoing to have a consistent standard for reviewing something that the \ngentleman feels is so important.\n  We all feel that is very important, and that is why we all should \noppose this motion to recommit and vote for the underlying bill. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against the motion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, due to an illness I was unable to vote on \nthe following:\n  Rollcall No. 130.\n  Rollcall No. 131.\n  Rollcall No. 132.\n  Rollcall No. 133.\n  Rollcall No. 134.\n  Rollcall No. 135.\n  Rollcall No. 137.\n  Rollcall No. 138.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes.''\n  On rollcall No. 136, had I been present, I would have voted ``no.''\n\n\n                          personal explanation\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, had I been present for the vote on the \nDemocratic Motion to Recommit H.R. 2745, which would add protections \nfor consumers by ensuring that the underlying bill would not apply to \nmergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical \ndrugs (rollcall No. 136), I would have voted ``aye.''\n  Had I been present for the vote on the passage of H.R. 2745, the \nStandard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act \n(rollcall No. 137), I would have voted ``nay.'' This bill would \neliminate important administrative and procedural tools the Federal \nTrade Commission (FTC) uses to protect market competition and the \nAmerican consumer. Additionally, this bill seems unnecessary, \nparticularly after the Wall Street Journal dubbed 2015 the ``biggest \nyear ever for mergers and acquisitions.''\n  Additionally, had I been present for the vote on H. Res. 658, a \nresolution condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in \nBrussels on March 22, 2016, (rollcall No. 138), I would have voted \n``aye.'' These attacks signal a painful continuation in our struggle \nagainst terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1570-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON H.

Many who attend the Congress \nwill receive full academic scholarships as they look toward completing \nuniversity courses.\n  The six students selected to attend the Congress of Future Medical \nLeaders represent many communities in the Fifth Congressional District. \nThose chosen include: Courtney Craft from Bradford Area High School, \nAubrey Feinour from Penns Valley High School, Kendra Gadley from West \nForest Secondary School, Bella Huber from Central Mountain High School, \nNeedhi Sharma from State College High School, and Laiken Turner from \nMt.

Mr. Speaker, this week marks the sixth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Affordable Care Act.\n  I am proud of the role I played as majority leader in 2010 to bring \nthat legislation to the floor, legislation that has been \nextraordinarily successful in making affordable coverage accessible to \nmillions of Americans.\n  The Affordable Care Act has become a critical tool in fighting \npoverty. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, 20\n\n[[Page H1571]]\n\nmillion previously uninsured individuals now have coverage.\n  Expanded Medicaid is now covering 8.6 million Americans in 28 States \nand the District of Columbia. Were the rest of the States to implement \nit, it would provide access to affordable, quality care to another 5.1 \nmillion Americans.\n  Young people under age 26 can be covered under a parent's plan, \nmaking it easier for them to find their footing in the workforce. And \ninsurance companies, Mr. Speaker, can no longer deny coverage based on \na preexisting condition.\n  As we mark this anniversary, the Democratic Whip's Task Force on \nPoverty, Income Equality, and Opportunity will continue to lead efforts \nto defend the law against attempts to repeal or undermine it, and we \nwill pursue additional policies that help more Americans stay healthy, \nput roofs over their heads, and find jobs that lift them out of poverty \nand into the middle class.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1571-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING SHERIFF'S DEPUTY CARL KOONTZ\n\n  (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Howard County \nSheriff's Deputy Carl Koontz, who was killed in the line of duty last \nSunday.\n  Deputy Koontz had strong ties to Howard County. He was a graduate of \nboth Western High School in Russiaville and Indiana University Kokomo. \nAs a member of the force, he served as a school resource officer, \npositively impacting the hundreds of students with whom he interacted \non a daily basis.\n  Deputy Koontz was also a husband and a father to an 8-month-old son, \nNoah. Noah will be celebrating Easter this Sunday without his father \nand will never know him.\n  I offer my deepest and most heartfelt condolences for the family of \nDeputy Koontz during this time, and I thank him for all of his hard \nwork and ultimate sacrifice.\n  I also pray for the continued recovery of Sergeant Jordan Buckley, \nwho was also injured on Sunday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1571-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING CESAR CHAVEZ\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you to remind us of a great \nAmerican, Cesar Chavez. Born in Yuma, Arizona, he dedicated his life to \nmaking sure that he fought for workers in America and around the world.\n  He only had an eighth grade education, but he served our country \nhonorably in the military as well and risked his life and served the \npeople of America honorably.\n  One of the key tenets of his life was nonviolence. That is something \nthat is timely for us to remind ourselves of, as Americans, at this \ntime when we choose who our leader is going to be, that we do it \nrespectfully, honorably, and nonviolently.\n  So, with that, I would like to commemorate the opportunity to remind \nall of us to speak from our heart, to work from our heart, to be kind \nto our brothers, sisters, and our neighbors, and to do things and make \nchange for the better nonviolently in honor of our fellow American, \nCesar Chavez.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1571-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     POLL: MEDIA HAS TOO MUCH POWER\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Americans know that liberal media \nbias is a major problem in our country.\n  A recent Rasmussen poll found that Americans believe media bias is a \nbigger problem in politics than large campaign contributions. It also \nfound that a large majority of Americans, 66 percent, believe the news \nmedia has too much power and influence over government decisions.\n  A Media Research Center analysis of The New York Times provides an \nexample. MRC found that, since last August, The New York Times has \nnever characterized Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders as being hard-\nline or hard-left. In contrast, Republican candidates have been labeled \nas hard-line 45 times and hard-right 13 times. That is 58-0.\n  Americans will continue to view the media as a problem until it \nprovides fair and balanced coverage. The media should give the American \npeople the facts, not tell them what to think.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1571-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TOXIC CONTAMINATION IN SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order \nto bring attention to an issue afflicting communities in southeast Los \nAngeles.\n  Today communities in Vernon and the surrounding areas are dealing \nwith the aftermath of years of toxic contamination by a now-closed \nlead-acid battery recycling plant.\n  The recycling plant, which was owned by the company Exide \nTechnologies, operated for years in the city of Vernon.

The beautiful Columbia Basin and 300 days of sunshine \nattract opportunities for agriculture, recreation, and business.\n  The Tri-City Regional Chamber of Commerce represents nearly 1,200 \ndiverse businesses, providing access to customers and a network for job \ncreators. The Chamber provides visibility for partner companies and \nworks to improve the economic climate of our region. The Chamber \nrepresents local leaders, working to advance the local economy and the \nquality of life in the Tri-Cities.\n  With the motto of ``Bolder, Brighter, Better,'' this advocacy group \nhas had a tremendously positive impact, attracting jobs to our \ncommunity.

Mr. Speaker, as the only physicist remaining in the \nUnited States Congress, I feel a special responsibility to speak out on \nthe importance of strengthening global nuclear security.\n  In just a few days, the United States will host the fourth and final \nNuclear Security Summit. World leaders from more than 50 countries will \nconvene in Washington, D.C., to participate in a global dialogue to \nreinforce our commitment at the highest levels to securing nuclear \nmaterials. To date, these summits have been instrumental in achieving \ncritical nuclear security objectives, such as minimizing the use of \nhighly enriched uranium in reactors around the world, and enhancing \nmembership in international organizations like the IAEA. But more \nremains to be done.\n  It is no secret that rogue regimes and clandestine organizations \ncontinue to exhibit the ambition to acquire nuclear materials that can \nbe used to create crude radiological dirty bombs or nuclear weapons.\n  I am, however, optimistic that with our allies and partners around \nthe world, we will continue to develop new and innovative ideas to \nsecure vulnerable nuclear material and make the world a safer place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1572-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE\n\n  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, we owe so much to the brave men and women who \npolice our Nation's streets. Every day they selflessly put on their \nuniforms to stand in harm's way to keep us safe.\n  In my district, on March 9, an off-duty Jacksonville detective, who \nwas taking his son to school, was shot while making an unexpected stop \nafter witnessing a suspect driving erratically. He has been upgraded to \na stable condition now, but it is a sobering reminder of how quickly \nevil can strike.\n  On March 13, Maryland Police Officer Jacai Colson was the 23rd police \nofficer killed in the line of duty this year. May he rest in peace.\n  Mr. Speaker, these tragedies have gone from infrequent to occasional \nto nearly everyday occurrences across the country. To me and law-\nabiding American citizens, this is simply unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, there isn't much room between order and chaos. Members \nof our police force are the first, and sometimes only, line of defense \nthat we have from the evils that lurk in the shadows.\n  Our law enforcement officers deserve every ounce of support, respect, \nand gratitude that we can bestow upon them.

These women were remarkable, flying 78 different \ntypes of aircraft for the United States Army Air Force during World War \nII. They were stationed throughout the United States. They flew the \nvery same missions as their male counterparts, over 60 million miles of \noperational flights. Despite their patriotism and selfless service, \nthey did not receive veteran status until 1977, and yet, today, they \ncannot be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Thankfully, the House has already acted.

This was President Obama's and congressional \nDemocrats' landmark law, which has helped 20 million Americans--1.7 \nmillion Floridians in my home State--get quality, affordable health \ncare.\n  It is a law that outlawed discrimination against people like me--a \nwoman and a cancer survivor--who could have been prevented from \nobtaining care before the ACA ended that injustice.\n  It is also the anniversary of the EARLY Act, a law that I was proud \nto author, which passed as part of the ACA. The EARLY Act empowers \nyoung women with the information and resources they need to understand \ntheir breast health and the risks that they face.\n  As a cancer survivor and a mother, these two anniversaries are near \nand dear to my heart.

Third, arm the right rebels in Syria--\nbut, in the details, the policy needs to be strengthened.\n  We have armed dozens, rather than thousands, in Syria because we \ninsist that those whom we arm swear that they will not attack Assad. \nAssad has killed 200,000 civilians. Patriotic Syrians will wage war \nagainst that regime. Second, in our bombing, we have a zero civilian \ncasualties policy. We will not hit a tanker truck that carries ISIS oil \nif it is moving, which means there is a driver in that truck, and that \ndriver might be a civilian. We provide free electricity to ISIS-\ncontrolled areas.\n  It is time to get serious about our efforts against ISIS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1573-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FACT-CHECKING GOP CLAIMS ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care \nAct is one of the most important pieces of legislation in a generation.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million people have gained \nhealth insurance coverage. As this chart shows, the percentage of the \npopulation without health insurance is now under 10 percent. That is \nthe first time this has happened in our Nation's history. Just look at \nit. The uninsurance rate was steady for many, many years. Then, after \nthe Affordable Care Act was passed, it dropped like a stone.\n  Thanks to the ACA, young people are now able to stay on their \nparents' plans. Thanks to the ACA, families who could not get health \ninsurance through their employers can now get it. Thanks to the ACA, \npeople who couldn't afford health insurance can get subsidies to help \nthem afford it. Thanks to the ACA, people who have what the insurance \nindustry calls preexisting conditions are no longer left high and dry.\n  The ACA has been a lifesaver for people who were previously \nuninsured. It is a good thing for our economy and a promise kept to our \nconstituents. I would like to wish the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, a \nvery happy anniversary.

It was during a visit to check up on a sick friend \nin California when she met her future husband, Vernon Lowe, whom she \nmarried soon after and started her family in Redding, California.\n  Being an African American woman in the 1940s, unfortunately, racism \nwas no stranger to Isaac. Despite holding a business degree, she was \ndenied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than \nher impressive credentials. Isaac did not give up. She started a \ncatering business in Redding, and she eventually became the first Black \nwoman to be hired by the County of Shasta, working in social services \nfor 17 years and helping others. However, Isaac's most noble work was \nthrough her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood.\n  Upon first moving to Redding, all but one of the Black families lived \non the same street and were segregated from the community. This was a \nstatus quo that she didn't accept. Isaac joined her husband in founding \nthe Redding chapter of the NAACP and began her 65-year journey of \nadvocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto \nthat charter of the NAACP when times got a little leaner back in the \nseventies. She lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and \naffordable housing for Black families. She worked with local school \nofficials for the equal treatment of Black children in the community's \nmainly White schools. She fought for fairness and justice under the law \nfor all citizens in the judicial system. She raised funds and \nsuccessfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the \nonly Martin Luther King, Jr., community center between Sacramento and \nOregon at that time.\n  It was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped \nchange Shasta County for the better. Some of her most notable \naccomplishments included being the first Black woman to serve on Shasta \nCounty's grand jury, where she served as a founding member of the \nShasta County Citizens Against Racism and was awarded the Redding \nCitizen of the Year in 1992. Her proudest moment was in getting the \nRedding City Council members to recognize Martin Luther King Day as a \nholiday.\n  Her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she \nhad on so many lives. One of the anecdotes I know about her informally \nis that she was fairly commonly referred to as the ``Rosa Parks of \nRedding, California.'' She was a deeply caring friend, a loving wife \nand mother, and a selfless advocate.\n  I had the chance to meet Isaac personally on different occasions--\nsome positive and one, actually, a very negative occasion, but it was \nmade positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial \nincident that took place against a Black family in their home. Many of \nus in the community joined together in a march in solidarity, \nprotesting, that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in \nnorthern California. Isaac was there, being strong but also being that \nsmiling, positive voice. You could see her strength. You could also see \nthe light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right \nfor everybody, really, at the end of the day.\n  If we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of \nthe divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today, we \nwould be much better off. Northern California has lost a gem, but her \nlegacy will live on, and we all recognize that. I am honored to be able \nto note that here today on the U.S. House floor and to properly show \nthat. Her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are \nright over here in the Library of Congress, which note some of her work \nin the past for the NAACP. Indeed, it is a rich legacy that reaches all \nthe way to Washington, D.C.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for allowing me to \nmake this special tribute to Isaac Lowe today.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from California (Mr. LaMalfa). I did \nnot realize I should have been joining in that tribute with the \ngentleman. Her being born in Wharton, Texas, and going to college in \nTexas, we share her as a real gem that the Lord provided to both of us. \nI thank the gentleman for sharing that with us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of being allowed to attend oral \narguments at the Supreme Court, and I appreciate their staff and their \naccomodation. Not everybody over there recognizes that there are three \nindependent, coequal branches of government the way the Founders \nintended, but I am extremely grateful for those who do, and we afford \nthe mutual respect between us. That is a good thing.\n  So, to the clerk of the Court and to Perry and others, I thank you \nfor your accomodation.\n  I am a member of the Supreme Court Bar, which allows attorneys, as \nfar as seating, to come sit in front of the bar, on the side of the bar \nwith the litigants, and to get a real ringside seat--actually, inside \nthe ring.\n  The case today was, actually, a consolidation of a number of cases. \nProbably most well-known--probably that should be most well-known--was \nthe Little Sisters of the Poor. We had representatives from East Texas \nBaptist University in my district in Marshall, Texas. It is just a \nsuper school. They are a religious school, and they are not ashamed, \nbecause they are East Texas Baptist University, to teach what religious \nconvictions inform them are the right things to do. They follow the \nlaw. The problem is when the law does not follow the Constitution, and \nthat is what has gotten us into the problem that was faced today and is \nbeing faced at the Supreme Court.\n  It is amazing. I was telling a group here just recently that, in east \nTexas, we call it ``common sense,'' but when I get to Washington, we \nusually just\n\n[[Page H1575]]\n\nhave to call it ``sense'' because it is not common at all. I found that \nto be the case at the Supreme Court during oral arguments. I do have \ngreat sympathy for all of the eight remaining Justices in this regard.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Once the Supreme Court issues a ruling that clearly violates the \nConstitution, for all who truly have eyes and truly have ears to hear \nnot clouded by secular humanism, but informed by the Constitution's \nwords itself, then they see that, when a court rules against the \nConstitution, violating the Constitution by its very ruling, it creates \na terribly difficult situation for itself.\n  Because once the bold, visible lines that are spelled out in the \nConstitution are violated and erased, the Court is charged with an \nongoing impossible task of trying to find a place to redraw those \nlines.\n  Now, it is unfortunate that some of the Justices--in fact, four of \nthem--kept trying to draw a line in a manner that was not before the \nCourt. They showed themselves to be not necessarily very able jurists \nwho loved justice, but, in fact, very experienced politicians.\n  Because politicians know, if you are wrong on an issue and somebody \nbrings up the issue about which you are wrong, the thing to do is \nchange the subject and make it about something that you are not wrong \nabout.\n  You point to something that is a very difficult question and say that \nthat is a very difficult question and, as good magicians do, divert the \nattention away from the wrong that you have already done and that you \nare about to complicate.\n  Mr. Speaker, the wrong about which I speak was the violation by \nCongress coupled with the violation by the Supreme Court itself.\n  For the first time in our Nation's history, having the United States \nFederal Government with all its powers, its guns, its ability to take \npeople's homes--well, that is the IRS. Most folks can't take homes.\n  But to just wreak havoc on the well-being of a family, of a business, \nthe Federal Government says for the first time: You have to purchase a \nproduct. It is required.\n  There is nothing in the Constitution that either allows or encourages \nthe United States Government to order all American citizens to buy a \nproduct.\n  As we went through discussion on ObamaCare back during 2009 until it \npassed in 2010, at first, the President and his minions were saying \nthat, well, clearly this is not a tax. It was a mandate.\n  It says: You must buy a product and, if you don't comply with our \nFederal order to buy this product, this health insurance--and it has to \nbe what we say health insurance is, not some idea you have--we will \ndictate what the health insurance is, and you have to provide it. If \nyou don't, it is not a tax.\n  There is a penalty for violating the law, the mandatory obligation \nthat we have imposed on every American. Well, nothing allows that and \nmany things prohibit it.\n  Over the years, Members of Congress and even the Supreme Court and \nPresidents have used the Commerce Clause, that we have the right to \ncontrol interstate commerce, as the basis for which to get involved in \nmatters of commerce that lie within a State.\n  In this case, Chief Justice Roberts in this part of the opinion very \ncorrectly states that, if you allow the Federal Government to say we \nhave jurisdiction to mandate people buy health insurance and not just \nany health insurance. It has to have the things in it that we dictate, \nthen there is no place you could ever draw a line and say the Commerce \nClause does not allow for this and ultimately decided that, under the \nCommerce Clause, ObamaCare was unconstitutional.\n  Simply citing the fact that everybody, at some point, seeks health \ncare--and most people have some form of health insurance at some \npoint--that does not give the Federal Government the right to come in \nand take over and even dictate the purchase of a product.\n  We had some in this room and at the other end of this building in the \nSenate who furthered the argument that this is old news, that the \nGovernment has been able to do this for many years. It is called car \ninsurance or automobile insurance. Governments have been requiring \ninsurance and penalizing if you didn't buy insurance for years. This is \nnot a new concept.\n  The trouble is that was not an appropriate comparison at all. For one \nthing, that is activity within the State. It was not the Federal \nGovernment that required an insurance policy. And there was no mandate \nthat everyone within a State had to have that car insurance.\n  Courts have long held that driving on a highway built by the State or \nFederal Government or county is a privilege. You do not have a \nconstitutional right to drive a car on a government road. But if you \nchoose to drive a car, a vehicle, on a government road, in that case, \nthen you must have insurance.\n  The difference is driving on a road is a privilege. In the case of \nObamaCare, the Federal Government said just breathing, walking around \nliving or even lying prostrate in your bed, even if you are confined to \nyour bed--it doesn't matter--just being a living person we will say \nunder our Constitution is a privilege that the government giveth and \nthe government taketh away.\n  Therefore, we are saying that, if you are going to exist, breathe, \nlive, you must have health insurance, and not just any health \ninsurance. It has to have the provisions we say and those will not \nnecessarily include the things you need in your life.\n  We, as the omniscient, ubiquitous government--of course, it may be \nmore ubiquitous than we know--we have a right to tell you what is good \nfor you and what isn't. Once the government can tell you what you have \nto have or have not in the way of health care, they have the right to \ncontrol your life.\n  So it was interesting, for one thing, that, in this case, the \ngovernment had conceded that these were sincerely, deeply held \nreligious beliefs of all the plaintiffs. So that was not an issue.\n  It was not an issue like some people who were trying to dodge the \ndraft, except for religious purposes when sometimes it was and \nsometimes it was not. It was conceded in this case all of the deeply \nheld religious beliefs were very sincere by the litigants.\n  I heard something I don't know that I have heard before in a Supreme \nCourt argument when Justice Sotomayor made a statement of fact about \nthe case.\n  One of the litigants who may not have been politically astute, but, \napparently, accurate, said that, factually, Justice Sotomayor, that is \njust not the case. That is just not true here.\n  Where four of the Justices showed incredible aptitude for being \npoliticians and not Justices, they diverted attention--as I said, good \nmagicians do this. Good politicians do this.\n  They diverted attention away from the real problem and diverted away \nfrom the actual question before the Court and kept digging and pointing \nto a question that was not before the Court.\n  That point was that the four Justices kept wanting to talk about \nobjections to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs.\n  They kept wanting to talk about the difficulty in drawing lines, \nthat: ``Gee, what do we do if the plaintiffs or the defendants''--the \nlitigants in the particular case--subjects would probably be more \naccurate under ObamaCare--the subjects of the United States--it used to \nbe U.S. citizens--``are not objecting to objecting on the basis of \nreligious beliefs?''\n\n  That has come up in cases before where someone would say: ``I believe \nmy religious belief is so personal. You should not make me object on \nthe basis of religious beliefs because then I would have to reveal what \nmy religious beliefs are and that is none of your business. So we \nobject to objecting.''\n  So the four most liberal Justices kept wanting to talk about: ``But \nwhere do we draw the line in this issue if there is an objection to \nobjecting on the basis of religious grounds?''\n  The able attorneys for the American subjects to the fast-growing \nmonarchy here in the United States kept trying to bring them back to \nwhat was before the Court: ``Justices, none of these clients, none of \nthe litigants, object to objecting on religious grounds. They have no \nproblem with objecting on religious grounds. They have objected on\n\n[[Page H1576]]\n\nreligious grounds. They filed objections both administratively and in \ncourt when they filed for injunction. They have had no problem \nobjecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. So that is \nnot really an issue.''\n  Once again, when Justices are in the wrong, they don't want to talk \nabout the issue before the Court. They want to talk about the issue \nthat is not before the Court. Let's talk about how many angels you \nmight could get on the head of a needle. Let's talk about anything but \nthe elephant in the room.\n  The real elephant in the room and the reason for which I have \nsympathy for all eight Justices is that, once they violated the \nConstitution by saying ObamaCare was constitutional, they created so \nmany scenarios that are going to be nightmares for the Court to try to \nfigure out where we stop the flood as it overwhelms the rights of \nAmericans.\n  It is just a massive--like that 1950s movie or maybe it was early \n'60s--``The Blob.'' You just couldn't stop it. It would go out one \nplace and come out another.\n  And that is the problem when the Supreme Court violates the \nConstitution in the case of ObamaCare, saying: You can dictate to \nAmerican citizens. You can make them American subjects to this all-\npowerful, dictatorial Federal Government. You can tell them what to \nbuy. You can punish them for not buying it.\n  And, of course, we know that--although Chief Justice Roberts was \nexactly right and on point when he said: Gee, if you try to use the \nCommerce Clause, jurisdiction over interstate commerce, to justify the \ntakeover of health care and a mandate to buy something the Federal \nGovernment says you have to buy, then there is no limit ever that can \nbe drawn on the Commerce Clause.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  So it is not constitutional under the Commerce Clause. It certainly \nappeared accurate when Chief Justice Roberts went through an \nexplanation of the initial issue that they had to take up on ObamaCare, \nand that was the anti-injunction statute, which basically requires \nthat, before a litigant in Federal court can have standing to be before \nthe court and if it involves a tax, then the litigant must be someone \nagainst whom the tax has already been levied and the tax has already \nbeen paid. Only if the tax has been levied against the litigant and the \ntax has been paid do the courts recognize standing by that litigant to \nbe before the court to make argument over any complaint.\n  So they had to deal with that issue because not only does a litigant \nnot have standing to even stay in court if they are arguing about a tax \nand the tax has not been levied and the tax has not been paid, but the \nFederal court itself has no jurisdiction to even hear the controversy \nuntil the tax is levied and the tax is paid.\n  So Chief Justice Roberts had the difficult problem of investigating \nand ruling on whether or not the mandate and the penalty that comes if \nyou don't purchase what is required by the Federal Government--is that \na penalty or is that a tax?\n  Because if it is a tax, the law is very clear. We will have to rule \nthat the plaintiffs do not have standing and their case be thrown out. \nAnd, similarly, we will rule that the Court does not have jurisdiction. \nThe case, as it is said in court, is not ripe for litigation. So it \nwill have to be thrown out.\n  If the court found that the penalty imposed by the Federal Government \nfor not being a loyal American subject and buying a product that the \nmonarchy or the growing dictatorship here says you have to buy--if it \nis a penalty, then you can come to court. We do have jurisdiction, and \nyou do have standing.\n  So Chief Justice Roberts went through and ably explained how Congress \ncalled it a penalty. At that time, of course, the Democrats were in the \nmajority here in the House as well as the Senate. The Democratic \nleadership, the Democratic supporters in favor of ObamaCare, had made \nit clear this is a penalty.\n  Chief Justice Roberts cited that, that Congress should know better \nthan anyone else whether this is a penalty or it is a tax. Because if \nit is a penalty, again, the litigant can be here and have standing. We \nhave got jurisdiction. But if it is a tax, we have to throw it out. We \ncan't hear the case, not now.\n  He said Congress should know better than anyone. They decided it was \na penalty. Not only that, but it really does appear to be a penalty \nbecause ObamaCare says: You have to buy insurance and you have to buy a \nproduct we say is okay. You can't buy what you want. You have to buy \nwhat we say you must buy. And if you don't do that, we will impose a \nfinancial penalty on you.\n  I am hearing more and more young people who are really perplexed: \nYes. The government is giving me a subsidy to help me pay for my \ninsurance, but my insurance has 5-, 6-, 7-, $8,000 of a threshold that \nI have to meet before it ever helps me with a dime of insurance help. \nSo am I better off getting the government subsidy, paying all this \nmoney that is really making my life miserable, or should I go ahead and \npay the new income tax that I have added on to me for not having \ninsurance as is dictated?\n  I think Chief Justice Roberts came to a proper conclusion. This truly \nis a penalty. It is not a tax because it is only paid if you violate \nthe mandate that the Federal Government dictated. So, clearly, it is a \npenalty.\n  So there at page 1415 of the opinion, Chief Justice Roberts \nconcludes: Okay. Congress says it is a penalty. It obviously is a \npenalty. If you don't want to pay the penalty, then buy the insurance. \nYou won't have the penalty. It is clearly a penalty. Since it is a \npenalty, the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply. Therefore, the \nplaintiffs do have standing, and not only do they have standing, but \nthis court has jurisdiction. Now, because it is a penalty and not a \ntax, we have jurisdiction. So now we will proceed to consider the \nprimary cause before us, whether or not the Federal Government can \nmandate for the first time in history that all of the American people \nbuy a product that it dictates.\n  Then he went through and determined, if you say the Commerce Clause \njustifies Federal jurisdiction here, then the Commerce Clause has no \nlimits, has no meaning. And we choose to find that the Commerce Clause \nhas meaning. Therefore, this is unconstitutional under the Commerce \nClause.\n  But, then again, about 40 pages after he says it is not a tax, it is \na penalty, Chief Justice Roberts plays the mental gymnastics of \narriving at saying: You know what. It turns out this really is not a \npenalty. It is a tax. And since it is a tax, a majority of us will find \nthat it is constitutional. And so the Federal Government can impose a \nmandate requiring that all American citizens be loyal subjects, subject \nto the dictatorship here in Washington, buy whatever product we tell \nthem to buy. And all of that is because the Supreme Court rewrote the \nlaw and called it a tax.\n  That is why the Supreme Court is struggling the way it is today. \nBecause when you create an abomination, you violate the Constitution to \nthe extent, you violate your conscience the way it was before it got so \nclouded with politics. You violate the Constitution and then you create \nthe kind of mess that is before the Supreme Court today.\n  It is incredible to sit and listen to the Supreme Court struggling \nover this issue of just how far we can go to violate someone's \nreligious beliefs. I didn't hear any one of the Justices refer to the \nFirst Amendment, that the government will establish no religion and not \nviolate--or not prohibit the free exercise thereof.\n  My friend, Keith Rothfus, a fellow Member of Congress, was sitting \nbeside me. He got sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court bar today. \nKeith Rothfus was pointing out that, in one of the prior Supreme Court \ndecisions back in the 1960s, they actually had a footnote where they \nlisted a lot of the religions that they found currently in the United \nStates. It was a fairly full list.\n  But one of the religions in the United States recognized by the \nSupreme Court in the early 1960s was secular humanism. As Keith Rothfus \nand I agreed, we have now come to the point where we are violating the \nFirst Amendment of the Constitution.\n  And not only are we violating the restraint against the Federal \nGovernment prohibiting the free exercise of religion, as it is doing \nfor East Texas Baptist University, Houston Baptist University, Little \nSisters of the Poor,\n\n[[Page H1577]]\n\nso many organizations that are religious in nature, but they have \nviolated the part that said we will have no establishment of religion.\n  The Founders were thinking specifically about the Church of England \nand how the King didn't like the way the Vatican was ruling. And so he \njust created his own church, the Church of England. He said: Everybody \nhas got to participate in my church now.\n  They didn't want that to ever happen where the government of the land \ncould dictate the religion that people had to practice. Yet, that is \nwhat the Supreme Court has now done because it has now recognized \nsecular humanism--not just recognized, but established secular \nhumanism--as the State-sponsored religion in America.\n\n  With the ruling last summer, the Supreme Court, in effect, said: \nSince the 1960s, we have been limiting people's ability to use the word \nGod, to pray to God, to read God's word, the Bible. We have been \nprohibiting that for 40 or so years, 50 years maybe, and we have been \nprotecting what Moses said was the Word of God and what Jesus said was \nthe Word of God for far too long.\n  They basically established secular humanism as the official religion \nof the United States. By their pronouncement, they were saying to \nforget what Moses said God said, forget what Jesus said.\n  When Jesus actually was asked about marriage and divorce, he quoted \nMoses verbatim: A man shall leave his father and mother, a woman leave \nher home. The two will become one flesh.\n  Then Jesus added, not just quoting Moses as to what Moses said God \nsaid about marriage: And what God has joined together, let nobody take \napart.\n  The Supreme Court last summer said: The effect of the ruling is not \nonly can you not talk about God publicly or pray or read the Bible, \nthank God we have speech and debate clause privileges here on this \nfloor where I am actually free to even mention the word God. We pray \nevery day to start our official day here in session. But the Supreme \nCourt ruled, in effect: We are your God. The five of us in the majority \nof the Supreme Court are now your God. Forget what we said in our prior \ndecisions about marriage. It was not mentioned in the Constitution. \nTherefore, under the 10th Amendment, it is reserved to the States and \nthe people.\n  Forget the fact that we have talked before about the States will \ndecide what marriage is. Forget our ruling on DOMA, the Defense of \nMarriage Act, passed by Congress, where we made very clear that the \nStates only have the right to decide what marriage is.\n  Forget all that. Now we five majority Justices are your God. And \nforget the fact that we--at least two of us have violated the Federal \nlaw in order to reach this decision. Because the Federal law is very \nclear. If a judge--a Federal judge, magistrate, Justice might have \ntheir impartiality--his or her impartiality questioned, then they \nshould disqualify--they shall disqualify themselves from sitting on the \ncase.\n  So we had two Justices. Not only was their opinion and their \nimpartiality in question, there was actually no question that they were \nnot impartial because they had both participated in same-sex wedding \nceremonies. And Justice Ginsburg, who is a very nice lady, actually \nsaid--as Maureen Dowd pointed out in her article, she emphasized as she \npronounced them married by virtue of the laws of the--and she said she \nreally hammered the words--by the Constitution of the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  So, clearly, we had Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg perform same-\nsex marriages before they were not impartial. The law required them to \ndisqualify themselves.\n  I have had some people say: Well, wouldn't it have disqualified any \nof the other judges if they had ever participated in a marriage between \na man and a woman?\n  The answer is very easily and clearly no, because that was the law.\n  The question is: Can a government prohibit same-sex marriage?\n  It was same-sex marriage that was before the court, not can a \ngovernment prohibit marriage between a man and a woman.\n  If the question had been: Can a government prohibit marriage between \na man and a woman, then that might be a different story. But that was \nnot the issue before the court. Two Justices were disqualified. They \nhad made their opinion clearly known in advance.\n  There were other judges who had been asked, as I understand it, to do \nweddings, but they said: No, that might create a question of my \nimpartiality and would require me to disqualify myself.\n  Well, their participation did certainly disqualify them. They refused \nto disqualify themselves. So two Justices, as a minimum, were \ndisqualified as they participated in the majority of five.\n  So when you have an unconstitutional ruling by the United States \nSupreme Court, when the Chief Justice has to commit to the mental \ngymnastics, the loop-the-loops that he has to try to do to get around \nsaying the mandate to purchase a policy that carries a penalty, is a \npenalty, and then over here we know he said it is a penalty over there, \nbut now we are saying it is a tax, not a penalty, they created a \nnightmare for any legitimate judge with a conscience in trying to \ndecide: Now that we have blown apart any constitutional lines, where do \nwe draw the lines now?\n  It is rather tragic. Justice Kennedy was questioning one of the \nreligious litigant's attorneys and made the statement, basically, that \nthe court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that if we \ngive an exemption to a church, we then have to give it to all other \nreligious institutions.\n  Well, that statement deeply troubled me as well because it means that \nJustice Kennedy does not understand the constitutional prohibition in \nthe First Amendment. You are not on the Supreme Court or in Congress or \nin the Presidency to ever establish a religion. And it has been \nestablished. It is called secular humanism, which the Supreme Court has \nrecognized as a religion. That is what is being established now.\n  You are also not to prohibit the free exercise of religion. When the \nSupreme Court gets to the point, as Justice Kennedy is, that we on this \ncourt--at least a majority--will find it very hard to say that if you \nare not a part of a church and acting as that church, then you have no \nright to practice any of your religious beliefs that five of us don't \nlike, that is tragic.\n  I keep coming back to that prophetic statement by Benjamin Franklin \nwhen he was asked after the Constitutional Convention by a dear lady: \nWhat did you give us?\n  ``A republic, madam, if you can keep it.''\n  Why would he say ``if you can keep it?''\n  The reason he said that is--as he knew--the nature of government is \nto take more and more power and authority over individual rights and \nindividual liberties. And in order to keep a republic, as Ben Franklin \ncalled it, you have to teach generation after generation that there are \nresponsibilities that come with citizenship. Because if you don't live \nup to those responsibilities, you will lose the republic, madam. You \ncan't keep it.\n  We have done a miserable job of teaching the next generation about \nhow you would keep a republic. Instead of being taught, as I was, in \nschool the dangers of socialism, the dangers of communism, and that it \nalways has to result in a dictatorship or a totalitarian government, \nthat it requires people's rights be taken away, our Founders say that \nwe have to recognize these rights are a gift from our Creator, from \nGod, because if we say they are a gift of the government, then what the \ngovernment giveth, the government can taketh away.\n  We have legislators and judges who have not been properly educated on \nthe manner in which you keep a republic, madam.\n  It really has been heartbreaking when very smart young people ask \nsincerely: I understand socialism is supposed to be wrong, communism is \nsupposed to be wrong, but it really sounds nice. Can you explain why it \nwould be wrong? Because I don't get it. It sounds nice.\n  As the New Testament Church started out, as the Pilgrims' Compact \nstarted out, you bring into the common storehouse, and then you share \nand share alike. You share from those according to their ability to \nthose according to their need.\n  Of course, more than one parent has explained socialism to their \nchildren\n\n[[Page H1578]]\n\nby saying: Look, you got an A. I know how hard you were working every \nnight doing your homework, but your friend over here got a C. I saw her \nout partying a lot of times when you were here studying. And she is not \nmaybe quite as smart as you are, so she got a C, you got an A.\n  The socialist notion is that we have to give everybody a B. So we \nwill make this A a B, we will make this C a B, and everybody will feel \nbetter for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have shared this before, but it was such a lesson to \nme as an exchange student to the Soviet Union being out at a collective \nfarm. The farmers were sitting in the shade in midmorning, when anybody \nback home in east Texas knows that--especially in July, like it was--\nyou start early and you try to finish early before the sun gets too \nhot. It is midmorning. This is prime time to be working before it gets \ntoo hot. And here are all the farmers sitting in the shade in the \nmiddle of their village.\n  Trying to use the best Russian I could--I had 2 years, which meant I \ncould converse ably with a 4-year-old--I asked: When do you work out in \nthe field?\n  I couldn't tell what they cultivated and didn't. It all looked brown. \nNone of it looked very good. I would have expected in Texas that those \nfields would have been green, looking good, and the weeds out. You \ncouldn't tell what was weeds and what wasn't.\n  I said: When do you work out in the field?\n  They laughed, and I thought I must not have translated that right. \nThen one of them said in Russian, basically: I make the same number of \nrubles if I am out there in the field in the sun or if I am here in the \nshade. So I am here in the shade.\n  I have carried that with me all these years. That is why socialism \ncan't work. It is why socialism or communism--again, bringing all into \nthe common storehouse, share and sharing alike--can never work on this \nEarth, in this world. Because the only way you will ever have share and \nshare alike, as they found out in the New Testament Church, the only \nway you can make it work is if you have a totalitarian government that \nsays: you will do what we say. And then there goes your freedoms.\n  So the only way to have the maximum amount of freedom is to have a \nself-governing republic so people can govern themselves by electing \npeople that they have interviewed, they have read all about, done \nplenty of research on, and then they come forward on hiring day--\notherwise known as election day--and they vote to hire the person that \nthey want for their public servant. That is the way it is supposed to \nwork.\n\n  People have not obliged themselves of the need that in order to keep \na republic, you have to do the research on the candidates that have \napplied for your job. You have a requirement, a need, for you to \nactually come out and vote. Look, I get it. There are so many I have \nheard from that are disenfranchised voters. They say: We hear about all \nthese people.\n  John Fund has a great book out on the fraud that has been in so many \nof our modern elections that is not being dealt with, despite what the \ngovernment says. It is a great book.\n  People find out there is fraud. Since they didn't have to have a \nphoto ID like you have to have to buy cigarettes or alcohol or get on a \nplane or anything else, you can manipulate the system, you can vote \nmore than one time.\n  My friend from south Texas told me about some of the people who were \nillegally in the country being approached with voter registration \nforms, saying: Fill these out. If you don't want to use your own \naddress here, just use one central address. You can all use the same \naddress.\n  Some of them were worried about showing an ID. They will figure out \nwe are illegally in this country and we are not supposed to vote. They \nwere assured: No, no.\n  President Obama's lawyer--Eric Holder at that time--has gotten a \njudge to rule that they can't require an ID and, therefore, all you \nhave to do is fill this out. But if you don't fill this out, then \nRepublicans are going to take away your welfare, they are going to take \naway your health care, and they are going to try to make you leave the \ncountry.\n  So you have got to fill this out. And even though it is illegal, \nthere is nothing wrong with doing it. You will get the voter \nregistration card in the mail to the address you give them, and then \nyou just go vote and that is all you have to show them.\n  Thankfully, we have voter ID now in Texas. But there are so many \npeople who have been disenfranchised, because they say: There is so \nmuch voter fraud going on. Why should I even bother? My vote doesn't \ncount like somebody that votes more than once.\n  We are in grave danger of losing this republic. We are not going to \nkeep it much longer the way we are going. We haven't educated future \ngenerations to how you go about keeping a self-governing republic. Some \nhave been miseducated to think socialism, which has failed every single \ntime it has ever been tried--it will always fail. We haven't educated \nthem about the truth of freedom and what is required to keep it.\n  Justice Scalia told a group from my hometown that was here that the \nreason we are the most free Nation in history is not because we had the \nbest Bill of Rights, but because the Founders didn't trust government. \nThey wanted gridlock. They wanted it as difficult as possible to pass \nlaws, because with the passage of every law is the risk that some \nfreedom will be taken away by the Big Government.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The Founders knew that, and they made it hard to pass laws. That is \nnot a bad thing. It is a good thing.\n  But when he mentioned that the Soviet Union had a better bill of \nrights than we had, I remembered, I did a paper back in college when I \nwas at Texas A After I had visited the Soviet Union as an exchange \nstudent, I wrote a paper on their system. But I had done a paper on \ntheir bill of rights, their Constitution. I was shocked at the extent \nof the rights that were guaranteed to the Soviet Union citizens.\n  I was also surprised to find that, in the early sixties, the Premier, \nKhrushchev, in the Soviet Union, had set up a commission, because those \nthat had truly been educated on the different forms of government and \ngoverning know that, actually, true communism is only when there is no \ngovernment, that it is like reaching for nirvana. You eventually reach \nthe point where everybody is so sharing and so giving--taking from \ntheir ability, giving to the need--they are so giving that you don't \neven need a government anymore.\n  So Khrushchev set up a commission basically charged with coming up \nwith a plan to reach that ultimate goal where someday there will be no \ngovernment and we will have true communism in its purest form, no \ngovernment, everyone giving, sharing, lovingly.\n  And I read that, after a couple of years of that commission trying to \nfigure out, ``How are we ever going to come up with a plan that \neventuates in having no government and everybody always sharing \nequally? How are we going to ever pull that off?'' they couldn't come \nup with a way to reach that in this world, in this life, and so \nKhrushchev disbanded the commission. There was no way to get there.\n  They were right. If you are going to have communism or socialism, you \nare going to have to have a totalitarian government, whether it is an \nindividual dictator or a political group like they have or used to have \nat the Kremlin. You have got to have ruling autocrats, an oligarch, \nmonarch, in order to force everybody to take from those who have worked \nhard, according to their ability, and giving to those who either can't \nwork or choose not to work. The only way you can maximize freedoms is \nwhen people in the country understand what Franklin understood: you \nhave got a republic if you can keep it.\n  We are not being vigilant to keep our Republic, and that is why so \nmany are desperate now as they vote for a Presidential candidate.\n  And even Christian friends have said, you know, I understand there is \na time and place for a David with a slingshot, complete faith in God, \nand a clear great ability with a slingshot. I know there is a time for \nthat. But right now, our freedoms have been so badly eroded, we are \nlosing the government. We are having people come in and start voting \nwithout understanding how you preserve a republic. We are losing the \ncountry. We are losing the melting pot that we once were, welcoming \npeople\n\n[[Page H1579]]\n\nfrom all over and coming together and being molded into one thing, not \na hyphenated American, but an American. We are losing that.\n  You see many voters standing in lines now. They didn't used to ever \ndo this, stand in line for hours. You found people do that in Africa \nwhen they are finally afforded an opportunity to vote for the first \ntime in their lives. But now, in America, some people are waiting hours \nto vote because they see that we have not been vigilant in protecting \nour Republic, and just as Franklin worried, we are about to lose it.\n  We are already losing it when the government can dictate that \nindividuals buy a product, when the government can say you can only \npractice your religious beliefs if you are within the confines of a \nchurch, but if you are an individual, like the Founders were, who held \ntightly to their religious beliefs--they talked about it as they passed \nlegislation; they talked about it as they created our Constitution--the \nSupreme Court is now saying: Secular humanism is what we must have; it \nis what we demand. And since we are in charge and we are moving toward \nbeing socialistic, you have got to have an oligarchy, and we are it.\n  Obviously, they don't say it in those words, but that is what their \nactions say, and that is why, when a Justice says: Well, this Court \nwould find it very hard to write an opinion saying that we were moving \nthe line from beyond a church and extending that line out to other \nreligious institutions--like the Little Sisters of the Poor, these \nwonderful, superb Christian women who have given their lives doing what \nJesus said, ministering to others, feeding His sheep, ministering to \ntheir physical needs, their healthcare needs--and the Supreme Court \nsays: We have a lot of trouble. See, they are not actually a church. \nThey are a religious institution, and we are going to have a hard time \nwriting an opinion that moves the line to protect religious opinions.\n  My word, shouldn't have any trouble drawing a line at individuals. \nAny individual in the United States of America who has a deeply held, \nsincerely held religious belief, it was meant to be protected, unless \nit is completely anathema to our Constitution.\n  Sharia law is anathema; and to the extent that some believe they \nshould replace our Constitution with their sharia law, then that is \ntreason if they are here in this country. But otherwise, their \nreligious belief should be recognized, and God help us if the Court \ndoesn't do it right.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/23/house-section/article/H1579-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
