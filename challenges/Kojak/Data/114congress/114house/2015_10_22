The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee will consider a surface transportation \nreauthorization. Unfortunately, calling it a ``reauthorization'' \ndoesn't make it so.\n  This legislation calls for a 6-year period of reauthorization and \nhopes to be funded for 3 years, but it doesn't actually provide a \nsingle dime of revenue from the highway trust fund. It is simply an \nempty shell.\n  It really doesn't have to be this hard. There is a single solution \nthat is supported by everyone outside of Capitol Hill, one that has \nbeen employed by six red Republican States already this year and \nchampioned by Ronald Reagan when he was President: raise the gas tax. \nOur problems are that we are trying to fund 2015 infrastructure with \n1993 dollars--the last time we raised the Federal gas tax.\n  I have a bill that will accomplish this fact. H.R. 680 provides that \nassurance and certainty by phasing in a gas tax increase over 3 years. \nIt will permit us to fully fund a 6-year reauthorization for the first \ntime since 1998 without resorting to gimmicks. It is cosponsored by \nover three dozen House Members, but, more importantly, it enjoys the \nbroadest base of support for any major piece of legislation before \nCongress.\n  Is there any other bill of any significance that is endorsed by the \nU.S. Chamber and the AFL-CIO, countless business and trade \nassociations, as well as individual unions, the American Trucking \nAssociation, representing that industry, and auto users, represented by \nAAA?\n  The answer is ``no.''\n  The coalition includes bicyclists, engineers, local government, \ntransit agencies--virtually anyone who builds, maintains, or depends \nupon our transportation system.\n  For all the rhetoric about ``strengthening the economy,'' this will \nbe the one proven way of putting several million people to work at \nfamily-wage jobs while it reduces the deficit and strengthens our \ncommunities from coast to coast. Every State, every metropolitan area, \nevery rural region of America would benefit both by the transportation \nimprovements as well as the economic impact this work will create.\n  This has been recognized by independent analysts, editorials in major \nnewspapers, and in small newspapers all across the country. There \nreally is no controversy.\n  Indeed, in the over two dozen States that have raised transportation \nrevenue since 2012, the legislators who voted for more transportation \nrevenue got reelected by a higher percentage than the legislators who \nvoted against it. It is broadly supported, not politically \ncontroversial, and is desperately needed.\n  I am glad my colleagues were able to reach a compromise on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee and put forward some \ninteresting ideas. It gives a hint of what could happen if we had a \nreal funding source, which we don't; and the bill being marked up \nraises more questions, therefore, than it answers. Even if the House \nwere to embrace it unanimously, we would still be where we were 3 \nmonths ago, 6 months ago, and many times before that.\n  We are facing another short-term extension--this will be the 35th--\nand are providing zero assurance or long-term certainty to the many who \nrely on our transportation system. No country became great building its \ninfrastructure 8 months at a time.\n  We can have markups and pass a reauthorization shell on the floor of \nthe House; but until we embrace H.R. 680 and raise the gas tax, finding \nrevenue that is sustainable, dedicated, and big enough to do the job, \nwe are still going to be spinning our wheels; and America will be \nstuck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7093-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7093-H7094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASHLEY MITCHELL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, this morning, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration announced that last month was the warmest \nSeptember in recorded history. Our reality can no longer be ignored. \nClimate change is here, and communities across the country--and the \nworld--are feeling its effects. Just take the events we have seen \nunfold in 2015 as an example.\n  In April, drought-stricken California witnessed a snowpack with \nvirtually no snow. On the other side of the country, Boston recorded \nits snowiest year with 110 inches between July 2014 and June 2015. \nBoston had so much snow, it did not melt until mid-July. 2015 also \nbrought us the wettest months ever recorded in the U.S. within the 121 \nyears of NOAA's recordkeeping; and this year, Tropical Storm Ana became \nthe second-earliest tropical storm in history to make landfall in the \nU.S., in early May.\n  So what does all of this mean?\n  It means that we are no longer at a place where talking about climate \nchange is enough. We need to act, and we need to act now.\n  I am proud that we have a President who is taking actions like \nreducing dangerous greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. \nAltering our current policies and enacting new ones will help reduce \nthe impacts of climate change in the future. But mitigation is only one \npiece of the solution. We also need to adapt our policies to handle the \neffects of our already-changing climate in the present.\n  Climate change is already happening; and adaptation to climate change \nis the only way we can help protect the people, the infrastructure, \nbusinesses, and ecosystems that are already threatened. We know that \nsocieties have adjusted to and have coped with changes in climate with \ndifferent degrees of success; but our modern life is tailored to the \nstable climate we have been accustomed to. As the President recently \npointed out, our climate is changing faster than we are adapting to it.\n  While climate change is a global issue, it is often felt on a hyper-\nlocal scale, so our cities have to be at the front line of adaptation. \nWe need communities that have better flood defenses, plans for dealing \nwith higher temperatures and heat waves, as well as better management \nof our water storage and use. Some cities are already taking steps to \ncreate these adaptation plans. Roughly 20 percent of cities around the \nglobe have adopted adaptation strategies. My city of Chicago is \nincluded on that list.\n  The most obvious changes that Chicago is dealing with are hotter \nsummers and more intense heat waves. Increased temperatures are leading \nto countless unforeseen consequences, such as heat-related illness and \na deterioration in air quality. Higher temperatures are also boosting \nthe demand for electricity, placing stress on our power plants. Heavy \nrains and snow are becoming more frequent in winter and spring. \nIncreasing downpours make travel more dangerous, pollute our drinking \nwater, damage crops, and disrupt infrastructure and transportation \nacross the city.\n  But adaptation means more than protecting our cities. We must also \nprotect our national defense. Many of our most critical military \ninstallations are already at risk.\n  A 2011 National Research Council report found that 128 U.S. military \nsites could be impacted by a sea-level rise of just 3 feet. Of those \n128 sites, 56 are naval facilities valued at $100 billion. Recent \nhurricanes have pushed water levels to dangerous heights in Norfolk, \nVirginia, threatening the largest naval base in the world. As sea \nlevels rise and storms intensify, climate change threatens to require \nthe relocation of that naval base.\n  This proves that local and State efforts are simply not enough. We \nneed congressional action to produce lasting solutions that address the \nroot causes of climate change and to prepare us for a very different \nfuture.\n  In closing, I defer to Charles Darwin, who said, ``It is not the \nstrongest of the species that survives nor the most intelligent; it is \nthe one that is most adaptable to change.''\n  I urge my colleagues to heed this warning and adapt to the reality in \nfront of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7094-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7094-H7095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SENSE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to paint a picture of the \nincredible progress of an industry that is making my district in \nwestern Pennsylvania a better place to work and live.\n  For many years, the coal industry has been an important part of the \neconomy in Pennsylvania. Historic mining activity, unfortunately, left \nbehind large piles of coal refuse. These piles consist of lower-quality \ncoal mixed with rock and dirt.\n  For a long time, we did not have the technology to use this material, \nso it accumulated in large piles in cities and towns, close to schools \nand neighborhoods, and in fields across the region. This has led to a \nnumber of environmental problems: vegetation and wildlife have been \nharmed, the air has been polluted, acid mine drainage has impaired \nnearby rivers and streams, and problems compound when these piles catch \nfire.\n  The cost to clean up all of this is astronomical. Pennsylvania's \nenvironmental regulator estimates that fixing abandoned mine lands \ncould take over $16 billion, $2 billion of which would be needed for \nthe coal refuse piles alone. We needed an innovative solution to this \ntough challenge. A commonsense compromise was necessary to get the job \ndone and protect the environment. That is where the coal refuse to \nenergy industry comes in.\n  Using advanced technology, they have been able to use this previously \nunusable fuel to generate electricity. This activity powers remediation \nefforts that have, so far, been successful in removing over 200 million \ntons of coal refuse and repairing formerly polluted sites. I visited \nthe Nanty Glo waste coal site, in my district, earlier this week and \nwitnessed the massive transformation this area has undergone.\n  In this picture, you can see an example of the progress that has been \nmade across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In the foreground are the \nremnants of a coal refuse pile that is up to 40 feet deep. In the \ndistance, you can see what used to be a coal refuse pile that is almost \ncompletely restored. A little bit of work remains. This hillside has \nbeen restored, and, soon, it will be covered with trees and wildlife. \nThis is an example of the environmental progress that is being made.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  The Nanty Glo site is one of the many examples of the good work being \ndone by the coal refuse energy industry in Pennsylvania and in historic \ncoal sites across the country.\n  We can all agree that we want to be good stewards of our natural \nresources and to use them as efficiently as possible. We also want to \nensure that regulations do not hamper job creation, the economy, and \nopportunity for our families.\n\n[[Page H7095]]\n\n  Unfortunately, expanding EPA regulations threatens to bring much of \nthe waste coal industry's activity to a halt. That would leave billions \nof dollars of vital cleanup unfinished and hurt jobs and Pennsylvania's \nenergy security.\n  A lot of people in Washington like to offer up a false choice between \nprotecting the environment and economic opportunity. The success of the \ncoal refuse industry shows that that does not have to be the case.\n  This week I am introducing a commonsense approach to keeping these \nfacilities open while holding them to tough standards. We are calling \nthis bill the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, \nor SENSE Act, for short.\n  The bill addresses problems arising from two of the EPA's more \nexpansive rules: the mercury and air toxin standards and the Cross-\nState Air Pollution Rule, known as CSAPR.\n  Under CSAPR, which relies on allocations to limit emissions, we are \nrequesting that the status quo remain in place with regard to sulphur \ndioxide emissions for bituminous coal refuse-fired power generators. \nDue to the nature of the coal refuse, these facilities would be unable \nto comply with a new standard that is expected in 2017. Under the \nmercury and air toxin standards rule, we are proposing to hold the \nindustry to alternative limits for hydrogen chloride or sulphur dioxide \nemissions.\n  Consistent with this legislation, Senators Toomey and Casey recently \noffered an amendment in the Senate exempting these plans from both the \nMATS and CSAPR requirements. While this proposal was supported by a \nbipartisan majority of Senators, it failed to achieve the supermajority \nrequired to pass.\n  This shouldn't be a controversial or partisan issue. We want to hold \nthis industry to high standards, but standards that they can actually \nachieve. My bill will help keep the coal refuse industry in business so \nthat the local community, economy, and environment will continue to \nreap the benefits. The fact that this industry performs such a vital \nenvironmental function means that we owe it to our communities to \nrecognize these circumstances and do everything we can to allow them to \nkeep up the good work.\n  Dennis Simmers, an engineer with Colver Power Project in Cambria \nTownship and a long-time resident of the area, told me why he hopes my \nlegislation is signed into law and the waste coal industry can go \nforward. ``It's personal,'' he said. ``Three generations of my family \nlived in Nanty Glo. Unfortunately, they died without ever seeing this \nenvironmental catastrophe corrected. There is a real shot now that I \nwill see that in my lifetime.''\n  With my legislation, I am working to ensure his vision becomes a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7095-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTHCARE WITHIN CA-46\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today a \nlittle disheartened, disheartened because my colleagues across the \naisle seem to have forgotten about the priorities and the needs of the \nAmerican people.\n  For an unprecedented 61st time, the majority has introduced a measure \nthat would cripple the landmark Affordable Care Act. The consequences \nof such a budget measure would be terrible. Millions of Americans would \nlose their healthcare insurance, and premiums for others would \nskyrocket.\n  The majority claims that the ACA somehow is ineffective, costly, or \nillegal. They claim that it doesn't work. Well, they are just wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is working. It has been working. \nIt has been working in my hometown. It has been working in Orange \nCounty, California, under the Affordable Care Act, the CHIP, and \nMedicaid. We have expanded insurance to over 12.3 million individuals; \n2.6 million of those individuals are Latinos.\n  Costs under the ACA have been greatly reduced, and the ACA is \nprojected to save the United States $200 billion in the next decade and \nover $1 trillion in the second decade. I would say that those \nstatistics speak to the success of the Affordable Care Act.\n  The ACA has had great success back home in my home district. In \nOrange County, we had the highest number of new people enroll into the \nhealthcare benefit exchange that we have in California. Currently, \nthere are more than 1.3 million Californians that now have health \ninsurance that didn't have it before.\n  See, Mr. Speaker, before the enactment of the ACA, the folks in my \ndistrict--well, they considered it a luxury. They chose between buying \nclothes for their kids to go to school or putting food on the table. Or \nworse, they used home remedies.\n  I know because I grew up on home remedies. I grew up not going to the \ndoctor. I grew up trying all these crazy things at home, having a \nsimple flu, and being out of school for 10 days because we couldn't \nafford to go to the doctor. It is pretty unacceptable in today's time, \nMr. Speaker, in the greatest country in the world.\n  Health care should be a right, not a privilege. We need to continue \nmoving forward. We need to continue moving our communities from a \nculture of coping to a culture of coverage.\n  No longer do people have to worry about being denied for their \nexisting health conditions. Quality health insurance is now available \nto all who seek it. Because nearly 4 out of every 10 people in my \ndistrict are Medicare recipients, I understand how important this \nlegislation is for working families; so I will continue to work to join \nwith my community-based organizations to ensure that our people are \ncovered.\n  So tomorrow, when my colleagues across the aisle once again vote--\nnumber 61--to defund the Affordable Care Act, I would like for them to \nthink about all the families in America that will suffer when that is \npassed; think of all the families; think about all the kids and their \nhome remedies.\n  My colleagues in the minority and I have stood up. We have tried to \nexplain to the other side the importance of the Affordable Care Act, \nonly to have our passionate voices fall on deaf ears.\n  Despite these continuous attacks against an existing law which has \nimproved the lives of millions of Americans, I will continue to fight \nfor quality health care for the folks back home in my district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7095-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7095-H7096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OBAMACARE IS FAILING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk for a few minutes this \nmorning about the families that are suffering under the false promises \nof ObamaCare. We are beginning to see this play out all across the \ncountry. The ObamaCare failings are very pronounced; and you see them \nin the communities; and you understand how they are affecting lives.\n  Now, the supporters of ObamaCare continue to have blinders on about \nthis; and they don't want to admit that the entire premise is a theory, \nnot proven. It was change for the sake of change. It was change for the \nsake of centralized control. It was change for the sake of the \narrogance of the elite making decisions for millions of Americans and \ndetermining what kind of health care they were going to be able to \naccess.\n  We all remember that the press said that the biggest fabrication of \nthe decade was, if you like your doctor, you can keep him. It is all so \nunfortunate.\n  I want to look, Mr. Speaker, for just a few minutes at what has \nhappened with these co-ops that are now failing. The failings are very \npronounced, and they truly have an imprint and an effect in our \ncommunities.\n  One month before the ObamaCare-funded Oregon co-op announced its \nfailure in bankruptcy, the CEO said she saw a ``long health life in \nfront of us.'' They had a $50 million Federal loan, if you will, and \nhad managed to enroll only 10,000 people. Now the taxpayers are \nbeginning to wonder if that loan is ever going to be repaid.\n  Take a look at Colorado. In the Colorado co-op, the same story; 72 \nmillion taxpayer dollars, and they enrolled 83,000 people. Do the math \non what the enrollment alone is costing the American taxpayer, and do \nthe math on what kind of healthcare access could\n\n[[Page H7096]]\n\nhave been if individuals were going straight to the marketplace.\n  We have heard Kentucky celebrated as being such a success story and \nthe poster child for the success of ObamaCare. Here is the truth: they \nhave $146 million in Federal loans and then another $65 million in an \nemergency solvency loan. They have 51,000 people in a co-op that is not \nfunctioning.\n  And in Tennessee, where our co-op is going under, $73 million, and \nthey had 27,000 people enrolled.\n  Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to say, \noh, ObamaCare has been such a success. If you do the math and look at \nthe numbers, I take issue with that. I would not term that a success. I \nterm it a failure.\n  I wonder if the people in Oregon and Colorado, Kentucky and Tennessee \nare feeling success as they, once again, find out that simply having an \ninsurance card is not health care. It is access to the queue, if the \ncompany is solvent and the queue exists.\n  Imagine, four States, a collective nearly $500 million for \nexperiments. That is half a billion taxpayer dollars for experiments in \nhealth insurance delivery, all before anybody received any mental \nhealth help or received a single mammogram or a single child's vaccine.\n  We know that ObamaCare is too expensive to afford; and, for all too \nmany, it is too expensive to use once they get the insurance. It is \nproving to be a failure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7096-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express strong \nsupport for the people and nation of Israel and to wholly condemn the \nhorrific acts of violence targeting innocent civilians.\n  My heart goes out to the families of the victims. All people have the \nright to live in peace and security, and every nation has the right to \ntake actions to protect its citizens.\n  As chaos envelopes Israel from all borders, we must stand stalwartly \nwith our strongest ally in the region. Over the past month, unprovoked \nPalestinian attacks against Israeli civilians, including children, \npolice officers, and members of the IDF, have increased to shocking \nlevels.\n  Perhaps even more disturbing are the Palestinian leadership's recent \nincitements to violence. In a September 30 address, Palestinian \nAuthority President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the United Nations, saying \nthat Palestinians would no longer be bound by their commitments to the \nOslo Accords. One day later, Palestinians ambushed two Jewish Israelis, \nRabbi Eitam and Naama Henkin, murdering them in front of their \nchildren. Since then, barbaric terrorist attacks against civilians, \nincluding stabbings, rock throwing, and deliberate car crashes, have \nbecome all too commonplace.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  We have seen a 15-year-old teenager stabbed in Jerusalem, two rabbis \nstabbed and killed in the Old City, five people attacked with a \nscrewdriver in Tel Aviv, and a driver intentionally hitting civilians \nat a bus stop, then getting out of the car with a sharp object and \ncausing more bloodshed and destruction in broad daylight.\n  These are only some of the innocent victims of this deplorable \nviolence. Rather than showing leadership and calling for common \ncivility, President Abbas and other Palestinian leaders have chosen to \nfurther incite violence.\n  President Abbas has perpetuated false accusations about the Israeli \nGovernment's treatment of Palestinians and undermined the Israeli \nGovernment's assurance that it seeks to maintain the status quo on the \nTemple Mount.\n  Mr. Speaker, I continue to support the United States' longstanding \npolicy of supporting our partners for peace in the region to reach a \ntwo-state solution. However, the Palestinian Authority's words and lack \nof action to quell the violence calls into question those partnerships.\n  I call on the international community to speak out against these \nbrutal terrorist attacks. In addition, we must put pressure on those \nwho are taking inflammatory actions that deliberately fuel tensions.\n  Just yesterday six countries submitted a resolution to UNESCO with \nthe sole intention of delegitimizing Jewish history in our own Holy \nLand. This is disgraceful. I applaud the efforts of this administration \nto oppose this harmful and incendiary resolution.\n  We must unequivocally condemn terrorist attacks and actions wherever \nand whenever they take place. These violent attacks against Jews in \nIsrael are part of growing anti-Semitism around the globe. Tragically, \nover the past few years in particular, we have seen a rise in anti-\nSemitism from the streets of Paris to the streets of Miami Beach in my \ndistrict.\n  Around the world, we have seen the spread of a violent and depraved \nideology aimed at crushing the values that we hold dear: the freedom to \npractice and celebrate our own diverse religions and cultures; the \nright to express ourselves in print and in speech; the right to live in \nour homelands and walk in our streets with dignity, respect, and \nsafety. We must stand up and speak out whenever these rights are \nthreatened.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs, I am proud to advocate for strong \nfunding and cooperation with Israel on matters of mutual interest.\n  As our strategic and democratic ally, we must bolster efforts to \nensure that Israel has the necessary resources she needs to be secure \nand confront the violent threats against her. The rise in violence in \nIsrael and of anti-Semitism more broadly is deeply troubling to me, as \na lawmaker who values and respects the strong U.S.-Israel relationship; \nbut it also impacts me more personally, as a Jew who feels a \nsignificant and historic connection to the land of Israel.\n  No nation on Earth can be expected to sit back and take these kinds \nof attacks on her citizens without responding.\n  President Abbas and Palestinian leaders must take clear and \nmeaningful steps to stop this violence and encourage unity and a return \nto the path toward a peaceful two-state solution. There is absolutely \nno justification for violence against innocent civilians under any \ncircumstances, and I call for those responsible for these vicious \nterrorist attacks to be brought to swift justice.\n  I proudly and firmly stand behind Israel's right to defend herself \nagainst malicious, brutal terrorist attacks from outside her borders \nand from within, and call on others here and around the world to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7096-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7096-H7097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NDAA VETO THREAT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Carter) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House for 5 \nminutes and talk about what the President is saying he is going to do \non the NDAA.\n  The President is determined to end his second term on a spending \nspree, and that spending spree will threaten the national defense of \nthis country and hold our military hostage. He is showing his lack of \nleadership by threatening to veto the NDAA, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I ask you, Mr. Speaker, does this President not understand that the \nNDAA provides the resources for the military to do their jobs, to \nprotect our great Nation and the freedom that we all enjoy?\n  The President is willing to jeopardize our national security in favor \nof more welfare programs. He threatens this reckless veto in spite of \nthe fact that the NDAA has passed for 53 years in a row, a rare display \nof bipartisanship in this city.\n  The American people have had enough of political games. They are \ntired of them. Just turn on the radio and television, and see if you \ncan't learn that. It is especially important when it jeopardizes the \nmen and women of our military and our national security.\n  It is hard to find a worse example of leadership than a Commander in \nChief who is so irresponsible that he is willing to deny his military \nresources and sacrifice the security of our Nation\n\n[[Page H7097]]\n\nsimply for political games. Even more importantly is that, and that \nsolid statement is exactly what is going on at the White House as he \napproaches this veto.\n  I would hope that he would realize that people--men and women, of all \nages, from the chief of staff of the Army all the way down to the \nlowest private--have gone and risked their lives fighting for freedom \nand for liberty for the last 12 years; and they are being rewarded by a \nPresident that won't even back them up by passing the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, something that has been passed by every House, every \nSenate, and every President for the last 53 years.\n  His reasoning is, I want more money for the welfare programs, which \nhave been plussed-up over the years until some of them are out of \ncontrol. Doesn't he think about the guys out there getting shot at or \nblown up and who must wonder why the Commander in Chief, the person who \nour military ultimately answers to, is not on his side, is not standing \nup for the soldier?\n  In my district, we have sent warfighters from Fort Hood to these \nactions now for 12 years. They deserve the support of this Congress. \nThey deserve the support of the President of the United States.\n  This is a good bill. It is a bill that meets the President's \nstandards that he set for this bill, gives him the increases he \nrequested in this bill; yet, he is going to veto it for his political \nconvenience. This is a shame, a shame on the country, a shame on the \nPresidency.\n  I hope that the President will reconsider. If not, I hope this body \nwill have the strength to override this veto and stand up for the \nAmerican soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7097-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PALESTINIAN TERRORISM IN ISRAEL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, at least nine Israelis have been \nkilled and many wounded in the latest wave of Palestinian terror.\n  Nearly every day in the past few weeks, Palestinians have stabbed, \nshot, or run over innocent Israeli Jews. These terrorists do not care \nwho their victims are. They want to kill as many Jews as possible.\n  Earlier this month, Palestinian terrorists murdered an Israeli couple \ndriving in the West Bank right in front of their terrified children. \nThis level of hate violence has not been seen in this region since the \nsuicide bombings in the 2000s.\n  Why is this happening? What has caused this sudden outbreak of \nterror? The answer is really pretty simple: incitement by Palestinian \nleaders.\n  Just last month, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \npraised violent riots on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; yet, the world \npress ignores his doctrine of murdering Jews. He called Palestinians \nkilled in the clashes ``martyrs, fighting to keep the dirty feet of \nJews out of the holy site.''\n  The Temple Mount is the holiest place in the world for Jews, but \naccording to Israeli law, only Muslims are able to pray there. Israel \nhas no intention of changing the status quo on Temple Mount, but Abbas \nsimply wants to create a charged atmosphere of violence. This \nincitement doesn't just come from his speeches.\n  Get this, Mr. Speaker: Palestinian leaders have turned their schools \ninto virtual incubators to raise children as terrorists. School \ntextbooks in Palestinian schools routinely teach students that Jews are \nevil and have no right to live in Israel. They are not just taught to \nhate; they are even instructed specifically how to stab Jews in these \nschool textbooks.\n  As all of this incitement translates into real violence that kills \nJews and injures Israelis, what has Israel done in response? Israel has \nreacted how any democratic country would react to defend its people. \nThe policy is simple: if a terrorist is wielding a knife and is \nspotted, Israeli security is ordered to shoot that terrorist.\n  Israel has also increased its arrests of terrorists in the West Bank, \nincluding the cofounder of Hamas, a terrorist group. To deter more \nmurderous attacks, Israel has destroyed the homes of terrorists who \nhave attacked its citizens. Perhaps these terrorists will think twice \nabout killing people: women, children, and men.\n  What exactly has our government said about this huge wave of \nPalestinian terrorism? When Israel is up against the wall, fending off \ndaily attacks, the State Department says that Israel may be using \nexcessive force. Is killing someone who tries to kill you considered \nexcessive force? When did self-defense become excessive force?\n  Secretary Kerry went as far as to blame the current Palestinian \nviolence on Israeli construction in the West Bank. Mr. Kerry is totally \nuninformed about what the facts are on the ground. Does Secretary Kerry \nmean to say that Israeli civilians deserve to be murdered? That is \ntantamount to saying that 9/11 occurred because of America's foreign \npolicy in the Middle East.\n  This dangerous logic by the State Department only encourages more \nterrorist attacks. It does not stop the terrorism. Nothing can justify \nthe killing of innocents.\n  Instead of our government supporting our Israeli allies, we are \nturning our backs on them. Instead, we should be standing side by side \nwith Israel, condemning the terrorists. We should be pointing our \nfingers at the Palestinian leadership who have instigated all of this \nviolence; hold those who preach hate and violence accountable, not give \nthem a pass. Instead of calling out Israel, the State Department should \nbe highlighting the incitement to hatred and violence in the \nPalestinian curriculum, in their textbooks.\n  We must stop making excuses for terrorists and stand up for the \nvictims. We must stand up for all of our values and our friends and not \nbetray them. That includes standing with Israel.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7097-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the EPA is at it again. A few weeks ago, \nthis runaway agency released its most expensive regulation in history. \nThe new ozone rule joins a number of other costly, expansive, and \ncrippling regulations put out by the EPA during the Obama \nadministration. According to the EPA's own estimates, this new \nregulation will be one of the most crippling in history, at a cost of \n$1.4 billion a year.\n  While no one disagrees that the protection of air quality is an \nessential responsibility, Hoosiers have a proven track record of being \ngood stewards of the environment and good stewards of the economy. Yet \nthe EPA continues to issue rules that overwhelm Hoosier companies and \nthreaten job creation.\n  We should focus on policies that grow the economy, protect our \nenvironment, and not burying job creators under red tape and mandates.\n  It is time to end the EPA's assault on business. That is why, today, \nI am introducing a resolution of disapproval that would block this \nharmful regulation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7098-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I recently joined my colleagues on the \nGreat Lakes Task Force to ask the White House to support funding for \nthe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative next year.\n  The Great Lakes is the world's largest system of fresh surface water. \nIt supports 1.5 million American jobs and $62 billion in wages.\n  In western New York, Lake Erie is the focus of an amazing \ntransformation of Buffalo's waterfront. Keeping the lake clean for \nrecreation and fishing is essential to sustaining that economic growth.\n  The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has also been instrumental in \nthe next phase of Buffalo's waterfront renaissance, the Buffalo River. \n$30 million in funding to clean up the river has leveraged $20 million \nin private investment. Now the river that the Federal Government \ndeclared biologically dead in 1968 will be swimmable and fishable in 5 \nyears.\n  The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is creating jobs and improving \nenvironmental quality in my community, and it is producing returns for \nthe national economy.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Great Lakes Restoration \nInitiative funding in the upcoming budget negotiations and to support \nthe passage of the Great Lakes Restoration Act, which would authorize \nthis program through 2020.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7098-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  (Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS.

It was those teachings that inspired and drove their \nsons, Pete and Joseph, to enlist in the U.S. armed services and defend \nour Nation. Ever since World War II, every generation of the Ortiz \nfamily, totaling over 50 family members, have bravely served in \nAmerica's Armed Forces, putting their lives on the line to protect our \nfreedoms.\n  For their selfless and honorable service, I am proud to recognize the \nvalor and sacrifices of the Ortiz family.\n  Thank you for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7099-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING DEBBIE NYE SEMBLER\n\n  (Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOLLY.

The value of the products produced \nin and shipped from North Carolina is more than $10 billion.\n  America's forests keep our air and water clean while providing \nrenewable energy, wildlife habitat, and recreation. They are also an \neconomic generator, especially in the Nation's rural communities, \ndelivering the paper and manufactured products we rely on every day.\n  We are grateful for this industry in North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7099-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WHITE HOUSE FELLOWS PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BARTON.

I served with the \nformer Governor of South Carolina, James B.

Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday night, right after dark, \nOfficer Randolph Holder of the NYPD heard on his radio, ``Shots \nfired.'' He immediately rushed toward the gunfire in East Harlem. He \narrived, but was gunned down by an outlaw. Holder was assassinated with \na shot to the head.\n  Just 33 years old, Randolph Holder was an immigrant from Guyana. \nAccording to his aunt, his job was first in his life. He cherished the \nopportunity to become a policeman here in America.\n  He was a third-generation police officer, following in the footsteps \nof his father and grandfather, who served as peace officers in Guyana. \nRandolph was proud to be the first in his family to serve in that \ncapacity in America. His killer was a hardened, violent criminal who \nshouldn't have been on our streets, according to the mayor.\n  Mr. Speaker, the war on police officers has resulted in 31 officers \nbeing killed in the line of duty just this year. The badge that \nrepresents safety for most is a target for some. Those in blue do a job \nthat many of us would never do. So we owe them all, like Officer \nHolder, our extreme appreciation for taking care of the rest of us.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7100-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETOING THE NDAA IS IRRESPONSIBLE\n\n  (Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a simple request. Every \nday across the globe men and women of the United States Armed Forces \nmake grave sacrifices for our country and are courageously protecting \nus from a number of evils.\n  From an Iranian regime pursuing a nuclear weapon to the self-\nproclaimed Islamic State terrorizing the Middle East, to Russia looking \nto expand its influence in a world where American leadership is on the \ndecline, we rely on the men and women in uniform to keep us safe.\n  In Congress, we are tasked with supporting our military, promoting \nlegislation that will give them the tools they need and providing for \ntheir families stationed back home.\n  The House and Senate fulfilled these responsibilities by passing the \nNational Defense Authorization Act in an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nfashion, reassuring our military that, as they protect us, we will \nsupport them.\n  It is totally irresponsible for the President to veto this bill while \nour troops are in harm's way, and I call on all Members of Congress to \njoin together to override the bill. There is nothing political or \npartisan about the support for our military, and it is outrageous that \nthe President would take this action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7100-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                JASON SPRADLEY ATTAINS EAGLE SCOUT RANK\n\n  (Mr. FLEMING asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Speaker, today I want to give special recognition to \na special individual.\n  Jason Spradley was recently awarded the Eagle Scout designation, the \nhighest rank in the Boy Scouting program. He is a senior at Airline \nHigh School in Bossier City and hopes to pursue law and become a JAG \nofficer in the Navy.\n  While Jason is just 17 years old, he has worked over a decade to \nreach this Eagle Scout status. The qualifications state a Boy Scout \nmust earn 21 merits to reach this level. Jason earned almost 40.\n  These young men earn merits by proving their skills in camping, first \naid, and many more, but more than learning how to fish or start a fire, \nBoy Scouts learn about serving their community. Obedience, loyalty, and \nmany other characteristics make up what we know to be a true leader.\n  The Boy Scouts motto is ``Be prepared.'' I would say Jason and these \nyoung men have already built a solid foundation in their lives. I wish \nhim, the rest of the members in troop 105 in Louisiana, and the many \nother young men across the country who have attained Eagle Scout the \nvery best. I know that they all have a bright future ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7100-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK\n\n  (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrate National Forest \nProducts Week, and I rise to recognize the important contributions of \nour wood products across Montana and the country.\n  In my home State alone, we have more than 20 million acres of timber. \nWe have 12 sawmills that employ thousands of Montanans; yet, we can't \ncut a tree in Montana. The number of lumber products has gone down \nbecause we can't figure out in this body how to cut a tree without a \nlawsuit.\n  There is a bipartisan bill in the Senate, the Resilient Federal \nForests Act, that passed out of this body bipartisan, and the Senate is \nnot picking it up. We are not going to hear about forest fires from now \nuntil the end of winter, but they are there, and it is time to act.\n  When a bipartisan bill comes out of this House and the Senate refuses \nto pick it up, it has consequences on Montana, and it has consequences \non hardworking families that just want to make a living in the timber \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7100-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE LESS SAFE\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last Sunday the \nPresident's Iranian nuclear deal, a tragic mistake, went into effect. \nInstead of making the world safer, as promised, American families have \nbecome less safe. As reported in The Post and Courier of Charleston, \nsince the Iran deal was reached, the Iranian regime tested a ballistic \nmissile that could reach Israel, in direct violation of U.N. \nresolutions.\n  After the test of the missile, the Iranian defense minister said: \n``We don't ask permission from anyone.'' This does not come as a \nsurprise. We know the Iranian regime cannot be trusted. Sadly, it is \nshocking that the President has dismissed the Iranian regime's flagrant \ndisregard of international rules and still insists that Iran will \nuphold their part of the deal.\n  The evidence is overwhelming that the Iranian regime will break the \nagreement, with billions of dollars for new attacks. The President's \nlegacy is American families at risk of terrorist attacks by jihadists \nand a rogue regime oppressing the people of Iran.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops. The President, by his actions, \nmust never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. \nTomorrow is the gruesome 32nd anniversary of the murder of 241 \nAmericans at the marine barracks in Beirut by Iran.

I had the privilege of meeting a very inspiring \npatient during the Energy and Commerce's work on 21st Century Cures \nlegislation. Madison, a young girl diagnosed with Down Syndrome, had \nfour major open-heart surgeries all before her 3rd birthday.\n  An estimated 50 percent of children born with Down Syndrome have some \nform of heart defect, like Madison; yet, her surgeries are still fairly \nnew in the medical world.

The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I want to start with the end of what our \nReading Clerk read before I get to the excitement in the beginning.\n  At the end, what you heard was some blanket authority to consider \nwhat I will call housekeeping measures here in the House, and not \nbecause Republicans say so, not because Democrats say so, but because \nRepublicans and Democrats come together, consult with one another, and \ntry to find those issues on which we agree to bring forward.\n  I sit on the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker. The best thing that \nhappens in this institution is when a bill comes through the Rules \nCommittee, because my colleague Ms. Slaughter and I always make it \nbetter. We always make it better.\n  But we include authority to avoid the Rules Committee for some of \nthese issues that are going to come to the floor fast and furious. Here \nwe are, at the end of a cycle. We are in a leadership change here in \nthe House. You don't know what might happen. What the Rules Committee \ndid last night was to create a pathway to allow the House to continue \nits business at a moment's notice, and I am glad that we included that \nprovision in here. We also include same-day consideration authority.\n\n[[Page H7102]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the things that happened when the big freshman \nclass that I was elected with in 2010 came is we said, for Pete's \nsakes, we need time to read the bills. We need to follow the rules and \nmake sure that all Members have a chance to get deep into the \ninformation and legislation.\n  That persists still today. We have a process today that allows \nMembers to get involved in that legislation. But we still have those \nemergency times here in this Chamber where something has to happen in a \nhurry. Whether we are talking about borrowing authority, spending \nauthority, whether we are talking about something for our troops, \nsomething for our veterans, things still happen on a moment's notice.\n  What we have included in here is the ability to bring things more \nquickly to the floor here in the next short period of time. That is \nimportant from a housekeeping perspective, Mr. Speaker, but that is not \nwhat is important about this rule today.\n  What is important about this rule today is that 4\\1/2\\ years ago, the \npeople of the great State of Georgia, its Seventh District, sent me to \nCongress. I was placed on the Budget Committee in this Congress, the \nBudget Committee, the committee that writes the framework by which the \nentire $3.5 trillion Federal Government is funded. We got together and \nwe worked hard here in the House, Mr. Speaker, and we produced a \nbudget, but the Senate did nothing.\n  I came back that second year, 2012. We worked hard here in the House. \nTogether, we produced a budget, but the Senate did nothing. We came \nback again 2013, worked hard here in the House, produced a budget, but \nthe Senate produced nothing.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are here today to do--what we are here today to \ndo--is made possible for one reason, and one reason only. That is \nbecause, for the first time since 2001, Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether in the House; Republicans and Democrats came together in the \nSenate. We passed a budget; they passed a budget. We conferenced a \nbudget, and America has a balanced budget which it lives under for the \nfirst time in 15 years--for the first time in 15 years.\n  Now, what does that mean?\n  It is not all that exciting to read the budget, Mr. Speaker. I \nrecommend it to you if you haven't gotten into the details. I recommend \nit to anybody who hasn't gotten into the details.\n  But that is not what is exciting. It is not the numbers in the budget \nthat are exciting. What is exciting is that, because we came together, \nnot because we had our ideas and they had their ideas, but because we \ncame together, we have triggered a process called reconciliation.\n  Now, I am saddened that reconciliation is now in the lexicon of the \nAmerican people. It is not an important word that folks need to know \nexcept for the fact that it gives us access to do things on their \nbehalf that we wouldn't have been able to do before.\n  I am so pleased that the Secretary of the Senate sent that message \nover right before we got up to say that the Senate has just acted on \ntwo pieces of House legislation. One of those, enacted with no \namendments, is going to be on its way to the President's desk. One, \ndone with amendments, we are going to have to consider that again.\n  So often we do such good work, the 435 of us together in this \nChamber, and it does not get past a Senate filibuster. Mr. Speaker, the \nfilibuster is designed to protect the rights of the minority. \nRepublicans use it when they are in the minority; Democrats use it when \nthey are in the minority; but it prevents the people's business from \nmoving forward.\n  Not so today. Not so today. Because we got together in the House with \na budget and the Senate with a budget, because we brought a budget \ntogether, we are now in the process of reconciliation, which allows us \nto have the people's will be done. Fifty-one votes in the Senate now \nwill move legislation forward, as it relates to balancing the budget.\n  You remember, Admiral Mullen, he said, Mr. Speaker, the greatest \nthreat to American national security wasn't a military threat. He said \nit was our Federal budget deficit.\n  We have done such an amazing job collaboratively in this Chamber \nworking on the one-third of the budget pie called discretionary \nspending. That is the spending that we have to work on here every year. \nWhat we have failed to do together is work on the two-thirds of the pie \ncalled mandatory spending, where the real growth in those budget \nprograms occurs. But that failure ends today.\n  With the passage of this rule, we will move to consider the first \nreconciliation package that has come to Congress in the 4\\1/2\\ years \nthat I have been here, made possible by the first balanced budget \nagreement that Congress has come to since 2001.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is why--this is why--I came to Congress, and we are \ndoing it together here today.\n  Let me tell you what is in this bill. I have seen it described in the \npress as a complete and total repeal of the President's healthcare \nbill. That is nonsense. I would support such an effort if we could \nbring such an effort to the floor, but that is not what this bill is \ntoday. What this bill is today is a group of commonsense, budget-\nsaving, spending-reprioritizing measures.\n  I will give you an example. There is a medical excise tax that the \nPresident's healthcare law put into effect. It is 2.3 percent. It is an \nexcise tax, a gross receipts tax on all medical innovation in this \ncountry as it relates to devices. We all know the power to tax is the \npower to destroy. There is not one Member in this Chamber who supports \ndestroying medical innovation, not one--not one.\n  But, back at the time when the Congressional Budget Office said the \nPresident's healthcare bill was going to cost $1 trillion, the \nPresident said: I am not going to spend a penny more than $1 trillion. \nI am going to make sure it is paid for.\n  He was out there looking hard for money. Turns out, medical \ninnovation was a place he could look. We all see now, in retrospect, \nthat was a terrible idea, much like the other nine bills that we have \npassed here in this House, that they have passed in the Senate, that \nthe President has signed into law to repeal various unworkable parts of \nthe President's healthcare bill. This is just yet another.\n  We can do this together here today, made possible by this first \nbudget agreement that we have had since 2001.\n  The Cadillac tax it is called, Mr. Speaker, another provision that \nthis bill will repeal. It is a Cadillac tax, Mr. Speaker.\n  As we all know, Cadillac is a fine American automobile. You get in a \nCadillac, you feel good. We call it the Cadillac tax because it is on \nhealthcare plans that are too good--too good. Turns out, Mr. Speaker, \nthere are some labor unions in this country that are taking too good of \ncare of their members. Turns out there are some businesses in this \ncountry that are looking after the healthcare needs of their employees \ntoo much. We want to keep that down. The last thing we want in this \ncountry, apparently, is folks having health care that is too good.\n  I tell people all the time, Mr. Speaker, I can make everybody in this \ncountry poor; I just can't pass a law to make everybody rich. We are so \ngood at dumbing down the system for everybody. Well, that is what this \nCadillac tax was designed to do.\n  The labor unions don't like it. Employers don't like it. We all know \nit is not the right thing to do, and in a bipartisan way we have \nintroduced legislation to repeal it. This bill, this rule, gives us an \nopportunity to actually send that to the President's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I won't go on and on about all the good things that are \nin this bill. I am sure my colleague from New York is going to \nhighlight a lot of those herself, and I don't want to steal all the \nthunder.\n  But we are here because 435 of us came together here, 100 came \ntogether there, and America is operating under a conferenced budget, \nand not just a budget, but a balanced budget for the first time since \n2001.\n  A lot of disappointment has come out of Washington, D.C., Mr. \nSpeaker, but we are here on the floor today talking about one of those \nthings we get to celebrate, one of those successes on behalf of the \nfamilies back home, that we have done together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me \nthe time, and I yield myself such time\n\n[[Page H7103]]\n\nas I may consume. I really enjoy serving with him on the Rules \nCommittee because he is always so cheerful and puts such a good face on \neverything, and heaven knows we can use that in the world.\n  But the truth is, Mr. Speaker, and my colleague knows it, that by \ntaking away the funding for the healthcare act, you are killing the \nhealthcare act. That means that people would go back to not having \npreexisting conditions covered.\n  That means that women in eight States and the District of Columbia \nwould face the fact that their insurance companies consider domestic \nviolence to be a preexisting condition, which translates out, if you \nare beaten up once, maybe they will cover you. The second time, it is \nobviously your fault. You have that propensity.\n  We can't go back to the rising cost of health care with so many \nAmericans using the most expensive kind of health care in the world, \nthe emergency room. We are told that if this were to pass, 13 million \nAmericans would lose their health care.\n  But the fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, this is not going to \npass, and we know that. As a matter of fact, I find myself saying over \nand over again the very same things. I remember saying this is the 35th \nvote, this is the 40th vote. This, Mr. Speaker, is the 61st vote, using \ntax money and wasting time, to take health care away from people.\n  Now, I have asked many, many times in the Rules Committee: What is \nthis great urge to prohibit people from having access to health care?\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The best I can come up with is it is not particularly that they don't \ncare about those people, but they want to do something to upset the \nPresident. There was a good deal of talk yesterday that, if we could \nadd a few amendments on here, it would really cause him grief.\n  It is not going to cause him any grief. If this should pass, if the \nSenate should pass it, which is in control of Republicans--and, you \nknow, if you complain about not passing the bill, take it up with \nthem--what we are going to be doing is, if it gets to the President, he \nis going to veto it, and you know very good and well that we don't have \nthe votes here to override. So we are wasting time.\n  We are just wasting time and wasting money. I don't know how many \nmillions of dollars of tax money it has taken with these 61 bills, but \nthen they throw in a little something else here.\n  They say: Let's defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year. Why? I don't \nknow. Three committees in the House of Representatives are studying \nPlanned Parenthood, and we have got to look forward to one of those \nother new select committees which will go over the same thing over and \nover again and come up with the conclusion that Congressman Chaffetz \ncame up with after they grilled the president of Planned Parenthood, \nCecile Richards, for 5 hours, that there was nothing there, that they \nbroke no law.\n  I don't know why the American public is not outraged over the fact \nthat none of their business is taken care of, but over and over and \nover again we talk about taking health care away from people.\n  One in five American women and a lot of men have used Planned \nParenthood and do today. And then you add to that the 13 million people \nthat will lose their health care if this should become law, 3 million \nof them children.\n  Now, what should we be doing? Well, how about the Export-Import Bank. \nIt doesn't cost the taxpayers a dime, puts money back into the \nTreasury. It allows small companies in the United States to be able to \nafford to export their goods to other countries.\n  The loss of that bank has already received from both General Electric \nand Boeing words that they are going to take jobs out of the United \nStates because we don't have it. There is no earthly reason not to have \nit. As I said, it doesn't cost us anything. It makes us money. It is \njust that for some Members of Congress they just don't like it.\n  Now, this is the same majority that has produced no highway bill. We \nreally are on a road to nowhere. For the first time that I have been in \nCongress--a highway bill was always something everybody joined. It was \nalways bipartisan.\n  But we have got roads and bridges crumbling. We have no high-speed \nrail. Airports are overcrowded. Everybody needs help. But we are \nworking here to do something about the healthcare bill that is already \nworking and Planned Parenthood.\n  Now, this is the same majority that brought us the 7 legislative days \naway from risking the full faith and credit of the United States. What \nthat means is that we are refusing--the majority is--to bring up a bill \nhere to pay the debt that they have already incurred. It is the \nCongress that spends the money, and now they decided they don't want to \npay for it. So they are putting that off.\n  We have heard talks that tomorrow we are supposed to have a bill, but \nwe all know--because we all hear everything that is going on--that \nthere are only 170 votes for that bill, which won't pass it. So we may \nnot see it.\n  So what we are going to do today is give everybody in the House of \nRepresentatives an opportunity to protect the full faith and credit of \nthe United States and not risk another downgrade of our credit rating. \nTo downgrade the credit rating of the United States was something that \nall previous Congresses felt was an impossible thing for them to allow.\n  But while this is all festering out there and nothing is being done \nabout it, we are hurling toward another shutdown in mid-December.\n  So once again we find ourselves: Let's take away that health care. \nLet's shut down that thing over there. But let's not deal with the \nissues that we have been sent here, the things that we have been \nelected to do.\n  And one of those has to be to protect the full faith and credit of \nthe United States of America, which has always been done and was a \nresponsibility of all previous Congresses.\n  Now, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the \nreconciliation bill before us will take health care away from 16 \nmillion people, 3 million children, and I might add most of them didn't \nhave any health care at all before the ACA was passed. As I said, it \nwould also defund Planned Parenthood and endanger the health of men and \nwomen across the country. If I haven't said it enough, again, this \ndefunds Planned Parenthood.\n  A scant 3 weeks ago we stood on the floor as the House majority \nthreatened to shut down the government over the funding for Planned \nParenthood. The American public gave a very resounding message to \nCongress: Don't do it. In fact, nearly seven in ten Americans oppose a \ngovernment shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding, according to a \nQuinnipiac poll.\n  With this 61st vote to dismantle the ACA--and make no mistake about \nit. It doesn't say in there we are going to kill this thing. We are \njust going to take the money away from it.\n  And if you are smart enough to be a Member of Congress of the United \nStates, you know that, if you take the money away from it, you have \nkilled that bill. We all understand that. But as the majority continues \nto beat their head up against the brick wall of health care, the \nAmerican people get the headache.\n  This budget reconciliation bill before us does two things. One, it \ntakes health care away from, as I said, 16 million Americans. Two, it \nattacks women's health by defunding Planned Parenthood.\n  I believe that governing this body is a serious job with serious \nconsequences. The brinkmanship that this majority continues to display \nis dangerous to our economy and unsettling to our Nation. The last time \nthe majority shut down the government over the debt limit, it took $24 \nbillion out of this economy.\n  The consequences of this kind of brinkmanship are real. They are not \nimagined. We have been through it once. Why in the world would we self-\ninflict that wound on ourselves again?\n  We should not be pushed to the edge over and over again. We should be \nplanning what we need to do, follow regular order. My dear colleague \nMr. Woodall talked about how wonderfully well Democrats and Republicans \nwork together. I don't know where that is.\n  I know that the chair of the Benghazi Committee kept talking about he \nhad 7 members. There are actually 12 on there. But it just demonstrated \nagain\n\n[[Page H7104]]\n\nthat the 5 Democrats on there did not signify with them.\n  We need to focus on the urgent needs of the Nation, not manufactured \ncrises that we are insisting on creating.\n  To address the real issues, we have got a plan to allow us to pay the \nbills that this Congress has incurred and to protect the full faith and \ncredit of the United States. We always call for this on rules. We do \nsomething called the previous question, which everybody sort of glides \nover.\n\n  This today, what we are doing--when the previous question on this \nrule vote is called, I hope that every Member who wants to do something \nabout the debt limit and the full faith and credit of the United States \nwill vote ``no'' so that our side can bring this up and give everybody \nan opportunity to go home for a weekend without worrying about whether \nthis is going away.\n  By the time we get back here next week, there will be even fewer \nlegislative days to deal with it. But our troops, national security, \nthe whole Federal Government, and most of the people in the United \nStates are very much concerned with what will happen if it shuts down.\n  Let's relieve us of that burden and vote today to deal with the debt \nlimit. I invite all Members to vote for the Democrats' clean, simple \nbill. It doesn't do anything about taking away regulations from the \ngovernment, nothing. It simply deals with the most important matter at \nhand at this point, and that is the full faith and credit of the United \nStates.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I confess. I was sitting over here going through my papers. I was \nafraid I had come down here on the wrong bill here today, listening to \nmy friend describe it. I tell you that, if you listen to that \ndescription and you believe it, you ought to vote ``no.'' But it is \njust not true. It is just not true.\n  In fact, I will go line by line just a little bit. You will not find \na CBO document over there that says House Resolution 483 is going to \ntake health care away from 16 million Americans. We are not going to \nfind it.\n  In fact, you won't find a CBO document that says the underlying bill \nof H.R. 3762 is going to take health care away from anybody because \nsuch a document does not exist.\n  CBO did say that the President's healthcare bill would provide health \ncare for 16 million Americans. Yet, the President has joined with this \nHouse and that Senate nine times so far to repeal errant provisions of \nthat healthcare bill, and that is what we are going to do here in this \nlegislation today.\n  You won't find any language that suggests that House Resolution 483 \nis going to deal with preexisting conditions to set back preexisting \nconditions coverage in any way whatsoever, nor will you find any paper \nthat suggests the underlying bill, H.R. 3672, is going to set back the \nconversation on preexisting conditions.\n  Why? Because the President led on the issue of preexisting \nconditions, Mr. Speaker, much like a great Georgia speaker of this \nHouse, Newt Gingrich, and Bill Clinton got together and did in 1996. \nThey got together and outlawed all preexisting conditions for federally \nregulated plans.\n  What President Obama did in his healthcare bill has said: Well, as \nStates haven't done it on their own, we are going to do it for all \nState-regulated plans, too.\n  This bill doesn't dial that back one iota, not one bit. The \nPresident, I believe, won that debate in America. I don't think we are \never going to revisit that debate.\n  I think that is a success story for families with preexisting \nconditions and, again, something else we ought to be celebrating here \ntoday, Mr. Speaker, not holding our heads low about.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \ntells you that the greatest threat to America's national security is \nour budget deficit--and, at the time that I arrived here in Congress, \nMr. Speaker, in 2010, America was running its largest budget deficit in \nAmerican history, three times the size that they are today--I tell you \na bill like this that goes after those deficit numbers is a critically \nimportant bill. It is the business that my constituents back home sent \nme to be about here in this institution.\n  Now, of course, in the 4\\1/2\\ years that the folks in the Seventh \nDistrict have lent me their voting card, Mr. Speaker, we have brought \nbudget deficits down each and every year--each and every year--year \nafter year after year after year. But that has been primarily on that \ndiscretionary one-third of the pie I talked about, Mr. Speaker.\n  There is so much more work to be done, and reconciliation is the tool \nwe use to get around the filibuster, to allow the people's will to be \ndone with simple majorities on both sides of the Hill.\n  Good news. If you don't believe what is in the underlying bill is \ngood for America, you can vote ``no,'' and if 51 percent of your \ncolleagues agree with you, this bill will not go forward. But that is \nnot going to happen because this is good policy.\n  And good news, Mr. Speaker. When it goes over to the Senate, if the \nSenate does not believe this is good policy for America and 51 Senators \nvote against it, this bill will not go to the President's desk.\n  But that is not going to happen because there is good policy in the \nunderlying bill. This will go to the President's desk.\n  As the President sits today, Mr. Speaker, contemplating vetoing the \nNational Defense Authorization Act--in fact, that may be happening even \nas we are standing here now, that bill that provides authorized funding \nfor all of our troops--I can't possibly predict what he will do when \nthis bill arrives on his desk.\n  But what my friend from New York fails to mention every time she \nmentions that 61 times in this House we have dealt with trying to clean \nup the messes that the Affordable Care Act has created is that 9 of \nthose times the President agreed with us.\n  It is just so critically important, Mr. Speaker. We get wrapped \naround the partisan axle in this body in ways that are tremendously \ndiscouraging to me, as if it is always an us against them proposition. \nIt is not. It is just a proposition about us--about us--320 million of \nus.\n  And nine times so far, Mr. Speaker, just in the short time that I \nhave been in Congress, the House, the Senate, and the President have \ngotten together and said the Affordable Care Act is broken and together \nwe can begin to fix it.\n  I believe this is going to be one of those opportunities as well, Mr. \nSpeaker. It is going to be a tremendous vote, I hope, on passing this \nrule, which will allow us to begin debate. Pass that underlying \nresolution.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I just say once again, no, they don't say: We are going to take away \npreexisting conditions. They just say: We are taking away the funding \nfor the bill.\n  When the funding is taken away, it dies. I think almost all Americans \nunderstand that.\n  I am pleased now to yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the distinguished ranking member \nof the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here today to discuss the rule for \nreconciliation, which I believe we are wasting on a doomed attempt to \nrepeal ObamaCare for the 61st time. That we are doing this again for \nthe 61st time is a problem. But that we are wasting our one shot at \nbudget reconciliation on this is a tremendous shame. We should be using \nthis opportunity to avoid the Senate filibuster to actually make law, \nnot make a point to our bases. The way to do this is by focusing on a \nbipartisan issue: canceling the sequester.\n  Mr. Speaker, the sequester is a unique problem in American public \npolicy, a program that is intentionally designed to be a bad idea. It \ncripples the programs that made the 20th century one of unprecedented \nprogress, and it weakens the bravest military in the world. It is bad \nfor us at home, and it is bad for us overseas.\n  Its blundering destructive approach to deficit reduction was supposed \nto push this Congress to compromise. Unfortunately, we have not gotten \nthere\n\n[[Page H7105]]\n\nbecause a few intransigents refuse to give up this hostage. But it \nisn't this body that is paying the ransom for our inaction on the \nsequester; it is the American people of all walks of life. It is the \nmillions of workers, businesses, public servants, and soldiers who are \nfacing uncertainty and inadequate support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would encourage us to stand up and use this one shot \non something that matters and can pass, and canceling the sequester is \nsomething that both sides could actually agree on. So I urge my \ncolleagues, please, to bring this theater to a close and to return to \nsomething we can all support. Let's use reconciliation to cancel the \nsequester once and for all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if I could say to my friend from Michigan, I think there \nis a lot of wisdom in what he had to say. My friend has been here, Mr. \nSpeaker, since 1965, I believe. I can't remember if he was elected in \n1964 and began service in 1965. He has seen a lot of failures and a lot \nof successes in this institution.\n  Reconciliation exists for one reason and one reason only, and that is \nto do the really hard things that we can't get done in other times. I \nwould say to my friend, Mr. Speaker, that the die has been cast on \nreconciliation for 2015. But as a member of the Budget Committee, I \nwill commit to you that we are going to come back, and we are going to \nget a conferenced balanced budget next year as well. I hear that \ndrumbeat beginning around this institution: What is it that we can get \ndone together? I hope we get this done.\n  Make no mistake, I believe this is good underlying legislation. But \nthe past, well, three decades now since 1980, as I think of the big \nreconciliation measures that have gone through have been things that \nhave changed America for the better forever, and I am grateful to the \ngentleman for reminding us all of the power of this tool.\n  Mr. Speaker, 61 times we have had a vote on the President's \nhealthcare bill, that is true. But it is because there are real \nproblems there--again, nine times of which the President has agreed \nwith us about those real problems.\n  The folks who crafted the President's healthcare bill were smart. I \ndon't have any concerns about the funding that my friend from New York \nhas, Mr. Speaker, because the bill has funding buried in it in such a \nway we don't have any access to it from this institution. That is why \nwe passed 4\\1/2\\ years' worth of legislation here without getting our \narms around that funding.\n  What we are talking about here, Mr. Speaker, are budget deficits. \nWhat we are talking about here is an opportunity to move the needle on \nmandatory spending. What we are talking about here is about $81 billion \nin static scored money, closer to 130 in dynamically scored money, \nmoving the needle on the budget, as Admiral Mullen, then the Chair of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, encouraged us to do.\n  I don't know where the vote is going to come out, Mr. Speaker. I feel \npretty good about it. I feel pretty good about it because it is good \nunderlying policy. I feel pretty good about it because we did this the \nright way. We started in the Budget Committee. We conferenced it with \nthe Senate. We then sent those reconciliation instructions out to the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, the Education and Labor Committee, and \nthe Ways and Means Committee. Each committee did its work, sent that \nwork back to the Budget Committee, and we then brought all that \nlegislation together. Mr. Speaker, if you want a textbook case of how \nit is supposed to work around here, this is it.\n  Now, as a fellow who has been disappointed many times in 4\\1/2\\ years \nin this institution, I am just going to tell my colleagues that if any \nof my new colleagues believe they are going to have it their way every \nday of the week, the answer is no. I was disabused of that notion in \nweek one.\n  But what we can do is bring the collective wisdom of the body \ntogether, the collective wisdom of the body and the collective wisdom \nfrom our committee structures, and this bill does that. There is only \none way to get to this bill, though, Mr. Speaker, and that is to pass \nthis rule today, House Resolution 483, and I encourage my colleagues to \ndo that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the \nunderlying bill. I do so as somebody who comes from a State which, \nunlike maybe the gentleman from Georgia, actually embraced this law. \nThe Governor set up an exchange right away, and we have had what Forbes \nMagazine has described as the highest functioning exchange in the \ncountry. Our uninsured rate went from 8 percent down to 4 percent. We \nhave more insurers in the marketplace today than we did before the ACA \nwas passed.\n  On Labor Day, I was at a picnic with some friends, and there was a \ngentleman there who was the head of HR for the second largest employer \nin this community that I was at. It was about a 300-employee firm, a \ntrash hauler, who was actually quite concerned about the ACA's \ndefinition of part-time and full-time in terms of raising his rates. \nFor the last 2 years, his rates have gone down. He yelled from the pool \nwhere he was playing with his kids, splashing around in the water, \nsaying: Tell President Obama thank you for the Affordable Care Act \nbecause our rates have gone down for the 275 people that worked there.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, then the question is: What does this bill do? The \nfact of the matter is, by eliminating the individual mandate, by \nbasically destroying the financing of tax subsidies, which is precisely \nthe way that you broaden the insurance market so that you can implement \nan elimination of preexisting conditions, you, in fact, are totally \ncapsizing the market.\n  I know that because the State of Connecticut insurance department and \nthe exchange have looked at what this bill is going to do to the \nindividual mandate, and that is precisely what they said the outcome \nwould be, that it would send rates through the roof and \nbasically shatter the success that our State has accomplished.\n\n  What is so ironic about this is that the design of this bill with an \nindividual mandate and tax subsidies for insurance came from the \nHeritage Foundation. Stuart Butler was the mastermind of this back in \nthe 1990s. I was chairman of the Public Health Committee back then, and \nI remember vividly that that was the Heritage Foundation, the \nconservative alternative to healthcare reform, to the Clinton \nhealthcare plan. But, obviously, for political reasons, that is not \nmentioned very much by the majority as we again debate this ad nauseam.\n  What is sad is that 2 weeks ago we passed a bill, H.R. 1624, \nsponsored by my good friend, Mr. Guthrie from Kentucky, which amended \nthe Affordable Care Act. It changed the definition of ``small \nemployer,'' and it was done on a bipartisan basis, completely \nunanimous. It sailed through the House, and President Obama signed it.\n  Why did that work? Because they did it surgically, because Brett was \nsmart enough to understand that if you want to get people to come \ntogether, you don't load it up with a bunch of poison pills, that you \nactually present an idea with focus and with logic behind it. Guess \nwhat will happen. You will actually get bipartisan support, the \ncomplete opposite of the bill that we have before us here today.\n  Now, I want to point out, though, that there are some signs of \nintelligent life in this reconciliation bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marchant). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, section 305 does, as the gentleman from \nGeorgia points out, eliminate the excise tax on high-class plans.\n  It is interesting to note that 5 years ago it was the House Members \nwho pushed hard against that proposal with the administration, and we \ndelayed that tax for 5 years. H.R. 2050, which I am the lead sponsor \nof, I am proud to say we have 166 bipartisan cosponsors. It is verbatim \nthe language that was incorporated into the reconciliation bill.\n  So I point that out because I do think that it, in fact, will \nbasically sharply increase people's out-of-pocket\n\n[[Page H7106]]\n\ndeductibles because that is what actuaries tell us is the only way you \ncan respond to that kind of tax. It is true that 83 organizations, \nincluding organized labor, business groups, and small-business groups \nhave said this is not a workable plan. I mention that here because \nthere is an opportunity here to do what Congressman Guthrie did, which \nis to take an individual component, an idea, and not load it up with a \nlot of other baggage which is going to capsize the insurance market, \nwhich we know is going to happen if other provisions of the \nreconciliation bill are passed, that we can actually get it done.\n  You are giving the White House a perfect excuse to veto this bill and \nrobbing us of the ability to actually address this real problem, which \nsection 305 does recognize, and H.R. 2050 is out there and is on \nstandby for us to move forward on. So let's get rid of the blunt \ninstruments, the baseball bats, and the butchering of this law, and \nlet's focus on bipartisan surgical fixes to real problems.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say to my friend from Connecticut that the point that \nhe made was made very well by the gentleman from Oklahoma last night \nwhile we were in the Rules Committee. You only get to use this \nprocedure once--actually, you can use it three times; but for a variety \nof different reasons, it is only going to come together for us once \nthis year--and you have to choose how to do that.\n  I am thrilled--thrilled--that the story that the gentleman from \nConnecticut tells is of success for his constituents back home in \nConnecticut. I think that is fabulous. I think that is fabulous.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't get to tell as many of those stories. I tell \nstories of folks who had plans that they liked, and those plans were \noutlawed by their government. I tell stories about folks who have \ndoctors that they had had relationships with for decades, who were \npromised that if they liked their doctor they could keep their doctor, \nwho lost access to their doctor because their government told them ``no \nmore for you.''\n  I tell stories of the small businesses in the district that were \ndoing the right thing by providing health care for their employees who \nhave now been priced out of that marketplace. They are not required by \nlaw to do it, but rates have gone up so much they can't do it \nthemselves--not because of our efforts to provide health care to \npeople, but because of our efforts to tell people what kind of health \ncare is good for them and what kind isn't.\n  Mr. Speaker, you may not know, the chairman of the Budget Committee \nis Georgia Congressman Dr. Tom Price. Dr. Tom Price, in H.R. 2300, has \na replacement plan. Dr. Tom Price wants to see preexisting conditions \nout of the marketplace. Dr. Tom Price, in H.R. 2300, wants to see \nindividuals able to move their policies from business to business, from \nplace to place.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a doctor-patient relationship. It is not a Federal \nGovernment-patient relationship. It is not a Federal HHS, Health and \nHuman Services-patient relationship, and it is not an insurance \ncompany-doctor relationship. It is about me and my physician, you and \nyour physician, our families and our family physician, 320 million \nAmericans at a time.\n  We have it right here in this institution. We have replacement \noptions right here.\n  Do not let it be said that in the name of trying to bring sanity to \nour Federal spending, in the name of trying to fix the errors that were \ncreated in the Affordable Care Act, do not let it be said that any \nMember wants to trample on the healthcare opportunities that families \nhave back home. Our goal is to expand those opportunities, not to \ncontract them.\n  I celebrate what has happened in Connecticut. I only wish that folks \nin Connecticut, New York, and elsewhere would support us in Georgia \nwith the challenges that we are having and help us get back to that \nvery personal doctor-patient relationship that we believe is the right \nof every American.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, the budget reconciliation bill avoids the real problems \nbefore us, including the debt limit, the Export-Import Bank, a highway \nbill, a looming shutdown, and more. Instead of addressing the urgent \nneeds of the Nation, the bill doubles down on attacking women's health \nand marks the 61st time that the House majority has voted to repeal, to \ndefund, or to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's try to salvage something from the money we have \nspent on this hour here at a time that we have literally wasted again, \nfor the 61st time. Let's salvage something from it by voting ``no'' on \nthe previous question. We can actually accomplish something then.\n  If the previous question is defeated, we will be able to vote to take \ncare of the issue of debt limit, the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  A simple vote ``no'' allows us to bring that up, vote for that, go \nhome this weekend not having to be chewing everybody's nails and then \neverybody in the country wonders what in heck is going to be going on \nhere.\n  Why don't we for a change here on this day, on this Thursday, do \nsomething positive, do something that needs doing, do something we know \nsooner or later we will do. Do it today on a clean bill, no additions \nof any kind, just to do it. It is an opportunity that I certainly hope \npeople will take advantage of. I urge them to do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' so \nthat we can vote ``yes'' on a vote to deal with the debt limit issue \nand a ``no'' vote on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe there is more that unites us than that \ndivides us not just in this Chamber, but in this Nation.\n  As I have listened to my colleague from New York talk about some of \nthe priorities that America has, I think she is spot on. I think she is \nspot on.\n  I am missing votes in the Transportation Committee right now where we \nare moving that long-term transportation bill so that I can be down \nhere on the floor moving this reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of rust in the gears around here. There \nis a lot of rust in the gears. It has been since the 1990s that \nCongress--House and Senate combined--have sent all the appropriations \nbills to the President before the end of the fiscal year. It has been \nsince the 1990s.\n  Newt Gingrich ran this institution the last time we did that. Bill \nClinton was in the White House the last time we did that. There is a \nlot of rust in the gears that has accumulated under both Republican and \nDemocratic leadership in this place.\n  But this year we passed more appropriations bills earlier in the \nfiscal year than at any point since 1974. This year we are moving the \nfirst long-term highway bill that we have seen in almost a decade.\n  This year we have conferenced a balanced budget for America for the \nfirst time in a decade and a half. That is not just a notch to put on \nthe belt of America to say this is what we have done. This is an \nopportunity to move this budget reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do. I am saddened that reconciliation is a word that \nfolks have to go and look up and learn, but it is the only way--the \nonly way--in divided government that the people's voice can be heard.\n  There is no other procedure in the United States Congress that allows \n51 percent of America to prevail. There is no other ability in the \nUnited States Congress for the majority of Americans who have lent \ntheir power to Washington to express their views and change the law of \nthe land, save this one.\n  Mr. Speaker, budget deficits have gone down each and every year since \nSpeaker John Boehner stood right there where you are standing today\n\n[[Page H7107]]\n\nand Nancy Pelosi handed him the gavel--every year--from record high \nlevels now to the lowest budget deficit in the Obama administration, \nand we have an opportunity today to do more.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. \nSpeaker, talk about those things that we can do together, and I agree. \nI agree.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side talk about their \npriorities in terms of raising the debt limit and not seeing the \ngovernment shut down. I halfway agree.\n  I don't want to see the government shut down either. We avoided a \ngovernment shutdown 2 weeks ago and got a little thank you note from a \nyoung lady who was in the office.\n  She said: Dear Congressman, It was good to see you today. Thank you \nfor not letting the American History museum close down while my family \nwas in Washington.\n  There are real impacts to that. But the fact is the reason we are \nhaving the conversation is not because anybody wants to shut the \ngovernment down. It is because folks want to borrow more money. \nMortgaging our children's future to the tune of $18 trillion apparently \nis not mortgaging it enough. We are going to be back and make it $19 \ntrillion or $19.5 trillion.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are not talking about a debt limit that is coming \naround today. We are talking about one that came around in the spring. \nThe government has just been borrowing and borrowing and borrowing even \nbeyond that debt limit, and they are borrowing because we are spending \ntoo much.\n  Mr. Speaker, look at the tax rolls right now. Do you realize, as we \nare standing here today, not only is America collecting more in \nconstant dollars--not static dollars, but constant dollars adjusted for \ninflation--we are collecting more money than at any time in American \nhistory, any time.\n  Per capita in this country, Americans are paying more in taxes than \nthey have ever paid in the history of the Republic, not in inflated \n2015 dollars, but in constant dollars adjusted for inflation. The real \nimpact on American families is greater today in taxes than ever before.\n  Mr. Speaker, the problem is not that we don't raise enough money. The \nproblem is that we spend too much money. I can't count the number of \ngood pieces of legislation that have gone to the Senate and failed not \non their merits, but because a Democratic filibuster would not even \nallow the bill to be debated.\n  With this rule and with this underlying bill, we allow the people's \nvoice to be heard, we allow the American majority's voice to be heard, \nand we have an opportunity to put a bill that will make a difference \nfor American families on the President's desk for the very first time.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues' strong support of the rule. Upon \npassage of that rule, Mr. Speaker, I encourage their strong support for \nthe underlying reconciliation measure. We have an opportunity today \ntogether to make a difference.\n  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:\n\n    An Amendment to H. Res. 483 Offered by Ms. Slaughter of New York\n\n       Strike all after the resolved clause and insert:\n       That immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3737) to responsibly pay our Nation's bills on time by \n     temporarily extending the public debt limit, and for other \n     purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed \n     with. All points of order against consideration of the bill \n     are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and \n     shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Ways and Means. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All \n     points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At \n     the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the \n     Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with \n     such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and \n     amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3737.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  General debate shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided and controlled \nby the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural \nResources.\n  The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1937, the National Strategic \nand Critical Minerals Production Act of 2015. This bill was introduced \nby my good friend and colleague, Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, \nand myself as the first cosponsor.\n  Not a day goes by when Americans don't use a product that is made \nfrom critical minerals. In fact, life as we know it in the 21st century \nwould not be possible without these minerals.\n  There would be no computers, no BlackBerries, no iPhones. There would \nbe no MRIs, CAT scans, or x-ray machines. There would be no wind \nturbines or solar panels. Mr. Chairman, the list is exhaustive of these \nthings that depend on critical and strategic minerals that make our \nlives possible.\n  Rare earth elements, a special subset of strategic and critical \nminerals, are core components of these products in the 21st century. \nYet, despite the tremendous need for rare earth elements, the United \nStates has allowed itself to become almost entirely dependent on China \nand other foreign nations for these resources.\n  America has a plentiful supply of rare earth elements, but roadblocks \nto the development of these critical materials have resulted in China \nproducing 97 percent of the world's supply. That is 97 percent.\n  Our current policies are handing China a monopoly on these elements, \ncreating a dependence that has serious implications for American jobs, \nfor our economy, and on our national security.\n  Burdensome red tape, duplicative reviews, frivolous lawsuits, and \nonerous regulations can hold up new mining projects here in the U.S. \nfor more than 10 years. These unnecessary delays cost American jobs as \nwe become more and more dependent on foreign countries, such as China, \nfor these raw materials.\n  The lack of domestically produced strategic and critical minerals are \nprime examples of how the U.S. has regulated itself into a 100 percent \ndependency on at least 19 critical and unique minerals. It has also \nearned the United States the unique and unfortunate distinction of \nbeing ranked dead last when it comes to permitting mining projects.\n  The 2014 ranking of countries for mining investment out of 25 major \nmining countries found that the 7- to 10-year permitting delays are the \nmost significant risk to mining projects in the U.S. We are dead last \nin that ranking. I can't speak for the other countries, but the reason \nthe U.S. is so slow to issue new mining permits is very simple: \ngovernment bureaucracy.\n  H.R. 1937, introduced by my colleague from Nevada, will help us end \nforeign dependence by streamlining government red tape that blocks \nAmerica's strategic and critical mineral production. Instead of waiting \nfor over a decade for mining permits to be approved, this bill sets a \ngoal for the total review process for permitting at 30 months, 2\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  Now, this isn't a hard deadline, Mr. Chairman. It can be extended. \nBut it is a goal to push the bureaucrats into action on these important \ninfrastructure projects. It shouldn't take a decade to get a project \nbuilt for minerals that we need in our everyday lives and for our \nnational security. No company can reasonably forecast the price of \nminerals 10 years in advance.\n  Finally, above all, this is a Jobs bill. The positive economic impact \nof this bill will extend beyond just the mining industry. For every \ngood-paying metal mining job created, an estimated 2.3 additional jobs \nare generated. For every nonmetal mining job created, another 1.6 jobs \nare created.\n  This legislation gives the opportunity for American manufacturers, \nsmall businesses, technology companies, and construction firms to use \nAmerican resources to help make the products that are essential to our \neveryday lives.\n  As China continues to tighten global supplies of rare earth elements, \nwe should respond with a U.S. mining renaissance that will bring mining \nand manufacturing jobs back.\n  The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, H.R. \n1937, is important to our jobs and to our economy. We must act now to \ncut the Government red tape that is stopping American domestic \nproduction and furthering our dependence on foreign countries for our \nmineral needs.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This bill takes us in the wrong direction. It not only fails to make \nany meaningful reforms to our antiquated system of mining in this \ncountry, but it proposes to make them worse. We have a mining system \nthat was put together in the 1870s when the number one goal for \nPresident Grant at that time was to get people to settle in the West. I \nam here to tell you, Mr. Chair, the West has been settled.\n  As a resident of southern California, we have this 150-year-old bill \nthat really makes things as easy as possible for miners. We still have \na law that doesn't require any royalties to be paid on the extraction \nof hard rock minerals on public lands. Let's be clear. If you drill for \noil or gas on public lands or mine coal or soda ash or potash or a \nnumber of other minerals, what do you do? You pay a royalty to the \nAmerican taxpayer, but not if you mine copper or silver or platinum or \ngold or other valuables. You get to mine royalty free.\n  When the Mining Law of 1872 was enacted, there was no such thing as \nenvironmental safeguards. There was no concept of the multiple uses of \npublic lands to ensure that mining could coexist with grazing, with \nrecreation or conservation. There were no requirements for miners to \nclean up after themselves when they were done mining. Simply mine as \nlong as it is profitable, and when you are done, just pick up and \nleave, and don't worry about it, except that the people who live \nanywhere near the half million abandoned mines in this country need to \nworry about it. Communities located near the tens of thousands of miles \nof polluted rivers with toxic acid mine waste, they need to worry about \nit, and, certainly, the United States Congress needs to worry about it.\n  But, instead of tackling this problem, what does this bill do? It \ndeclares that the biggest problem we have with mining in this country \nis that we are not doing it fast enough.\n  So this bill proposes to undermine one of our bedrock environmental \nlaws--the National Environmental Policy Act--and it makes land managers \nwho are reviewing mine plans prioritize mineral production over every \nother potential use of the land, which threatens hunting, fishing, \ngrazing, and conservation.\n  Mr. Chair, it would be one thing if the data showed that a large \nnumber of mines were being delayed for no good reason; but, in fact, \naccording to the data from the Bureau of Land Management, mines are \ngetting approved much faster. We just heard that it takes a decade, but \nlet's be clear what the data says.\n  Between 2005 and 2008, on average, 54 percent of the plans were \napproved in less than 3 years. In 2009 to 2014, 69 percent of the plans \nwere approved in less than 3 years. So, in reality, rather than\n\n[[Page H7109]]\n\ntaking a decade, we are seeing that the Obama administration is \npermitting mines at a much faster rate than the Bush administration.\n  Now, I have an amendment that would address one of the key problems \nin this bill. This bill has an incredibly broad definition of what is a \nstrategic and critical mineral. I have yet to hear anyone tell me--and \nwe asked in committee--what mineral now doesn't qualify as strategic \nand critical under this bill. Certainly, none of the witnesses we had \nat our Natural Resources Committee hearing could, and the majority \nhasn't suggested anything. Now we are talking about expediting the \nprocess for sand and gravel, crushed stones, gold, silver, diamonds. \nAll of these are now going to be considered strategic and critical by \nthe definition in this bill. All get an expedited process for \npermitting, and they have weaker environmental reviews.\n  But, even if this bill were limited to the definition for critical \nminerals that the rest of the world goes by--basically, that those \nminerals be important, they be unique, and, most importantly, we are \ndefining them as strategic and critical minerals because they are \nsubject to a supply risk--it is clear that this bill does not help.\n  We had one rare earth element mine start up in this country a few \nyears ago. The rare earth elements are ones that are truly critical. \nTwo months ago, that mine stopped operating because prices were too \nlow. That is what has happened. That one mine was already permitted, \nalready built, and already operating, and it had to be shut down \nbecause of economics.\n  I don't think changing the environmental laws in any way solves the \nproblem of economics, but it certainly would help major international \nmining conglomerates--companies based in Canada or Australia. It is \ngoing to help them grease the skids when they want to open their next \ngiant copper mine or gold mine or uranium mine right next to a national \npark or a sensitive watershed.\n  Mr. Chair, this bill is bad policy. The outcomes here won't be any \ndifferent than the outcomes over the past two Congresses. This bill is \ndead on arrival in the Senate, and the administration has already \nexpressed its strong opposition.\n  What should we be doing?\n  We should be here today, discussing how to fix our outdated and \nantiquated mining laws, how to make mining companies pay their fair \nshare, how to clean up the half million abandoned mines that litter our \nlandscape from coast to coast. We shouldn't be here talking about a \nbill that is only going to make things worse.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1937.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would point out to my friend and colleague from California that the \nNational Research Council study has said: ``All minerals and mineral \nproducts could be or could become critical to some degree depending on \ntheir importance and availability.''\n  So you have to look at the total circumstances surrounding the \ncurrent supply of a mineral and what that mineral is, and they all, \nliterally, could fit that definition according to the National Research \nCouncil.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great \nState of Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis), my colleague, who is also the vice \nchairman of the full Committee on Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I want to thank Chairman Lamborn and my good friend and \nfellow Western Caucus member, Nevada Representative Amodei, for their \nwork on this important legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me start by addressing why strategic minerals \nmatter and why we ought to have a piece of legislation like this.\n  My home State of Wyoming is the headquarters for our Nation's nuclear \nintercontinental ballistic missile force. These missiles ensure that \nthose who would do us harm are deterred from using nuclear weapons. \nThese weapons are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, but they \nneed regular maintenance and replacement components. Rare earth \nelements are an important part of these components--from batteries, to \ncomputer chips, to display screens and engines. These components--\ncomponents vital to our technological edge--would require elements that \ncan be difficult to procure.\n  Now, China controls nearly 80 percent of rare earth production. As we \nknow, China has used this leverage to bully our allies, to limit \nexports at a time of a dispute, especially recently, with Japan over \nthe control of islands in the South China Sea. The U.S. Navy plans to \nconduct operations in the area to remind China of the importance of \nrespecting maritime boundaries and the freedom of navigation; but China \nis using its 80 percent share of rare earth minerals to leverage our \nallies. They can do it anytime they want because they have such massive \ncontrol of this resource.\n\n  The bill that Mr. Amodei is sponsoring, the National Strategic and \nCritical Minerals Production Act, would simplify the permitting process \nfor domestic mines that will provide resources used in components that \nare vital to our national security. That is why we need to do it.\n  Here is an example of the existing problem.\n  In my home State of Wyoming, the Bear Lodge Critical Rare Earth \nProject has been going through the current process since 2011. It will \nbe the only large-scale production facility in the U.S. for some rare \nearth elements designated as critical by the U.S. Department of Energy. \nThey have to coordinate their permit application between the Forest \nService, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, and the Department of Energy.\n  Under Mr. Amodei's legislation, one Federal agency would become the \nlead agency and set project timelines for permit applications and \ndecisions. The total review process would not be authorized to exceed \n30 months unless extended by all parties involved. These parties would \ninclude State and local governments and local stakeholders. This \nensures that local voices will be heard.\n  Mr. Chairman, I cannot emphasize enough how important I think this \nlegislation is. I am a cosponsor of the legislation. It passed the \nHouse in previous Congresses on a bipartisan basis. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1937. I thank Mr. Amodei for his \nthoughtful consideration of this bill.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would just like to point out that the proponent of the bill has \nsaid--I believe it was the National Research Council--that all minerals \nand products could be or could become critical to some degree. That is \nreally what they said, but let's be clear what this bill says and what \nthe National Research Council's definition is. That is, really, what we \nare talking about, and we are going to discuss that later on.\n  Just what is the definition?\n  In the bill that we see before us, in terms of strategic and critical \nminerals, the term ``strategic and critical'' means minerals that are \nnecessary for national defense and national security requirements--\nthere certainly are some of those--for the national energy \ninfrastructure, including pipelines, refining capacity, electrical \npower generation, and transmission and renewable energy products, for \nsupporting the domestic manufacturing of any mineral for agriculture, \nhousing, telecommunications, health care, transportation and \ninfrastructure, or for the Nation's economic security and balance of \ntrade. For that reason, they are saying let's shorten the process, \neviscerate NEPA--the National Environmental Policy Act--and let's \nexpedite this process.\n  I ask you: What mineral is not included in this definition? They are \nincluding everything.\n  Let's see what, in actuality, the National Research Council said. \nThey published the report in 2008. It was called: ``Minerals, Critical \nMinerals, and the U.S. Economy,'' and it defined what should be our \ndefinition of strategic and critical minerals.\n  It states: ``To be `critical,' a mineral must be essential in use.'' \nWe agree. They talk about strategic, and those proponents talk about \nessential minerals; but the National Research Council also says: ``To \nbe considered `critical and strategic,' it must be subject\n\n[[Page H7110]]\n\nto supply restriction.'' We do not see anything in this bill about \nsupply restriction.\n  Therefore, what it is is a blank check for mining companies to mine \nanywhere, to have an expedited process so as not to protect \ncommunities; and I think that is a great mistake and takes us the wrong \nway and is exactly the opposite of what the National Research Council \nhas called for.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gosar), who is also a member of the Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1937, the National Strategic \nand Critical Minerals Production Act.\n  This commonsense legislation will streamline the permitting process \nand allow for better coordination amongst the relevant State and \nFederal agencies in order to foster economic growth, create jobs, and \nensure a robust domestic supply of strategic and critical minerals.\n  People have been digging in Arizona for precious metals for \ncenturies. In the 1850s, nearly one in every four people in Arizona was \na miner. Without a doubt, mining fueled the growth that makes Arizona \nthe State it is today. In fact, it is part of the five Cs that built \nArizona with copper.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Today, the Arizona mining industry is alive. Minerals such as copper, \ncoal, gold, uranium, lime, and potash are still mined throughout my \ndistrict, but not at the levels they used to be.\n  These projects employ hundreds of my constituents with high-paying \njobs, jobs that pay over $50,000 to $60,000 a year, plus benefits. In \nrural Arizona, these types of jobs are few and far between.\n  As I meet with companies that do business throughout my State, the \nmessage is clear: we could do better. The length, complexity, and \nuncertainty of the permitting process is stymieing development and \ndiscouraging investors from committing to U.S. mining.\n  The folks on the ground tell me that because of regulatory excessive \noverreach by the Federal Government and the cumbersome permitting \nprocess, that it can take as long as 10 years. It is becoming a bad \nbusiness decision to even attempt to get a new U.S. mine off the \nground, despite a bountiful supply of domestic resources. We must \ncorrect this problem and prevent more American jobs from leaving \nAmerica.\n  Rare earth and other critical minerals have been discovered \nthroughout rural Arizona, have been the main economic driver and \nprovider of jobs for communities that otherwise probably wouldn't make \nit at all. The critical minerals produced in these areas are resources \nour country badly needs to meet the demand for production of everyday \nitems like cell phones, computers, batteries, and cars.\n  Let's lessen our dependency on importing critical minerals from \ncountries like China and restore some sanity to our permitting and \nregulatory process so we can get American miners back to work. Imagine \nour slogan, ``Made in the USA with materials mined in the USA.'' Now, \nthat is what this bill is all about.\n  I applaud Mr. Amodei for his leadership on this critical issue and \nurge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1937.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, today we are debating yet another \nRepublican bill restricting access to the courts to only those with \ndeep pockets. H.R. 1937 continues the alarming trend of Republican-\nsponsored legislation that proposes to limit the average American's \naccess to the courts so businesses that line the pockets of these \npoliticians with campaign contributions can continue to profit.\n  Misleadingly disguised as a bill stimulating the increased production \nof strategic minerals, this legislation is actually about shielding the \nmining industry's poor environmental practices from accountability to \nvictims while simultaneously disenfranchising mining-impacted \ncommunities.\n  H.R. 1937 allows regulators to exempt mining projects from the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act, EAJA. The EAJA allows average Americans access \nto legal representation to protect their communities. Without EAJA, \nimpacted communities cannot afford lawyers, much less the litany of \nscientific and technical experts needed to mount a serious challenge to \na multinational mining company. This exemption cripples the ability of \nthose concerned with environmental protection to seek representation \nand redress in the courts.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill and \npreserve justice for all.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlaska (Mr. Young), a senior member of the Natural Resources Committee.\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I am very proud of this bill, and I \nam a sponsor of this bill, and no one is lining my pockets. I resent \nthat comment. I am thinking of the United States of America and how we \nare importing these 31 known minerals and the process that we have to \ngo through to mine our own natural resources in our great Nation.\n  It impedes our capability to be secure, regardless of what one might \nsay. You just don't do this overnight. You have to have time to \ndevelop, especially the rare earths. The rest of the minerals we are \nimporting using outside people, countries to import those products \nfrom, which we live with. We have people in this Congress and across \nthis place who say we don't need it. We have to follow the example.\n  By the way, if a miner tries to develop a mine, you have to go \nthrough so many different permits; and then when you get done, guess \nwhat we have. The lawyers from the big, big environmental organizations \nlike the Safari Club, Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth, all 58 \ndifferent groups, file suit by a legal body that impedes the progress \nfor this Nation.\n  We cannot continue to import all which we need to have this living \nstyle we have today, yet that is what a lot of people on that side of \nthe aisle insist upon.\n  This is a good bill. Mr. Amodei thought about this bill. How do we \nretain our security? But more than that, how do we keep jobs within the \nUnited States? His comment is ``made in the United States by resources \nmined in the United States.'' That is what we should be looking at as \nthis Congress instead of following, I call it, the blind piper: We \ndon't need to drill our oil; we will buy it from abroad. We don't need \nto mine our minerals; we will buy it from abroad. And, by the way, we \nwill ship our jobs overseas, and we will be further in debt $18 \ntrillion.\n  We need our resources. That is what made this Nation great. \nEverything in this room, in these hallowed Halls, this body came from \nthe earth. It was mined, it was cut, it was manufactured from the \nearth. Why should we buy it from abroad?\n  Let's be American. Let's mine for our resources. Let's cut our trees \nfor our resources. Let's build our resources. As it says right up \nthere: ``Let us use our resources God has given for the benefit of \nmankind.'' If we don't do that, we are abusing the job we have here.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would really like to discuss in a little bit more detail the idea \nthat the permitting process is so onerous, that it takes so long to do \nit.\n  In 2012, 2013, and 2014, let's talk about the last 3 years of \npermitting of mines, of plans of operation, what really is the data? I \nwill tell you that of all the plans of operation that were approved in \n2012, 93 percent of them were done in 3 years or less; in 2013, 79 \npercent were done in 3 years or less; and in 2014, it was 68 percent. \nIn summary, in the last 3 years, close to 80 percent of all plans of \noperation were permitted in less than 3 years. So we are not talking \nabout an onerous time.\n  Also, let us remember that the same bill was twice introduced last \nyear. It was twice introduced in the last session, and it was also \nintroduced once in the 112th Congress. It never got taken up in the \nSenate.\n  This bill, if it ever did get through, let's see what the \nadministration says. I read to you a Statement of Administration \nPolicy:\n\n[[Page H7111]]\n\n  ``The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1937, which would \nundermine existing environmental safeguards for, at a minimum, almost \nall types of hardrock mines on Federal lands. Specifically, H.R. 1937 \nwould undermine sound Federal decision-making by eliminating the \nappropriate reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act if \ncertain conditions are met, circumventing public involvement in mining \nproposals, and bypassing the formulation of alternatives to proposals, \namong other things. The Administration also opposes the legislation's \nsevere restrictions on judicial review. Although the legislation \npurports to limit litigation, its extremely short statute of \nlimitations and vague constraints on the scope of prospective relief \nthat a court may issue are likely to have the opposite effect.\n\n  ``The Administration strongly supports the development of rare earth \nelements and other critical minerals, but rejects the notion that their \ndevelopment is incompatible with existing safeguards regarding the uses \nof public lands, environmental protection, and public involvement in \nagency decision-making.''\n  If we are really concerned about updating this old law, let's work \ntogether and come up with a better definition of what is a critical and \nstrategic mineral and let us not eviscerate the environmental \nprotections and the public participation which we now afford people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an exchange of \nletters between Chairman Bishop and Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary \nCommittee on this bill.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Natural Resources,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, 28 July 2015.\n     Hon. Robert Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On July 9, 2015, the Committee on \n     Natural Resources ordered favorably report H.R. 1937, \n     National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of \n     2015. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on \n     Natural Resources, with an additional referral to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n       I ask that you allow the Committee on the Judiciary to be \n     discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it \n     may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no \n     way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the \n     bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future \n     referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be \n     necessary, I would support having the Committee on the \n     Judiciary represented on the conference committee. Finally, I \n     would be pleased to include this letter and your response in \n     the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural Resources \n     to memorialize our understanding, as well as in the \n     Congressional Record when the bill is considered by the \n     House. Thank you for your consideration of my request, and \n     for your continued strong cooperation between our committees.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Rob Bishop,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     Committee on Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 2015.\n     Hon. Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop, I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     1937, the ``National Strategic and Critical Minerals \n     Production Act of 2015,'' which the Committee on Natural \n     Resources recently ordered reported favorably. As a result of \n     your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 1937 that \n     fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, I agree to discharge our Committee from further \n     consideration of this bill so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.\n       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1937 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our \n     Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as the \n     bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our \n     Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an \n     appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks \n     that you support any such request.\n       I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this \n     matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 1937.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Bishop), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, they once asked the famous spitball \npitcher Gaylord Perry if he put a foreign substance on the ball, and he \ncalmly answered: No. Vaseline is 100 percent American product.\n  We used to only have to import a handful of rare earth minerals in \nthis country, like eight. Today, we are importing dozens of them \nbecause we have, with this administration, a policy of trying to \nstockpile these resources. Hopefully, when we get through them, we will \nbe able to find some other country that can help us to resupply those \nresources, kind of like Blanche in ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' where \nwe are dependent on the kindness of strangers at all times.\n  Would it not be wiser for us simply to have a consistent policy where \nwe actually have a workforce that is developing, on a regular basis, \nthese rare earth minerals that we can have for our use so that we can \nhave the jobs from them, it can help our economy, and it could give us \nthe security we desperately need? We don't need to keep importing stuff \ninto this country. I mean, we imported the Expos from Montreal to here \nin Washington. That should be sufficient. That is enough.\n  I read an article the other day about mining rare earth minerals in \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo where rare minerals, necessary for \niPhones and the Samsung Galaxy phones, were being produced. Miners used \ntheir bare hands to filter out the minerals in order to earn a whopping \n$5 a day. If the miners use their hands to find the rare minerals, how \ndo you think they handled environment protections and how do you think \nthey reclaimed these projects?\n  What we need desperately is to use 21st century technology and pay \nour labor force 21st century wages to produce the strategic and \ncritical minerals that are necessary for our way of life and not be \ndependent on other countries for these minerals and not take advantage \nof their miners. This is a no-brainer. Let's do the right thing. As \nSatchel Paige said: Just throw strikes. Home plate don't move.\n  We know what we are doing. Pass this bill. It is a good bill.\n\n\n                       Announcement by the Chair\n\n  The CHAIR. The Chair notes a disturbance in the gallery in \ncontravention of the law and rules of the House.\n  The Sergeant At Arms will remove those persons responsible for the \ndisturbance and restore order to the gallery.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Benishek), who is also a member of the Committee on \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1937, \nthe National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act.\n  Over the past several decades, our Nation has lagged far behind much \nof the world in the development and extraction of domestic mineral \nresources. Falling behind on this front has made our Nation dependent \non foreign sources of many vital mineral resources that our economy and \nnational defense need to continue functioning.\n  Falling behind has also led to the loss of good-paying jobs \nthroughout the country. We have seen this in my district in northern \nMichigan in the mines that have shut down and the mines that have not \nbeen permitted. There is a mine in the western part of my district that \nhas been over 10 years in the permitting process and is still not near \nopen. These jobs are critically needed in my district.\n  The mines of the U.P. have served our country in times of need, \nproviding many of the raw minerals that we have needed for national \ndefense. If the resources that we have beneath our feet were needed \ntoday, these mines would have to go through a significant permitting \nprocess that would likely take almost 20 years.\n  While I support making sure that we behave in an environmentally \nresponsible manner, it is ridiculous that overly burdensome Federal \nregulations are keeping us from being competitive in the world economy. \nThis bill will cut through some of the bureaucratic red tape that is \nholding our economy back, leading to a nation that is less dependent on \nforeign resources for vital natural resources and creating jobs.\n\n[[Page H7112]]\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the responsible development of \nour domestic natural resources and to vote in favor of this commonsense \nand long-overdue legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nthe Silver State, Nevada (Mr. Amodei), a former member of the Committee \non Natural Resources and the author of this bill.\n  Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chairman, God forbid we place dealing with bedrock \nAmerican issues ahead of the culture of political cliche. It is always \nnice to be informed of what the status is in the Intermountain West by \npeople from towns that end in the name ``Beach.''\n  I find it incredibly interesting that we have heard on several \noccasions that the administration's average for the supermajority of \napplications is 36 months or less and how we need to work together on \nthings when the legislation on the floor right now calls for a 30-month \ntimeframe, which is extendable, by the way, with the consent of both \nparties.\n  So instead of, Well, let's have an amendment to make it 36 months and \nput this on the suspension calendar, we are subjected to ``This is \nbad'' and ``It disenfranchises the public'' and all that.\n  Let's talk about what this is really about. There is an old saying in \nthe law: When you have got the facts, you argue the facts. When you \nhave got the law, you argue the law. When you don't have either, you \njust argue.\n  Here we are. Because everybody in the room knows, depending on what \nside of the issue you are on, the big tool in this thing is, if we can \noutwait them, the capital will go elsewhere. Guess what. The folks that \nbelieve in that are winning.\n  When we talk about those bedrock American issues, things like jobs, \nthings like public participation--you know, 30 months, that is longer \nthan we get to hang out here after the people of our district give us \ntheir voting card. That is longer--used to be--than somebody would take \nto try to talk you into voting for them for Governor or President.\n  Nobody can accuse this legislation, at 2\\1/2\\ years, extendable by \nstipulation, of forcing the public to sit on their hands. Jobs, \nparticipation of the public, balance of trade, that is not important.\n  I mean, why should we be concerned about balance of trade and \nexporting the minerals that this country is wealthy with? You want to \ntalk about abandoned mines? In my State, those folks happen to be doing \na great job. If you want to talk about the culture of the 1870s, yeah, \nbut it has come a long way.\n  God forbid, when we talk about paying your fair share, in my State, \nthe industry pays north of $80,000 a year. Those people pay Federal \nincome taxes. They buy goods and services that are federally taxed: \ngasoline, tires, all that stuff. But, no, let's send those jobs \noverseas where none of that happens. None of that happens. That is \nsmart policy. I simply disagree.\n  God forbid we talk about commercial supplies, national security, \nstrategic supplies. Other speakers have talked about that. This is not \nsome dream job for the minerals extraction industry.\n  Oh, by the way, let's not look at the folks down in the Palmetto \nState right now who are experiencing phenomenal floods that might need \nmaterials to kind of rebuild their State.\n  God forbid we talk about sand and gravel for those folks in the \nGolden State after the Loma Prieta earthquake and they needed to \nrebuild things called freeways lickety-split.\n  This is not about supplying sand for your kid's sandbox. This is not \nabout gravel for your driveway in your subdivision. This is about \nhaving flexibility to address issues that are mineral related. Because \nyou know what, nobody has called this place, regardless of who is \nrunning it, nimble.\n  When one of these issues comes up, God forbid you give them: That is \nright, folks. Hang on to your hats. Thirty months to try to get the \npermission from the Federal Government to extract minerals on that.\n  With all due respect, what this is all about is: Do you continue to \nlet folks who are opposed to things try to starve them out and wait and \nwait and wait until the capital goes elsewhere or do you take the folks \nand the administration's word: Nice job. Takes you 36 months? You want \nus to change it to 33 months and put it on the suspension calendar? I \nwill do it. But short of that, me thinks thou doth protest too much.\n  I solicit your earnest support, and I am looking forward to the \nSenate work on it this time because we are nimble compared to those \nfolks on the north end of the building.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, we have heard in this discussion that we should have a \nsweeping definition, every mineral should be under the definition of a \ncritical mineral, and that we should not be beholden to foreign sources \nif we don't do that. Well, I agree in many ways. We should not be.\n  This bill doesn't really deal with that issue because, if the authors \nwere really concerned about restrictions to the supply, they would make \nthe definition of ``critical'' and ``strategic minerals'' much \nnarrower. We would not give up our environmental protections. We would \nnot give up our public participation. We would not give up our legal \nprotections when, in fact, there is no danger to the Nation's supply of \nthis mineral.\n  The problems are really that we are now broadly including everything \nunder this definition, and the bill that is in the Senate under--I \nthink it is Senator Murkowski--has a much more limited definition of \nwhat is a strategic and critical mineral.\n  I urge the authors here, the proponents, to really amend this bill so \nthat we can all work together on this to really restrict the two very \nspecific occasions of when we would enable a change in the protections \nthat we already have under NEPA. Right now, everything is included. \nThis eviscerates all of our protections. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, much has been debated here on the floor about what is \nstrategic and what is not strategic. Let me suggest two ways that you \ncould define strategic minerals.\n  You could define it by making a definition so narrow that, in effect, \nthe legislation picks winners and losers or you could write law that \nsays that certain conditions that require certain elements will be the \ndriver of what is strategic and critical. That means the marketplace \nwill decide what is strategic and critical.\n  I think that is a much better approach when I talk about this because \nI recall hearing that, in the late 1890s, the U.S. Patent Office issued \na statement--I think I have this correct here--saying that we ought to \nclose down the U.S. Patent Office because everything that can be \ninvented has been invented.\n  That was in the 1890s. That was before airplanes. That was before \ncars were commercially available. That was before most \ntelecommunications. This means all the minerals that go into these \nthings weren't even thought of at that time.\n\n  What we do in this bill is just very straightforward. We say that the \nstrategic and critical minerals will meet any of the following four \ncriteria--and, by the way, you can find these on page 5, section 3, \nunder ``Definitions'':\n  A, for national defense and national security. That is so evident, it \nhardly needs to be debated.\n  B, for the Nation's energy infrastructure, including pipelines and \nrefining. That is because of the importance of energy. That certainly \nshould not be debated because we have to have a good energy source if \nwe are going to have a growing economy.\n  Also, C, to support domestic manufacturing. That includes, obviously, \nagriculture and housing as well. In other words, to support our \neconomy. Doesn't that make good sense to have a source of strategic and \ncritical minerals for that?\n  Finally, D, for the Nation's economic security and balance of trade. \nThat\n\n[[Page H7113]]\n\nmakes such good sense because we are seriously out of balance now with \nChina.\n  This approach is more of a long-term solution because 25 years from \nnow there will be a mineral that somebody will find that will be used \nfor new technology. But if we have defined it so narrowly, as the other \nside would suggest, that we don't know what that technology is, we \nhave, in fact, been picking winners and losers, and that is the wrong \napproach.\n  The right approach is what is embodied in this bill to say that these \nfour conditions will be the ones that define strategic and critical \nminerals.\n  Finally, let me close on this: Some people make fun of sand and \ngravel as being strategic. I guarantee you that, after a major \nearthquake in northern or southern California, when the freeways \ncollapse, I can tell you that cement and sand and gravel will \nabsolutely fit that definition.\n  In this bill, strategic and critical minerals are not defined, as \nsome have suggested, as all minerals all the time. Instead, H.R. 1937 \nallows any mineral to be deemed strategic and critical at a given time \nwhen the appropriate situation warrants it. This is vital to protecting \nour economy, our jobs, and our way of life.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule, and shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1937\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategic and \n     Critical Minerals Production Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The industrialization of developing nations has driven \n     demand for nonfuel minerals necessary for telecommunications, \n     military technologies, healthcare technologies, and \n     conventional and renewable energy technologies.\n       (2) The availability of minerals and mineral materials are \n     essential for economic growth, national security, \n     technological innovation, and the manufacturing and \n     agricultural supply chain.\n       (3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and \n     recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the \n     economic well-being, security and general welfare of the \n     Nation.\n       (4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is \n     becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these \n     mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following:\n       (A) Twenty-five years ago the United States was dependent \n     on foreign sources for 45 nonfuel mineral materials, 8 of \n     which the United States imported 100 percent of the Nation's \n     requirements, and for another 19 commodities the United \n     States imported more than 50 percent of the Nation's needs.\n       (B) By 2014 the United States import dependence for nonfuel \n     mineral materials increased from 45 to 65 commodities, 19 of \n     which the United States imported for 100 percent of the \n     Nation's requirements, and an additional 24 of which the \n     United States imported for more than 50 percent of the \n     Nation's needs.\n       (C) The United States share of worldwide mineral \n     exploration dollars was 7 percent in 2014, down from 19 \n     percent in the early 1990s.\n       (D) In the 2014 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment \n     (out of 25 major mining countries), found that 7- to 10-year \n     permitting delays are the most significant risk to mining \n     projects in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Strategic and critical minerals.--The term ``strategic \n     and critical minerals'' means minerals that are necessary--\n       (A) for national defense and national security \n     requirements;\n       (B) for the Nation's energy infrastructure, including \n     pipelines, refining capacity, electrical power generation and \n     transmission, and renewable energy production;\n       (C) to support domestic manufacturing, agriculture, \n     housing, telecommunications, healthcare, and transportation \n     infrastructure; or\n       (D) for the Nation's economic security and balance of \n     trade.\n       (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency, \n     department, or other unit of Federal, State, local, or tribal \n     government, or Alaska Native Corporation.\n       (3) Mineral exploration or mine permit.--The term ``mineral \n     exploration or mine permit'' includes--\n       (A) Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service \n     authorizations for pre-mining activities that require \n     environmental analyses pursuant to the National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and\n       (B) plans of operation issued by the Bureau of Land \n     Management and the Forest Service pursuant to 43 CFR 3809 and \n     36 CFR 228A or the authorities listed in 43 CFR 3503.13, \n     respectively, as amended from time to time.\n\n  TITLE I--DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SOURCES OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL \n                                MINERALS\n\n     SEC. 101. IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL \n                   MINERALS.\n\n       Domestic mines that will provide strategic and critical \n     minerals shall be considered an ``infrastructure project'' as \n     described in Presidential order ``Improving Performance of \n     Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects'' \n     dated March 22, 2012.\n\n     SEC. 102. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD AGENCY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The lead agency with responsibility for \n     issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall appoint a \n     project lead within the lead agency who shall coordinate and \n     consult with cooperating agencies and any other agency \n     involved in the permitting process, project proponents and \n     contractors to ensure that agencies minimize delays, set and \n     adhere to timelines and schedules for completion of the \n     permitting process, set clear permitting goals and track \n     progress against those goals.\n       (b) Determination Under NEPA.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent that the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) \n     applies to the issuance of any mineral exploration or mine \n     permit, the requirements of such Act shall be deemed to have \n     been procedurally and substantively satisfied if the lead \n     agency determines that any State and/or Federal agency acting \n     pursuant to State or Federal (or both) statutory or \n     procedural authorities, has addressed or will address the \n     following factors:\n       (A) The environmental impact of the action to be conducted \n     under the permit.\n       (B) Possible adverse environmental effects of actions under \n     the permit.\n       (C) Possible alternatives to issuance of the permit.\n       (D) The relationship between local long- and short-term \n     uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement \n     of long-term productivity.\n       (E) Any irreversible and irretrievable commitment of \n     resources that would be involved in the proposed action.\n       (F) That public participation will occur during the \n     decisionmaking process for authorizing actions under the \n     permit.\n       (2) Written requirement.--In reaching a determination under \n     paragraph (1), the lead agency shall, by no later than 90 \n     days after receipt of an application for the permit, in a \n     written record of decision--\n       (A) explain the rationale used in reaching its \n     determination;\n       (B) state the facts in the record that are the basis for \n     the determination; and\n       (C) show that the facts in the record could allow a \n     reasonable person to reach the same determination as the lead \n     agency did.\n       (c) Coordination on Permitting Process.--The lead agency \n     with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine \n     permit shall enhance government coordination for the \n     permitting process by avoiding duplicative reviews, \n     minimizing paperwork, and engaging other agencies and \n     stakeholders early in the process. For purposes of this \n     subsection, the lead agency shall consider the following \n     practices:\n       (1) Deferring to and relying upon baseline data, analyses \n     and reviews performed by State agencies with jurisdiction \n     over the proposed project.\n       (2) Conducting any consultations or reviews concurrently \n     rather than sequentially to the extent practicable and when \n     such concurrent review will expedite rather than delay a \n     decision.\n       (d) Memorandum of Agency Agreement.--If requested at any \n     time by a State or local planning agency, the lead agency \n     with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine \n     permit, in consultation with other Federal agencies with \n     relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, \n     may establish memoranda of agreement with the project \n     sponsor, State and local governments, and other appropriate \n     entities to accomplish the early coordination activities \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (e) Schedule for Permitting Process.--For any project for \n     which the lead agency cannot make the determination described \n     in 102(b), at the request of a project proponent the lead \n     agency, cooperating agencies, and any other agencies involved \n     with the mineral exploration or mine permitting process shall \n     enter into an agreement with the project proponent that sets \n     time limits for each part of the permitting process, \n     including for the following:\n       (1) The decision on whether to prepare a document required \n     under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       (2) A determination of the scope of any document required \n     under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n       (3) The scope of and schedule for the baseline studies \n     required to prepare a document required under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n       (4) Preparation of any draft document required under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n       (5) Preparation of a final document required under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n       (6) Consultations required under applicable laws.\n\n[[Page H7114]]\n\n       (7) Submission and review of any comments required under \n     applicable law.\n       (8) Publication of any public notices required under \n     applicable law.\n       (9) A final or any interim decisions.\n       (f) Time Limit for Permitting Process.--In no case should \n     the total review process described in subsection (d) exceed \n     30 months unless extended by the signatories of the \n     agreement.\n       (g) Limitation on Addressing Public Comments.--The lead \n     agency is not required to address agency or public comments \n     that were not submitted during any public comment periods or \n     consultation periods provided during the permitting process \n     or as otherwise required by law.\n       (h) Financial Assurance.--The lead agency will determine \n     the amount of financial assurance for reclamation of a \n     mineral exploration or mining site, which must cover the \n     estimated cost if the lead agency were to contract with a \n     third party to reclaim the operations according to the \n     reclamation plan, including construction and maintenance \n     costs for any treatment facilities necessary to meet Federal, \n     State or tribal environmental standards.\n       (i) Application to Existing Permit Applications.--This \n     section shall apply with respect to a mineral exploration or \n     mine permit for which an application was submitted before the \n     date of the enactment of this Act if the applicant for the \n     permit submits a written request to the lead agency for the \n     permit. The lead agency shall begin implementing this section \n     with respect to such application within 30 days after \n     receiving such written request.\n       (j) Strategic and Critical Minerals Within National \n     Forests.--With respect to strategic and critical minerals \n     within a federally administered unit of the National Forest \n     System, the lead agency shall--\n       (1) exempt all areas of identified mineral resources in \n     Land Use Designations, other than Non-Development Land Use \n     Designations, in existence as of the date of the enactment of \n     this Act from the procedures detailed at and all rules \n     promulgated under part 294 of title 36, Code of Federal \n     Regulations;\n       (2) apply such exemption to all additional routes and areas \n     that the lead agency finds necessary to facilitate the \n     construction, operation, maintenance, and restoration of the \n     areas of identified mineral resources described in paragraph \n     (1); and\n       (3) continue to apply such exemptions after approval of the \n     Minerals Plan of Operations for the unit of the National \n     Forest System.\n\n     SEC. 103. CONSERVATION OF THE RESOURCE.\n\n       In evaluating and issuing any mineral exploration or mine \n     permit, the priority of the lead agency shall be to maximize \n     the development of the mineral resource, while mitigating \n     environmental impacts, so that more of the mineral resource \n     can be brought to the marketplace.\n\n     SEC. 104. FEDERAL REGISTER PROCESS FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION \n                   AND MINING PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) Preparation of Federal Notices for Mineral Exploration \n     and Mine Development Projects.--The preparation of Federal \n     Register notices required by law associated with the issuance \n     of a mineral exploration or mine permit shall be delegated to \n     the organization level within the agency responsible for \n     issuing the mineral exploration or mine permit. All Federal \n     Register notices regarding official document availability, \n     announcements of meetings, or notices of intent to undertake \n     an action shall be originated and transmitted to the Federal \n     Register from the office where documents are held, meetings \n     are held, or the activity is initiated.\n       (b) Departmental Review of Federal Register Notices for \n     Mineral Exploration and Mining Projects.--Absent any \n     extraordinary circumstance or except as otherwise required by \n     any Act of Congress, each Federal Register notice described \n     in subsection (a) shall undergo any required reviews within \n     the Department of the Interior or the Department of \n     Agriculture and be published in its final form in the Federal \n     Register no later than 30 days after its initial preparation.\n\nTITLE II--JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AGENCY ACTIONS RELATING TO EXPLORATION AND \n                              MINE PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 201. DEFINITIONS FOR TITLE.\n\n       In this title the term ``covered civil action'' means a \n     civil action against the Federal Government containing a \n     claim under section 702 of title 5, United States Code, \n     regarding agency action affecting a mineral exploration or \n     mine permit.\n\n     SEC. 202. TIMELY FILINGS.\n\n       A covered civil action is barred unless filed no later than \n     the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date of the \n     final Federal agency action to which it relates.\n\n     SEC. 203. RIGHT TO INTERVENE.\n\n       The holder of any mineral exploration or mine permit may \n     intervene as of right in any covered civil action by a person \n     affecting rights or obligations of the permit holder under \n     the permit.\n\n     SEC. 204. EXPEDITION IN HEARING AND DETERMINING THE ACTION.\n\n       The court shall endeavor to hear and determine any covered \n     civil action as expeditiously as possible.\n\n     SEC. 205. LIMITATION ON PROSPECTIVE RELIEF.\n\n       In a covered civil action, the court shall not grant or \n     approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that \n     such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than \n     necessary to correct the violation of a legal requirement, \n     and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct that \n     violation.\n\n     SEC. 206. LIMITATION ON ATTORNEYS' FEES.\n\n       Sections 504 of title 5, United States Code, and 2412 of \n     title 28, United States Code (together commonly called the \n     Equal Access to Justice Act) do not apply to a covered civil \n     action, nor shall any party in such a covered civil action \n     receive payment from the Federal Government for their \n     attorneys' fees, expenses, and other court costs.\n\n                  TITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 301. SECRETARIAL ORDER NOT AFFECTED.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as to affect any \n     aspect of Secretarial Order 3324, issued by the Secretary of \n     the Interior on December 3, 2012, with respect to potash and \n     oil and gas operators.\n\n  The CHAIR. No amendment to this bill is in order except for those \nprinted in House Report 114-301. Each such amendment may be offered \nonly in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the \nreport, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time \nspecified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall \nnot be subject to a demand for division of the question.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \nHouse Report 114-301.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, strike lines 1 through 15 and insert the following:\n       (1) Strategic and critical minerals.--The term ``strategic \n     and critical minerals''--\n       (A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), means--\n       (i) minerals and mineral groups identified as critical by \n     the National Research Council in the report titled \n     ``Minerals, Critical Minerals, and the U.S Economy'' and \n     dated 2008; and\n       (ii) additional minerals identified by the Secretary of the \n     Interior based on the National Research Council criteria in \n     such report; and\n       (B) does not include sand, gravel, or clay.\n       Page 5, line 25, after ``ties'' insert ``for strategic and \n     critical minerals''.\n       Page 6, line 3, after ``operation'' insert ``for strategic \n     and critical mineral mines''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 481, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would fix a critical problem with this \nbill, namely, that the name of the bill doesn't match the substance of \nthe bill.\n  When you read the title, you would think this bill has something to \ndo with critical and strategic minerals, but, in fact, as currently \nwritten, the bill would define practically every mined substance--and \nthat is every mined substance in the United States--as being strategic \nand critical. Sand, gravel, gold, copper, clay, all of these, are \nstrategic and critical under this bill, and I think that is going too \nfar.\n  In fact, I am still waiting for someone to explain to me what mineral \nwouldn't fall under the definition of this bill. Certainly none of the \nwitnesses at our June Committee on Natural Resources could name one.\n  The National Research Council published a 2008 report called \n``Minerals, Critical Minerals, and the U.S. Economy,'' and it states: \nTo be critical, a mineral must be both essential in use and subject to \nsupply restriction.\n  They go on to point out some specific examples of minerals that are \nessential, but not critical, such as copper, iron ore, and construction \naggregates, such as sand and gravel, except that this bill would \ncompletely ignore the National Research Council and many other \norganizations that know what criticality means and define all of \nthese--copper, iron ore, sand, gravel, and more--as strategic and \ncritical minerals.\n  There is no doubt that these minerals are essential, but they are \nwidely produced in the United States, and there is no danger of a break \nin the supply chain. Let me state that again. There is no danger of a \nbreak in the supply chain.\n  Let's talk about the sand and gravel that was just mentioned before. \nThere are roughly 6500 sand and gravel quarries in the United States. \nWe are not\n\n[[Page H7115]]\n\ngoing to run out of gravel by not permitting one more gravel mine.\n  Gravel is important, but no one from the National Research Council or \nthe Department of Energy or any organization that knows the real \ndefinition of critical minerals would consider sand and gravel to fall \nin that category, period, end of discussion.\n  My amendment would ensure that the scientifically vetted definition \ndetermined by the NRC is what the Secretary of the Interior uses to \nassess the criticality of minerals to be mined under this bill. It \nwould ensure that the bill actually addresses the intent that is \nsuggested by its own title: critical minerals.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  It puts no time limits on the identification of these minerals. So, \nas conditions change over time, the Secretary would be able to add or \nremove items from the list of critical minerals, as necessary.\n  Republicans in the Senate understand this. Senator Murkowski, the \nchair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees \nmining, has introduced a bill that requires a methodology for \ndetermining which minerals would qualify as critical.\n  That methodology is to be based on an assessment of--I quote in her \nbill--``whether the materials are subject to potential supply \nrestrictions and also important in use.''\n  I may not agree with everything that is in Senator Murkowski's bill, \nbut I believe that she at least understands the definition of a \ncritical mineral and is making a serious attempt to expand the \nproduction of minerals that are actually critically important and \nstrategic.\n  But without my amendment, this bill is just a guise for mining \ninterests to loosen public review, judicial review, and environmental \nprotections for all hardrock mining.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In response, I just have to say one word: earthquake.\n  During the 2008 Great Southern California ShakeOut, which studied and \nanalyzed the potential effects of a major earthquake, the USGS \ndiscovered that there would be a shortfall of building materials, \nnamely, sand and gravel, if there was a major earthquake, God forbid, \ncausing significant damage in the L.A. basin and the surrounding areas.\n  This amendment, if we accept it, would preclude that sand and gravel \nwould be defined as critical, hindering expedited development of these \nresources.\n  Furthermore, by explicitly excluding sand, gravel or clay, this \namendment is at fundamental odds with the National Research Council \nstudy--I have quoted it earlier--which stated: ``All minerals and \nmineral products could be or could become critical to some degree, \ndepending on their importance and availability.''\n  The California Geological Survey recently released information \nforecasting a continuing shortage in California of permitted aggregate \nresources so as to meet only one-third of demand over the next 50 years \nin the State of California.\n  So we have a shortage coming, whether people like it or not, and that \nis without a major earthquake. Once again, God forbid.\n  The bill, as currently structured, does allow the market and the \nNation's needs to define a mineral as critical, thereby allowing the \nflexibility necessary for carrying out the provisions of the act.\n  However, this amendment would hinder the efficiency and fluidity this \nbill seeks to inject into the permitting process for critical and \nstrategic minerals by imposing an extra bureaucratic determination to \nbe made by the Secretary of the Interior. It also picks winners and \nlosers in the mining industry.\n  So for those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say, in conclusion, \nthat we are talking about a definition of critical and strategic \nminerals that comes from the NRC, or the National Resource Council, \nthat really talks about things that are essential.\n  But it also says that, to be declared critical, it must have a danger \nof disruption in the supply chain. We must have a limit to where we can \naccess other materials.\n  As it was just pointed out, what happens if there is an earthquake in \nSouthern California? God help us. Let's hope that there is not going to \nbe an earthquake in Southern California. And there is a limitation on \nthe supply.\n  I would like to urge us to say that the Secretary has the ability to \nchange what is on that list or not under my amendment.\n  I urge support of my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mrs. Dingell\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \nHouse Report 114-301.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 7, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through page 8, line 18, and insert the following:\n       (b) Treatment of Permits Under NEPA.--Issuance of a mineral \n     exploration or mine permit shall be treated as a major \n     Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the \n     human environment for purposes of the National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.).\n       Beginning at page 9, strike line 19 and all that follows \n     through page 12, line 21.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 481, the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Dingell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  There are several troubling positions in this legislation, many of \nwhich my other colleagues have already addressed this afternoon. But I \nam particularly concerned with how H.R. 1937 treats the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, or NEPA, as it has become known.\n  If this bill were to become law, public comment would be severely \nlimited and, in some instances, a proper environmental review may not \nbe conducted at all.\n  The underlying bill employs a functional equivalence standard, which \nwould permit the lead agency to circumvent a NEPA review if other \nagencies have performed reviews that are determined to be equivalent. \nThere are several problems with this approach.\n  First, it is not clear that the six factors listed in the bill \ncompromise all that a NEPA document would explore. So if functional \nequivalence was applied, the public may not have the complete story \nabout the environmental impacts of a specific project.\n  Second, case law demonstrates that functional equivalence has \nhistorically not been extended to other agencies beyond the EPA because \nthey are simply not equipped to do that kind of work.\n  That is why the committee heard testimony earlier this year that this \nprovision ignores Congress' choices in NEPA, as well as the judiciary's \nstruggle with functional equivalence.\n  My amendment strikes the functional equivalence provisions and \nreplaces it with the language that makes it clear that all mine \nexplorations or mine permits are major Federal actions and would \nrequire an environmental impact statement under NEPA.\n  It is well known that hardrock mining can have adverse health \nimpacts, and these projects deserve a formal environmental review.\n  NEPA has a simple premise: Look before you leap. This landmark law \ngives the public an opportunity to review and comment on actions \nproposed by\n\n[[Page H7116]]\n\nthe government, adding to the evaluation process unique perspectives \nthat highly specialized, mission-driven agencies might otherwise \nignore.\n  We should be preserving and protecting this important tool for public \nparticipation rather than undermining it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Dingell amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would urge rejection of this amendment because it would make the \npermitting process for critical and strategic minerals even worse than \nit currently is. It is already 7 to 10 or more years. It is dead last \nin the 25 major mineral-producing countries in the world, according to \nthat recent study we cited earlier.\n  This amendment would strike several key sections of the bill, \nincluding the NEPA provisions, the expedited schedule provision, the \ntime limit provision, and the applicability of this law to existing \npermit application provision.\n  First, this amendment seeks to remove the NEPA provisions. Our \nprovision does not sidestep or avoid the NEPA process in any way; \nrather, it codifies a judicial determination for NEPA known as the \nfunctional equivalence doctrine.\n  This doctrine provides that, when an agency action, whether State or \nFederal, has addressed the substantive requirements of NEPA, such \naction may be substituted as sufficient rather than having to prepare \nan entirely new and duplicative environmental study.\n  This amendment rejects the functional equivalence doctrine and \nmandates that the issuance of every mineral exploration or mine permit \nconstitutes a ``major Federal action,'' thereby requiring the \ndevelopment of costly and time-consuming environmental impact \nstatements, regardless of a proposed project's size.\n  Furthermore, this amendment strikes the provisions of the bill that \nrequires the authorizing agency to develop a schedule for the permit \nprocess, and it removes the 30-month time constraints that would be put \non said authorizing agency.\n  In other words, it restores the current 7- to 10-year permit process \nthat plagues the mining industry and the production of jobs and the \ngrowth of our economy.\n  Let me mention one thing about automobile manufacturing in \nparticular. An automobile contains rare earths for magnets, copper, \naluminum, platinum, and many other critical minerals and elements.\n  According to Rare Earth Technology Alliance, the average hybrid car \ncontains 61 pounds of rare earth metals. So it is important that we \npass this bill.\n  This amendment unfortunately guts the bill. I would urge opposition \nto it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to quickly respond to some of the \npoints made by my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  I do recognize the importance of those metals in auto production. It \nis important to me. But this bill isn't going to impact them.\n  To be frank, I think this bill is a solution in search of a problem. \nNEPA is often a scapegoat for permitting delays, but this does not hold \nup when you closely examine the facts.\n  In fact, since 2008, the approval time for hardrock mines has \ndecreased. Last year the average time it took to approve a plan of \noperations for a hardrock mine was 17 months--17 months--not 10 years.\n  I want jobs as much as my colleagues do on the other side of the \naisle, but I want to protect people. Project complexity, local \nopposition, and the lack of funding are almost always the culprits for \na project being delayed, but everybody wants to blame NEPA unfairly.\n  Hardrock mines could pose significant threats to public health, \nwater, and the environment. We must ensure that every mining \napplication is properly reviewed under NEPA, as my amendment proposes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind us all that America \nhas a plentiful supply of rare earth elements, but there are roadblocks \nto developing them, such that China produces 97 percent of the world's \nsupply and there are at least 19 unique minerals that the U.S. has zero \nsupply of.\n  So if we continue the current regime of 7 to 10 years to permit a \nmine project--and that is what will happen if we don't pass this bill--\nthen we are going to be dependent on other countries and automobile and \nall kinds of manufacturing will be affected.\n  The 2014 ranking of countries for mining investment, out of the 25 \nmajor mining companies, found that the delays that we have in this \ncountry are the worst in the world; yet, we have such tremendous \nresources if we were only to use them.\n  So I think this bill is a good faith and reasonable effort to strike \nthe balance between proper environmental protection by keeping \nfunctional equivalence and, yet, producing the minerals that will give \nus the jobs we need.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge rejection of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan will be \npostponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Cartwright\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \nHouse Report 114-301.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 14, line 1, strike title II.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 481, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chair, just off the floor of the House of Representatives, steps \noutside the door, we have a magnificent statue of one of our Founding \nFathers, Thomas Jefferson.\n  Thomas Jefferson said: ``I consider trial by jury as the only anchor \never yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the \nprinciples of its constitution.''\n  The amendment I offer today, Mr. Chair, ensures that an important \nright of the American people is preserved: the right to hold the \ngovernment accountable for their actions, the right of ordinary \nAmericans to go into court and hold the government accountable.\n  The right to challenge the government in court should not be limited \nto large groups that are well funded and have the financial ability to \npay for a lawyer, and that is exactly what this bill would do. This \nright should be extended to every American citizen, every small \nbusiness, every nonprofit organization regardless of the size and scope \nof their wallets.\n  Now, as a lifetime courtroom lawyer, I know the importance of being \nable to access the court system. For many years, I fought to make sure \nthat ordinary Americans could have their day in court and hold \nwrongdoers accountable.\n  Access to the courts is a key right envisioned by not only Thomas \nJefferson, but all of the Founding Fathers, and is protected by the \nEqual Access to Justice Act, the EAJA, which allows eligible \nindividuals to recover fees and expenses from the government if they \nwin their day in court. As a Congressman and former trial attorney, I \ncannot and will not stand by silently and watch this bill chip away at \nthis American right without standing up and speaking out.\n  By exempting exploration and mining permits from the Equal Access to \nJustice Act, this bill prevents valid\n\n[[Page H7117]]\n\nclaims from reaching the courts by prohibiting the government from \nreimbursing legal expenses to parties that win in court. This overturns \n30 years of legal precedent aimed at opening the court's doors to the \npublic.\n  What I can't understand is why any of my colleagues across the aisle \nwould want to limit review of the government's actions, given the \nfairly consistent message we hear that government has gotten too big \nand continues to come up with unnecessary rules and rulings.\n  EAJA allows average citizens to challenge this kind of thing in \ncourt, challenge the very kind of supposed overreach that the majority \nalways likes to talk about.\n  We have heard time and time again from the majority that blocking \naccess to the courts is necessary to halt frivolous and unnecessary \nlitigation, as if judges are incapable or lack the intellectual rigor \nto be able to figure it out for themselves; but it is this bill that is \nfrivolous and unnecessary, and the Congressional Budget Office proves \nit.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, estimates that this bill, \nH.R. 1937, would reduce direct spending by less than $50,000 a year. We \nare throwing up a barrier to access the courts for a paltry $50,000 a \nyear.\n  But the larger point is this is money that is awarded to successful \nclaimants against the government. Why would you want to punish the \nsuccessful claimants in the name of cutting down on frivolous \nlitigation? Frivolous litigation, by definition, is claims that are so \nbad, they couldn't possibly win in court and never do.\n  The only reason I can see for the EAJA exemption in this bill is that \nit further solidifies industry's free pass to mine on U.S. public \nlands. First, this bill limits public and agency consideration by \nwaiving the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, and setting \nunrealistic time limits. Then title II puts the nail in the coffin by \neliminating the public's last opportunity to review a mine's permit by \nchallenging it in open court.\n  My amendment today would strike all of title II, including the EAJA \nexemption, in order to maintain this vital, time-honored American \npublic right to challenge the government's decisions in court.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes title II of the \nbill, which addresses the judicial review of agency actions relating to \nexploration and mine permits. This title is designed to address one of \nthe primary contributors to the long permitting timelines and delays we \nhave been talking about this afternoon: relentless litigation brought \nby environmental organizations.\n  Regulatory agencies routinely try to craft a lawsuit-proof NEPA \ndocument. However, that is impossible. They are going to get sued no \nmatter what. So title II seeks to provide some certainty in the \nlitigation process. Rather than prohibit or block litigation, it does \nseveral reasonable things:\n  It expedites the judicial process by requiring timely filings no \nlater than 60 days after a final agency action. It just keeps the ball \nrolling. That is entirely reasonable.\n  It requires the court to proceed expeditiously on reaching a \ndetermination in the case. That also is entirely reasonable.\n  Furthermore, title II provides the project proponent a guaranteed \nright to intervene. If a company has invested millions or even billions \nof dollars in a project, they deserve an opportunity to go to court on \nsomething that could adversely impact their investment. That, too, is \nentirely reasonable.\n  Also, title II limits certain prospective attorneys' fees under the \nEqual Access to Justice Act. This provision affects all parties to the \nlawsuit, including permitholders, and has as its purpose dissuading \nfrivolous suits that would harm the Nation's ability to provide these \nvital resources. That, too, is entirely reasonable.\n  So for those reasons, I would say, let's reject this amendment. Let's \nkeep title II in the bill. It is essential to have a predictable and \nreasonable permitting timeline so that we can explore and develop these \nresources to make our economy stronger. I urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, I acknowledge my colleague from Colorado. \nHowever, his silence on the point I was making is deafening.\n  The point I made is that cutting out EAJA from this act means that \nyou are attacking successful claims. If your point is to attack \nfrivolous lawsuits, you don't cut out reimbursing legal fees and costs \nfor successful claims. What are we really up to by doing that?\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. \nPearce).\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, just in answer to the gentleman's question, I \nwould point out that what happens right now is that the EAJA is \nactually gamed. People can put in 15 or 20 frivolous claims, but if \nthey have a finding on one substantial thing--and always, those \nlawsuits have a multitude of claims, but then one thing will be tucked \nin that is simply procedural that the agency forgot the deadline, it \ndidn't have a meeting--and if the judge finds on one, then all are paid \nfor. So they are allowed to bring frivolous actions with one \nsubstantiating claim, and it is those frivolous things that tie up and \nhold up development.\n  No one objects to the fact that sometimes the agencies are wrong. \nPeople do object to the fact that frivolous lawsuits come under the \ncover of one thing that is just almost inane in the whole discussion.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I have a simple question.\n  Name one Federal judge who has granted all of the attorneys' fees \nwhere there are 15 frivolous claims and one successful one.\n  I have never heard of such a thing.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.\n  Mr. PEARCE. I would be happy to respond. I will provide the \ndocumentation to the gentleman afterwards. I don't have it right here. \nBut we see these things in New Mexico.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Reclaiming my time, I will just conclude, Mr. Chairman, \nby saying that this amendment is not a good amendment for the bill \nbecause it guts title II.\n  We need some predictability in the litigation process as well as in \nthe government bureaucratic process. This allows parties to go to \ncourt. It prevents the abuse of EAJA.\n  It is not the legitimate use of that law that we are after; it is the \nabuse of that particular law. That is why it is addressed in this bill.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Pearce\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \nHouse Report 114-301.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike title III (page 15, beginning at line 15) and insert \n     the following:\n\n                  TITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 301. SECRETARIAL ORDER NOT AFFECTED.\n\n       This Act shall not apply to any mineral described in \n     Secretarial Order 3324, issued by the Secretary of the \n     Interior on December 3, 2012, in any area to which the Order \n     applies.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 481, the gentleman from New \nMexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, in the Permian Basin, which the Second \nDistrict\n\n[[Page H7118]]\n\nof New Mexico falls just in the corner of that, two or three counties \nhave tremendous assets. It is home to some of the most prolific and \npurest forms of potash, which is used for fertilizer, and then it also \nhas significant oil and gas.\n  When I was elected to Congress in 2002, one of the first things that \nnext year that we began to discover is that the oil and gas and potash \nindustries have had an approximately 50-year running battle against \neach other. We began to try to sort through the differing opinions, \nworking with the agency, the Interior Department, and over the next 10 \napproximate years, worked out an agreement with the Secretary of the \nInterior and the two different industries on how to both get along in \nthe same area. That was a significant undertaking. It was a significant \nfinding by the Interior Department and, again, took almost 10 years of \nvery delicate negotiations. So my amendment to this bill, H.R. 1937, is \nsimply to clarify that nothing in the bill overturns that agreement \nthat has been reached.\n  Again, this agreement came under the Obama administration but dated \nback through the Bush administration, so it has been pretty well looked \nat by both sides, both parties, and has been functioning very well.\n  It is my desire to simply get the clarifying language that nothing in \nthe bill is going to change that Secretarial order, and, likewise, the \namendment does nothing to change the language in the bill. It is just \nclarifying that this is what we are going to do.\n  It is extremely important for New Mexico, but also for the Nation, \nbecause the potash provides the fertilizer for food sources across the \nNation; but also, the oil and gas industry is providing much of the oil \nand gas that is coming into America's supply right now and driving down \nthe price. The discoveries in that particular region will produce more \noil and gas in one county than has been produced in the entire State \nfor its entire history. So it is not as if these questions are \ninsignificant.\n  Again, my amendment is very straightforward. It just seeks to clarify \nthat nothing is going to affect that Secretarial order.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PEARCE. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. We support the amendment and commend the author for \noffering it.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime that is allotted to the opposition to this amendment, although I \ndo not intend to oppose it.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nPennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I think it is interesting that this \namendment is coming up, as it has in the past, because it simply proves \nthe point we have been trying to make.\n  The larger point is that this bill is simply too broad. It covers \nevery possible mineral you could mine, including potash. I think the \ngentleman from New Mexico would agree that potash is not a strategic \nand critical mineral. It does not need the environmental review waivers \nthat this bill would provide.\n  What many of my colleagues and I are saying is that potash is no \ndifferent from many other minerals. The concern for southeastern New \nMexico is that potash development and oil and gas drilling should be \nable to occur without conflict. This bill would threaten that.\n  Well, we want to make sure that mineral development doesn't conflict \nwith other things as well throughout the country, like hunting, \nfishing, camping, grazing, recreating, conserving, and other legitimate \nuses. Unfortunately, this bill threatens that, and we are likely not \ngoing to grant exemptions for these purposes like we are for the oil \nand gas industry.\n  I would certainly like it if sportsmen were protected from hastily \nadopted and permitted sand and gravel quarries the same way you want \nyour oil and gas drillers to be protected from hastily permitted potash \nmines.\n  Interestingly, potash is a mineral where we import over 80 percent of \nour supply. We are entirely self-sufficient in sand and gravel. So, by \nthat standard, you could say that potash is more critical and strategic \nthan sand and gravel. But the majority will allow this amendment to be \nadopted because it benefits oil and gas producers.\n  Mr. Chairman, meanwhile, the Lowenthal amendment, which takes sand \nand gravel out of this bill for the benefit of everyone else in this \ncountry, is likely to get voted down. I think that is unfortunate.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, again, this is an amendment that does not \nchange the underlying language of the bill. It simply seeks to clarify \nto all parties that no change was intended and no change will occur to \nthe existing order from the Secretary.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would urge everyone to support the amendment and the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Hastings\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \nHouse Report 114-301.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n                   TITLE __--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. _01. LIMITATION ON APPLICATION.\n\n       This Act shall not apply with respect to a proposed \n     strategic and critical minerals mining project unless the \n     project proponent demonstrates that the combined capacity of \n     existing mining operations in the United States producing the \n     same mineral product that will be produced by the project, \n     whether currently in operation or not, but not including \n     mining operations for which a reclamation plan is being \n     implemented or has been fully implemented, is less than 80 \n     percent of the demand for that mineral product in the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. _02. PUBLICATION OF NOTICE REGARDING TRANSPORTATION AND \n                   SALE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       If any intermediate or final mineral product produced by a \n     strategic and critical minerals mining project is to be \n     transported or sold outside the United States, and the \n     project proponent cannot demonstrate that the annual \n     production of such product in the United States exceeds 80 \n     percent of the demand for that product in the United States, \n     the project proponent shall publish at least once prior \n     notice of their intent to make such transport or sale in \n     national newspapers or trade publications, by electronic \n     means, or both, and on any Internet site that is maintained \n     by the project proponent.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 481, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Hastings) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Chairman, when I saw H.R. 1937 as submitted, I \nagreed with the minority on the Energy and Mineral Resources \nSubcommittee that it was in need of a significant amendment, in \nparticular, in the definition of ``strategic and critical minerals.''\n  The amendment submitted by Congressman Lowenthal is also a good basis \nand would correct the bill. However, as this has been rejected in the \npast, I took a less stringent approach that I believe would be a basis \nthat would at least eliminate the most egregious aspects of the \ndefinition.\n  This bill addresses a real problem, which is that long permitting \ndelays for mining projects in the United States, especially in remote \nor environmentally sensitive areas, can reach 7 to 10 years in some \ncases.\n  This represents a significant project risk for potential investors, \nwhich makes them historically more likely to develop projects outside \nof the United States when there are opportunities to produce the same \nmineral products.\n  Increasing international government scrutiny on environmental issues \nfor mining projects outside of the United States along with civil \ninstability in many mineral resource-rich countries\n\n[[Page H7119]]\n\nhas prompted project proponents to look to the United States as a safer \nalternative, given that projects can be developed in a reasonable \ntimeframe.\n  That said, Mr. Chairman, the majority's claims of mining permit \ndelays for all kinds of mining projects that prompted this bill are \nunfounded. Last year the average time it took to approve a plan of \noperations for a hardrock mine was 17 months, and since 2008, the \napproval time has actually decreased. As of last year, the Obama \nadministration had approved 69 percent of hardrock mines within 3 \nyears.\n  Rather than addressing the problem directly with the responsible \nagencies, as President Obama did in his Presidential order ``Improving \nPerformance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure \nProjects'' dated March 22, 2012, this bill is an end run around the \npermitting process, the authority of the permitting agencies, and the \ncourts.\n  H.R. 1937 includes a very broad definition of ``strategic and \ncritical minerals'' that does not take into account whether these \nminerals are actually in short supply in the United States. Under the \ndefinition as written, cement, and wallboard, as well as gold and \ndiamonds would qualify. It makes one wonder if there is a strategic and \ncritical shortage of jewelry in the United States.\n  The authors of this bill say that they do not wish to identify which \nmineral products are ``strategic and critical'' since this may change \nover time with changes in national priorities. Therefore, this \namendment adds a simple test. This amendment requires proposed \n``strategic and critical minerals'' projects to demonstrate that \ndomestic capacity to produce strategic and critical minerals is less \nthan 80 percent of domestic requirements. This would eliminate mineral \nproducts such as sand and gravel, which the authors claim the bill was \nnever meant to encompass.\n  The amendment also requires that unless or until the domestic \ncapacity for a ``strategic and critical mineral'' product exceeds 80 \npercent of domestic requirements, the public will be notified of the \nintent to transport or sell any final or intermediate strategic and \ncritical mineral products outside of the United States.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I am having a little trouble understanding \nwhere this amendment is headed and what it is really trying to do. If I \nunderstand correctly, it proposes to limit export of strategic and \ncritical minerals if the supply of those minerals is greater than 80 \npercent of domestic demand. As I am trying to figure that out, one \nthing that jumps out at me is why is 80 percent a significant \nmilestone? It seems sort of plucked out of thin air. It seems \narbitrary.\n  How would you measure and find that 80 percent of something that is \nused in many ways around the country, I am not sure how that would be \ndone, by advertising in national newspapers or something? I am just a \nlittle unsure.\n  Also, the amendment appears to be internally inconsistent. On one \nhand, the amendment seeks to prevent the use of the bill's provisions \nif the supply is greater than 80 percent of domestic demands. On the \nother hand, the amendment says that the project proponent cannot show \nthat production exceeds 80 percent of domestic demand, the project \nproponent must advertise that fact in a national newspaper, trade \npublications, or Web site.\n  I am just a little confused as to what this amendment is really \ntrying to get at. But it does seem to be, in the final analysis, a \ncontinuation of the overregulation that has produced this problem in \nthe first place. We have so many regulatory obstacles to producing \nminerals that it does take 7 to 10 years.\n  Now, if you take a certain slice out of that process, it may sound \nlike a smaller period of time. But when you add in litigation and \neverything else that accompanies the process, it is literally 7 to 10 \nyears, especially for hardrock mine projects that produce rare earth \nminerals and things like that.\n  There might be a few exceptions for clay or other items that are of \nless concern, but for hardrock mining, there is no way to avoid the 7 \nto 10 years, unfortunately, in our country today. This would be another \nexample of the kind of regulation that just gums up the whole process.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I would urge the rejection of this amendment.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Hastings).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed.\n  Mr. LAMBORN.

{time}  1620\n\n  Ms. MOORE changed her vote from ``no'' to ``aye.''\n  So the amendment was rejected.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, \nthe Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe \nof Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bost, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1937) to \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture \nto more efficiently develop domestic sources of the minerals and \nmineral materials of strategic and critical importance to United States \neconomic and national security and manufacturing competitiveness, and, \npursuant to House Resolution 481, he reported the bill back to the \nHouse with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  The question is on the amendment.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. PETERS. I am in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Peters moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1937 to the \n     Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n     SEC. _01. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.\n\n       Nothing in this Act limits the authority of the lead agency \n     with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine \n     permit from assessing the extent to which the activity \n     proposed to be conducted under the permit may contribute to \n     climate change.\n\n  Mr. PETERS (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  I have been a clear proponent for reducing regulatory burdens and \nstreamlining the environmental review process in ways that make sense.\n  Before I entered public service, I practiced environmental law for 15 \nyears in large firms, in a government office, and in my own firm. \nThrough that experience, I learned firsthand of the frustration that \nmany businesses and local governments face when they try to navigate a \nsometimes overly complex and underly responsive permit process.\n  I also know from experience that time is money. Often a business \nseeking a permit is paying dearly to hold a property or service a loan \nwhile it waits for that permit to be issued, and\n\n[[Page H7123]]\n\nthat is why I have often said that, for applicants, no is the second-\nbest answer. Tell us ``no'' or tell us how, but don't string us along.\n  Unfortunately, the approach that the underlying bill takes is not to \nstreamline the process for analyzing the significant impacts of \nhardrock mining, which I might support; it just eliminates the review \nprocess altogether.\n  Mr. Speaker, my amendment would not solve that problem but would make \nan important clarification. As these critical mineral mining projects \nundergo environmental review, agencies should be able to assess how the \nproject may contribute to climate change.\n  Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or \nNOAA, reported that the first 7 months of this year had been the \nhottest such period on record. Globally, average surface temperatures \nhave increased substantially in the last century, and nearly twice as \nfast in the last 50 years alone. We know that the vast majority of \nclimate scientists, including numerous leading scientific and academic \norganizations across the world, agree that the planet is warming due to \nhuman activities.\n  How many national academies reject the science of global warming? \nNone. Between November 2012 and December 2013, there were 9,137 peer-\nreviewed papers written on climate change. Of those 9,137 papers, how \nmany did not agree that climate change is happening because of human \nactivity? One. That is right. Only 1 out of more than 9,000.\n  So it seems to me that when scientific organizations, including the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, the American \nChemical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American \nMeteorological Society, the American Physical Society, the Geological \nSociety of America, the National Academy of Sciences, and the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change all agree that climate change \nis happening because of human activity, we ought to be listening.\n  If 99 doctors told you that you had diabetes and 1 said he wasn't \nsure, wouldn't you still do something?\n  Now, for too long, we have heard that we have to choose between a \nprosperous economy and a clean environment. San Diegans and people \naround the country know that is a false choice. We can and we must \nprovide economic opportunity and clean air and water for future \ngenerations.\n  Given the high stakes associated with carbon emissions and climate \nchange on coastal property, energy, defense, our food supply, and our \nquality of life, shouldn't we at least understand the long-term costs \nassociated with a project?\n  By allowing agencies to take a full environmental consideration of a \nproject, including its potential contributions to climate change, my \namendment rejects the false choice between a prosperous economy and a \nhealthy climate. We can and we must have both.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is a procedural \nmotion designed to slow down consideration of this important jobs bill. \nIt is a purely procedural motion, not a substantive motion. I urge us \nto reject the motion.\n  It is important to pass this bill. Right now it takes 7 to 10 years \nto approve a mining project in the U.S. Mr. Speaker, this is dead last \namong major mining countries. The critical and strategic minerals we \nmine in this country go into vital infrastructure and manufacturing to \nimprove our way of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, when we use American resources to create American jobs, \nwe reduce our dependency on foreign countries like China. This bill \nwill reduce bureaucratic red tape, speed up the legal and permitting \nprocess, and create certainty so that mining projects will stay here in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and \nsupport H.R. 1937 to use American resources for American jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-\nminute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered; ordering the previous \nquestion on House Resolution 483; and adoption of House Resolution 483, \nif ordered.\n  This is a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 184, \nnoes 246, not voting 4, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 564]\n\n                               AYES--184\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Greg has shown that there is no greater reward \nthan the satisfaction of serving one's fellow neighbor. For having \nembraced this most noble of endeavors with such lofty principles, I \nthank him so very much.\n  Not one to rest on his laurels since his retirement, Greg continues \nto volunteer his time to serve our community through his church, the \nBoy Scouts of America, and as a police reserve officer with the Miami-\nDade Police Department.\n  Godspeed to Greg Truitt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7126-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MINNESOTA LYNX\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members of our House today to \njoin me in support of H.R. 2800, the Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment \nAct.\n  This important piece of legislation expands upon existing law to help \nprotect pregnant women from workplace discrimination, and I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor.\n  Women account for nearly half of the workforce in our country, so it \nis particularly hard to believe, in today's society, women are still \ndenied jobs or lose their jobs because they are pregnant. Every time \nthis happens to a mom, it hurts her, it hurts her family, and it hurts \nour economy.\n  We must ensure that hardworking moms and moms-to-be are protected \nfrom unfair employment decisions. As a society, we should encourage and \nsupport all workers. We should help ensure that moms and dads are \nphysically and financially healthy and secure as they approach \nparenthood.\n  As a single father myself, who raised my son from the time he was in \ndiapers, I know firsthand how important it is to have a support system. \nThat includes a supportive work environment where soon-to-be parents \nare not worried about being fired or about being overlooked for jobs or \npromotions because they have decided to have children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7127-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016--VETO MESSAGE \n      FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 114-70)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi) laid before the \nHouse the following veto message from the President of the United \nStates:\nTo The House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1735, the ``National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.'' While there are \nprovisions in this bill that I support, including the codification of \nkey interrogation-related reforms from Executive Order 13491 and \npositive changes to the military retirement system, the bill would, \namong other things, constrain the ability of the Department of Defense \nto conduct multi-year defense planning and align military capabilities \nand force structure with our national defense strategy, impede the \nclosure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, and prevent the \nimplementation of essential defense reforms.\n  This bill fails to authorize funding for our national defense in a \nfiscally responsible manner. It underfunds our military in the base \nbudget, and instead relies on an irresponsible budget gimmick that has \nbeen criticized by members of both parties. Specifically, the bill's \nuse of $38 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funding--which \nwas meant to fund wars and is not subject to budget caps--does not \nprovide the stable, multi-year budget upon which sound defense planning \ndepends. Because this bill authorizes base budget funding at \nsequestration levels, it threatens the readiness and capabilities of \nour military and fails to provide the support our men and women in \nuniform deserve. The decision reflected in this bill to circumvent \nrather than reverse sequestration further harms our national security \nby locking in unacceptable funding cuts for crucial national security \nactivities carried out by non-defense agencies.\n  I have repeatedly called upon the Congress to work with my \nAdministration to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, \nand explained why it is imperative that we do so. As I have noted, the \ncontinued operation of this facility weakens our national security by \ndraining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and \npartners, and emboldening violent extremists. Yet in addition to \nfailing to remove unwarranted restrictions on the transfer of \ndetainees, this bill seeks to impose more onerous ones. The executive \nbranch must have the flexibility, with regard to those detainees who \nremain at Guantanamo, to determine when and where to prosecute them, \nbased on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national \nsecurity interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with \nour national security and our humane treatment policy. Rather than \ntaking steps to bring this chapter of our history to a close, as I have \nrepeatedly called upon the Congress to do, this bill aims to extend it.\n  The bill also fails to adopt many essential defense reforms, \nincluding to force structure, weapons systems, and military health \ncare. Our defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it \nwill have the greatest effect. My Administration's proposals will \naccomplish this through critical reforms that divest unneeded force \nstructure, slow growth in compensation, and reduce wasteful overhead. \nThe restrictions in the bill would require the Department of Defense to \nretain unnecessary force structure and weapons systems that we cannot \nafford in today's fiscal environment, contributing to a military that \nwill be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.\n  Because of the manner in which this bill would undermine our national \nsecurity, I must veto it.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                     The White House, October 22, 2015.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The objections of the President will be \nspread at large upon the Journal, and the veto message and the bill \nwill be printed as a House document.\n  Pursuant to the order of the House of October 21, 2015, further \nconsideration of the veto message and the bill are postponed until the \nlegislative day of Thursday, November 5, 2015, and that on that \nlegislative day, the House shall proceed to the constitutional question \nof reconsideration and dispose of such question without intervening \nmotion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7127-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7127-H7129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SYRIAN DISPLACEMENT CRISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Syrian displacement \ncrisis has consumed seven nations in the Middle East, among them \nLebanon, Jordan, Turkey, obviously, and Syria itself, and has spawned \nthe largest refugee crisis Europe has faced since World War II.\n  The scope of the damage is incredible. This protracted conflict has \ndecimated Syria's infrastructure and has already taken the lives of \nover 250,000 civilians, has displaced over 4 million people, and has \nsubjected tens upon thousands of children in that nation to Assad's \nhorrific barrel bombs. Most everyone who remains in Syria endures power \nand water cuts, the threat of shelling, galloping inflation, and \nrampant speculation about: What will happen next? Who will help us, the \ninnocents?\n  With roads often subject to ambush, freedom to travel has been \nheavily curtailed. Checkpoints and concrete blast barriers have become \naccepted adornments of daily life. Institutions such as schools, \nhospitals, and offices remain open in government-held areas, though \nmany schools have become shelters for the legions of war injured and \nhomeless. Truly, it is grim. Often, classes are held in double shifts \nto make room for the extra students. This is everyday life in Syria.\n  Five years into the conflict that has ravaged this once-modern \nnation, more than half of the Syrian population is displaced, with over \n4 million refugees in neighboring countries and tens of thousands \nmoving toward Europe. We see this on television every evening.\n  My hometown of Toledo has taken in 8 weary Syrian families--refugees \nwho have now again found hope in the liberty that America offers--but \nfewer than 2,000 Syrians have come to the United States, though the war \nhas displaced more than 12 million since 2011. The free world simply \ncannot allow this savage slaughter and dislocation to continue.\n  We ask ourselves: Where is the leadership for resolution?\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Now, in addition to daily airstrikes against civilians by the Syrian \nGovernment violating international humanitarian law, Russian warplanes \nare\n\n[[Page H7128]]\n\nstriking medical facilities and residential areas in non-ISIL areas \nwhere rebel forces are fighting to overthrow the Assad regime while \nRussia publicly proclaims its aim of eliminating ISIL targets.\n  I brought a map to the floor here that essentially shows most of \nSyria, who holds it. If one looks at these red dots here, the Russian \nplanes are mainly bombing in the rebel-held areas, not in the ISIL-held \nareas. So we see a complex situation that has developed on the ground.\n  As Putin moves with defiance to maintain the Syrian dictatorship, his \nactions simply must be checked because it tells us that, in the future, \nthere will be more slaughter with what remains if those moderate forces \nare not allowed to survive.\n  Since Russia began airstrikes at the end of September, at least 127 \ncivilians, including 36 children and 34 women, have been killed by \nRussian airstrikes, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for \nHuman Rights.\n  For the sake of liberty in Syria, in Europe, and around the world, \nAmerica, NATO, the Transatlantic Alliance, and our allies in the Middle \nEast must lead the region to peaceful settlement.\n  I happen to represent a region in America where Syrian Americans have \nlived for over a century. I can't even explain to you how they feel \nabout the total destruction of their homeland, its artifacts, and its \nhistory. I am not even able to contain it in words here.\n  They came to see me last week, and they asked if I would read some of \ntheir words into the Record, which I promised I would do this evening. \nThey want the American people and the world to know:\n\n       The biggest killer of civilians in Syria is the Assad \n     regime's use of barrel bombs. Packed with TNT and shrapnel, \n     these dumb bombs have no target and are just dropped from \n     helicopters on civilian neighborhoods. These bombs cause \n     massive destruction and casualties. Thousands upon thousands \n     of children have been killed and injured by these helicopter \n     flights.\n\n  And they said to me: Congresswoman, if you can say one thing to the \nCongress and to those in Washington who can make a difference, please \ntell them to disrupt and stop these helicopter flyovers. So the barrel \nbombs aren't coming out of the F-16s obviously flying over Syria, but \nthey are coming from helicopters that the Assad regime is dispatching \nacross that country.\n\n       The most important step that can be done to save lives \n     would be the imposition of a no-fly zone. A no-fly zone will \n     turn the tide of war, and bring down the regime of terror and \n     force Assad to negotiate his exit.\n\n  We know there is resistance to that, but the world community must \nmeet this latest test in order to secure a better life for the people \nthat remain in Syria, those who may wish to return, and, obviously, the \nmillions that have fled and are in refugee camps throughout that region \nand now as far as Western Europe.\n  I would urge the President of our country to consider the appointment \nof a special envoy without portfolio for Syrian peace to work full-time \nto bring all relevant nations together to resolve this unfolding \ntragedy and aim at a civil military strategy for transition and \nsettlement.\n  I include for the Record Anthony Cordesman's writings.\n\n [From the Center for Strategic & International Studies, Oct. 1, 2015]\n\n  The Long War in Syria: The Trees, the Forest, and All the King's Men\n\n                       (By Anthony H. Cordesman)\n\n       Cliches are cliches, but sometimes it really is hard to see \n     the forest for the trees. In the case of Syria, the ``trees'' \n     include the UN debate between Obama and Putin over Syria and \n     the fight against Islamic extremism, Russia's sudden military \n     intervention in Syria, the failure of the U.S. training and \n     assist missions in both Syria and Iraq, and the developing \n     scandal in USCENTCOM over exaggerated claims of success for \n     the U.S.-led air campaign in Syria and Iraq.\n       The most important ``tree,'' however, is trying to \n     negotiate an end to the fighting from the outside, as if \n     Assad was the key issue and as if it would be possible for \n     some diplomatic elite or mix of power brokers to bring Syria \n     back to some state of stability if only Assad would agree to \n     leave and the United States and Russia could agree on how to \n     approach the negotiations.\n\n\n            Focusing on the Trees When the Forest is Burning\n\n       The problem is that the ``forest'' is dying, burning, and \n     occupied by four broad sets of fighters that have little \n     reason to cooperate with any UN-led negotiating effort, \n     outside agreement over Assad--with or without U.S. and \n     Russian cooperation.\n       To shift from one cliche to another, Syria presents far \n     more problems than Humpty Dumpty. ``All the king's horses and \n     all the king's men'' couldn't put Syria back together by \n     negotiating a solution from the outside even if there was one \n     King instead of a divided mix of the United States, Russia, \n     Iran, Turkey, Iraq, the other states surrounding Syria, the \n     Arabian Gulf states, Egypt, and France and the other \n     interested European powers.\n       It shouldn't take a child's nursery rhyme to point out the \n     obvious--although it is one whose origins may date back to \n     England's civil wars and first appeared in print shortly \n     after it became fully clear that there was no way English \n     could ever bring the 13 colonies back under its control. To \n     begin with, there is no equivalent of Humpty.\n\n\n   Putting Four Humptys Together with No King and No Unity Among the \n                               King's Men\n\n       The problem is not simply ISIS or Assad. ISIS is one of the \n     four ``Humptys'' in a shattered Syria, but ISIS controls only \n     a limited part of Syria's population even in the east. ISIS \n     occupies both parts of Syria and Iraq. It continues to \n     systematically purge any religious and ideological dissent \n     while neither government in Damascus or the government in \n     Baghdad have shown any clear ability to gain support from a \n     major portion of the Sunnis in the area that ISIS controls.\n       So far, neither the forces of the Syrian or Iraqi \n     government have had much military success against ISIS, and \n     U.S. claims that Iraq has regained some 35% of the territory \n     it lost to ISIS are little more than dishonest spin. They are \n     based on the maximum line of ISIS advance before any fighting \n     took place and before ISIS established any level of \n     governance or control. They include vast areas of unpopulated \n     desert: areas where no one controls anything because no one \n     is there.\n\n\n                               The Kurds\n\n       The second Humpty consists of the Syrian Kurds--who have \n     gone from a partially disenfranchised minority to the \n     equivalent of a mini-state in the north and east of Syria, \n     and have been the only real U.S. military train and assist \n     success. They have no reason to support Assad or any of those \n     who support Assad. They too are divided, and some have ties \n     to Turkish Kurds, some to Iraqi Kurds, some to both, and some \n     are independent.\n       At the same time, they have no clear economic viability as \n     a state, face growing water problems, and would need to grab \n     a significant part of Syria's limited oil and gas resources \n     in the East to be viable unless they somehow united in a \n     broader Kurdish entity--one that included Turkish and/or \n     Iraqi Kurds and would be likely to create a new set of \n     regional conflicts.\n       Furthermore, these Administration claims and maps that talk \n     about liberating 35% of the area that ISIS occupied ignore \n     the fact that control of much of the disputed populated areas \n     in Anbar remains undecided, and that it was the Iraqi Kurds \n     which not only recovered much of the lost populated areas \n     that did matter, but grabbed a large additional part of \n     Iraq--including Kirkuk and its oil fields--and created a \n     whole new dimension of the Kurdish problem and its tensions \n     with Iraq's Arab and the Turks while the corrupt government \n     in the Kurdish zone of Iraq has divided and threated to \n     create a new round of internal power struggles.\n\n\n                        The Other Sunni Fighters\n\n       The third Humpty consists of an uncertain coalition of \n     other Sunni fighters. They control--or are fighting for \n     control--in many of the most populated areas in Syria. There \n     are no reliable unclassified estimates of the number, \n     strength, and ideological character of these factions but \n     there are well over 20 groups--and some estimates go well \n     over 30.\n       Some, like the Al Nusra Front--one of the most successful \n     in military terms--are linked to Al Qaeda. Others are less \n     radical Islamist factions, but are scarcely secular or \n     moderate, also have no ties to the hollow outside efforts to \n     create moderate governments in exile, and are being backed by \n     Arab states like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The small \n     groups being given limited support with U.S. weapons and \n     Special Forces assistance are at best petty and uncertain \n     players.\n       This is also a group of fighters that is fighting the pro-\n     Assad forces in what is increasingly becoming a wasteland. \n     The fighting on the ground, Assad's barrel bombs and the \n     threat of poison gas, deliberate isolation and efforts to \n     starve out rebel held areas have created one of them most \n     serious humanitarian disasters in any one country in modern \n     history.\n       Many of the more than 4 million Syrian refugees that had \n     left Syria lived in the area where this fight takes place. \n     The same is true of the well over 7 million internally \n     displaced persons (IDPs) that no long have a real home, job, \n     business, or access to key services like health and \n     education.\n       Many of the more than 250,000 Syrian civilian dead, and at \n     least 500,000 seriously wounded are the product of this \n     fighting--although it is important to note that the UN ceased \n     to be able to make meaningful casualty estimates well over \n     half a year ago, and the estimates of refugees and IDPs have \n     ceased to increase because (a) there no longer is a basis for \n     guesstimating the increase, and (b) many of the remainder are \n     simply too poor to leave.\n       To go back to cliche number one, this is the area where the \n     forest has now been burning for some four years. This was one \n     of the\n\n[[Page H7129]]\n\n     most populated and developed parts of Syria. It is an area \n     where Syria's already poor economy probably now has a GDP \n     around 20% of what it was in 2011 and has no clear basis for \n     recovery. It is an area where no top down negotiation between \n     Assad or his backers and any outside faction can begin to put \n     even one Humpty back together again.\n\n\n                          The Assad Faction(s)\n\n       The fourth version of Humpty is the group of factions and \n     fighters supporting Assad. It is important to note that this \n     is not a unified group. No one has given most of those in the \n     area Assad control a choice as to who controls them. The \n     majority of the population is Sunni and other non-Alawites. \n     The Alawites are not Shi'ite, and are a gnostic religious \n     group that may have political ties to Iran and the Hezbollah, \n     but Alawites are not Muslims in the normal sense of the term.\n       There are no reliable data on Syria's population. The CIA \n     estimates, however, that some 17-18 million people remain in \n     Syria, it estimates that 87% are Muslim (official; includes \n     74% Sunni 74% and 13% that are a mix of Alawi, Ismaili, and \n     Shia). Some 10% are Christian (includes Orthodox, Uniate, and \n     Nestorian), and the final 3% are Druze and some small number \n     of Jews who remain in Damascus and Aleppo).\n       If one looks at the maps of Syria's sectarian and ethnic \n     divisions before the fighting, they are also distributed into \n     a series of small enclaves, many near the coast. They have no \n     clear ``region,'' and it is far from clear how many of the \n     Sunnis in the regular Syrian forces, the real Shi'ites and \n     other minorities in Syria, or the more secular Sunni \n     businesspersons and civilians would support either Assad or \n     any mix of Assad supporters if they had a choice.\n       It is also important to note that the World Bank rated the \n     Assad regime as having some of the worst governance in the \n     world before the uprising began in 2011. It was also rated as \n     deeply corrupt. Transparency International rated it as the \n     159th most corrupt country in the world--out of 175--in 2014. \n     The Arab and UN development reports warned that the younger \n     Assad was no better in moving the country towards real \n     economic development than his father, and that the massive \n     population increase in Syria had created a ``youth bulge'' \n     for which there were often no real jobs.\n       The Syrian GDP per capita was at best around $5,100 even in \n     Purchasing Power Parity P terms in 2011 before the upheavals \n     began--and ranked a dismal 165th in the world. It now may \n     average half that level. Some 33% of the population is 0-14 \n     years of age; 14% is 15-24, and over 500,000 young Syrian men \n     and women now reach job age each year in a country where \n     direct (ignoring disguised) unemployment is estimated to be \n     33-35%, and the poverty level was well over 12% before the \n     fighting started.\n\n\n             A Time for Honesty, Transparency, and Realism\n\n       One cannot ignore trees, anymore than one can ignore the \n     forest. The failure of U.S. policy and military efforts, \n     Russian and Iranian support of Assad and major Russian \n     military intervention, and the conflicting ways in which \n     other states intervene will all make things worse. The impact \n     of religious warfare and extremism, and failed Syrian \n     secularism, are even more serious problems.\n       It is time, however, to stop focusing on either ISIS or \n     Assad, to pretend that Syrian ``moderates'' are strong enough \n     to either affect the security situation or negotiate for \n     Syria's real fighters, and act as if a shattered nation could \n     be united by some top down negotiation between groups that \n     hate each other and have no competence in dealing with the \n     economic, social, and governance challenges Syria now faces.\n       The first step in solving a problem is to honestly assess \n     it. No negotiation can work that does not deal with grim \n     realities and divisions created by years of fighting. No \n     amount of U.S. and Russian intervention and argument can \n     bring security or stability. No UN effort at conventional \n     negotiation can survive encounter with reality, and no effort \n     of any kind that does not address the sheer scale of Syrian \n     recovery and reconstruction.\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Anthony Cordesman, probably one of the most respected \nthinkers on this subject, ends a very significant analysis of the \nsituation in Syria and greater Europe with this admonition. He tells \nAmerica: ``We face a moment of facing up to honesty, transparency, and \nrealism.''\n  And he tells us, ``One cannot ignore trees anymore than one can \nignore the forest,'' related to Syria. ``The failure of U.S. policy and \nmilitary efforts, Russian and Iranian support of Assad and major \nRussian military intervention, and the conflicting ways in which other \nstates intervene will all make matters worse. The impact of religious \nwarfare and extremism, and failed Syrian secularism, are even more \nserious problems.\n  ``It is time, however, to stop focusing on either ISIS or Assad, to \npretend that Syrian `moderates' are strong enough to either affect the \nsecurity situation or negotiate for Syria's real fighters, and act as \nif a shattered nation could be united by some top-down negotiation \nbetween groups that hate each other and have no competence in dealing \nwith the economic, social, and governance challenges Syria now faces.\n  ``The first step in solving a problem is to honestly assess it.

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Hartzler) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the \nmajority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Fifty-three years ago is a long time. In 1962, John F. \nKennedy was President. Gas was 28 cents a gallon. The first Walmart \nopened. The U.S. Navy SEALs were created, and the Cuban Missile Crisis \nwas on everyone's minds.\n  Now, we have gone through a lot as a nation since then, but one thing \nhas remained constant: the U.S. Congress and the President of the \nUnited States have fulfilled one of our primary obligations according \nto the Constitution of providing for the common defense by passing a \nNational Defense Authorization Act. You may say that Congress hasn't \nalways passed legislation that is needed, but on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, we have gotten it right. For 53 years in a row now, \nour Nation's national security needs have been taken care of.\n  Sadly, that might not be the case this year. The reason? Not because \nthe Representatives of the people did not do their work. It is because \nthe Commander in Chief has chosen to use the military as political \npawns to advance his domestic agenda by choosing to veto the NDAA.\n  Never before in our Nation's history has a President vetoed the \nNational Defense Authorization Act in order to leverage concessions on \nother areas of government spending. Let me say that again. President \nObama's veto stems not from defense policy but, rather, from his desire \nfor more domestic spending unrelated to national defense. This is \nunprecedented.\n  Four times during the past 53 years, Presidents have vetoed the NDAA, \nbut it was over specific defense-related provisions in the NDAA itself. \nDifferences were able to be worked out with Congress and concerns \nquickly addressed so the bill could move forward and our men and women \nin uniform would have the tools, equipment, and resources they need to \nkeep us safe. Not this year.\n  Just minutes ago, our President vetoed our Nation's most important \nbill, which provides for full funding for our military.\n  Let me share with you what provisions are in this bill and why it is \nso important. It provides: a 1.3 percent pay raise for our troops; \nretirement benefits for the 83 percent of our troops who currently see \nnone; the authority for commanders to allow soldiers to\n\n[[Page H7130]]\n\ncarry guns on base to defend themselves, their colleagues in arms, and \ntheir families; vital resources and new tools to combat cyber attacks \non our critical infrastructure; restrictions on Guantanamo detainee \ntransfers to address the potential illegality of the President's \nprevious unilateral transfers; 12 new F-18 Super Hornets to be built in \nmy home State of Missouri; $300 million of assistance in lethal aid so \nthe people of Ukraine can defend themselves; $330 million in funding \nfor the iron dome missile defense system for Israel; and it directs the \ndeployment of a new advanced ballistic missile defense system to defend \nagainst the threat of an Iranian intercontinental ballistic missile.\n  In short, at home and abroad, the NDAA ensures our military has \nfunding for national defense and overseas operations. These are the \nselfless individuals who we rely upon for our safety and freedom that \nwe are talking about. And in a strongly bipartisan fashion, Congress \nhas authorized that funding at the exact level that the President \nrequested.\n  In this unprecedented move, the Commander in Chief is using the very \ntroops he commands as pawns in a very dangerous political game. It is \nwrong to add to the uncertainty our men and women in uniform face as \nthey stand on the front lines of an increasingly uncertain world.\n  Let us remember, the President recently made a decision to keep \nalmost 10,000 of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in \nAfghanistan. On the heels of such a serious decision, asking them to \nleave their families and lives on hold for another year or more, how \ncould he justify not signing the bill that provides the pay and \nbenefits for our troops?\n  I am thankful for my colleagues who stand with me here today to tell \nyou why this is such a critical piece of legislation and why this veto \ncannot stand. We are here to make sure the men and women who put \nthemselves in harm's way for our freedom are a priority to our Nation \nand not held hostage to political games.\n  With that, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine), \na Navy veteran and currently lieutenant commander in the United States \nNavy Reserve.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Hartzler) for all her hard work on these issues.\n  Just as a point of maybe disagreement, I am no longer in the Navy \nReserve. I joined the Oklahoma National Guard, and I will be flying \nwith the Oklahoma Air National Guard.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for hosting this Special Order, \nand I would like folks to understand really what my friend from \nMissouri just said.\n  The President of the United States vetoed the Defense Authorization \nbecause he wants more spending for other domestic programs. This is \nunprecedented and, quite frankly, it is scary for this country. I am \nstill dumbfounded by it, that you are going to hold defense hostage for \na domestic agenda. We don't do that in the United States of America. \nThis President somehow doesn't understand that you don't take the \ndefense of this country hostage for a domestic agenda, and yet that is \nwhat he has just done.\n  I want to share with my colleagues why we do an authorization every \nyear, because the world changes. Things get more dangerous year after \nyear after year.\n  As a Navy pilot and now as a National Guard pilot, we utilize space. \nI am on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We hear all kinds of things about space.\n  I can tell you, as somebody who has used it, we use space for over-\nthe-horizon communications with our space-based communication \narchitecture. We use it for weather so that we can make sure we can get \nto the target on time. We use it for intelligence. We use it for \nmissile warning. We use it for a whole host of things: the position, \nnavigation, timing, our GPS satellites, for actually hitting our \ntargets.\n  Space is critical, yet something has changed drastically in the last \nfew years. The Russians have been launching various things that were \nnot registered with the International Telecommunication Union, the ITU.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  What are we discovering that these objects are doing? Well, they are \ndoing very sophisticated co-orbital maneuvers, demonstrating that they \ncan do proximity and rendezvous operations, which means--guess what--\nultimately that could be an antisatellite capability.\n  Friends, if we lose our satellites, we could have even more risk. \nImagine your ATM not working. Imagine the food in the grocery store not \nbeing there when you go shopping. National security in this country is \ncritically important, and the President is holding it hostage for a \ndifferent domestic agenda that has absolutely nothing to do with \nnational security. This is absolute craziness.\n  So what did we do in the NDAA? We plussed up spending on space \nprotection, which is critically important; and we not only plussed up \nspending on space protection, but we provided authorities, critically \nnecessary authorities so the Department of Defense can actually protect \nthis country in ways that it hasn't had the opportunity to do so \nbefore.\n  For our communications architecture, we are doing Pathfinder \nprograms, and we are purchasing communications in space in ways that we \nhave never done it before. Why? Because we need to distribute the \narchitecture so it complicates the targeting solution for our enemies. \nWe are not doing this because it is fun or because we like it. We are \ndoing it because it is critical for national security.\n  When the President of the United States vetoes it, it puts all of us \nin jeopardy. I want to be clear. This is about the troops, there is no \ndoubt about that, but when we are talking about somebody's ATM working, \nthis is about the security of the United States of America, and the \nPresident is holding it hostage for a domestic agenda.\n  When it comes to the troops, just a few items. We talk about the \nauthorities in the NDAA. Well, those of us who have served understand \nthat there are special pays that we receive: combat pay, hazardous duty \npay, bonuses for reenlistments, flight pay for those of us who fly. \nThere are pays that are going to be in jeopardy now that otherwise \nwouldn't be in jeopardy.\n  By the way, a lot of these pays are for people who are right now \nserving this country overseas. Do we not understand that, Mr. \nPresident? I should say, Mr. Speaker, the President should understand \nthat.\n  This is a momentous day in American history and not for good \nreasons--for tragic reasons.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Missouri for hosting this \nSpecial Order and giving somebody like me and all these colleagues \nbehind me the opportunity to make sure that America understands what is \nat stake here. The gentlewoman's leadership on these issues is \ncritical, and America is in jeopardy.\n  We need to understand what happened today is not the norm. It must \nnot be the norm, and future Presidents must never hold hostage American \nnational security for a domestic agenda.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Bridenstine for \nhis service to our Nation and his firsthand perspective on how vital \nthis is and what a tragic day it is for our Nation that our Commander \nin Chief would do this.\n  Now I would like to turn to another friend and hero to our Nation in \nmany ways, who served both in the Army and the Marine Corps, the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman).\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri, \nVicky Hartzler, for her leadership on the Armed Services Committee and \non this critical issue.\n  I rise today in strong support of the National Defense Authorization \nAct, and I urge my colleagues to override President Obama's veto. This \nbipartisan bill provides essential pay and benefits to the men and \nwomen serving in our military today. Expanded retirement options for \nour troops, greater protections against sexual assault in the military, \nand increased cybersecurity defense funding are among some of the most \nimportant authorizations included in the NDAA.\n  For the Sixth Congressional District of Colorado, the NDAA also \ncontains provisions and language that help\n\n[[Page H7131]]\n\nBuckley Air Force Base. Buckley not only plays a critical role in our \nNation's defense, but it is the largest employer in my district.\n  Finally, the NDAA also includes language to prevent the transfer of \nGTMO detainees to U.S. soil. Last week, a delegation from the \nadministration surveyed potential locations for GTMO detainees in \nColorado. Along with most Coloradans, I remain adamantly opposed to \nthis move and strongly support the language in the NDAA. There is \nabsolutely no reason to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp only to \nfinance the incarceration of enemy combatants in the United States.\n  This legislation is too important to our Nation and to Colorado to \nbecome the subject of political games by the White House. Once again, \nthis bill must become law, and I urge my colleagues in the House to \noverride the President's veto.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Coffman made several excellent \npoints, not only about the importance to Colorado, but certainly to our \nNation. He raised a very important point that hasn't been brought up \nyet: how it prevents the transfer of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay \nfrom coming to our soil; and that is what the administration wants to \ndo is to put them in our backyards and our prisons, and we do not \nsupport that, and this NDAA prevents that.\n  Now I would like to turn to another friend and colleague from the \nArmed Services Committee, Mr. Wilson. He is quite a hero to this Nation \nin many ways, but certainly having four sons who have served in the \nmilitary is one of his major contributions. We are so proud of him and \nhis family and his service.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler \nfor her leadership for military families, and I thank her for \nreferencing my four sons. Of course, I want to give all credit to my \nwife, Roxanne. She did a great job raising four sons who truly know how \nimportant it is to serve our country.\n  Sadly, President Obama has vetoed this year's National Defense \nAuthorization Act, even though it allocates the same amount of funding \nas the Department of Defense request that he made himself. The \nPresident does not support the bipartisan NDAA because it utilizes \nwartime funds. Despite utilizing these funds himself, the President \naccepted this fabrication to veto the NDAA and put servicemembers, \nmilitary families, and veterans at risk.\n  On October 3, The Washington Post editorialized: ``Refusing to sign \nthis bill would make history, but not in a good way. Mr. Obama should \nlet it become law.''\n  I believe the veto underscores the President's legacy of weakness. \nThis is leading to instability. It is leading to aggression, mass \nmurders, and it is leading to citizens fleeing the violence causing \nchildren to drown at sea.\n  This year's NDAA provides for servicemembers and equips our troops to \nfight serious threats to American families, like the murderous Islamic \nState. It supports our allies, like Ukraine and Israel, to defend \nthemselves from aggression. The NDAA establishes meaningful reforms to \nthe Department of Defense acquisition process and creates commonsense \nimprovements to the military retirement system. It fully staffs and \nresources Cyber Command, which I appreciate as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, to protect American \nfamilies.\n\n  American families deserve peace through strength. The National \nDefense Authorization Act gives our military critical resources to \ndefend us as we constantly face new threats. It is sad for the \nPresident to weaken these reforms and funds and put American families \nat risk.\n  Fellow Members, I strongly urge you to override the President's veto. \nAs the appreciative son of a World War II Flying Tigers veteran, as a \n31-year veteran of the Army myself, and as the grateful father of four \nsons serving in the military, I know firsthand that your bipartisan \nvote will help protect and better serve our troops, military families, \nveterans, and all American families by promoting and ensuring peace \nthrough strength.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I really appreciate the gentleman's service to this \nNation as a 31-year veteran; but also serving as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, he has a unique \nperspective on the inherent dangers facing our Nation now that our \nPresident has vetoed this important bill. I thank him for sharing his \ninsights.\n  Now I will yield to another member of the Armed Services Committee, \nbut more than that, he is a decorated Navy SEAL, and I look forward to \nhearing his thoughts on this very important moment in our Nation's \nhistory. I turn to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the President's \nveto and ask my colleagues to override it. I come before this body not \nonly as a Representative of the great State of Montana, but also a \nformer commander of SEAL Team Six and a former deputy- and acting \ncommander of Naval Special Warfare's efforts in the Persian Gulf.\n  The job of the Commander in Chief is bound by the Constitution to \nsupport the troops, to be the leader, and yet this President vetoes a \nbipartisan bill to defend our country.\n  I talk not only as a former commander, but also a father. My daughter \nis a Navy diver, and my son-in-law is an Active-Duty Navy SEAL. My wife \nwatched her daughter, her husband, and her son-in-law all deploy.\n  I have seen the consequences of war. I am probably the last \nindividual that would advocate for war. I have seen the consequences \nand the pain. But when we go to war, the Commander in Chief is \nobligated to make sure we go to war to win. He has to make sure that \nour troops have the right training, the right equipment, the right \nleadership to win decisively on the field of battle. Before this \nCommander in Chief sends them into harm's way, it is his obligation and \nduty to make sure that we know the conditions to bring them home.\n  His actions today are a dereliction of his duty. It affects every \nsoldier, sailor, airman, and marine in harm's way. A veto and the \nsubsequent continuing resolution causes harm to our troops. I call it \ngarrisoning, where our troops don't train, our fleet can't go in and \nreceive the maintenance necessary. Above all, it gives a message to the \ntroops that are in harm's way that their Commander in Chief does not \nhave their back.\n  This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue. This is an American \nissue, because it is America's sons and daughters that we put in harm's \nway. It is the obligation of a great nation to make sure when we do \nthat we give them everything they need to come home safely.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I don't know of a more articulate way to \nsay how important and imperative it is that we override this veto. I \nthank Mr. Zinke for sharing his very real and heartfelt and expert \nthoughts on this issue.\n  Now I have a friend who is going to share who is passionate about \nlots of things and competent on many issues, but I tell you, serving on \nArmed Services Committee with the gentlewoman from Indiana, Jackie \nWalorski, I can tell you her main passion is for the men and women in \nuniform, for our national defense.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman and \nmy friend from Missouri, Vicky Hartzler.\n  The NDAA, as we have heard tonight, is the largest single \nauthorization bill that Congress considers and one of this body's most \nsignificant pieces of legislation and accomplishments this year. This \nlegislation is critical to our national security. It continues to fund \nthe entire national defense of this country.\n  For 54 years, Republicans and Democrats in both Houses in this body \nhave come together to pass this defense bill. This year was no \ndifferent. This Congress sent a bipartisan bill to President Obama. \nToday, though, the President vetoed this defense budget in order to \ngain leverage for additional increased spending, his demands of \nspending, a process of a budgetary procedure that is completely \nunrelated to this bill.\n  This defense bill helps our men and women in uniform by adjusting pay \nand retirement benefits. It removes barriers that prevent access to \nurgent\n\n[[Page H7132]]\n\nmedical care for members of the armed services while also expanding \nemployment opportunities for those exiting the service. It helps us \nretain our most experienced servicemembers. It makes those individuals \nsafer by enhancing and improving military training and modernizing our \nresources and programs.\n  Lastly, this bill provides very real authorities, such as the ability \nto protect Americans by keeping terrorists secured in the detention \nfacility known as GTMO, or Guantanamo Bay. For 54 years, this defense \nbill has transited party lines and Washington dysfunction. As a \ncandidate, President Obama promised to do the same. But with this veto, \nhe has threatened to end this staple of bipartisanship in this Chamber.\n  Our servicemen and -women put their lives on the line every day. The \nleast we can do is offer them the security of knowing that they can \nprovide for their families and plan for their own futures.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I thank the gentlewoman. I appreciate that.\n  Next we have another member of the Armed Services Committee, who is a \ndecorated Army commander, who led soldiers in Iraq, and whose unit was \nresponsible for finding Saddam Hussein, to share his thoughts on this \nday when the President has vetoed the NDAA and why it is so important \nthat we override this veto.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell).\n  Mr. RUSSELL. I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for all of her \nhard work on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I served my country 21 years in the Infantry in the \nUnited States Army and have deployed operationally to Kosovo, Kuwait, \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  As a combat Infantry veteran, I know firsthand the hardships and \ndangers that our warriors face. The question that we have to ask is: \nWhy has the President increased the hardship and danger to our troops? \nHas he forgotten that we have troops in the field that are still \nfighting?\n  Has he forgotten that he has committed to contingency operations that \ncreated new hardships, new deployments, unscheduled training, \nunscheduled maintenance? And now, after asking them to turn everything \non their heads, he is not even going to support it.\n  A Presidential veto blocks needed funds for our ongoing combat \noperations and for our emergency operations and contingencies.\n  The President claims that we need to do this right; yet, he has \ncreated the foreign policy mess that has required our troops to deploy \non contingencies and then has asked this body to get additional \nCongressional authorization for those efforts. And now he adds to their \nburden.\n  The veto eliminates crucial planning time just for normal peacetime \noperations in training from 3 to 6 months, forcing the military to \nwaste millions of dollars as they play a catch-up game, usually in the \nspring, by having to deal with such efforts to try to make up for lost \ntime.\n  The veto reduces certainty in our overall national security posture. \nThe veto also blocks a revised retirement program benefiting 83 percent \nof our warriors that are not currently covered, and it denies expanded \naccess to health care and blocks access to needed drugs.\n  It continues to leave our warriors defenseless at recruiting \nstations, camps, posts, and bases by denying their ability to carry \nfirearms in their defense against terror threats.\n  The veto also blocks a mediocre pay raise that the President himself \nalready reduced by 1 percent, and now they will not even get that \npathetic 1 percent pay raise, 1.3 percent.\n  Mr. Speaker, a Presidential veto makes one thing crystal clear: \nNothing is too good for our troops and nothing is what he is going to \ngive them. That is why we will fight to overturn this veto, so that he \ncan hear the people of the United States and our constitutional \nrequirement to defend this republic.\n  We will overturn this veto, and we ask, Mr. Speaker, that the Nation \njoin us in this fight.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I couldn't agree more with the gentleman. Thank you \nfor your leadership, service to our country, and your call for the \nAmerican people to join us and come alongside us as we fight for the \ndefense of our Nation and for the men and women in uniform.\n  The thing that I feel is so important tonight is that the American \npeople and everyone here in the House has had an opportunity to hear \nfrom people who not only care about their Nation, who are today's \npatriots, but many of them who have either served themselves on the \nfront line and who have experienced danger and put themselves in harm's \nway because of it or they have family members that they are supporting \nin that line of duty.\n  Our next speaker I want to turn to is certainly one of those, not \nonly a colleague on the Armed Services Committee, but a father who has \nthree sons who are serving in the military, and he knows firsthand the \ndangers, the sacrifice, and how important this NDAA is to our Nation.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Nugent).\n  Mr. NUGENT. Congresswoman Hartzler, I really appreciate you taking \nthe time to do this today on the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an outrage that the President would veto, as the \nCommander in Chief of our military in general.\n  Think about this. I have three sons that have served in the military, \nthat currently serve in United States Army, that have served in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, that have done trips to Haiti to help during \nreconstruction as it related to an earthquake.\n  The President of the United States has made them political pawns.\n  One of the things that my wife and I felt when they were deployed to \nIraq or Afghanistan was that they were the best equipped, best led, \nbest trained troops on the face of the earth. By vetoing the National \nDefense Authorization Act, we are putting a dagger in the heart of what \nwe are supposed to be holding up.\n  The Constitution of the United States says that this Congress has the \nobligation to stand up an Army, to stand up a Navy, to support the \nPresident of the United States and the actions that we must take to \nprotect this Nation.\n  The actions today are strictly a political action when you do a press \nconference to hold up the fact that he vetoed the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  You have heard so many members here today talk about the things that \nthis act did or does. And so I call upon all of our friends across the \naisle. Democrats, unite with us to overturn this veto because we live \nin the most dangerous of times.\n  Go back in time. I can't think of a time--I don't know if you can--\nwhere it has been more dangerous in regards to a resurgent Russia, to \nChina, to Iran, to North Korea, to all of the non-state actors out \nthere that are threatening this Nation and our friends and allies \naround the world.\n  This is not the time to play political brinksmanship with our \nmilitary. This is a time to hold them up, lift them up, and let them do \ntheir job and know that their Commander in Chief has their back.\n  I truly do appreciate, Mrs. Hartzler, your doing this.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Thank you, Mr. Nugent. I just thought it was so \nimportant that you shared, as a parent. I have heard you say this \nbefore in committee, that, as a parent, it is vital for you and your \nwife to know that you are sending the best equipped, best trained force \npossible over into harm's way so, when you send your sons, you know \nthat they are going to be able to come back safe.\n  Mr. NUGENT. People forget that there is actually flesh and blood, \nparents and children, of those young men and women that are serving \nthis country. They forget there are real people in those uniforms. And \nso that is why this is so important.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Absolutely. And what message is that sending to them \nright now? Thank you.\n  Now I would like to turn to Representative Doug Lamborn, my friend \nfrom Colorado, who has the privilege and does such a great job \nrepresenting\n\n[[Page H7133]]\n\none of the most military-intense districts in the country. I had the \nopportunity to visit the Air Force Academy around Memorial Day. I \nappreciate your leadership on this issue.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) for whatever he \nwould like to share.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for her \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's veto from the President breaks dangerous new \nground for callous disregard for the needs of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  While he worked so hard to make sure that the Iranian military had \nthe funding they needed via his disastrous nuclear deal, today he chose \nto willfully disregard the needs of our own military to make a \npolitical point with his veto.\n  The Presidency has sunk to a new low today. For the first time in \nhistory, an American President has vetoed a defense bill because of \nissues that the bill itself cannot possibly address.\n  Most of us here in Congress agree that defending our Nation is the \nfirst and most important priority, a sacred constitutional duty we have \nto protect the American people and to keep us safe in an increasingly \ndangerous world.\n  Tragically, President Obama is willing to hold defense hostage to try \nto get more money for agencies like the IRS and the EPA, all of this \nwhile we remain at war with extremist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS \nthat want to attack America, all of this while we still are having \ntroops killed overseas, including some from Colorado.\n  This is pretty simple, really. This administration wants to cut our \nmilitary and increase spending almost everywhere else. Our troops have \nalready endured massive cuts similar in size to the Clinton drawdown in \nthe nineties, although this time global threats are rising, not \nfalling.\n  On top of all this, the President wants to send Guantanamo detainees \nto U.S. soil, including to my own district in Colorado, and is also \nissuing his veto for this reason.\n  Look, terrorists will find a reason to hate us no matter what happens \nin Guantanamo.\n  I ask my colleagues: Are we willing to let this happen on our watch?\n  To my fellow Republicans who are rightly concerned about out-of-\ncontrol Federal spending and an out-of-control Federal debt, please \nhear me when I say we are working on real reform and real \naccountability for the large defense budget.\n  But please also hear me when I say that defense is simply not the \ndriver of our debt, especially over the long term. Defense spending \nensures and protects our way of life.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to do the right thing for our military \nand the right thing for America: override President Obama's reckless \nand truly dangerous veto.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I thank the gentleman so much because he raises a very \ngood point as far as spending goes in that this bill, the NDAA, \nprovides the exact amount of funding for our defense that the President \nrequested.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Down to the penny.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. We worked hard to come up with that, but we made sure \nthat our troops had the funding they need. And, yet, as the Commander \nin Chief, he requested $612 billion. We gave him $612 billion in this \nbill, and then he vetoes it.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. It makes no sense. It is dangerous, and he is doing it \nfor political reasons that can't be solved in this bill.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. You are exactly right. Thank you for your comments.\n  Now I have a gentleman from Georgia that I have been privileged to be \nelected with in 2010 and serve alongside in both Agriculture Committee \nand Armed Services. I believe he is one of the most hardworking members \non Armed Services.\n  If you are his constituent, I want you to know he is at every \nhearing. He does his homework. And I appreciate him coming out tonight \nto share his thoughts on the NDAA.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. I want to thank you, Mrs. Hartzler, for \nwhat you have done here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss what \nhas happened here today. As we talked earlier today, I honestly thought \nthere was a chance that we wouldn't be here speaking about this. I \nthought that maybe this one time our Commander in Chief would do what \nwas right.\n  I hope you will take an opportunity to look at the news. I am looking \nat it right now.\n  Obama to hold photo op to veto defense bill. Obama plans to hold a \nphoto op in the Oval Office when he uses his veto pen on the National \nDefense Authorization Act, according to his public schedule.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, when I am around the District, I hear a lot of \ncomplaints: Why can't Congress just work together? Why can't you get \nalong?\n  The National Defense Authorization Act came out of the Armed Services \nCommittee 60-2, 60-2. There was one Democrat and one Republican that \nvoted against the bill; 60-2.\n  It came through the House. A significant majority voted for the \nNational Defense Authorization bill on the floor. It passed out of the \nSenate with over 70 votes.\n  When I am talking to Americans, I have used this as an example of how \nnot everything you see in the press is true, that there are issues like \nnational security that the Democrats and the Republicans in Washington, \nD.C., absolutely take very seriously, and when it comes to the well-\nbeing of our men and women that serve the country and their families \nand making sure that they have the training and the equipment that they \nneed, that this is an example of how we are able to put partisanship \naside and work in the best interest of everybody in the country, most \nespecially those that serve so honorably.\n  And the President held a photo op to veto the bill.\n  I want to thank my fellow colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, \nfor their work on this bill. Certainly I supported it. I continue to \nsupport it.\n  I think one of the things that continues to be mentioned and needs to \nbe mentioned over and over and over again is the President got the \ntotal of what he asked for with regard to the authorization of the \nfunds for carrying out the fight against ISIL, for the operations of \nthe military.\n  There were a couple of things in it that he didn't like. One the them \nwas the transfer of terrorists out of Guantanamo Bay.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Now, I would just ask that you think about the fact that, since the \nfirst NDAA 50 years ago, it has only been vetoed four times. In each \ninstance, there was an agreement effectively prior to the veto on how \nto resolve it.\n  But not this guy, not this guy. He holds a photo op. He holds a photo \nop so that he can show off while he vetoes the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I just hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \njoin us as we work to override the President's veto in the House. I \nhonestly believe that we will get the votes in the House to do that.\n  I hope that the Members of the Senate who voted for the National \nDefense Authorization Act will vote for it again when they have the \nopportunity to do so after we send the bill over there, after we have \noverridden the President's veto with this piece of legislation in the \nHouse.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologize. If the President \nwon't do it, I want to do it. What happened today I think will long be \nlooked upon as one of the worst moments of American leadership.\n  With that, Mrs. Hartzler, I thank you again for what you have done \nfor the men and women who serve and your service in this House.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I thank the gentleman.\n  I think it is so important to remember that national defense is not a \npartisan issue. It is a constitutional duty. It is a constitutional \nprivilege that we have, as elected officials in this country, to \nprovide for the common defense.\n  The bill did pass overwhelmingly with bipartisan support in the \nHouse, in the committee, and over in the Senate. I am hopeful as well \nthat we will\n\n[[Page H7134]]\n\nbe able to continue to join together to override this veto.\n  My friend from Georgia also made the comment and the sad news about \nthe photo op that the President did today as he vetoed this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I wonder, where is the photo op with the soldiers right now fighting \nin Afghanistan and some of them, sadly, who have died lately? Where is \nthe recognition for them? Where is the photo op with the sorties that \nare being flown and our pilots that are going into harm's way to take \non ISIS right now? Where is the photo op with all the military families \nthat are sacrificing?\n  It is truly shameful, I think, that this occurred. I stand alongside \nwith those who are fighting for the people of this country to keep them \nsafe.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gibson), \nanother friend who is a champion of this, who is a decorated Army \ncommander, proudly serves on the Armed Services Committee and does a \nwonderful job.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Thank you. I really want to express my gratitude to the \ngentlewoman. I thank her for leading tonight, putting this together.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues that came out tonight to share \ntheir views and share their experiences.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a very critical topic we are talking about here \ntoday. The first function of government is to protect its people.\n  Mr. Speaker, every single one of our service chiefs are on record, \nunder oath in sworn testimony, saying that, if they do not get the \nadditional resources that are provided in parts of this bill, that they \nwill not be able to execute the national security strategy, that it \nwill break our military.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is at a time that we have Russian tanks in Syria. \nWe have got a significant challenge from the Islamic State. We have got \nmajor issues with Iran. We are dealing with a very aggressive Putin in \nEastern Europe. We have got a quixotic leader in North Korea and an \nambiguous situation in China.\n  Now is not the time to be taking a knee on our national security \nstrategy. Now is not the time to be breaking our military.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure it is clear just how partisan the \nPresident's actions are. The American people need to know just how \npartisan this action is.\n  This process, our national security policy bill, is collaborative.\n  In our committee, in the House Armed Services Committee, we hold \nhearings. It is fully collaborative. Both sides--Republicans and \nDemocrats--get to come together, work on the issues, bring forward the \nquestions, collaborate in that whole process of the hearing.\n  Then we have a markup. We have a markup at the committee level. This \nmarkup lasts for, in some cases, over 12 hours. Every single person in \nthat committee, regardless of party, is able to bring forward their \nideas, to speak for their people, to offer their amendments, to have \ndebate, and to have a vote on those amendments.\n  As the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) mentioned, at the \nculmination of that process in the House Armed Services Committee, the \nvote in our committee was 60-2, a strong vote, a bipartisan vote. The \nrepresentatives of the people of the United States voted to support our \nservicemen and -women and their families.\n  The vote that was taken here on the floor of the House was a strong, \nbipartisan vote. Our colleagues over in the Senate, as was mentioned--\nthe vote on the conference was 70-27. Three individuals who are running \nfor President of the United States who were not present expressed \nsupport for it. Seventy-three votes, almost three-quarters of the \nUnited States Senate, represented the will of those respective States \nthat they were here to represent. It was a strong, bipartisan vote.\n  We have a supermajority supporting this bill for our servicemen and -\nwomen and their families.\n  The President of the United States, despite all that, vetoed this \nbill when it is so clear that every single one of our service chiefs \nhave said that they need these additional resources or we will not be \nable to execute the national security strategy.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is also very personal for me. I enlisted at the age \nof 17 as a private in the Infantry back in 1981. In my early years in \nthe military, I was part of an effort to try to increase the readiness \nof our Armed Forces, and I saw those efforts working. I saw us \ncontinuing to build capability throughout the eighties and standing on \nthe principle of peace through strength.\n  We won the cold war without a major conflict. We put ourselves in the \nposition, when we had conflict in 1990 in the Persian Gulf war, that we \nhad a military with overmatch so that we were able to prevail in that \nconflict with as few casualties as was possible.\n  Mr. Speaker, over time, in the 29 years that I served in the \nmilitary, the other important facet of peace through strength is it \nforged trust with those who were willing to come forward and defend \nthis Nation, trust that their leaders here in Washington, D.C.--\nregardless of party--would always have their back, would ensure the \nresources necessary so that they could be fully equipped and trained, \nwould be there for them, that their pay and benefits would always be \nthere for them, and that, when they deployed forward, that the programs \nwould be there to support their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, that trust was really called into question today by our \nPresident, who, in a very partisan manner, vetoed an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan piece of legislation. I can't even begin to tell you how \ndisappointed I am.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will fight this. We are working now with our \ncolleagues. We feel like we are in a strong position in the Senate to \noverride this. We have more work to do here in the United States House. \nThat work is ongoing. We need to enact this bill.\n  Let me just end where I began and thank the gentlewoman for her \nleadership. I thank her for coming forward today to organize this, to \nreally inspire us to come together to express so that the American \npeople can know what happened today and how their representatives, in a \nbipartisan way, will rise to this challenge and make sure that we get \nthis important national security policy bill into law.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I thank the gentleman for his service and for sharing \nhow important it is, how vital it is, that we override this veto and do \nwhat is right for our troops and for America.\n  The last speaker is the newly elected gentleman from California who I \nhave really enjoyed getting to know and is a privilege to serve with on \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight).\n  Mr. KNIGHT. I thank Congresswoman Hartzler for her leadership in this \nrole. This is of vital importance.\n  I want to start this discussion with just a little bit of reference. \nWhen I got elected 9 months ago, everyone said: You have to go to \nCongress. You have to get some things done. You have to work across the \naisle. You have to build some friendships. You have to do these things.\n  I think in the one committee that I sit on, Armed Services, we do \nthat. We talk about the military. We talk about what is best for it, \nwhat is best for America, what is best for the readiness, and what are \nthe programs and the projects and the arms and the things that we are \ngoing to do to make sure that our men and women are the best prepared \nto go into battle, if called upon.\n  But today I think we saw a little bit of politics, and maybe we have \nseen that for the last week or more. But political football shouldn't \nhappen around the military. We should be able to hammer these things \nout.\n  As you heard from some of the speakers before, this has been vetoed \nfour times, and every time it has been basically an issue that has then \nbeen worked out. We have come back, we have taken care of that issue, \nand it has gone forward.\n  So for 53 years, the NDAA has worked like it is supposed to: put the \nmilitary first, put America first, and move forward through the \ndisagreements.\n  But as you have heard--and we heard this in the discussion with part \nof the NDAA--that this was going to be vetoed. The President was \nforecasting maybe he would veto this.\n  Well, this wasn't a secret operation we were doing. The NDAA was out \nin the open. I don't know of a chairman\n\n[[Page H7135]]\n\nthat is better than the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services at \nworking across the aisle, working with the issues, and trying to get \neverything done before we get to a problem like this, including working \nwith the White House. That is exactly what happened.\n  But I would disagree with some of the speakers that came before me \nwhen they said that the President came out and he brought his pen and \nhe did a photo op. This was forecasted that it was going to be done \ntoday, today.\n  Is there something that is happening today that is going to take up \nall the news, that is going to be in all of the papers tomorrow, that \nis going to be on Twitter? That is right. The Benghazi hearing is \nhappening right now, and it has been happening for hours.\n  During this veto, the Benghazi hearing was happening. I just went on \nTwitter. There are 200 times more Twitter feeds on Benghazi than the \nNDAA veto.\n  In politics, we would call that cover. We would call that: You know \nwhat? I have to do something bad; so, I had better do it when they are \nnot looking at me. That is exactly what happened today.\n  Let's talk about the NDAA a little bit. Yes, we have had some \ndisagreements, and we have figured them out: 60-2 in the House. How do \nyou get something done when you get such a bipartisan vote? Well, you \nsit there for 20 hours and you work through a chairman and you get the \nissues worked out.\n  $612 billion was asked for. $612 billion was given. A 1.3 percent pay \nraise from the President's budget, a 1.3 percent pay raise to our \nmilitary, that was done.\n  In July, we lost four Marines to a tragic incident in Tennessee. When \nI went home, many people said: What are you going to do about this? Can \nyou change something? Shouldn't they be armed? Shouldn't something \nhappen?\n  That is in the NDAA. Now we give post commanders the appropriate \nability to arm our recruiting and our reserve centers.\n  But let's go a little further. This allows our friends and enemies to \nknow what is happening in America. Now, today they say: Is something \nhappening in America that is weak? Because for 53 years, it has been \nthe military first, America first. We are going to be strong. And today \nI have got to believe that our friends and enemies might be scratching \ntheir head and saying: What is happening in America?\n  That is not something we ever want. We want our friends to know that \nwe are going to be shoulder to shoulder with them, and we want our \nenemies to know that we are as strong as we possibly can be.\n  I am going to finish thanking the gentlewoman from Missouri. We have \na kindredship. In my district, we tested and built every B-2. In her \ndistrict, she houses the B-2 Spirit that sends them off to do difficult \ndeals, difficult sorties. I am very proud of what the B-2 does, just as \nI am proud of every man and woman in the military and every mission \nthat they complete.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. Speaker, if we are going to stand with the military, then let's \nstand with the military. If we are going to turn our back and say that \nthis is not what we believe, then that is not what I want to be part \nof. I think we should work as hard as we possibly can to override this \nveto. That is the mission. That is the vision.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Thank you, gentleman. I share that vision and look \nforward to working alongside you to do the right thing for the American \npeople.\n  I think you brought up many good points, but certainly the situation \nnow under this Commander in Chief is that we have a situation where our \nallies don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. This action today \ncan't help but contribute further to that thinking. We have got to \nreverse this. America is strong when it is safe, and it is safe because \nit is strong.\n  We have heard this evening, Mr. Speaker, from many people who are \nexperts on this issue. Not only do they care about it passionately, but \nthey themselves have put on the uniform and made the sacrifices. They \nhave left families to serve their country, and they know what it is \nlike, what our troops are facing and what potential dangers we can be \nin by jeopardizing their security by not providing for them and passing \na National Defense Authorization Act. We have heard from other \ncolleagues here who are parents and who have children who have answered \nthe call and signed up to serve their country and gone into harm's way, \nsome of them who are there right now.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have heard how distressing it is for our troops to \nhear today--no matter where they are, whether they are in Afghanistan, \nIraq, whether they are in the Pacific or they are in the jungles of \nAfrica, or whether they are advising as we look and see what is going \non with Ukraine and the President, and whether they are monitoring \nintelligence around the world, cyber threats and cyber attacks--when \nthey turn on their TV tonight, to find out that their Commander in \nChief has vetoed the bill that would provide for the resources that \nthey need to carry out their mission, to find out that it is not done \nbecause of some specific provisions in the bill, unlike a few times in \nthe past 53 years where we have passed this, but because the President \nwants to advance a domestic agenda that has nothing to do with \nproviding for our common defense. It is wrong and it is disheartening.\n  Just a reminder of the things in this bill, the reasons it is so \nimportant. It provides: $612 billion for our national defense, the \nexact amount of money that the President requested; a pay raise for our \nhardworking troops; retirement benefits for those that don't have it \nnow; the authority of commanders, like Representative Knight shared, to \nbe able to make a policy to allow the soldiers on their installation to \nbe able to defend themselves and carry guns so hopefully we won't see \nthe senseless tragedy again; to restrict allowing Guantanamo Bay \ndetainees--terrorists, basically--to be brought here to America and put \ninto our jails in our backyard; and to support our allies, whether it \nbe the Iron Dome for Israel that has been so helpful in saving \ncountless thousands of lives in Israel in the last few years, but also \nto provide funding for those fighting for freedom in Ukraine, allowing \nthem to protect themselves.\n  Other speakers talked about space protections, protections against \nsexual assault in the military, preventing the transfers, supports our \nallies, some of the things I have said, acquisition reform. We did \neverything we could in this bill to help make the Pentagon more \nefficient and more effective to save money, and we will continue to do \nthat.\n  We also heard about the dangers and how, with the President's veto, \nit is going to eliminate critical training time, and parents are going \nto be able to question whether their child is going to be safe when \nthey send them to war.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can't allow this veto to stand. If the Commander in \nChief is going to forsake his most fundamental duties, then the people \nof the House, the representatives of the people of America, will and \nare going to do everything possible to override this veto and to make \nsure that those in harm's way have what they need, that we don't \njeopardize our national defense, and that we continue to have our \npriorities right as a nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to come on the House floor \ntonight and to share about this very, very important issue and this \nvery historic day, and to also lay the groundwork for November 5, when \nwe will vote for an override of this veto. I ask all my colleagues to \nsupport that, and I look forward to a positive vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded not to engage in \npersonalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/house-section/article/H7135-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7135-H7136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2015.\n     Hon.
