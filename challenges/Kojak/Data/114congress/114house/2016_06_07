The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the House will vote this \nweek on a resolution of disapproval on a carbon tax, a new tax that \nwould greatly hurt my State of West Virginia.\n  West Virginia is the second largest producer of coal in the United \nStates. The coal mined in West Virginia made this country what it is \ntoday. It made the steel that built skyscrapers and the ships that won \nworld wars.\n  If a carbon tax would be imposed, all of this would change. According \nto the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a carbon tax would hurt \nour economy. It would raise prices and diminish people's purchasing \npower. It would reduce the number of hours people worked, resulting in \nlost wages. It would also disproportionately hurt low-income families \nand raise energy prices for seniors and families.\n  West Virginia already has one of the highest unemployment rates in \nthe Nation. What we need are policies that create more jobs, encourage \ncompanies to expand and hire, diversify our economy, and reinvest in \nour people.\n  Our coal miners and our coalfields have suffered enough. They can't \nafford a tax on the very energy West Virginia produces.\n  The message is clear: West Virginia needs more jobs and reinvestment, \nnot a carbon tax.\n\n\n                 Implementation of New Ozone Standards\n\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the EPA is at it again. It \nis writing yet another rule that will hurt our economy and could make \nit harder for us to build new roads and create jobs.\n  In this economy, when West Virginia has one of the highest \nunemployment rates in the Nation, the last thing we need is more red \ntape. We don't need more bureaucrats getting in the way of our State's \nability to develop our resources.\n  The new ozone standards the EPA wants to impose on States would hurt \nmanufacturing, drilling, mining, and agricultural operations, hurting \nthe families who depend on these jobs.\n  The EPA is ratcheting up its ozone standard on States. Most States \nand counties haven't even met the 2008 ozone standard, and now the bar \nis being raised again. This is unrealistic.\n  Counties not in compliance with the new standard could find it even \nharder to attract and build new developments. In southern West \nVirginia, that means we might not be able to redevelop our former mine \nsites to their full potential. It could even halt the much-needed Hobet \nmine redevelopment.\n  Noncompliant counties also might not be able to build new highways. \nFor southern West Virginia, that could mean long planned highway \nprojects are put on the back burner again.\n  This week, we will vote in the House on a bill to put the brakes on \nthe EPA's latest actions. We will give the States time to catch up \nbefore the EPA tries to impose yet another standard. We will protect \npublic health while ensuring implementation of new ozone standards that \ndon't cripple our economy.\n  This is a commonsense bill that deserves bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3465-5", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3465-H3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING ANITA DATAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Lowey) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor an extraordinary public \nservant, Anita Datar, who was tragically killed late last year during \nthe despicable terrorist attack at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako, \nMali.\n  Anita, only 41 years old, was senior director for field programs for \nthe international development firm, Palladium. She went to Mali on a \nUSAID-supported research project focused on women's reproductive \nhealth.\n  Raised in New Jersey, Anita devoted her entire career to \ninternational public health and development. She started as a Peace \nCorps volunteer in Senegal, and then continued to travel throughout \nsub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, helping \nvulnerable communities escape poverty and disease.\n  Anita founded a nonprofit organization that connects low-income women \nin developing countries to quality\n\n[[Page H3466]]\n\nhealth services. She was especially committed to expanding access to \nfamily planning services and treating and preventing HIV.\n  Anita's son, Rohan, is in the gallery today with his father, David. \nThey will join Anita's friends and colleagues at a reception this \nevening at the U.S. Institute of Peace to remember Anita and celebrate \nthe mark her work left on so many.\n  Rohan recently moved to my home district in New York. Rohan, we are \nproud and honored to have you in our community. Your mom made the world \na better place through her passion, spirit, and dedication to helping \nothers. Her selfless commitment to service is one of the many indelible \nlegacies Anita bestowed on Rohan and all those who had the honor of \nknowing her.\n  I would also note that the Senate passed, on February 1, 2016, a \nbipartisan resolution, S. Res. 347, honoring the memory and legacy of \nAnita Ashok Datar; condemning the terrorist attack in Bamako, Mali, on \nNovember 20, 2015; and extending heartfelt condolences and prayers to \nthe family, friends, and colleagues of Anita Ashok Datar, particularly \nher son, Rohan; and the individuals touched by the life of Anita Ashok \nDatar or affected by her death, including the dedicated development \nprofessionals and volunteers that continue to selflessly engage in \ncritical humanitarian and development efforts.\n  The text of S. Res. 347 can be found on pages S134-S135 of the \nCongressional Record, dated Wednesday, January 20, 2016.\n  We will continue to be inspired by Anita's dedication to helping \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3466-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the life of \nSt. Cloud native Wheelock Whitney. Mr. Whitney devoted his life to the \nState of Minnesota and to our community.\n  Wheelock Whitney was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and joined the \nNavy following high school. After serving his country, he attended Yale \nUniversity and went on to become the successful CEO of J.M. Dain & \nCompany until he retired in 1972.\n  Wheelock's passions, however, expanded far past business. He served \nas the mayor of Wayzata, Minnesota, and ran for the U.S. Senate in \n1964. He also ran for Governor of the State of Minnesota in 1982. \nWheelock was active in politics throughout his long life. He was also a \nbaseball enthusiast and was instrumental in bringing our beloved Twins \nto Minnesota.\n  While Wheelock will, undoubtedly, be remembered for his successful \ncareer and many endeavors, many of us will remember him for his \ncharity. Among his many charitable efforts, Wheelock served as the \nchairman of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, and \nhe cofounded the Johnson Institute, which helps fight addiction.\n  Wheelock Whitney was a man with a great heart. He lived to help \nothers and strived to make Minnesota a wonderful place to live, and we \nwill all miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3466-7", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE FAILURE OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans in Congress have failed to pass \na budget or to adequately address the health crises that we have \nbrewing in this country, including one in my own hometown of Flint, \nMichigan.\n  Now, this week, Speaker Ryan is trying to distract the focus from \nRepublican Party leader and presumptive nominee Donald Trump's racist \nand bigoted remarks toward Mexican Americans and Muslim Americans.\n  Releasing white papers is not enough to offset what the leader of \nyour party is saying every day about American citizens.\n  Last week, for example, Donald Trump questioned the ability of an \nAmerican Federal judge to do his job--this is a direct quote--because \n``he's a Mexican.'' He even doubled down on this extreme position, \nquestioning whether a Muslim American judge could also properly do his \njob based on his religion, based on his beliefs. These are deeply \ntroubling, racist, un-American comments that cannot be tolerated, that \ncannot be accepted.\n  Honestly, if I felt as if the leadership in the House were doing its \njob to overcome that so as to do its own job and not align with those \nsorts of statements by allowing its own legislation to fail because of \nthe willingness to fly the Confederate flag, it would be far more \nacceptable.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The Chair \nwill remind Members to refrain from engaging in personalities towards \npresumptive nominees for the Office of the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3466-8", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3466-H3467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SPEAKER RYAN'S ``A BETTER WAY'' AGENDA\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week, Speaker of the \nHouse Paul Davis Ryan presented a positive program on what Republicans \nsupport--A Better Way--which is our vision for a confident America.\n  Speaker Ryan has outlined a bold Republican agenda that advances \nmeaningful reforms to address poverty, to protect national security, to \ngrow our economy and create jobs, to defend the Constitution, to \nimprove health care, and to reform the Tax Code. The A Better Way \nprogram will provide positive opportunities for American families\n\n[[Page H3467]]\n\nand will chart the course that challenges all Americans to reach their \nfull potential.\n  The American Dream should be true for everyone.

He continued his education at the University of Tennessee \nat Martin, where he was majoring in criminal justice.\n  At the University of Tennessee, Coy was also pursuing his passion for \nrodeo.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have all seen, heard about, or even experienced for ourselves the \nrecent crisis of wait times at TSA checkpoints at airports across this \ngreat Nation. With record passenger volumes, inefficient staffing \nmodels, and collaboration challenges with airports and airlines, the \nTSA has found itself stretched way too thin. The fact of the matter is \nthat security effectiveness and efficiency are not mutually exclusive.\n  Now that the summer holiday season is upon us, it is imperative that \nwe move to alleviate the nightmarish scenarios that have been playing \nout at airports across the United States in recent months. Passengers \nshould not be missing flights due to long security lines when they are \narriving to the airport 2 hours prior to their flights. Similarly, \nairports should not be approaching an operational ground stop related \nto TSA checkpoint lines. Also, they should not be having to sleep \novernight on cots, in airports, because of TSA snafus.\n  The House has already passed important legislation to expand TSA \nPreCheck, which is still awaiting passage in the Senate. Getting more \npassengers enrolled in PreCheck is essential to security and efficiency \nby identifying low-risk travelers and expediting them through \nscreening. Today, we have the opportunity to act again and swiftly. \nWhen I came to Congress, I made a commitment to my constituents to \ntackle problems head-on and get things done.\n  A few weeks ago, my colleagues and I had convened representatives \nfrom airports and airlines from across this country to discuss this \nwait time crisis and to hear directly from them what they think needs \nto be done to help. The message was consistent, and it was loud: the \nTSA needs to collaborate with individual airlines and airport \nauthorities to coordinate sufficient staffing levels on a local basis.\n  We heard their message. This bill will require the TSA to maximize \nall of its available resources and give airports, airlines, and labor \norganizations a seat at the table to ensure those resources are being \nutilized and allocated in the most effective and efficient manner.\n  The Checkpoint Optimization and Efficiency Act will make a meaningful \nimpact in shortening the burdensome security wait times being \nexperienced by Americans who travel through airports across this \ncountry. It is critical that Congress act to swiftly get this bill to \nthe President's desk.\n  Specifically, this legislation redeploys TSA assets, such as behavior \ndetection officers, of which there are 3,000, and K-9 teams so that \nmore personnel are made available to perform screening functions. \nFurther, the bill grants additional flexibility to local TSA \nsupervisors in order to empower them to make decisions on an airport-\nby-airport basis, rather than a top-down approach from TSA \nheadquarters.\n  This bill will also direct the TSA to undergo a comprehensive \nworkforce assessment and report to Congress to ensure that the agency \nis deploying personnel in the most risk-based manner. The TSA must also \nshare its staffing practices with airport operators, airlines, and \nlabor organizations in order to enhance the coordination between peak \ntravel times, flight schedules, and TSA checkpoint staffing.\n  Mr. Speaker, this wait time crisis is an issue that touches airports \nacross this great country, and a swift response to problems like this \nis what the American people sent us here to accomplish. This \nlegislation implements commonsense practices while preventing a one-\nsize-fits-all approach to aviation security. Above all, the bill \nexplicitly states that security is paramount and that wait times should \nnot be prioritized at the expense of effective security screening.\n  I thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, for his \nstrong support of this legislation and for ensuring that it was a top \npriority for the committee. Additionally, I thank Ranking Member Rice \nand Representative Keating for their bipartisan support on this bill. I \nalso thank the ranking minority member on the Homeland Security \nCommittee, my colleague who works with us hand in hand again and again \non these matters, Mr. Thompson. We are here, before Congress, passing \nyet another bill in a bipartisan manner. This is what Congress is \nsupposed to do, and I thank Mr. Thompson for his support. I also \nexpress thanks to each of the bill's cosponsors for recognizing the \nimportance of this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 5338, the Checkpoint Optimization and \nEfficiency Act of 2016.\n  Over the past few months, the Transportation Security Administration \nhas been scrutinized and criticized regarding wait times. As the peak \ntravel season began, there were several reports of wait times that \nexceeded 2 hours. Those lengthy waits caused anxiety and disappointment \namong travelers. At times, the prolonged wait times caused many \npassengers to miss their flights.\n  In response to this crisis, the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Transportation Security Administration took a series of actions. \nThe TSA deployed additional K-9 teams to screen passengers at \ncheckpoints; it intensified its efforts to promote participation in the \nPreCheck program; it partnered more closely with airlines and airports; \nand it increased research and development efforts for technologies that \nwill improve screening. This bill codifies many of those actions. \nHowever, it does not encompass\n\n[[Page H3469]]\n\nthe entirety of the Department's efforts to address the wait times \ncrisis.\n  DHS Secretary Johnson also requested that $34 million in \nappropriations be reprogrammed from other TSA accounts to help cover \nthe costs for overtime, converting part-time workers to full-time, and \nexpediting the hiring of new transportation security officers. DHS' \nrequest was approved. Just 2 weeks after the reprogramming, Secretary \nJohnson requested an additional infusion of cash to TSA operations of \n$28 million. That reprogramming request is pending. The infusion of $34 \nmillion in additional resources into TSA security operations has had a \ntremendous impact on wait times at the Nation's airports. In fact, \nduring the Memorial Day weekend, most airports reported wait times of \nless than 30 minutes during peak time.\n  If the TSA is to maintain the operational gains that have been \nrealized in recent weeks and keep wait times down, it will require \nCongress' stepping up and providing resources. Even though the measures \nwithin this bill will codify much of what the TSA and the DHS are \nalready doing to address the issue, the only way to achieve long-term, \nmeasurable success is by giving the TSA the resources it needs on an \nongoing basis.\n\n  The TSA's current staffing is out of step with its own projection for \nvolumes in fiscal year 2016. As you can see from the poster, the TSA's \nstaffing in fiscal year 2016 was 42,525 TSOs, which is nearly 2,500 \nfewer frontline staff than in fiscal year 2011. The TSA is expected to \nscreen nearly 100 million more passengers in FY 2016, with about 2,500 \nfewer staff.\n  That is why I joined with Representative DeFazio and Representative \nDold in introducing H.R. 5340, the FASTER Act, which is bipartisan \nlegislation that directs the money that is collected from the flying \npublic through the September 11 Security Fee to actually be used to \nsecure the Nation's commercial aviation system. Unfortunately, a \nsignificant portion of the funds collected, which has totaled $12.6 \nbillion over 10 years, is being diverted to offset the Federal budget. \nI urge Members to support H.R. 5340, the FASTER Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce).\n  Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5338, the \nCheckpoint Optimization and Efficiency Act of 2016.\n  Every week, when I come and go from the Cleveland airport, I worry \nabout the chaotic lines and the long wait times in security. I am glad \nfor the opportunity to speak in support of legislation that intends to \nalleviate this ever-growing problem. I am increasingly hearing from \nconstituents about the frustration of subjecting oneself to air travel. \nTraveling with children is even more stressful, as my wife and I can \nempathize with. Missing a flight because of ridiculously long lines at \nsecurity is unacceptable. At the same time, we need a system that \nguarantees passenger safety.\n  It is all of our jobs here in Congress to ensure that our \nconstituents are safe, and it is the responsibility of TSA officers to \nensure travelers are thoroughly screened. This legislation will boost \ntheir efficiency in doing so. Reviewing the TSA's staffing model is \nnecessary to determine best practices and implement them as soon as \npossible. This legislation increases transparency and accountability. \nExamining big-picture problems with the current system and tackling the \nissues at the source will help to reduce passenger wait times and will \nensure the safety of all of our constituents.\n  This legislation presents a commonsense approach in addressing the \nairport wait times issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. \n5338.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold).\n  Mr. DOLD. I, certainly, thank my good friend from New York for \nyielding the time.\n  I thank my friend from Mississippi, who talked a little bit before \nabout the bill that we are working on together, that being the FASTER \nAct, which I do believe is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent a district just north of Chicago, so the \nairport that I go in and out of right now is Chicago's O'Hare--the \nbusiest airport in the country. In fact, we believe about 77 million \npassengers are going to go through O'Hare this year--77 million. It is \nnot uncommon, obviously, for me to go there and have extremely long \nwait times at the TSA. Unfortunately, what we have seen more recently \nis these wait times continuing to build--to build so much that, \nactually, the wait time is longer than the flight, itself, which, to \nme, is completely unacceptable. Frankly, the American public deserves a \nlittle bit more accountability.\n  Over the past few weeks, these long wait times, obviously, have been \nexacerbated, so we have put on a Band-Aid--a patch--to try to make sure \nthat we have a little bit more staffing at some of these busiest of \nairports around the country, and we have seen those wait times come \ndown. Yet what we do know is that people are missing their flights. \nPeople who have missed their flights, at least in the last couple of \nweeks, have been able to be put on flights without too much \ninconvenience. If this were to happen this summer, the chances are, at \nleast from the airlines, they wouldn't be able to get on their flights \nfor a week or more, which could completely disrupt family vacations and \nthe like.\n  The current screening procedures need to be updated to ensure that we \nprotect passengers from terrorist threats and to make sure that \npassengers are screened in the most efficient manner possible. This is, \nreally, a two-pronged approach. In one, my friend from Mississippi \ntalked about the FASTER Act, which is, again, trying to make sure that \nthe resources that passengers pay are actually going toward the TSA to \nmake sure that it has the manpower necessary to do the screening.\n  Today's bill, the Checkpoint Optimization and Efficiency Act, will go \na long way towards ensuring that the TSA updates the screening \nprocedures to improve customer service at the Nation's busiest \nairports. This bill will ensure that TSA position screeners are where \nthey are needed most, which, I think, is absolutely critical. The bill \nwill allow the TSA to reallocate K-9 teams to the Nation's busiest \nairports or where they are needed. K-9 detecting teams are a vital tool \nin ensuring the quick and effective screening of passengers.\n  Mr. Speaker, just this last week, I was at O'Hare. I went down and \nhad an opportunity to talk with some of the K-9 screeners in Chicago. \nOne actually came from Fairbanks, Alaska, and the other one came in \nfrom Cincinnati.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  There is no question that there was a huge issue at O'Hare that \nneeded to be rectified, and what this legislation does--and the \ngentleman from New York proposes--will allow that flexibility to \nhappen.\n  Finally, I want to just talk about the TSA's Federal Security \nDirectors and making sure that they are placed at the busiest airports \nand have some of the flexibility that they need to make the staffing \ndecisions that are best for the people.\n  The bill today, I believe, will go a long way toward alleviating the \ncrisis at our busiest airports around the country and will help make \nsure that our hours-long wait times will be reduced and diminished.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance \nof my time to close.\n  Mr. Speaker, the measure under consideration will codify much of what \nthe Department and TSA have been doing to address wait times at our \nNation's airports. Thankfully, through bipartisan negotiations on this \nmeasure, we were able to ensure that when local airport working groups \nare stood up, the voices of the airport operators, air carriers, and \nthose who represent the men and women on the front lines of aviation \nsecurity would be heard.\n  Also, I am pleased that the bill, as amended, takes a broader view on \nhow behavior detection officers could be used at our airports. I have \nlong been skeptical of TSA's investment in the Behavior Detection \nOfficer program,\n\n[[Page H3470]]\n\ngiven the risks of racial or ethnic profiling and the lack of science \nto back TSA's claim of this security effectiveness.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Katko was receptive to repurposing this \nposition, at the Federal Security Director's discretion, to any \nalternate position within TSA's checkpoint screening functions.\n  I, once again, urge Members to support H.R. 5340, the FASTER Act, as \nit will ensure that TSA receives funding it needs to acquire and \nmaintain staff and resources to efficiently carry out its mission \nwithout compromising security effectiveness.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  The threats facing our Nation's aviation system are constantly \nchanging and adapting. For this reason, TSA's mission is not only \ndifficult, but critical to the national security of the United States \nand the safety of traveling Americans.\n  I, again, wish to thank all of the bipartisan cosponsors of this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, the traveling public is suffering from \nstaggeringly long airport wait times. As the busy summer travel season \nhas begun, I am consistently hearing reports of missed flights, delays, \nand two-hour plus wait times at TSA security checkpoints. This \nbipartisan legislation includes meaningful reforms that the Homeland \nSecurity Committee has identified to address wait times, while making \nsure that the traveling public remains safe. I also want to encourage \nthe Senate to act on other House-passed bills that would help alleviate \ncheckpoint wait times.\n  TSA's Admiral Neffenger testified before my committee that the \nprovisions outlined in H.R. 5338 would help optimize checkpoints and \nreduce the burden on TSA and passengers. Our bill has also received \noverwhelming support from transportation stakeholders, such as the \nairport and airline community.\n  The Checkpoint Optimization and Efficiency Act redeploys TSA \npersonnel to enhance staffing and increase operational capability, \nallowing more screening lanes to be open. The bill ushers in a new era \nof transparency and accountability between TSA and its airport and \nairline stakeholders, while pushing continued expansion of TSA's \nPreCheck program, which the House has already sought to expand with the \npassage of the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President's recent budget requests have failed to \npredict the resources that were needed to mitigate this problem before \nit started. In fact, last year, TSA gave $100 million back to the U.S. \nTreasury. Now, Secretary Johnson has had to ask Congress for \nreprogramming requests to alleviate the burden placed on TSA \noperations. While these reprogramming requests were necessary, I am \npleased that this legislation will go a step further by reallocating \nexisting assets in a much more effective manner.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Katko for his leadership on this important \nissue, as well as each of the cosponsors of the bill. In particular, I \nwish to thank Ranking Member Rice and Representative Keating for \nlending their support to the bill and for their engagement and work on \nenhancing transportation security. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncritical legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 5338, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3470-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3470-H3475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HELPING HOSPITALS IMPROVE PATIENT CARE ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. TIBERI.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Tiberi) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on H.R. 5273.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today I rise in support of H.R. 5273, the Helping Hospitals Improve \nPatient Care Act, or ``HIP-C'' Act. This bill truly represents a \nbipartisan effort, and I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from \nWashington State (Mr. McDermott) for working with me on this bill. The \nbill also fully represents what the Speaker has often called true \nregular order.\n  Prior to introducing H.R. 5273, the Ways and Means Committee held \nthree hearings on topics included in the bill during the 114th \nCongress, and the committee recently marked up the bill in a unanimous \nway.\n  H.R. 5273 strikes the right balance of preserving site-neutral \npayment policy, which I support, and providing essential relief for \nhospitals that were caught up in this policy change from last year's \nbudget deal. Specifically, this bill helps many hospitals around the \ncountry and in my State of Ohio, including a facility by OhioHealth and \nNationwide Children's Hospital that was started a year ago, last \nsummer, and will benefit from full outpatient payments under the bill, \nas they had planned to when they dug the hole for their facility.\n  Further, the James Cancer Hospital, part of my alma mater at Ohio \nState University, will have their cancer designation protected under \nthe bill, along with other designated cancer centers.\n  The bill also touches on three very important themes in the Medicare \nprogram: One, giving providers regulatory relief; two, ensuring access \nin rural areas; and three, protecting Medicare beneficiaries' access to \nthat important service that people like my mom and dad count on.\n  Under the topic of regulatory relief, we have included three Ways and \nMeans member priorities:\n  Representative Diane Black's bill that provides physicians who \nprimarily practice medicine in ambulatory surgical centers relief in \nthe electronic health records program; Representative Vern Buchanan's \nbill, ensuring full access to Medicare advantage plans; and finally, \nRepresentative Mike Kelly's bill requiring fair and transparent \nreporting by congressional district on the enrollment of beneficiaries \nin both the traditional fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Advantage \nprograms. All of these priorities have previously passed the House \nduring the 114th Session.\n  Under the topic of access in rural areas, the bill allows for \ncontinuation and expansion of participation in the Rural Community \nHospital Demonstration Program. Championed by my colleagues, Senator \nGrassley in the Senate and Chairman Don Young in the House, this policy \nis a continuation from the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.\n  Under the topic of beneficiary access in Medicare, the bill requires \nthe Secretary to revise the pre-Medicare eligibility notification, \nadding greater transparency for beneficiaries, which was led by my \ncolleagues, Dr. McDermott and Representative Pat Meehan.\n  Finally, the bill includes two important Member priorities that \nadvance important Medicare hospital issues. The first requires the \nSecretary to ensure there is proper adjustment for socioeconomic \nfactors. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) has championed this \nissue for some time. Representative Jim Renacci's policy ensures that \nthe hospital readmissions program provides an apples-to-apples \ncomparison based on the specific patient population a hospital treats.\n  The second priority, led by our Speaker, Paul Ryan, is the \nestablishment of a crosswalk of hospital codes. Back when Speaker Ryan \nwas the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he actively pursued \nMedicare hospital issues. His crosswalk is an important building block \nof a future system that promises to streamline the operation of \nhospital services.\n  I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation, send it to the \nSenate, and let's get this to the President's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of the Helping Hospitals Improve Patient Care \nAct. This bill makes important changes that will help hospitals \ncontinue to provide high-quality care to patients as they implement the \nrecent payment reforms. This is bipartisan legislation unique in itself \nthat I am happy to have introduced with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nTiberi).\n  I thank the chairman for his willingness to collaborate on this bill. \nI also thank the staff of the Ways and Means Committee for their hard \nwork in helping us come to an agreement on language that Members of \nboth parties\n\n[[Page H3474]]\n\ncan fully support. This final bill isn't perfect, but it is truly a \nbipartisan product that reflects the spirit of compromise.\n  Whenever we head back to our districts, we all hear from our \nhospitals about the effects that our policies are having back home. \nAlthough we made a smart change to hospital payments when we passed the \nBipartisan Budget Act last year, we are beginning to recognize the \nunintended consequences of the legislation. We did not really expect \neverything that is happening.\n  Many hospitals that were in the process of constructing outpatient \ndepartments will be hit with unexpected payment cuts due to the BBA. In \naddition, many cancer hospitals would be harmed by the new payment \nrules. This bill fixes these problems in a narrowly tailored way that \ndoesn't undermine the goals of the BBA.\n  Moving forward, hospitals will no longer be encouraged to consolidate \nby buying up physician practices for the purpose of billing Medicare at \nan inflated rate. This is a good policy that is consistent with the \nrecommendations of a GAO report that was released last year. But \nfacilities that were under development when we passed the BBA, as well \nas cancer hospitals, will be protected from these changes. This isn't a \ngiveaway to hospitals. The industry will pay the full cost.\n  In addition, this bill makes refinements to the readmissions \nreduction program. To ensure that hospitals that serve a large number \nof low-income patients are not unfairly penalized, the bill will \nrequire CMS to make apples-to-apples comparisons between similar \nfacilities. As we await additional data that will soon be available \nthanks to the IMPACT Act, this will ensure that the hospitals are not \nhit with undeserved penalties due to a flawed methodology.\n  Finally, I am happy that we are also able to come to an agreement on \na bipartisan improvement to the beneficiary enrollment process. Each \nyear, thousands of people enroll in Medicare; and thanks to this bill, \nseniors will have more information about their benefit options when \nthey become eligible for Medicare. Providing complete and easy-to-\nunderstand information is critical. The decisions that beneficiaries \nmake when they enroll in Medicare have serious, long-term implications, \nincluding a potential lifetime penalty if they fail to sign up for part \nB. This bill will also help beneficiaries make informed decisions by \nimproving the Welcome to Medicare package.\n\n  I, again, thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working \ntogether on this bill. I am pleased we were able to craft a bipartisan \ncompromise, and I look forward to continuing to work together on these \nand other important issues in the weeks ahead.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlaska (Mr. Young).\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank Chairman \nTiberi for his kind work. We will miss the gentleman from Washington \n(Mr. McDermott), and I thank him for this bipartisan effort because \nthis is a good bill and I strongly support it.\n  This measure includes many important provisions as you have spoken \nabout. But especially important to Alaska is section 103 language from \nlegislation, H.R. 672, a 5-year extension of the Rural Community \nHospital Demonstration Program. This demonstration program has worked \nwell and has come to the aid of seniors in Alaska and healthcare \nproviders across rural America.\n  Congress created the program to provide increased Medicare \nreimbursements for hospitals across the Nation that are too large to be \nconsidered Critical Access Hospitals, but too small to be supported by \ntraditional low Medicare margins on inpatient services.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  This program has helped three hospitals in Alaska: Central Peninsula \nof Soldotna, the Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, and Mt. \nEdgecumbe in Sitka. These hospitals serve a wide variety of patients \nall across those vast areas.\n  I do believe this is one of the better bipartisan efforts. Go back to \nthe old days when we accomplished things together by talking with one \nanother. It is vital we pass this bipartisan legislation and that the \nSenate act on it. I would suggest, respectfully, to both my chairman \nand ranking member, let's talk to the Senate and see if we can't get \nsomething done. Four hundred bills over there is wrong. This is one \nthat shouldn't be hung up.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and \ncongratulate Chairman Tiberi and Ranking Member McDermott for having \nput together an outstanding piece of legislation. While we applaud it \nfor being bipartisan, I applaud it because it is good. It actually \nhelps to meet needs that exist. It protects hospitals and gives them \nthe opportunity to provide a better level of patient care.\n  I attended, just last week, the opening of an outpatient center that \nSt. Bernard Hospital in the Englewood community of Chicago had put \ntogether. Of course, everybody in the community was there because \neverybody recognized that inner-city hospitals, disproportionate share \nhospitals, and medical centers that are complex need all of the \nprotection that they can get, and we need to have a better \nunderstanding of readmission policies and practices and why some are \ndifferent than others.\n  These gentlemen have put together a piece of legislation that all of \nus can be proud of. I strongly support it and thank them for their \ndiligence, for their cooperation, and for their tremendous efforts to \ndo a good bill.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nnortheastern Ohio (Mr. Renacci), a good friend, an important member of \nthe Committee on Ways and Means, and a leader on the readmission policy \ndealing with hospitalization.\n  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5273, the Helping \nHospitals Improve Patient Care Act of 2016. I want to thank Chairman \nBrady and my good friend and colleague, Subcommittee Chairman Tiberi, \nfor all their great work to advance this bill, which addresses many \nconcerns in payments to hospitals, and especially outpatient \ndepartments.\n  I heard from many of the hospitals in northeast Ohio, including \nMetroHealth, about the impact this payment policy had on their new \nfacility. I am happy we are able to correct these issues for those \nfacilities already under construction.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Ohio for including my bill, \nH.R. 1343--the Establishing Beneficiary Equity in Hospital Readmission \nProgram--in the underlying legislation. The Hospital Readmission \nProgram was created due to concerns that too few resources were being \nspent on reducing acute care hospital readmissions.\n  While we do want to make sure hospitals are reducing acute care \nreadmissions, we also want to make sure we are not disproportionately \npenalizing those who see a large number of our most vulnerable patient \npopulations, especially those teaching hospitals who see a large number \nof dual-eligible beneficiaries, low-income seniors, or young people \nwith disabilities who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid who \nwould have been unintentionally hurt under the current program.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman for working with me on this \nreadmission component of this bill, but also all of the other important \nprovisions included in this legislation. These are commonsense, \nbipartisan reforms to improve our healthcare system.\n  I urge all Members to support the Helping Hospitals Improve Patient \nCare Act of 2016.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to \ntell you a little bit about some of the hospital networks in my State \nof Ohio. Mr. Renacci talked about some in northeastern Ohio that \nsupport this legislation. Let me just name a few hospitals in my State \nof Ohio that are\n\n[[Page H3475]]\n\nsupportive of this legislation: Aultman, headquartered in his district \nin Canton; the Cleveland Clinic, Kettering Health Network in the Dayton \narea; Mercy Canton Sisters of Charity; MetroHealth System in Cleveland; \nOhioHealth, headquartered in Columbus; Ohio State University Wexner \nMedical Center in Columbus; the University of Cincinnati Health System \nin Cincinnati; and University Hospitals, headquartered in Cleveland. As \nwas mentioned, this legislation passed the Committee on Ways and Means \nin a bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, occasionally we have an extra minute on \nthe floor, and it makes sense to acknowledge some people that we trust \nand rely upon and we don't ever mention, so I would like to just say \nthank you to the Democratic staff: Sarah Levin, Melanie Egorin, Daniel \nFoster, JC Cannon, and Daniel Jackson; on the Republican side: Emily \nMurry, Lisa Grabert, Nick Uehlecke, Taylor Trott; to the staff at the \nCMS who helped put this bill together: Ira Burney, Anne Scott, Lisa \nYen. And to the staff at legislative counsel: Ed Grossman--Ed has been \nthere for as long as I have been here, so any bill that gets out of \nhere without Ed looking at it is a pretty rare bill--and Jessica \nShapiro is his assistant.\n  The Congressional Budget Office gets in on these deals as well: Tom \nBradley, Lori Housman, Kevin McNellis, and Jamease Kowalczyk. I am from \nChicago. I should be able to pronounce a Polish name. We appreciate \ntheir hard work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, let me just close by saying thank you to Dr. \nMcDermott. It has been enjoyable to work with his team, led by Amy, and \nwe appreciate the bipartisanship. You mentioned all those names--stole \nmy thunder--Emily and her team, and my staff, Whitney Koch Daffner and \nAbigail Finn, too, for yeoman's work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a unanimous vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n5273, the Helping Hospitals Improve Patient Care Act of 2016.\n  First, I'd like to thank Chairman Tiberi and Ranking Member McDermott \nfor their leadership on this important legislation.\n  At the Ways and Means Committee, we are working to deliver health \ncare solutions that will expand access, increase choices, and improve \nthe quality of care for the American people.\n  The Helping Hospitals Improve Patient Care Act helps advance all \nthree of those goals. And the bill does so in a fiscally responsible \nmanner that helps strengthen and preserve Medicare for the long-term.\n  At its core, our bipartisan legislation is about supporting the \ndelivery of high-quality, affordable care to families and seniors \nthroughout the country. It will especially help people who live in low-\nincome and rural communities.\n  Our bill includes straightforward solutions to help hospitals and \nhealth care providers transition to--and preserve--the new site-neutral \npayment policies. This will give providers the certainty they need to \nbest serve their patients, now and into the future.\n  This bill is an excellent illustration of what we can accomplish \nthrough regular order. It's the product of many innovative solutions, \nproposed by many members on both sides of the aisle.\n  The solutions in this bill will make a real difference when it comes \nto the delivery of high-quality care for the people of our districts.\n  In fact, the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center located \nin Houston has already embraced this bill. MD Anderson officials said, \n``This ensures our ability to continue providing the highest quality \nand level of cancer care to patients in the communities we serve.''\n  And MD Anderson is just one of many hospitals and cancer treatment \ncenters throughout the country that we help with H.R. 5273.\n  This bill is particularly personal for me because it builds from the \nhospital discussion draft I released as Health Subcommittee Chairman \nback in November 2014.\n  In the Helping Hospitals Improve Patient Care Act, we push forward \ntwo critical building blocks of that discussion draft.\n  First, Speaker Ryan's crosswalk bill that better coordinates care \nbetween inpatient and outpatient settings.\n  Second, Congressman Jim Renacci's readmission policy, which helps \nhospitals in low-income communities serve their patients.\n  There are still many policies from our hospital discussion draft that \nare worthy of debate. We'll continue to work with Members and \nstakeholders to pursue additional reforms that make our health care \nsystem work better for patients and providers in our communities.\n  I'm grateful to all the members--on and off our committee--who worked \nhard to craft and advance the Helping Hospitals Improve Patient Care \nAct.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 5273, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3475-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3475-H3479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUPPORTING GOAL OF ENSURING ALL HOLOCAUST VICTIMS LIVE WITH DIGNITY, \n                         COMFORT, AND SECURITY\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Res. 129\n\n       Whereas the annihilation of 6,000,000 Jews during the \n     Holocaust and the murder of millions of others by the Nazi \n     German state constitutes one of the most tragic and heinous \n     crimes in human history;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Jews survived persecution \n     by the Nazi regime despite being imprisoned, subjected to \n     slave labor, moved into ghettos, forced to live in hiding or \n     under false identity, forced to live under curfew, or \n     required to wear the ``yellow star'';\n       Whereas in fear of the oncoming Nazi Einsatzgruppen (``Nazi \n     Killing Squads'') and the likelihood of extermination, \n     hundreds of thousands of Jewish Nazi victims fled for their \n     lives;\n       Whereas whatever type of persecution suffered by Jews \n     during the Holocaust, the common thread that binds these \n     Holocaust victims is that they were targeted for \n     extermination and that they lived with a constant fear for \n     their lives and the lives of their loved ones;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims immigrated to the United States \n     from Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and the former \n     Soviet Union from 1933 to today;\n       Whereas it is estimated that there are at least 100,000 \n     Holocaust victims living in the United States and \n     approximately 500,000 living around the world today, \n     including child survivors;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Holocaust victims are in their \n     80s or 90s or are more than 100 years in age, and the number \n     of Holocaust victims is diminishing;\n       Whereas at least 50 percent of Holocaust victims alive \n     today will pass away within the next decade, and those alive \n     are becoming frailer and have increasing health and welfare \n     needs;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims throughout the world continue to \n     suffer from permanent physical and psychological injuries and \n     disabilities and live with the emotional scars of this \n     systematic genocide against the Jewish people;\n       Whereas many of the emotional and psychological scars of \n     Holocaust victims are exacerbated in their old age, the past \n     haunts and overwhelms many aspects of their lives when their \n     health fails them;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims suffer particular trauma when \n     their emotional and physical circumstances force them to \n     leave the security of their own home and enter institutional \n     or other group living residential facilities;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Holocaust victims live in \n     poverty, cannot afford and do not receive sufficient medical \n     care, home care, mental health care, medicine, food, \n     transportation, and other vital life-sustaining services that \n     allow them to live their final years with comfort and \n     dignity;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims often lack family support \n     networks and require social worker-supported case management \n     in order to manage their daily lives and access government \n     funded services;\n       Whereas in response to a letter sent by Members of Congress \n     to Germany's Minister of Finance in December 2015 regarding \n     increased funding for Holocaust victims, German officials \n     acknowledged that ``recent experience has shown that the care \n     financed by the German Government to date is insufficient'' \n     and that ``it is imperative to expand these assistance \n     measures quickly given the advanced age of many of the \n     affected persons'';\n\n[[Page H3476]]\n\n       Whereas German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer acknowledged in \n     1951 Germany's responsibility to provide moral and financial \n     compensation to Holocaust victims worldwide;\n       Whereas every successive German Chancellor has reaffirmed \n     this position, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, who in \n     2007 reaffirmed that ``only by fully accepting its enduring \n     responsibility for this most appalling period and for the \n     cruelest crimes in its history, can Germany shape the \n     future'';\n       Whereas in 2015 Chancellor Merkel's spokesperson again \n     confirmed ``all Germans know the history of the murderous \n     race mania of the Nazis that led to the break with \n     civilization that was the Holocaust. . . we know that \n     responsibility for this crime against humanity is German and \n     very much our own''; and\n       Whereas Congress believes it is Germany's moral and \n     historical responsibility to comprehensively, permanently, \n     and urgently provide the resources for all Holocaust victims' \n     medical, mental health, and long-term care needs: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges the financial and moral commitment of the \n     Federal Republic of Germany over the past seven decades to \n     provide a measure of justice for Holocaust victims;\n       (2) supports the goal of ensuring that all Holocaust \n     victims in the United States and around the world are able to \n     live with dignity, comfort, and security in their remaining \n     years;\n       (3) applauds the nonprofit organizations and agencies that \n     work tirelessly to honor and assist Holocaust victims in \n     their communities;\n       (4) acknowledges the ongoing process of negotiations \n     between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Conference on \n     Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference) in \n     order to secure funding for Holocaust victims and for vital \n     social services provided through nonprofit organizations and \n     agencies around the world;\n       (5) acknowledges that the Federal Republic of Germany and \n     the Claims Conference have established a new high-level \n     working group that will develop proposals for extensive \n     assistance for homecare and other social welfare needs of \n     Holocaust victims;\n       (6) urges the working group to recognize the imperative of \n     immediately and fully funding victims' medical, mental \n     health, and long-term care needs and to do so with full \n     transparency and accountability to ensure all funds for \n     Holocaust victims from the Federal Republic of Germany are \n     administered efficiently, fairly, and without delay; and\n       (7) urges the Federal Republic of Germany to continue to \n     reaffirm its commitment and fulfill its moral responsibility \n     to Holocaust victims by ensuring that every Holocaust victim \n     receives all of the prescribed medical care, home care, \n     mental health care, and other vital services necessary to \n     live in dignity and by providing, without delay, additional \n     financial resources to address the unique needs of Holocaust \n     victims.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank my good friend and south \nFlorida colleague, Mr. Ted Deutch, for his work on this resolution and \nfor cointroducing it together. It is an important resolution, Mr. \nSpeaker. I also want to thank our chairman, Chairman Royce, and the \nranking member, Mr. Engel, for always working in a bipartisan manner, \nfor recognizing the importance of this resolution, and for moving this \nbill out of our Committee on Foreign Affairs in an expeditious manner.\n  This resolution, simply put, Mr. Speaker, urges Germany to honor its \nmoral and historical obligations to Holocaust survivors and to provide \nfor their unmet needs immediately and comprehensively. I know that for \nMr. Deutch and for me, this is an issue that deeply impacts many of our \nconstituents in south Florida.\n  There are just over 500,000 Holocaust survivors worldwide. About a \nquarter of that number live right here in the United States, with over \n15,000 living in our south Florida communities, Mr. Speaker. I have had \nthe honor and privilege to work closely with survivors from south \nFlorida, many of whom I have come to call dear friends: my friends \nDavid Mermelstein, David Schaecter, Herbie Karliner, Joe Sachs, and \nAlex Gross; and Jack Rubin, who has testified before Congress on issues \nrelated to Holocaust survivors, including a hearing that I chaired \nalongside Mr. Deutch in the year 2014.\n  There are also many more to thank, those who have made justice for \nHolocaust survivors their life's work, individuals like Sam Dubbin, \nMark Talisman, and the list goes on and on, Mr. Speaker.\n  It has been my close relationship with these individuals that has \nreally helped me to understand the realities that survivors have \nendured during humanity's darkest period and, unfortunately, the sad \nreality that they face today--today--Mr. Speaker, especially when it \ncomes to their home healthcare needs, to their mental health needs, to \ntheir medical care needs.\n  Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that nearly half of all survivors worldwide \nlive at or below the poverty level? After going through what is almost \nindescribable horror, these survivors are living at or below the \npoverty level. Many survivors are unable to maintain even a modest and \ndignified standard of living: they lack funds for home care; they don't \nhave the money for medicine; they don't have the funds for food; they \ncan't pay the utilities; and they can't pay their rent. As Jack Rubin \nsaid before our subcommittee in the year 2014: the existing system has \nfallen tragically short of what survivors need and deserve.\n  The current funding and care delivery systems are difficult for \nsurvivors to access, and they are severely underfunded. That is why it \nis so important that we pass this resolution and urge our friends in \nGermany, our good partners in Germany, to honor the obligations and the \ncommitments that they have made to provide for the needs of Holocaust \nsurvivors.\n  German Governments have provided some support through income \nassistance programs and have doubled funding for home care services in \nthe past 5 years, so they are trying. They want to do better. In fact, \neven by Germany's own admission, the care financed by the German \nGovernment to date has been insufficient for those in need of intensive \nlong-term care.\n  Mr. Speaker, because of the horrors that these survivors have endured \nand the emotional and physical scars they continue to carry with them, \ntheir medical, mental, and home care needs are far more complex, far \nmore extensive than those of other elderly individuals.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  These survivors have endured the torture; they have endured the labor \ncamps, experiments, the loss of loved ones, and even the loss of entire \nfamilies. We owe these survivors the opportunity to live out the \nremainder of their days in the dignity and comfort they deserve.\n  Germany owes it to the survivors to alleviate and end the continuing \ninjuries inflicted by the Nazi regime by finding a way to provide for \nall of their medical, mental health, and home care needs, directly and \nwithout delay.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Mr. Deutch and to join me in urging \nGermany to do the right thing, because time is of the essence.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this resolution. And I thank Chairman Royce and \nRanking Member Engel for moving so quickly to pass this resolution \nthrough committee and bring it to the floor, because time is, sadly, \nvery much of the essence.\n  Today we will vote on H. Con. Res. 129, which calls upon Germany to \nfully fund the needs of aging Holocaust survivors. I want to thank my \nfriend, Chairman Emeritus Ros-Lehtinen, for her steadfast leadership \nand for her longstanding commitment to championing the needs of \nHolocaust survivors.\n  More than anything else, I want to thank the survivors in south \nFlorida and throughout the Nation. You are my constituents, my friends, \nand my heroes. This includes Jack Rubin, whose tireless advocacy \nthrough trips\n\n[[Page H3477]]\n\nto Washington to educate and testify in Congress shaped this very \neffort; and Norman Frajman, whose dedication to educating students in \nour own community helped ensure that they will never forget.\n  My friend, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, mentioned so many of the \npeople that she is so close to. I want to thank her for giving me the \nopportunity and the blessing of getting to know and spend time with \nDavid Schaecter, David Mermelstein, and others.\n  It breaks my heart that today in the United States there are tens of \nthousands of survivors who live in poverty and cannot afford, and thus \ndo not receive, sufficient medical care, home care, and other vital \nlife-sustaining services.\n  Today we have an opportunity to send a clear message that these \nsurvivors, who made it through the darkest time in history, deserve to \nlive out their lives with the dignity that they are so worthy of and \nhave long been promised.\n  Some of my colleagues might wonder: Why is this resolution needed?\n  It is simple: Holocaust survivors are not receiving the care that \nthey need.\n  For decades, the German Government has remained committed to funding \nsurvivor needs. This is something I know Chancellor Merkel cares a \ngreat deal about, as she has reaffirmed that commitment. But the \nsurvivor population is aging into their eighties, their nineties, and \nhundreds. Their needs are greater.\n  Unfortunately, despite the payments of the German Government over \ndecades, significant gaps in survivor care remain. And German officials \nhave acknowledged that shortfall. Right now there are special \nnegotiations going on with the German Government. In the coming days, \ndecisions will be made in Berlin that will determine whether or not \nsurvivors will receive the funding and the care that they so \ndesperately need.\n  But I am worried. I am worried that time is running out. I am worried \nthat this is our last chance to ensure that, once and for all, \nsurvivors have what they need. Every survivor deserves to receive the \ncare needed to live in comfort.\n  So many survivors are struggling. And, again, while we appreciate the \ndecades-long commitment of the German Government, I am not certain that \nour ally, Germany, understands the scope of the true need--the needs \nthat Chairman Ros-Lehtinen and I see in our communities in south \nFlorida every day. That is why passing this resolution here will send a \nmessage that is unmistakable; and that is that Congress is fully \nunited.\n  We stand at a decisive moment in the lives of our aging survivor \npopulation. Each month it seems that there is another funeral in my \ncommunity and another survivor passes. So it is with a heavy heart that \nwe must acknowledge that these current negotiations are likely the last \nopportunity for Germany to comprehensively address the unique health \nand welfare needs of survivors before it is too late.\n  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today urges our German partners \nto fulfill the moral and financial commitment to the victims of the \nHolocaust. The shortfall is the most dramatic when it comes to home \ncare. For survivors, the need to stay in their homes as they age is \ncritical. The thought of institutionalized care or being removed from \ntheir home is a devastatingly painful reminder of the past. As they \nage, they rely more on home care services.\n  Under the current system, home care is capped so that even the most \ninfirmed, isolated, and poor Nazi victims can only receive a maximum of \n25 hours of home care per week. That is 5 hours a day for 5 days a \nweek. There is no funding for additional hours.\n  In committee I spoke about my 91-year-old constituent who survived \nBergen-Belsen. He fell and suffered a fracture. He requires assistance \nwith all of the activities of daily living. He now needs round-the-\nclock care, but the current funding system does not provide it.\n  Many of those who survived also lack family support to help with \ntransportation to doctors' appointments or help preparing meals. They \ndeserve to have these most basic needs met. They deserve to be able to \naccess care for all of their mental and medical health needs. And they \ndeserve our support.\n  Today I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of \nthis resolution and for Germany to seize upon this opportunity to \nalleviate the suffering of survivors. While no amount of money can ever \nerase the horrors faced by Nazi victims, there is a moral \nresponsibility to ensure that they can receive all of the vital \nservices and medical care necessary to live out the remainder of their \ndays with dignity.\n  No more limitations on home care hours. Complete the negotiations. \nAnd fund the needs now, once and for all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly), my friend.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Ted Deutch, for his \nleadership, and also my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Florida \ntwins who have so steadfastly brought this matter of conscience and \nhistory to the floor of the House of Representatives.\n  It was said about the Holocaust that ``we should never forget'' and \n``never again.'' What a legacy it would be that those who survived the \ndarkest chapter of human history should live out the remainder of their \nyears in want--in want of basic medical care, in want of home health \ncare and caregiving so that they can have dignity in their twilight \nyears.\n  How can we ignore that plight? How can we say to that generation, You \nshould go without?\n  They are living reminders of the dark side of human nature and of how \nhistory can go so terribly wrong. Honoring them with this resolution \nand engaging our partner, our ally, Germany, in this one last endeavor \nis a noble cause.\n  I am pleased to support H. Con. Res. 129, and I applaud the \nleadership of my colleagues from Florida in reminding this House of the \nduty still in front of us.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are talking about the frailest people in our \ncommunity who have endured the worst, most unimaginable horrors. They \nare people whose entire families were destroyed.\n  Mr. Speaker, Hitler tried to destroy them. He succeeded in killing \nmillions, but his goal was genocide. His goal was to wipe the Jewish \npeople from the face of the Earth.\n  We can't imagine the magnitude of that evil, but we have just a few \nyears left with those who managed to survive, to escape death--\nsometimes multiple times--to endure concentration camps when everyone \naround them was sent to the gas chambers, and to flee death squads that \nroamed the European countryside killing--and mass killings--again and \nagain and again.\n  For them to live through all of that, to survive all of that, should \nwe tell them that we are sorry, we must cap the amount of care you can \nreceive in your home? Or that the social service agencies and their \nemployees and their volunteers who know what their clients need should \ntell them to need less?\n  Mr. Speaker, let's pass this resolution and tell every person sitting \nat the negotiating table in Berlin that we will not accept half \nmeasures. The German Government has reiterated its moral obligation to \nact. This resolution calls for action. The time to act is now. \nSurvivors of the Holocaust deserve dignity.\n  I would like to again thank my dear friend and fierce advocate for \nsurvivors, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. We have stood together on \ntheir behalf for years. She is remarkably committed to justice.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, there are Holocaust survivors who are \nwatching us now. When we pass this resolution, many will cry. They told \nme that. I cannot and I will not go back to south Florida on Friday and \nlook into the eyes of these sweet people whom we are so fortunate to \nknow, so privileged to have in our community, and tell them that \nCongress passed a resolution to make them feel better. They don't need \nsymbolism.\n  What I will tell them is that the United States House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly spoke on their behalf--\n\n[[Page H3478]]\n\na group that 80 years ago had no one speaking for them. And we expect \nthe German Government to hear what we are saying.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank Mr. Deutch and Mr. Connolly. What a joy it has been \nfor me to have worked with them, especially with my twin. The poor guy. \nThat was a low blow by Mr. Connolly. Mr. Deutch might not forgive him \nfor that. But what heartfelt words from Mr. Deutch. I thank him for \nthat.\n  We are indeed fortunate, Mr. Speaker, that we have so many \nconstituents in our districts for whom this issue is so important. We \nare blessed that we have so many Holocaust survivors in our districts. \nBut, sadly, as Mr. Deutch, Mr. Connolly, and I have pointed out, time \nis of the essence. These survivors are passing away without the urgent \ncare that they have been promised and without the comforts that they \nneed.\n  So I want to close by saying, Mr. Speaker, just how important this \nmeasure is. Mr. Deutch talked about how our constituents are watching \nin south Florida. And it is so true. How important it is that we send a \nclear message to the German Government that time is of the essence.\n  For over 70 years, Holocaust survivors have had to live with the \npainful memories and the toll that their experiences have had on their \nminds and their bodies.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Successive German Governments have acknowledged Germany's \nresponsibility for the Nazi regime's atrocities. Most recently, \nChancellor Merkel's office stated: ``We know the responsibility for \nthis crime against humanity is German and very much our own.''\n  I agree with Chancellor Merkel's office. We don't have time for \nnegotiations, Mr. Speaker. How long will those negotiations take while, \nevery day, yet another Holocaust survivor passes away.\n  We don't need Germany to engage with the bureaucratic nightmare that \nis the Claims Conference. This was a process that was set up to deal \nwith these issues, but it has not worked out that way. Why add another \nlayer to the process when Germany can and should provide this \nassistance directly?\n  The proof that this Claims Conference process has been nothing short \nof an abject failure is that nearly half of the survivors today, Mr. \nSpeaker, are living at or below the poverty level. Under this current \nsystem, many have died well before their time as a result of this \ncurrent broken system, to say nothing about the fraud, the corruption, \nand the embezzlement that has been documented.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Claims Conference has failed to live up to its \nmandate to advocate and work on behalf of survivors. The Claims \nConference provides artificial caps on survivors' needs. When those \ncaps are reached, good luck.\n  Just recently, a survivor from our own area right here in D.C. was \ntold by a local service agency that the Claims Conference would no \nlonger fund her Lifeline button. This woman lives alone, Mr. Speaker. \nShe needs this service, but she was cut off.\n  The Conference stops assistance for many, and many others receive no \nassistance at all, while their pleas fall on deaf ears.\n  With the Claims Conference, there is no transparency, little \naccountability, and a shocking disregard for the actual survivors, \nthemselves; but I believe Chancellor Merkel's heartfelt expression of \nconcern about Germany's responsibility to survivors and her leadership \non moral issues, and this will finally resolve this longstanding \ntragedy for survivors.\n  That is why our resolution, Mr. Speaker, to fund, directly, \nsurvivors' needs is so important. We have seen what happens when the \nClaims Conference gets involved. Survivors are just not afforded the \nassistance they desperately need.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join Mr. Deutch and me in urging Germany \nto fund, directly and comprehensively, all of the needs of survivors \nlike it has pledged. There is no time to waste.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Ros-Lehtinen and \nRanking Member Deutch for their work on this resolution, and their \ncontinued work on Holocaust issues.\n  The horrors wrought by the Nazi regime did not end when prisoners \nfinally walked out from behind the barbed wire fences in 1945. Today, \nthe after-effects of Hitler's death camps still haunt the lives of \nthose who survived.\n  Tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors throughout the world live in \npoverty, forced to choose between feeding themselves and purchasing \nnecessary medication.\n  The problem is staggering. Five hundred thousand survivors remain--\nmost of them in their 80s. Today, more than one in four lack sufficient \naccess to the care they need to live their final years in comfort and \nin dignity.\n  For decades, Germany has instituted and funded a number of aid \nprograms in recognition of its obligation to these survivors. However, \nGermany's own evaluations made clear that more needs to be done.\n  We urge the German government to immediately and fully fund \nprogramming for victims' medical, mental health, and long-term care \nneeds.\n  Time is of the essence. Every day that decisions are stalled, we lose \nanother survivor, another story, another chance to show our respect for \nthese individuals who have already endured what no one should.\n  Today's resolution recognizes the moral imperative for us--all of \nus--to work to ensure a life of dignity, security, and comfort for \nHolocaust survivors.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. \nCon. Res. 129, urging the Federal Republic of Germany to further \nfulfill its commitment to support the welfare of Holocaust survivors by \nensuring that they receive the medical, mental health, and long-term \ncare they require.\n  In 1952, the West German government concluded an agreement with \nrepresentatives from major Jewish national and international \norganizations and the State of Israel to provide indemnification and \nrestitution directly to survivors of the Holocaust. This agreement \nreflected an overdue but basic recognition at the time by many, \nincluding then-German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer who saw such \nrestitution as, quote, ``easing the way to the spiritual settlement of \ninfinite suffering.''\n  Mr. Speaker, that infinite suffering inflicted by the genocidal Nazi \nregime continues to this day. It is a daily reality for the aging \nsurvivors of that infamous crime who live with the mental and sometimes \nphysical consequences of being tortured and abused.\n  There are over 500,000 Holocaust survivors living around the world \ntoday, and over 100,000 live here in the United States--witnesses to \nboth the stunning evil and miraculous resilience of which humanity is \ncapable. Their quiet presence in our midst is a treasure seldom \nsufficiently cherished. Today, as they age, they are increasingly in \nneed of support and assistance that will allow them to live their \nremaining days with access to quality care and the peace that comes \nwith it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support H. Con. Res 129 because I think it is right \nthat the Federal Republic of Germany deliver direct support to \nHolocaust survivors to guarantee that they live the rest of their lives \nwith the dignity, comfort, and security that was deprived them decades \nago.\n  The resolution calls on the German government to make every effort--\nwhether through direct assistance or negotiated arrangements--to \nsupport the medical, mental health, and long-term care needs of \nHolocaust victims. This support would be fully consistent with the \nGerman government's longstanding commitment to Holocaust survivors and \nit cannot wait.\n  It is important, Mr. Speaker, to also note the important steps \nalready taken by the Federal Republic of Germany and the tremendous \nefforts and achievements it has made in making amends for the genocide \ncommitted under the Nazi dictatorship. H. Con. Res. 129 urges Germany \nto continue on this path and as such deserves our support in the House.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my friend and colleague Rep. Ileana \nRos-Lehtinen, for introducing this laudable resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the \nrules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 129, as \namended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Land Management Workforce Flexibility Act enacted \nlast year removed a barrier to the career advancement opportunities of \nlong-serving temporary and seasonal employees of land management \nagencies across the Federal Government.\n  I want to thank my friend from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for his \ncompanion work in the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I \nam proud to not only support it, but I authored a similar measure in \nthe national defense authorization.\n  The bill we are considering today makes a technical correction that \nis necessary due to recent guidance of the Office of Personnel \nManagement, or OPM. H.R. 4906 clarifies that Congress intended to \nremove restrictions on temporary seasonal employees that would \notherwise hinder their ability to compete for merit promotion vacancies \nopen to other Federal employees.\n  Seasonal work of land management agencies is accomplished by a mix of \nboth permanent and temporary employees. Before the Land Management \nWorkforce Flexibility Act, regardless of how many seasons served, \ntemporary employees could not compete for permanent jobs under the \nmerit promotion procedures available to other Federal employees. Under \nthe bill enacted last year, long-serving temporary employees were given \nthis opportunity, and their employing agencies are provided with better \napplicant pools as a result.\n  For instance, experienced seasonal wildland firefighters are well \nqualified for permanent leadership roles within agencies that work to \ncombat wildfires. Mr. Speaker, the Land Management Workforce \nFlexibility Act recognized their service as employees and afforded them \nopportunities for promotion.\n  However, recent guidance from the Office of Personnel Management \nseverely limits temporary employees' ability to compete for permanent \njobs. OPM's guidance declares temporary employees eligible to compete \nfor permanent jobs only in situations where the hiring agency plans to \nprepare a list of candidates under merit promotion procedures and \naccepts applications only from individuals inside its own workforce.\n  This bill today makes a technical correction to clarify the temporary \nseasonal employees of land management agencies are eligible for the \nsame opportunities for consideration under merit promotion procedures \nthat apply to other Federal employees.\n  The bill also makes clear that eligible former employees are deemed \nto be employees of the agency from which they were most recently \nseparated for instances where the position is limited to employees of \nthe hiring agency.\n  Mr. Speaker, this straightforward bill will help to establish a more \neffective, efficient, and qualified Federal workforce.\n  I thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Government \nOperations, my friend, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), for \nauthoring this key legislation.\n  I would also like to highlight the great work of the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Government Operations, the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Meadows), who is an original cosponsor of H.R. 4906 and \ncares deeply about remedying this situation.\n  I support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Oklahoma for his leadership and \nhis support on this important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of a bipartisan bill, H.R. \n4906, which I am pleased to cosponsor with Chairman Meadows of the \nGovernment Operations Subcommittee.\n  This simple bill makes, as my friend indicated, a technical \ncorrection to bipartisan legislation known as the Land Management \nWorkforce Flexibility Act, on which I was pleased to work with the \ncommittee in passing into law just last year. That bill originally \npassed the House by a voice vote and then went on to pass the Senate by \nunanimous consent. As my colleagues will recall, that bill was intended \nto give temporary seasonal employees an opportunity to compete for \npermanent full-time employment within all agencies across the entire \nFederal Government.\n  Merit promotion procedures provide an important career advancement \npath for Federal employees, and many nonentry-level jobs are filled \nusing this process. Yet, no matter how long an individual has served, \ntemporary seasonal employees never get access to merit promotion \nprocedures.\n  Now, who are those people? Those are men and women on the front line \nof wildfires in the West, who put their lives on the line to contain \nforest fires during the fire season out west--dangerous work, arduous \nwork. We are simply trying to give them a fair shake, a fair shake that \nis available to all other Federal employees. This was intended to put \nthem on an equal footing for vacant jobs in the civil service, \nincluding permanent seasonal jobs.\n  God knoweth why, but the Office of Personnel Management recently \nissued guidance to the agency, based on a narrow reading never intended \nby our committee or by this Congress, of the legislative language that \nwould actually limit the positions to which these temporary employees \nmay apply to just those within the current agency. That was never the \nintent of this Congress, and I, frankly, feel, if you looked at the \nlegislative history both in committee and on the floor, that would have \nbeen clear.\n  Our bill, which reflects a collaborative effort with the majority and \nminority, as well as with OPM and employee groups such as the National \nFederation of Federal Employees, clarifies the intent, I hope, once and \nfor all.\n  The barrier to merit promotion faced by our temporary seasonal \nemployees demoralizes the dedicated and courageous corps that serves in \nland management agencies, contributes to increased attrition, and \nultimately leads to higher training costs and a less-experienced, \ncapable workforce.\n  Last year, Mr. Speaker, a record 10 million acres burned across these \nUnited States, about 4 million more than average. In Arizona alone, 294 \nfires burned in the first quarter of this\n\n[[Page H3480]]\n\nyear, double that of the same period last year. Our country cannot \nafford to degrade its wildland firefighting and emergency response \ncapabilities.\n  An individual that successfully competes for a vacant permanent \nposition--we are not creating new ones--under the clarified intent of \nthis bill would, upon appointment, become a career-conditional \nemployee--unless the employee had otherwise completed service \nrequirements for career tenure--and acquire competitive status upon \nappointment.\n\n  H.R. 4906 defines land management agencies to include the Forest \nService, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Fish and \nWildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, and Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  The legislative fix will finally give temporary seasonal firefighters \nand other land management temporary seasonal employees the chance to \ncompete for vacant permanent positions, seasonal or full-time, under \nthe same merit promotion procedures available to other Federal \nemployees.\n  Last year, I stated that our bipartisan bill was consistent with \nOPM's support for the concept that ``long-term temporaries who have \ndemonstrated their abilities on the job should not have to compete with \nthe public for permanent vacancies.''\n  Despite their misinterpretation of H.R. 1531, the original land \nmanagement bill, I remain confident OPM still supports that sentiment.\n  In closing, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan \nLand Management Workforce Flexibility Act, ensuring that our Nation's \nhardworking, temporary, seasonal employees may compete to serve the \nAmerican people on a permanent basis, if they so choose. That will \nimprove government efficiency and effectiveness and, I believe, provide \na safety valve when it comes to the fire season out west. But it is \nsimply the right thing to do, in the final analysis, on behalf of this \ndedicated workforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4906.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright) on \nthe Oversight and Government Reform Committee for introducing H.R. \n4904, the Making Electronic Government Accountable By Yielding Tangible \nEfficiencies Act of 2016, or the MEGABYTE Act of 2016, to improve the \nFederal Government's management of software licenses. I am a proud \ncosponsor of this straightforward legislation.\n  Importantly, this bill is the House companion to Senator Cassidy's \nown MEGABYTE Act, S. 2340, and I am glad to see this proposal has found \nbipartisan support in both Chambers and has moved forward.\n  H.R. 4904 requires the Chief Information Officer for each Federal \nagency to maintain a software license inventory as well as analyze the \nuse of software to inform decisionmaking.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Government Accountability Office has expressed \nrepeated concerns on software license management and its costs. In \nfact, the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, listed IT software \nlicense management as a potential cost savings area on its 2015 \nduplication report. In our never-ending effort to cut waste, I agree \nwith the GAO that it believes implementing sound, comprehensive \nsoftware management policies has already achieved at least $250 million \nin savings to the Federal Government. But there is more work to be \ndone. There are other savings that the government could and should be \ncapturing.\n  A 2014 GAO report found that only 2 of 24 major agencies had \ncomprehensive software licensing policies in place. In fact, only 2 of \nthe 24 agencies had comprehensive license inventories. Agencies cannot \neffectively manage the software licenses they have if they don't know \nwhat they have in the first place.\n  Maintaining a thorough inventory is vital to ensure that agencies \nmake cost-effective decisions with respect to software licensing and \navoid duplicative measures.\n  The MEGABYTE Act will force agencies to focus on their software \nlicense policies and their inventories, leading to savings to the \nAmerican taxpayer. These are straightforward steps that should already \nbe happening, and this bill ensures that they will.\n\n[[Page H3481]]\n\n  This legislation is about responsible stewardship of the tax dollars \nof hardworking Americans. I thank my friend, Mr. Cartwright, and also \nSenator Cassidy for their collective work on the MEGABYTE Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to not only support this \nlegislation, but all legislation in our continued quest to cut waste in \ngovernment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4904, and I \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me first begin by thanking our chairman of the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for bringing \nthis bill forward for a vote. I also want to thank the gentleman from \nMaryland, Elijah Cummings, my friend and the ranking member; as well as \nthe other two lead cosponsors who are here, Congressman Will Hurd of \nTexas and Congressman Steve Russell of Oklahoma who just spoke for \ntheir support.\n  Additionally, I also want to join him in thanking Senator Bill \nCassidy--lately our colleague here in the House, but now over in the \nminor leagues--for his support and his authorship of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are always looking for ways to curb waste in the \nFederal Government, and sometimes it is surprising the places you find \nit. It is a changing world. Fifty years ago, nobody used the acronym \nIT, but now they do, and there is waste to be found in the IT \nprocurement mechanism.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends $82 billion a year on \ninformation technology. Right now, for the second year in a row, our \nGAO has identified IT software license management as a top priority in \nits annual duplication report. A duplication report is something that \nis really good at identifying waste because duplication means what it \nsays: you are duplicating purchases in the Federal Government.\n  Of the 24 major Federal agencies, as you just heard, only two have \nimplemented policies of comprehensive and clear management of software \nlicenses. It is like this: anybody in the private sector knows that \nwhen you go to buy a suite of software from a major vendor, they sell \nit in blocks with a price point. So you might buy a block of 25 copies \nof a particular brand of software even though your office only needs 19 \ncopies. That means you have six extra licenses left over.\n  The Federal Government buys software the same way. What we found is \nthey are not doing a good enough job of keeping track of the unused \nlicenses. This bill codifies current administration efforts to do \nthings like that to save the Federal taxpayers their tax dollars.\n  Right now none of the 24 agencies have fully implemented all of these \nindustry best practices recommended by the GAO, and that ends now with \nthis legislation.\n  The Making Electronic Government Accountable By Yielding Tangible \nEfficiencies Act, the MEGABYTE Act, is comprised of necessary reforms \nto the Federal Government's management of IT software licenses. In \nparticular, the MEGABYTE Act achieves cost savings by seven action \nitems:\n  Number one, it requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue \ndirectives requiring agencies to identify clear roles, \nresponsibilities, and central oversight authority for managing IT \nsoftware licenses;\n  Number two, it requires having agencies establish comprehensive \nrecords of software license spending and inventories of enterprise \nlicenses in the agency, as I just mentioned;\n  Number three, regularly track and efficiently and effectively utilize \nsoftware licenses to assist the executive agency in implementing \ndecisions throughout the software license management life cycle;\n  Number four, analyze software usage and other data to make cost-\neffective decisions in the purchase of software;\n  Number five, provide relevant training for software license \nmanagement;\n  Number six, establish broad objectives and targeted implementation \nstrategies of the software license management program of the agency;\n  And, finally, number seven, consider the software license management \nlife cycle phases, including the requisition, reception, deployment and \nmaintenance, retirement, and disposal phases in order to implement \neffective decisionmaking, again, in the purchase and handling of \nsoftware.\n  The GAO found that when implementing these oversight and management \npractices reflected in the MEGABYTE Act, a Federal agency--one Federal \nagency--saved 181 million tax dollars in a single year. Enacting \nMEGABYTE across the entire executive branch promises potentially \nyielding billions of savings to the American taxpayer footing the bill \nfor all of this.\n  Mr. Speaker, improving the management of agency contracts and \nlicensing for commercial software is critical to ensuring the \nprocurement process works effectively for both the Federal Government \nand industry that provides the software.\n  An obvious example of how effective software management could save \nnot only dollars and cents, but improve the lives of Americans is in \nthe health records of our servicemembers.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has held \nhearings on the failure by the Department of Defense and the Department \nof Veterans Affairs to implement a fully integrated electronic health \nrecord system for our Active Duty soldiers and our veterans. As early \nas 1998, DOD and VA began an effort to create health records that could \nwork together, with an initiative to create a joint system--an \nintegrated electronic health record system. But after nearly two \ndecades and spending over $560 million toward that effort, DOD and VA \nditched the plan and continued on with their separate systems.\n  Now, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who are making their \ntransition from DOD to VA health care are told to print out hard copies \nof their medical records and bring them to the VA. That is an enormous \nsum of money to have spent with absolutely nothing to show for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that the MEGABYTE Act is the first in a \nseries of steps we can take to minimize wasteful software spending and \nto promote efficient procurement of technology. Our software and \ntechnology must promote interoperability across multiple platforms--and \nthis starts with effective decisionmaking. By encouraging the use of \nopen standards that are technology neutral, we can encourage innovation \nwhen we create connected, interoperable components and systems, driving \ndown costs and avoiding unnecessary lock-in to any one particular \ntechnology platform.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipartisan and bicameral effort behind \nthis bill. I thank, again, our chairman, Jason Chaffetz, for advancing \nthe bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends more \nthan $80 billion a year on IT procurement, and 80 percent of that is on \nlegacy systems, old and outdated systems that all of us would think \nshould be gone. Every time I hear this stat, I get upset because it is \noutrageous. This is a waste of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars.\n  In 2015, the Office of Management and Budget noted that Federal \nagencies spent about $9 billion on software licenses alone. But guess \nwhat? Many agencies are not managing these software licenses properly. \nI know--nobody is surprised.\n  The Government Accountability Office did a report last year that \nexplained agencies could achieve hundreds of millions of dollars in \ngovernmentwide savings if they managed their software licenses better. \nAgencies should already have a comprehensive inventory of what software \nthey use. Agencies should already be utilizing their spending power to \nget good deals on software licenses. Agencies should already be getting \nrid of old software they don't use. But this isn't happening, so \nCongress is acting.\n  In 2015, Congress passed landmark IT reform legislation called \nFITARA, which gave agency CIOs greater authority over IT decisions and \nchanged the way that the Federal Government procures technology.\n  The MEGABYTE Act, H.R. 4904, builds upon the important work that\n\n[[Page H3482]]\n\nFITARA started. When enacted, this bill would require CIOs to develop \ncomprehensive inventories on their software license agreements. \nAdditionally, this measure would require agency CIOs to provide OMB \nwith annual reports on any realized savings, which OMB must make \npublicly available.\n  It is simple, it is straightforward, and it makes sense. IT \nprocurement is not a sexy topic. Nobody goes to a rally for IT \nprocurement. But getting this right will save money, and when we cut \nwaste, we allow hardworking Americans to keep more of their money in \ntheir own pockets.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his \nleadership on this issue, and I look forward to continuing our work \ntogether. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4904.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly.)\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Cartwright) especially for his leadership on this bill, the \nMEGABYTE Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, as has been indicated, we spend over $80 billion a year \non IT procurement across the Federal Government, 80 percent of which \nmaybe is used to maintain old and legacy systems, some of those systems \ngoing back to the 1960s. We are still funding COBOL, DOS, and many \nmultiple systems that aren't integrated and aren't interoperable.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  My friend, Mr. Cartwright, gave what I think is one of the most \nglaring examples of how, even when we move to update, because of the \nstovepipe nature of decisionmaking all too often in the Federal \nGovernment, bad decisions get made.\n  The Pentagon has one system for medical recordkeeping and the \nVeterans Administration has another. When one individual moves from \nActive Duty to retired status, they have to take their records with \nthem, physically, because the two systems, upgraded recently, are not \ncompatible. A third procurement contract had to be issued for the \nprivate sector to try to see if they could bridge these two systems, \nand the taxpayer had to pay a third time. Why couldn't we get that \nright the first time?\n  Making sure these investments serve the purpose for which they are \nintended is really critical. This act helps codify that.\n  My friend, Mr. Hurd from Texas, was gracious in bringing up the \nFITARA, the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, \nwhich I think sets the construct, the structure, for every Federal \nagency to modernize itself to improve efficiency, to streamline \nmanagement, and to make sure that these investments are efficacious.\n  The MEGABYTE Act is a wonderful complement to that when it comes to \nsoftware. I think it will help transform how the Federal Government \nprocures and manages its information technology portfolio. I urge its \npassage, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I urge my fellow Members of the United States House of \nRepresentatives to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4904, a commonsense, \nbipartisan, bicameral effort to save the American taxpayers money in \nthe purchase of software. It is our chance to nip this problem in the \nbud before it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It is an opportunity \nto save a whopping amount of money for the American taxpayer.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I also urge not only support and adoption of this bill, but I think \nit is crucial, as we continue to fight and combat waste in government, \nthat we look at measures that are so ripe and so effective, if we pass \nthem, that they will have an immediate impact on tax dollars that are \nwasted. Here we have a measure that literally will save billions of \ndollars in the very short term. It is very, very important that we pass \nit. I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4904.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Nevada?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 1815, the Eastern Nevada Land Implementation Improvement Act, \nwhich I introduced last year, makes several changes to the existing \nFederal land laws. The bill authorizes hazardous fuels reduction \nprojects and wildfire planning for rangeland and woodland restoration \nprojects in Lincoln County, Nevada. These projects will help reduce the \nrisk of catastrophic wildfire and improve and protect habitat for the \ngreater sage-grouse.\n  The bill also authorizes the implementation of a conservation plan in \nNevada's Virgin River region. In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService required the city of Mesquite to create a conservation plan to \nprotect several species in the Lower Virgin River Basin before moving \nahead with two land acquisitions. The city planned to use these funds \nfrom the Mesquite Lands Act, a law passed by Congress in 1986 that \nallowed the city to acquire and develop lands from the Federal \nGovernment, to complete the plan. FWS signed a memorandum of agreement \nwith the city of Mesquite to carry out the law.\n  This agreement expired in 2014. The Fish and Wildlife Service refused \nto sign a new memorandum of agreement or to allow the city to access \nthe necessary funding because it didn't feel that the current \nlegislation enabled them to implement the conservation plan. As a \nresult, all efforts to advance the conservation plan and expand the \ncity are at a standstill.\n  This bill remedies the problem by making a technical correction to \nthe Mesquite Lands Act of 1988 that will provide the necessary \nauthority to the Fish and Wildlife Service to implement the \nconservation plan, after signing the new agreement with the city of \nMesquite.\n  Lastly, the bill makes several boundary adjustments that collectively \nreduce three wilderness areas to improve public access to the Big \nCanyon Trailhead, provide land to the existing Girl Scouts camp, and \nrelease a small dam owned and operated by the Yamba Tribe.\n  It is important to know that all of the money that would be spent to \nexecute these programs in this bill would come from special accounts \nthat already exist. Not a single taxpayer dollar would go to pay for \nthis bill. These special accounts are funded by the proceeds of the \nFederal land sales in Nevada and, in total, have a balance of $270 \nmillion in unobligated funds. The $2 million predicted to be used for \nthe purposes in H.R. 1815--protecting communities from catastrophic \nwildfires by reducing hazardous fuels and implementing a habitat \nconservation plan--would come directly from those accounts at no cost \nto the taxpayer.\n  This is a well-balanced, bipartisan piece of legislation that will \nreduce wildland fire threat and greatly benefit local communities, \nwildlife and its habitat, and the future management of public lands in \nNevada.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1815.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 1815 clarifies and updates several laws related to the \nmanagement of Federal land in eastern Nevada. This bill is cosponsored \nby the entire Nevada delegation, and I recognize its passage is \nimportant to the people of eastern Nevada.\n  I want to thank the majority and the sponsor for working with the \nBureau of Land Management to address many of their concerns. Resolving \nthose concerns and working with the BLM turn\n\n[[Page H3484]]\n\nthis bill into a proposal we can support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of \nthis legislation also.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1815, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Nevada?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 87, introduced by Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, \nexpands the boundaries of the Shiloh National Military Park and \ndesignates the Parker's Crossroads Battlefield as an affiliated area of \nthe National Park System. Located in Corinth, Mississippi, the Battle \nof Shiloh was a flash point in the Western theater during the Civil \nWar.\n  This bill would preserve three critical battlefields, covering \napproximately 2,126 acres, associated with the Siege of Corinth, \nincluding the Fallen Timbers, Russell House, and Davis Bridge \nBattlefields. The National Park Service determined that each of these \nsites provides extensive opportunities for visitor use and \ninterpretation or the potential for archeological research.\n  This bill passed out of committee by unanimous consent. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  By expanding the boundaries of the Shiloh National Military Park in \nthe State of Tennessee, H.R. 87 will assist the National Park Service \nin its efforts to preserve and interpret resources associated with the \nCivil War.\n  The bill adjusts the boundary of the park to include several sites \nidentified in the 2004 boundary expansion study conducted by the \nNational Park Service. This bill also establishes the Parker's \nCrossroads Battlefield as an associated area of the National Park \nSystem, providing even broader opportunities to interpret the Civil War \nstory.\n  Associated sites, such as Parker's Crossroads Battlefield, continue \nto highlight the value of State and local partnerships in the \npreservation of our national heritage. By incorporating three \nadditional sites related to the Siege of Corinth into the park and \nunder the management of the National Park Service, this bill guarantees \nthe lasting conservation of these places of knowledge and remembrance.\n  The emphasis that we all need to place on preserving our country's \nhistory cannot be overstated, and the Civil War is a chapter in our \nnational story that continues to shape the thoughts and actions of this \ncountry over 150 years after its conclusion.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  The struggles and personal conflicts that were faced by millions of \nsoldiers and the impact on families throughout and after the war have \nprovided us with many lessons--lessons that continue to remain relevant \ntoday. We can only ensure that we continue to learn from past \nstruggles, triumphs, and mistakes if we make the effort to set aside \nspecial places for future generations.\n  Parks, such as Shiloh National Military Park, offer countless \nopportunities for us to explore the rich history and lessons of the \npast. These opportunities are most effective when visitors to these \nsites can immerse themselves in the full setting of the area and gain a \ntrue understanding of the historical context, which is something that \nthis expansion of the Shiloh National Military Park will achieve.\n  I thank Representative Blackburn for her hard work and commitment to \nprotecting the historical resources in her State, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank my colleagues for the work that they have \ndone on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, they have each mentioned the public-private partnership\n\n[[Page H3485]]\n\nthat has taken place in Tennessee and Mississippi and at the Shiloh \nNational Military Park. I think it is so significant that we have seen \nour local elected officials work with our State and Federal officials.\n  I do have to commend the employees of the National Park Service who \nhave done a phenomenal job as they have worked toward the preservation \nof these entities, as Mr. Clay said so very well, and who have looked \nat how we adjust the boundaries, expand the boundaries, and then \npreserve these areas. It is a part of the historical legacy, as has \nbeen said, not only of Tennessee's and Mississippi's, but of the United \nStates'.\n  Indeed, over a half million visitors a year come to the Shiloh \nNational Military Park. This will give the National Park Service the \nflexibility that it needs to look at adding in the additional 2,100 \nacres into this park. It would encompass the Fallen Timbers, the \nRussell House, and the Davis Bridge battlefields, and would provide \nthat consideration for Parker's Crossroads. As I said, it is an \nimportant part of the National Park Service.\n  This legislation is the product of work from our local, State, and \nFederal officials and from the community groups and organizations that \nsupport this.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. CLAY.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2733, the Nevada Native Nations Land Act.\n  I commend my colleague from Nevada (Mr. Amodei), the sponsor of this \nbill, for his tireless work on this important piece of legislation. \nBecause he will speak further on the details that affect his district, \nI will provide a brief summary of the bill.\n  H.R. 2733, as amended, would require the Secretary of the Interior to \nplace, approximately, 71,000 acres of Federal land into trust for six \ntribes in the State of Nevada. Gaming would be prohibited on these \nlands.\n  Located in my district, the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe would have, \napproximately, 31,000 acres of land placed into trust by the Secretary \nof the Interior. The tribe intends to utilize these lands for economic \ndevelopment and community growth. Specifically, the additional lands \nwill allow the tribe to expand agricultural operations, additional \nhousing and facilities development, and to protect cultural sites and \nwildlife.\n  Over 85 percent of the land that is located in Nevada is federally \ncontrolled, and tribes continue to have a small land base. This bill is \nan important step in promoting economic activity that will generate \njobs in the tribal communities, benefitting both reservation economies.\n  I thank Mr. Amodei for his efforts in getting this legislation to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The six Nevada tribes that are affected by this legislation want to \nexpand their reservations for a variety of purposes, including for \nrecreational use, residential construction, and energy and mineral \ndevelopment. H.R. 2733 will allow the tribes to pursue these goals. By \npassing this bill, they will be able to preserve their cultural \nheritage and traditions, expand housing for their members, and realize \nnew economic development opportunities.\n  The final legislation is the result of years of negotiations between \nthe tribes, the Federal Government, the State of Nevada, and local \nstakeholders.\n  I commend my colleague from Nevada (Mr. Amodei) for his work on \nbehalf of the Nevada tribes and on this legislation. I urge its quick \nadoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Amodei).\n  Mr. AMODEI. I thank my colleague from the Silver State and my \ncolleague from the Show Me State. I appreciate the background.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the return of a bill that was passed in the \n114th Congress by a voice vote in the House of Representatives. It went \nto the Senate. I can't tell you what happened there, but the good news \nis that the 114th Congress, the Senate, has moved on a companion bill; \nso we might actually get some resolution of this.\n  I note that my colleague from the Show Me State mentioned patience \nand hard work. I want to point out that, for the folks of the Fort \nMcDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe, the 19,000-acre transfer that is \nproposed in this piece of legislation was first before the United \nStates Congress in a bill that was introduced in 1972 by then-Nevada \nSenators Alan Bible and Howard Cannon. Certainly, that tribe gets the \n``patience'' award in terms of waiting to fill in what is largely \ncheckerboard-type holdings to consolidate their holdings in the whole \nthing.\n  As a whole, about 31,000 acres are in my colleague's CD4 district, \nand 40,000 acres are in the rest of CD2. There is a variety of things \nto provide housing to attract healthcare facility givers and cultural \nresource preservation buffer zones. It has been through the planning \nprocess in those counties in which it is. Many off-road vehicle \norganizations support this. It can hardly be said to have been sprung \non anybody.\n  I urge my colleagues' support.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Nevada?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 3070, which was introduced by my colleague, Congressman Lee \nZeldin of New York, aims to eliminate Federal regulatory confusion \naround the Block Island Sound. His bill authorizes the Secretary of \nCommerce to permit striped bass fishing in the Block Island Transit \nZone between Montauk, New York, and Point Judith, Rhode Island.\n  The bill before us today is the result of extensive input from area \nstakeholders and congressional deliberation. Following a Natural \nResources Committee's oversight field hearing and a subsequent \nlegislative hearing, the bill has been amended to resolve any concerns \nabout the unintended impacts of other federally permitted activities. \nAs such, the Natural Resources Committee passed this bill earlier this \nyear by unanimous consent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I commend Mr. Zeldin \nfor his leadership on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As introduced, H.R. 3070 would have had sweeping negative impacts. It \nwould have redrawn the boundary of the exclusive economic zone in an \narea between Montauk Point, New York,\n\n[[Page H3487]]\n\nand Block Island, Rhode Island, allowing for the State management of \nfishery resources that are currently managed by the Federal Government. \nIt would have barred Connecticut fishermen from using the area at all, \nand it would have eliminated a key sanctuary for striped bass at the \nvery time the species needs stronger conservation measures.\n  Fortunately, the Natural Resources Committee was able to address \nthose flaws at markup and is able to bring forward a bill today that \ndoes not have any unintended consequences. The current version of H.R. \n3070 simply clarifies that the Secretary of Commerce has the authority \nto issue regulations that govern recreational fishing for striped bass \nin the Block Island Transit Zone. This area is currently closed to \nstriped bass fishing, and I join the vast majority of recreational \nanglers in the region in urging fisheries' managers to keep it that \nway.\n  That said, we do support the bill before us today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin).\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I thank Mr. Hardy and Mr. Clay for their comments and for \ntheir support of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3070, the EEZ Transit \nZone Clarification and Access Act, which would clarify the Federal laws \nthat govern the management of the striped bass fishery in the exclusive \neconomic zone, or the EEZ, between Montauk, New York, and Block Island, \nRhode Island.\n  One of the most pressing issues that is faced by Long Island \nfishermen is the urgent need to clarify the Federal regulations \nregarding striped bass fishing in the small area of federally \ncontrolled waters between Montauk Point and Block Island.\n  Between New York State waters, which end 3 miles off of Montauk \nPoint, and the Rhode Island boundary, which begins 3 miles off of Block \nIsland, there is a small area of federally controlled water that is \nconsidered part of the EEZ. The EEZ, which extends up to 200 miles from \nthe coast, are waters that are patrolled by the Coast Guard, where the \nUnited States has exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries and other \nnatural resources. Since 1990, striped bass fishing has been banned in \nthe EEZ even though fishermen can currently fish for striped bass in \nadjacent State waters.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Fishing is an industry in and around my district. It is getting more \nand more difficult to survive in this industry if you are a \nbusinessowner. Fishermen are desperately pleading for commonsense \nrelief, and this is one way Congress can help.\n  To my colleagues in this Chamber, I ask you to vote in favor of this \nbill, passing this legislation on behalf of the amazing fishermen on \nthe east end of Long Island.\n  Long Island striped bass fisherman have lost 60 percent of their \ntraditional fishing grounds due to Federal restrictions that my bill \nintends to reform. Additionally, the geography of our region means that \nmaking the 15-mile journey by boat from Montauk Point to Block Island \nrequires passing through a small strip of waters considered to be part \nof the EEZ. The shift in jurisdiction can mean the difference between a \nnice day on the water and committing a Federal offense.\n  My bill, H.R. 3070, clarifies the Federal laws currently governing \nthe management of the striped bass fishery between Montauk and Block \nIsland, permitting striped bass fishing in these waters and allowing \nfor local regulations to manage this important fishery.\n  This legislation is a commonsense reform that offers a simple \nsolution to a unique local issue, providing regulatory relief and more \ncertainty to our region's fishermen, while restoring local control to a \ncritical fishery that must be properly managed and preserved for future \ngenerations.\n  Late last year, on December 7, 2015, I cohosted a House Natural \nResources Committee field hearing within my district in Riverhead, New \nYork, with Chairman Rob Bishop of Utah. The hearing was held to discuss \nimportant local fishing issues, including this legislation. Chairman \nBishop and members of the committee were able to hear firsthand the \nconcerns of those on Long Island who rely upon fishing as an occupation \nand way of life. A few months later, on March 17, 2016, working closely \nwith the committee, my bill passed this committee with unanimous \nbipartisan support.\n  I thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for having the bill \nplaced on today's agenda on the House floor. A big thank you to House \nNatural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop; Subcommittee on Water, \nPower and Oceans Chairman John Fleming; and Subcommittee on Water, \nPower and Oceans Vice Chairman Paul Gosar for recognizing the urgency \nin passing this bill. I also thank Congressman Joe Courtney, my \ncolleague across Long Island Sound, who worked with us to make this a \nbipartisan bill.\n  I also commend the steadfast commitment and activism of Long Island's \nfishing community, which championed this issue for nearly two decades \nand is standing up for Long Island's coastal way of life. The dedicated \nmen and women who fish in these local waters and the tens of thousands \nof Long Islanders who depend upon the coastal economy of the east end \ndeserve no less than this commonsense reform promoted by this proposal.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in support of this critical \nbill.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge the \nbody to adopt H.R. 3070.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nany extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Nevada?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 3826, the Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification \nAct, was introduced by Congressmen Greg Walden and Earl Blumenauer to \naddress the ongoing land exchange issues.\n  In 2009, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act authorized a land \nexchange in Government Camp, Oregon. This land exchange was supposed to \nbe completed within 16 months; however, this still has not occurred \nmore than 7 years later. The long delay, primarily due to disagreements \nsurrounding easement terms, has frustrated local communities such as \nMount Hood Meadows and other local groups.\n  H.R. 3826 comes as a result of a successful mediation session held by \nthe Forest Service to resolve the longstanding issues between the \nagency and the local community. As a result of this exercise, H.R. 3826 \nupdates the details and process for the land exchange to clarify issues \nrelating to land appraisals and the parameters of a wetland \nconservation easement on the Federal land in the conveyance.\n  The bill was amended in committee to address concerns raised by the \nForest Service, including clarifying language for the easement allowed \nin the bill and the length of time allowed for the Forest Service to \nimplement this legislation. It is frustrating that the Forest Service \nhas not already carried out the provisions of the 2009 act. I \nappreciate Congressman Walden's work to see this issue is addressed \nonce and for all.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 3826 clarifies the terms of a land exchange between the Forest \nService and Mount Hood Meadows, a privately held ski resort. Last year, \nthe Forest Service and Mount Hood Meadows engaged in mediation to \nresolve the issues that have held up the exchange. This bill is the \nresult of that mediation, and its passage will ensure that, after 6 \nlong years, the exchange will finally move forward.\n  I want to thank the sponsors from Oregon, Representative Walden and \nRepresentative Blumenauer, for their hard work and commitment to \nresolving this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Walden).\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clay and Mr. Hardy for their \nwork and support of this very important legislation. I thank Mr. \nGrijalva and Chairman Bishop for bringing this bill to the floor, yet \nanother Mount Hood bill.\n  My colleague and friend from Oregon, Earl Blumenauer, and I actually \nbackpacked 3 nights, 4 days around Mount Hood, 9,000 feet up and down, \nelevation gain and loss. We hiked with environmentalists, foresters, \nornithologists, biologists, and geologists.\n  We put together a big bipartisan legislative effort. It took 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. Part of this effort was making sure that a very sensitive part \naround Mount Hood in the Crystal Springs watershed was exchanged out so \nthat the development didn't occur there and it occurred in an area that \nalready has development, a more appropriate setting. That is what this \nis really all about.\n  The legislation that ultimately passed the Congress was a little \ndifferent than what Representative Blumenauer and I started with \nbecause we feared this very result could happen, that it would be \ndelayed for years and years and years because we have seen it happen \nbefore. Be that as it may, we are here today, 7 years later, after the \nCongress had told the agency to get this done in 16 months, which \nshould be all the time that is necessary. Seven years later, we are \nback with a second piece of legislation, confirming the mediation, \nworking this through so that we can get this exchange done \nthoughtfully, completely, and finally get this done.\n  I see I am joined by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who \nhas been a real partner in this.\n  The legislation directs the Forest Service to move ahead on \nimplementing the underlying exchange. This is critical as it protects \nthe Crystal Springs area, the water source for much of Hood River and \nthe rest of the upper Hood River Valley as well. So it really does \nprovide a much more thoughtful place where Mount Hood Meadows does \ntheir development and protects this very sensitive watershed from \ndevelopment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when it comes up for \na vote. Let's get this done once and for all.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon \n(Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I want to pick up where my friend, the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), left off.\n  Congressman Walden and I worked for several years to try and deal \nwith the preservation of a precious resource. Mount Hood is the \ndividing line between our two districts. We have a lot of personal \nhistory involved there, and it was really one of my most positive \nexperiences in two decades of congressional service, zeroing in with \nthe stakeholders--Native Americans, environmentalists, local \ngovernment--trying to figure out the best protections for a very \ncomplicated area that is within easy driving distance of 4 million \npeople. There were many strains and stresses and multiple stakeholders \non the mountain itself.\n  As he said, part of the delicate balance that was achieved was an \nopportunity for us to deal with this land exchange. It was a win-win \nsituation for a variety of the stakeholders. It obviously is better for \nthe environment. It settled long-simmering disputes that served \nnobody's interest but had actual potential for negative outcomes.\n\n[[Page H3489]]\n\n  This land exchange was part of what was envisioned. This was not just \na bipartisan effort with my friend, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nWalden), and myself. It was then Senator Smith and Senator Wyden, and \nnow Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden have been partners in this. It is \nfrustrating that we get to the point where it requires legislation to \ndo something that was an integral part of this agreement.\n  I am proud to join my friend in urging support for it. We want to get \nthis passed and be able to capitalize on the vision that we worked so \nhard on to protect the mountain and all of the attendant interests. \nThis land exchange is critical to it, and I am pleased that this \nlegislation is finally on the floor, although I am frustrated that we \nhave to have legislation on the floor. Hopefully, this will enable us \nto finish this task.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3826, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nany extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Nevada?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2009, which would authorize a land \nexchange involving the Pacific Yaqui Tribe, the Tucson Unified School \nDistrict, and the Department of the Interior. Specifically, the bill \nwould require the Secretary of the Interior to place 40 acres of \nadjacent public land into trust for the tribe upon conveyance to the \nUnited States from the Tucson Unified School District.\n  According to the tribe, acquiring these lands will help with \nreservation access and prevent or control flooding during significant \nrain events. According to the tribe, heavy rain events occur frequently \nduring Tucson's monsoon season.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  The bill would also require the conveyance of a 13-acre parcel of \npublic land to the Tucson Unified School District and eliminate a \nrevisionary interest held by the United States in a 27-acre parcel \npreviously patented to the Tucson Unified School District under\n\n[[Page H3490]]\n\nthe Recreation and Public Purposes Act. The bill would also require the \nTucson Unified School District to pay fair market value for the land \nand the revisionary interest received.\n  I want to thank the ranking member from the Committee on Natural \nResources for his efforts on the legislation and urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGrijalva), the sponsor and my good friend, and commend him for bringing \nthis legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Missouri \nfor his support of the legislation.\n  As we heard, H.R. 2009 is the culmination of a longstanding land \nagreement between Tucson Unified School District, TUSD, and the Pascua \nYaqui Tribe.\n  Last Congress we finalized the first part of the agreement with the \npassage and signing of H.R. 507, which conveyed two 10-acre parcels to \nthe tribe. Passage of this bill will complete the second part of the \nagreement to the mutual benefit of both parties involved as well as the \nsurrounding communities.\n  The 40-acre parcel of land referenced in the bill is currently deeded \nto TUSD under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, but TUSD has no \nintention of using the land for the stated purpose. Instead, the tribe \nwill be able to utilize the parcel to construct flood control measures \nto protect the reservation and surrounding communities from flash \nflooding during Arizona monsoon season.\n  Additionally, the land conveyed to TUSD will allow the district to \nbetter plan for future expansion and best use scenarios without the \nencumbrances encountered under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act.\n  I would like to note that the tribe and TUSD have had, and continue \nto have, a great working relationship, especially when it comes to the \nland use decisions around the Pascua Yaqui reservation. This bill is a \ndirect result of that relationship and was negotiated with input from \nall parties involved and with an eye to the most effective use of the \nparcels.\n  In closing, let me take the time to thank Chairman Young and Ranking \nMember Ruiz for their work on the legislation in the subcommittee; and, \nof course, a special thanks to Chairman Bishop for working with me to \nbring it to the floor today. I urge adoption of the legislation.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform my colleague I have no \nfurther speakers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Ranking Member Grijalva \nfor bringing forward this legislation. I urge its quick adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time also.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate a very dear \nfriend, Lauren Morris Schulman, on her retirement. For the past 13 \nyears, I have had the pleasure of working closely with Lauren on some \nof the most pressing issues regarding the U.S.-Israel relationship.\n  Serving as AIPAC's Florida political director, Lauren has played a \nkey role in building a stronger U.S. alliance with our closest ally, \nthe democratic Jewish State of Israel. Lauren has been a lifelong \npublic servant in having previously worked as a staffer in Congress for \nthe late E. Clay Shaw, Jr., and she also served at the county and State \nlevels in Florida.\n  \n\n  Lauren has a wealth of knowledge and experience that will surely be \nmissed by all who have had the pleasure to work with her; but I am \ncertain that Lauren is looking forward to this\n\n[[Page H3494]]\n\nexciting next chapter in her life and will enjoy spending more time \nwith her husband, Cliff, and their children, Jake and Samantha.\n  I wish my good friend Lauren Schulman the best of luck, and I \ncongratulate her on her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3494-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE FORT HOOD, TEXAS, NINE\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Texas has been hammered by historic \ntorrential rain and flooding.\n  As the Texas floodwaters rose, 12 soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas, \nwere crossing Owl Creek in a 2\\1/2\\-ton Light Medium Tactical Vehicle \nwhen it became stuck in the Owl Creek low water crossing. Suddenly, the \nvehicle was swept over and sent downstream by fast-moving water. Nine \nAmerican soldiers drowned in the massive flood waters. Today, we \nremember them, and here they are:\n  Staff Sergeant Miguel Colon Vazquez, 38, from New York. He had just \nspent four tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan;\n  Specialist Christine Armstrong, 27, of California;\n  PFC Brandon Banner, 22, of Florida;\n  PFC Zachery Fuller, 23, of Florida;\n  Private Isaac Deleon, 19, of Texas. He was the youngest of all of \nthem. He had only been in the Army for 17 months;\n  Private Eddy Rae'Laurin Gates, 20, of North Carolina--a former \nhomecoming queen;\n  Private Tysheena James, 21, of New Jersey;\n  West Point cadet Mitchell Winey, 21, of Indiana;\n  Specialist Yingming Sun, 25, of California.\n  These are the nine who drowned recently in the Texas floods. The \nsoldiers were members of the 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery \nRegiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Cavalry Division. \nThese American soldiers were volunteers who swore to protect the United \nStates. They were a cut above the rest and were ready to defend freedom \nat home and abroad. Their lives were ripped from this world and their \nfamilies all too soon.\n  We are grateful for them and their families for their service and \ntheir sacrifices. These soldiers are the best of America. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with the soldiers and their families, who have been \ndevastated by the floods of Texas this spring.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3494-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARIEL GRACE'S LAW\n\n  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago tomorrow, Ariel Grace's life \nended before it had a chance to begin--killed by the failure of the \nunsafe medical device, Essure. Despite her tragic passing, there \nremains no legal recourse to seek justice. That is why, on the 1-year \nanniversary of her death, I will introduce Ariel Grace's Law in order \nto resolve the broken law that prevents the families of Ariel Grace and \nthousands of others to have their voices heard in court.\n  At the same time, I will offer legislation to reform the flawed FDA \nprocess that allowed another dangerous device--a laparoscopic power \nmorcellator--to spread deadly cancer throughout the bodies of women \nlike shrapnel. Despite case after case, no one reported the harm to the \nFDA--not even their own doctors.

On the other hand, the Fish and Wildlife \nService plans to spend as much as $150 million in buying water to \ndrastically increase Shasta releases to the delta, allegedly to protect \ndelta smelt--dumping water in the middle of this year.\n  That is right, Mr. Speaker. Federal agencies are simultaneously \ndemanding that more water be released from reservoirs, not for human \nuse, and that more water be kept in the reservoirs but not for human \nuse.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, as you know, we have had some interesting \ndiscussions here on the floor in recent days about transgender as a \ntopic and as individuals of interest. In having talked a couple of \ntimes with one man who had been through a sex change operation, what he \ntold me was--really, the best expert in the world on the issue of \ntransgender is the former head of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, now a \nretired diplomat, but he speaks for himself.\n  Anyway, there was an article published back in 2014 that Dr. Paul \nMcHugh had updated and that has been republished in the Wall Street \nJournal on May 13, 2016. It is entitled ``Transgender Surgery Isn't the \nSolution: A drastic physical change doesn't address underlying \npsychosocial troubles.''\n  Since there are so many people who have opined on this subject who \nhave not dealt seriously with the issue, it seemed like it would be \nhelpful to read from this article that was written by what one \ntransgender explained was a great article by whom he thought was the \nworld's leading expert on transgender issues.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  But Dr. Paul McHugh, who obviously is a brilliant man and obviously a \nman who cares very deeply about individuals, especially those who have \ntransgender as an issue, says:\n  ``The government and media alliance advancing the transgender cause \nhas gone into overdrive in recent weeks. On May 30, a U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services review board ruled that Medicare can pay \nfor the `reassignment' surgery sought by the transgendered--those who \nsay that they don't identify with their biological sex. Earlier last \nmonth Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that he was `open' to lifting \na ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. Time \nmagazine, seeing the trend, ran a cover story for its June 9 issue \ncalled `The Transgender Tipping Point: America's next civil rights \nfrontier.'\n  ``Yet policymakers and the media are doing no favors either to the \npublic or the transgendered by treating their confusions as a right in \nneed of defending rather than as a mental disorder that deserves \nunderstanding, treatment, and prevention. This intensely felt sense of \nbeing transgendered constitutes a mental disorder in two respects. The \nfirst is that the idea of sex misalignment is simply mistaken--it does \nnot correspond with physical reality. The second is that it can lead to \ngrim psychological outcomes.''\n  Let me insert parenthetically here into Dr. McHugh's article, having \ntalked to him twice in the last couple of weeks. He was aware--and he \npointed out that the DSM-V, the latest Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, evolves over time in line \nwith the new scientific training and information available. It renames, \nas required, as they believe is appropriate, different conditions that \nmay be diagnosed in accepted diagnoses. In the fifth edition of the \nDSM, it has gone from calling transgender a mental disorder to calling \nit a dysphoria, a gender dysphoria.\n  Dysphoria basically is the opposite--it is an antonym of euphoria, \nand it basically means that someone is generally dissatisfied with \ntheir biological sex. And Dr. McHugh said that he thinks that \n``dysphoria'' probably is a better word than ``disorder'' because it \nmakes clearer what the situation is. It is someone who is generally not \nsatisfied with their biological sex.\n  His article goes on, though, and says:\n  ``The transgendered suffer a disorder of `assumption' like those in \nother disorders familiar to psychiatrists. With the transgendered, the \ndisordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems \ngiven in nature--namely one's maleness or femaleness. Other kinds of \ndisordered assumptions are held by those who suffer from anorexia and \nbulimia nervosa, where the assumption that departs from physical \nreality is the belief by the dangerously thin that they are \noverweight.''\n  Dr. McHugh goes on and says:\n  ``With body dysmorphic disorder, an often socially crippling \ncondition, the individual is consumed by the assumption `I'm ugly.' \nThese disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of \ntheir psycho-social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can \nchange the way that they appear to others. Such ideas work like ruling \npassions in their subjects' mind and tend to be accompanied by a \nsolipsistic argument.''\n  Dr. McHugh goes on:\n  ``For the transgendered, this argument holds that one's feeling of \n`gender' is a conscious, subjective sense that, being in one's mind, \ncannot be questioned by others. The individual often seeks not just \nsociety's tolerance of this `personal truth' but affirmation of it. \nHere rests the support for `transgender equality,' the demands for \ngovernment payment for medical and surgical treatments, and for access \nto all sex-based public roles and privileges.''\n  Dr. McHugh makes really important points as he goes forward:\n  ``With this argument, advocates for the transgendered have persuaded \nseveral states--including California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts--to \npass laws barring psychiatrists, even with parental permission, from \nstriving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor. \nThat government can intrude into parents' rights to seek help in \nguiding their children indicates how powerful these advocates have \nbecome.''\n  He goes on:\n  ``How to respond? Psychiatrists obviously must challenge the \nsolipsistic concept that what is in the mind cannot be questioned. \nDisorders of consciousness, after all, represent psychiatry's domain; \ndeclaring them off-limits would eliminate the field.''\n  We are talking about psychiatry.\n  Dr. McHugh says:\n  ``Many will recall how, in the 1990s, an accusation of parental sex \nabuse of children was deemed unquestionable by the solipsists of the \n`recovered memory' craze.''\n  Dr. McHugh goes on and says:\n  ``You won't hear it from those championing transgender equality, but \ncontrolled and follow-up studies reveal fundamental problems with this \nmovement. When children who reported transgender feelings were tracked \nwithout medical or surgical treatment at both Vanderbilt University and \nLondon's Portman Clinic, 70%-80% of them spontaneously lost those \nfeelings. Some 25% did have persisting feelings; what differentiates \nthose individuals remains to be discerned.''\n  As he pointed out on the air about 10 days ago, we all can recall \ngirls we grew up with that were considered tomboys, who later grew up \nto be quite beautiful and quite feminine. They didn't need any liberals \nrushing in and forcing them to go in the boy's restroom because they \nidentified more with what boys were doing.\n  But Dr. McHugh goes on in his article, and he says:\n  ``We at Johns Hopkins University--which in the 1960s was the first \nAmerican medical center to venture into `sex-reassignment surgery'--\nlaunched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered \npeople who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not.''\n  I will insert parenthetically that I remember reading that Johns \nHopkins medical center had been the first hospital in the United States \nto begin doing sex change operations back in the '60s. I remembered \nreading that. I never remembered reading that they ever stopped.\n  But Dr. McHugh's article points out--and I am going back and reading \nfrom the article:\n  ``Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as \n`satisfied' by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social \nadjustments were no better than those who didn't have\n\n[[Page H3496]]\n\nthe surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex-reassignment \nsurgery, since producing a `satisfied' but still troubled patient \nseemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.\n  ``It now appears that our long-ago decision was a wise one.''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, I never remembered reading anywhere and I don't \nrecall articles talking about how Johns Hopkins said, look, we are \nhaving no better mental, emotional results from those who have had the \nsurgery, so we are going to stop doing the surgery. This was Johns \nHopkins; they were on the cutting edge of trying to advance gender \nchange or sex change operations. They were doing those originally.\n  This forward-looking, people-caring institution at Johns Hopkins \nmedical center decided years ago that we may be doing more harm than \ngood and we are going to stop doing sex change surgery. So no one can \naccuse them of trying to make more money--because obviously they would \nmake money from the sex change operations--and not make money from \nstopping the sex change operations. But apparently those in charge at \nJohns Hopkins took rather serious the idea that doctors should first do \nno harm.\n  He goes on and points out in his article:\n  ``A 2011 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced the \nmost illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered, evidence \nthat should give advocates pause. The long-term study--up to 30 years--\nfollowed 324 people''--so they have got hundreds in their database here \nand are following for 30 years--``who had sex-reassignment surgery. The \nstudy revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, \nthe transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. \nMost shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the \ncomparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet \nno explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation \nreported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide \nrate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.''\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I know there are people on the floor that are \npushing for civil rights equality for the transgender and to let them \ngo into whatever restrooms they feel like represents the gender they \nare at that particular time, but the studies have shown that when \nsomeone has a general dissatisfaction with their biological sex, that \ndoing the surgery to make them that sex gives them 20 times more \nlikelihood of committing suicide.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  I know there is nobody on the other side of the aisle who has been \npushing this issue that wants people to commit suicide at 20 times the \nrate of nontransgendered people, but this is where this ultimately \ngoes.\n  I don't believe our President wants people to commit suicide at 20 \ntimes the rate of nontransgendered people, yet what he is urging right \nnow, the best studies in the world indicate will be the outcome. What \nthis President is doing in pushing people who at one point in their \nlives have a general dissatisfaction, or dysphoria, with their \nbiological sex is causing more damage for these individuals down the \nroad than he will be around to do anything about. It is not enough to \nsay, ``I care more than you do for those who want men to go in girls \ndressing rooms and bathrooms'' when you are doing the kind of harm that \nthe best studies in the world are showing has been done.\n  Back to Dr. McHugh's article, he says: ``There are subgroups of the \ntransgendered, and for none does `reassignment' seem apt. One group \nincludes male prisoners like Pvt. Bradley Manning, the convicted \nnational-security leaker who now wishes to be called Chelsea. Facing \nlong sentences and the rigors of a men's prison, they have an obvious \nmotive for wanting to change their sex and hence their prison. Given \nthat they committed their crimes as males, they should be punished as \nsuch; after serving their time, they will then be free to reconsider \ntheir gender.\n  ``Another subgroup consists of young men and women susceptible to \nsuggestion from `everything is normal' sex education, amplified by \nInternet chat groups. These are the transgender subjects most like \nanorexia nervosa patients: they become persuaded that seeking a drastic \nphysical change will banish their psycho-social problems. `Diversity' \ncounselors in their schools, rather like cult leaders, may encourage \nthese young people to distance themselves from their families and offer \nadvice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery. \nTreatments here must begin with removing the young person from the \nsuggestive environment and offering a counter-message in family \ntherapy.''\n  That is not me. That is what one transgendered gentleman who has had \nthe sex change operation and knows more about transgender than any M.D. \nin the world, Dr. Paul McHugh. Now, Dr. McHugh, when I talked to him, \nsaid he thinks there are some others who know more, but they support \nhis positions on what he is saying, which helped him come to these \npositions.\n  But Dr. McHugh goes on: ``Then there is the subgroup of very young, \noften prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the \nculture and, exploring how they fit in, begin imitating the opposite \nsex. Misguided doctors at medical centers including Boston's Children's \nHospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering \npuberty-delaying hormones to render later sex change surgeries less \nonerous--even though the drugs stunt the children's growth and risk \ncausing sterility. Given that close to 80 percent of such children \nwould abandon their confusion and grow naturally into an adult life if \nuntreated, these medical interventions come close to child abuse. A \nbetter way to help these children: with devoted parenting.''\n  This psychiatrist says: ``At the heart of the problem is confusion \nover the nature of the transgendered. `Sex change' is biologically \nimpossible. People who undergo sex reassignment surgery do not change \nfrom men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or \nmasculinized women. Claiming that this is a civil rights matter and \nencouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and \npromote a mental disorder''--or mental dysphoria, if you would rather.\n  Then I have this article from Walt Heyer. Having visited with Walt, I \nhave eminent respect for this man who underwent a sex change operation \nfrom man to woman years ago. He is now in his seventies. This is his \narticle published in The Daily Signal May 16 of this year.\n  He says: ``President Barack Obama, the titular head of the LGBT \nmovement, has added to the firestorm of confusion, misunderstanding, \nand fury surrounding the transgender bathroom debate by threatening \nschools with loss of Federal funding unless they allow students to join \nthe sex-segregated restroom, locker room, and sports teams of their \nchosen gender, without regard to biological reality:\n  ``I know firsthand what it is like to be a transgender person--and \nhow misguided it is to think one can change gender through hormones and \nsurgery.''\n  Walt Heyer says: ``His action,'' talking about President Obama, \n``comes after weeks of protest against the State of North Carolina for \nits so-called anti-LGBT bathroom bill.\n  ``As someone who underwent surgery from male to female and lived as a \nfemale for 8 years before returning to living as a man, I know \nfirsthand what it is like to be a transgender person--and how misguided \nit is to think one can change gender through hormones and surgery.\n  ``And I know that the North Carolina bill and others like it are not \nanti-LGBT.''\n  He says: ``L is for lesbian. The bill is not anti-lesbian because \nlesbians have no desire to enter a stinky men's restroom. Lesbians will \nuse the women's room without a second thought. So the law is not anti-\nL.\n  ``G is for gay. Gay men have no interest in using women's bathrooms. \nSo the law is not anti-G.\n  ``B is for bisexual. The B in the LGBT have never been confused about \ntheir gender. Theirs is also a sexual preference only that doesn't \naffect choice of restroom or locker.''\n  But he says: ``The North Carolina law is not anti-T because the law \nclearly states that the appropriate restroom is the one that \ncorresponds to the gender stated on the birth certificate. Therefore, a \ntransgender person with a birth\n\n[[Page H3497]]\n\ncertificate that reads `female' uses the female restroom, even if the \ngender noted at birth was male.\n  ``So, you see, the law is not anti-LGBT. What then is all the uproar \nabout?''\n  Walt Heyer goes on, he says: ``What has arisen is a new breed \nemerging among young people that falls outside the purview of the LGBT: \nthe gender nonconformists.\n  ``Gender nonconformists, who constitute a minuscule fraction of \nsociety, want to be allowed to designate a gender on a fluid basis, \nbased on their feelings at the moment.''\n  Walt Heyer says: ``I call this group `gender defiant' because they \nprotest against the definition of fixed gender identities of male and \nfemale. The gender defiant individuals are not like traditional \ntransgender or transsexual persons who struggle with gender dysphoria \nand want hormone therapy, hormone blockers, and eventually, \nreassignment surgery. The gender defiant group doesn't want to conform, \ncomply, or identify with traditional gender norms of male and female. \nThey want to have gender fluidity, flowing freely from one gender to \nanother, by the hour or day, as they feel like it.''\n  Mr. Speaker, coming from a transgender individual who had sex change \nsurgery, this is quite an article.\n  He goes on to say: ``Under the cover of the LGBT, the anti-gender \nfaction and its supporters are using the North Carolina bathroom bill \nto light a fuse to blow up factual gender definitions.\n\n  ``He does not grasp the biological fact that genders are not fluid, \nbut fixed: male and female.\n  ``Obama is championing the insanity of eliminating the traditional \ndefinition of gender. He does not grasp the biological fact that \ngenders are not fluid, but fixed: male and female.''\n  Here I would also like to insert parenthetically. This is not from \nWalt Heyer. But in talking with Dr. McHugh, who had headed up \npsychiatry for so many years at Johns Hopkins, who cares deeply about \npeople who are confused over gender, he was pointing out--he brought up \nthe MMPI and asked if I knew what that was. Well, I knew. It is the \nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Index, as I recall. But it is a \npersonality test, and as far as I know, it is the most complete testing \nanybody has done on personality. It has different scales in there, and \nas Dr. McHugh pointed out, scale 5 is masculine at one end, feminine at \nanother end.\n  Based on the questions that are asked, the MMPI score gives an \nindication on the male-female scale as to where someone is in that \nscale. It has nothing to do with biological sex. Apparently, most of us \nmay have different places on that scale at different ages, and there is \nnothing abnormal about that.\n  People are to be comforted and counseled, not have laws passed that \nthey can't get help from their parents, they can't get help from loving \ncounselors, they can't get help from psychiatrists.\n  As Dr. McHugh pointed out, when these States like California and New \nJersey pass laws that some confused minor with no biological \nindications of a problem, so the problem is all in the mind, when you \npass laws saying you can't get counseling for what is all in the mind, \nas Dr. McHugh says sarcastically, you might as well outlaw all of \npsychiatry because what they deal with are things that have not \npresented normally. They have not presented a biological scientific \nissue.\n  Going back to Walt Heyer's article, he says: ``Gender nonconformists, \nwho constitute a minuscule fraction of society, want to be allowed to \ndesignate gender on a fluid basis, based on their feelings at the \nmoment.''\n  He said: ``I call this group 'gender defiant' because they protest \nagainst the definition of fixed gender identities of male and female. \nThe gender defiant individuals are not like traditional transgender or \ntranssexual persons who struggle with gender dysphoria and want hormone \ntherapy, hormone blockers, and eventually, reassignment. The gender \ndefiant group doesn't want to conform, comply, or identify with \ntraditional gender norms of male and female.''\n  And I know I have read this, but this is so critical. He says: \n``Under the cover of LGBT, the anti-gender faction and its supporters \nare using the North Carolina bathroom bill to light a fuse to blow up \nfactual gender definitions.''\n  Now, going on: ``Using the power of his position,'' talking about our \nPresident, ``to influence the elimination of gender, overruling \nscience, genetics, and biblical beliefs, is Obama's display of \npolitical power.''\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  ``One fact will remain, no matter how deep in the tank Obama goes for \nthe gender nonconformists, genetics and God's design of male and \nfemale, no matter how repugnant that is to some, cannot be changed. \nBiological gender remains fixed no matter how many cross-gender \nhormones are taken or cosmetic surgeries are performed. No law can \nchange the genetic and biblical truth of God's design. Using financial \nblackmail to achieve the elimination of gender will become Obama's ugly \nlegacy.''\n  Now that is from a guy who has had the surgery, who has had the \nhormones. He has been through it all. Walt Heyer has a blog. He has \novercome his alcohol addiction. I asked him--I don't think he would \nmind me repeating--I said that we learned from the Swedish study over \n30 years, people that have had these sex change operations are 20 times \nmore likely to commit suicide.\n  I said: Did those thoughts enter your mind--suicidal ideations? And \nhe indicated that he had tried to commit suicide. I didn't elaborate. \nThis is a man that knows. And so is Dr. Paul McHugh.\n  To try to make this a new civil rights issue holds these people up \nfor political football. Everybody knows footballs get changed out from \ngame to game. Some political football will be the new football in \nanother game.\n  I doubt that the people in this room that have been using transgender \nas a football will go back like the Swedish study or the Johns Hopkins \nstudy did and see the damage that has been done. Eighty percent, if \nleft untreated, have very, very normal lives and normal mental affect \ndown the road--if they are left untreated. But my friends who support \nthis want to make them a political football.\n  We have this article, then, from June 3. Melody Wood wrote the \nheadline: 6 Men Who Disguised Themselves as Women to Access Bathrooms.\n  She reports:\n  ``The Obama administration has unlawfully rewritten law, meddling in \nState and local matters, and imposing bad policy on the entire Nation.\n  ``Americans agree that while we should be sensitive to transgender \nindividuals, others also have rights of privacy, safety, and their own \nbeliefs that deserve respect and should not simply be pushed aside, \nespecially when transgender persons can be accommodated in other ways.\n  ``The risk to the privacy and safety of women and girls is real. \nThere have been numerous cases in recent years of men either cross-\ndressing or claiming to be transgender in order to access women's \nbathrooms and locker rooms for inappropriate purposes.\n  ``Here are six examples:\n  ``In 2009, a sex offender named Richard Rendler was arrested for \nwearing fake breasts and a wig while loitering in a woman's restroom in \nCampbell, California, shopping center. Rendler had previously been \narrested on charges of child molestation and indecent exposure.\n  ``In 2010, Berkeley police arrested Gregorio Hernandez. Hernandez had \ndisguised himself as a woman on two separate occasions to get inside a \nUC Berkeley locker room. Once in the locker room, Hernandez allegedly \nused his cell phone to photograph women.\n  ``In 2013, Jason Pomare was arrested for cross-dressing in order to \ngain access to the women's restroom at a Macy's department store in \nPalmdale, California. Pomare snuck a video camera in to secretly \nvideotape women while they used the restroom.\n  ``In 2014, Christopher Hambrook--who faked being a transgender person \nnamed Jessica--was jailed in Toronto, Canada. Hambrook preyed on women \nat two Toronto shelters, and had previously preyed on other women and \ngirls as young as five years old to as old as 53. Hambrook's case in \nparticular shows the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of \nsome of our most vulnerable citizens: the homeless and others who seek \nemergency shelter. And yet, the Obama administration recently proposed \na rule\n\n[[Page H3498]]\n\nthat would impose a `gender identity' mandate here as well.\n  ``In 2015, two spying instances were recorded in Virginia--one at a \nmall and one at a Walmart. Both instances involved a man in women's \nclothing who used a mirror and camera to take pictures of a mother and \nher 5-year-old daughter and a 53-year-old woman while they were in \nneighboring restroom stalls. The suspect wore a pink shirt and a long \nwig to present himself as a woman.\n  ``In 2016, a man used a women's locker room at a public swimming pool \nin Washington State to undress in front of young girls who were \nchanging for swim practice. When Seattle Parks and Recreation staff \nasked him to leave, the man claimed that `the law has changed and I \nhave a right to be here.' The man was apparently referring to a \nWashington State rule that allows individuals to use the bathroom that \ncorresponds with their gender identity. However, the man made no \nattempt to present as a woman.\n  ``As these examples illustrate, there are people who will abuse \ntransgender policies. Although the Obama administration wants to keep \nits focus on bathrooms, its transgender directive goes much farther and \nactually requires biological male students who identify as female to be \ngranted unfettered access to women's and girls' showers at school gyms.\n  ``So what are women and girls to do when a biological male wearing a \nwig and makeup walks into an open shower next to them and they are \nshocked by the intrusion? According to the administration's directive, \n`the desire to accommodate others' discomfort' is no reason at all to \nprevent transgender people from accessing the intimate facilities of \ntheir choice.\n  ``Moreover, the directive prevents schools from requiring transgender \npeople to have surgery, take hormones, have a medical diagnosis, or \neven act or dress in any particular way before having the `right' to be \ntreated exactly like a person of the opposite sex.\n  ``The logical effect would be to silence women and girls who might \notherwise speak out to prevent serious crimes from happening for fear \nthat they would be accused of bigotry if they make the wrong call.\n  ``The interests and desires of transgender persons, especially \nadults, shouldn't be placed over the privacy and safety of women and \ngirls. There are ways of accommodating transgender people with private \nfacilities without endangering and silencing women who could be hurt by \npolicies allowing anyone unfettered access to their lockers, showers, \nand bathrooms.''\n  That is from Melody Wood.\n  It also reminds me of back years ago when the issue of hate crimes \nwas arising and we were going to punish people more severely based on \nwhat was in their minds, such as did they choose a person, a victim, \nbased on their being a member of an identifiable group?\n  That created a problem for me as one who has sentenced felons up to \nand including the death penalty, because from the testimony we heard \nover and over, those who used to be called sociopaths under the old \nDSM-II became antisocial personality disorder. But they knew right from \nwrong. They just chose to do wrong. And they would pick victims at \nrandom. They didn't really care.\n  The people that testified in my court repeatedly made clear that if \nsomeone has this antisocial personality disorder, formerly sociopath, \npsychopath, they had less chance of being reformed and coming out of \nprison and shying away from wrongdoing. A lesser chance of reforming \nthem.\n\n  Whereas the testimony indicated in different cases that if someone \ncommitted an act in the heat of passion--often it was a one-time crime \nthat had to be punished for its own crime's sake, but that they were \nnot likely to ever commit that crime again. There were some who \ncommitted crimes. They were not antisocial personality, but they had \nbeen brought up to hate a specific group or people, and they committed \nsome act or crime against them.\n  I always made sure--it didn't matter whether they picked their victim \nbecause of sexual orientation--if they committed an assault of any \nkind, up to and including murder, I made sure they were punished \nseverely for the crime they committed, because every person deserves to \nbe protected from an assault.\n  So hate crimes comes in. And those who chose a person based on a \nhatred they were taught, there are indications there have been some \ngreat successes with confrontations between them after they were \nsentenced with victims or victims' families in which the person who was \nnot an antisocial personality would weep and recant and apologize and \nbeg for forgiveness and never have that kind of hatred again and would \nbegin associating with people, whether they were of a different race, \ncreed, color, or gender. They had a better chance of being \nrehabilitated.\n  Yet, the hate crime law came in. In fact, under the Federal law, if \nyou convince a jury--just raise a reasonable doubt as a defendant--no, \nI didn't pick that victim because they were this, that, or the other; I \njust wanted to shoot somebody that day--if you raise a reasonable doubt \nthat you may have randomly picked the victim, it is a complete defense \nto the Federal hate crime law. That is a messed up law.\n  I also gave the example that, based on so many of the hate crime \nlaws, you could someday--and I was called crazy and all kind of names \nfor giving this example--but the example I thought many years ago that \nwas appropriate, based on the hate crimes legislation, is that you \ncould have a situation where a mother and her young daughter are \nstanding on a street corner, somebody opens their trench coat and \nflashes the daughter, and the mother, out of that protective instinct \nthey have to protect the child, hits the flasher with her purse.\n  The flasher--in a lot of jurisdictions, that is a minimal \nmisdemeanor--probably would never do any jail time. He might have to \npay a fine or spend 1 day in jail. But because the woman hit him \nbecause of his sexual orientation toward flashing, then she is now \nguilty under many hate crime laws of committing a felony and can get \nprison time under these misguided hate crime laws. And I warned that we \nwould get to this point.\n  And then when I hear on the news some woman got mad when a guy came \nin dressed as a woman, scared her, and she hit him, then she gets \narrested. This is what happens. This is the kind of miscarriage of \njustice you get when we don't base laws on facts.\n  And then we have this article from Rebecca Kheel. Of course, most of \nus have heard the headlines. We know the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, or the VA, has had problems. People have been dying while \nwaiting to get the treatment they needed.\n  And now the VA proposes covering surgeries for transgender vets. They \nare not even taking care of the vets when they need help, and now they \nare going to take up a procedure that Johns Hopkins says does more harm \nthan good, that the best study in the world from Sweden says they are \ngoing to be 20 times more likely to kill themselves.\n  Have we not lost enough veterans already? The VA wants to make them \n20 times more vulnerable to suicide than they already are?\n  It is time to stop the nonsense. And I would submit, Mr. Speaker, \nhaving reviewed the information that Dr. Paul McHugh from Johns Hopkins \nprovided and Walt Heyer provided and that I looked into based on their \ndirection, one thing is imminently clear: the issue of transgender is \nnot based on biological science, it is not based on medical science, it \nis not based on physical science, it is not based on chemical science. \nThere is only one science that this whole transgender issue before the \nCongress is based on, and that is political science.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3498-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate agree to the amendment of the House to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 2576) ``An Act to modernize the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act, and for other purposes.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3498-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3498-H3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Curbelo of Florida (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on\n\n[[Page H3499]]\n\naccount of his flight being delayed from Miami to Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. Duffy (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and June 8 on \naccount of the birth of his child.\n  Mrs. Mimi Walters of California (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for \ntoday and June 8 on account of business in the district.\n  Ms. Brown of Florida (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on \naccount of flight delayed.\n  Mr. Farr (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through June 10 on \naccount of family and health issues.\n  Ms. Jackson Lee (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account \nof official business.\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nofficial business.\n  Mr. Swalwell of California (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today \non account of primary election day in California.\n  Ms. Maxine Waters of California (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/house-section/article/H3499-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Karen L.
