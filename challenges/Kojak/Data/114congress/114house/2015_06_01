The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Massie) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I am here today because last night, at \nmidnight, a wonderful thing happened. In what seems like a constant \nflow, a tide that has been washing away our liberties since the \nfounding of this country, we experienced something unique.\n  The tide reversed, thanks to one Senator, Senator Rand Paul of \nKentucky, and now, we have some of our civil liberties restored. If \nonly but for a brief second in history, they are restored. It may \nregister only as an eddy current, but clearly, we changed the tide last \nnight.\n  Now, what happened? The PATRIOT Act expired. How does a law expire, \ndo you say? Why do we allow them to expire? It is because, when we \nenact laws, we know that we don't have the foresight to see how they \nwill be carried out. We don't know everything that is going to happen \nas time transpires. It is important that we revisit these laws. In this \ncase, this law expired.\n  I would like to pretend that, if I were here when the PATRIOT Act \npassed after the attacks on our country, that I wouldn't have voted for \nit, but I can't say that. I am not going to pass judgment on my \ncolleagues that were here when it did pass. I can barely imagine the \nincredible pressure they were under from their constituents, from \neverybody, to do something--to do something to protect our country, and \nso they passed the PATRIOT Act. I don't blame them. I wasn't here. I \nmight have done the same thing.\n  We have new facts today, so we revisit this law; we revisit the \nPATRIOT Act. What are the new facts? What are the things that have \nchanged since it was issued? Let me list them.\n  First of all, our Director of National Intelligence lied to us, lied \nto Congress about how the law was being implemented. In fact, he said, \n``I said the least untruthful thing I could,'' when he testified. Those \nwere his words. He said the least untruthful thing he could.\n  That is not good enough. He is in charge of all of our intelligence, \nand you are spying on Americans, and you lied to Congress about it, so \nthat has changed.\n  What else changed? The NSA broke the law. How do we know this? The \nsecond highest court in the land said they broke the law. Just a few \nweeks ago, they ruled this. Surely, we can't trust them to enforce the \nlaws that we are giving them now without some major reform.\n  What is the next thing that has changed since the PATRIOT Act first \npassed? The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence failed us. The \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence is privy to information that \nthe rest of Congress cannot have, and I understand that. It would be \nhard to keep a secret if 435 Members knew about it, so we entrust some \nof our Members to know the Nation's most important secrets.\n  What do we trust them with? Oversight, oversight over the \nintelligence community to make sure that the laws that all 435 of us \nvote on are being implemented in the way that we intended them to be \nimplemented--and that was not the case, so that has changed.\n  What is the fourth thing that has changed since the first PATRIOT Act \nwas issued and the last time it was reauthorized? The FISA court, this \nis the secret court that issues the secret warrants, if you will--if \nyou would call them warrants. I would not call them warrants.\n  They issued the mother of all general warrants. What are general \nwarrants? These are warrants that are not specific. The warrant they \nissued would make King George III blush. Think about this: a warrant \nthat covers every--every--American.\n  Let me read the Fourth Amendment to our Constitution here, and this \nis specifically about your right to privacy: ``The right of the people \nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no \nwarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or \naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and \nthe persons or things to be seized.''\n  The warrant that they issued, the one that went to Verizon which \nauthorized the collection of everybody's\n\n[[Page H3584]]\n\nphone records, was not constitutional; yet we trusted them with the \noversight, and they betrayed us. They betrayed that trust.\n  Since 1979, there have been 34,000 surveillance orders requested of \nthe FISA court by the intelligence community; 12 of the 34,000 have \nbeen denied.\n  Mr. Speaker, things have changed. I urge my colleagues not to \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act. The Freedom Act does not go far enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3584-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEDICAL MARIJUANA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is a quiet revolution taking place \nacross America to reform and modernize our marijuana laws. For over \nhalf a century, the official position has been one of prohibition, of \nincarceration, of obfuscation, and willful ignorance; yet almost 20 \nmillion Americans use marijuana every month.\n  A majority of the public now thinks that that should be legal, and an \neven larger majority thinks that, whatever their personal opinion about \nmarijuana is, that the Federal Government should not interfere with \nwhat the States do, just like how we regulate alcohol.\n  In the vanguard of the reform movement has been medical marijuana \nsince 1996, when California was the first State to legalize it. It has \nbeen followed now where almost three-quarters of the States provide \nsome form of access to medical marijuana, and most of those decisions \nwere made by a vote of the people. Well over 200 million Americans live \nwhere they have access to medical marijuana.\n  There have been many positive benefits achieved for our veterans, who \nsuffer from a wide range of medical problems, many of which stem from \ntheir years of service: chronic pain, PTSD, controlling the symptoms of \nmultiple sclerosis, or dealing with violent nausea as a result of \nchemotherapy; yet our veterans are discriminated against because, even \nin States where it is legal, their VA doctors are discouraged from \nworking with them to see if medical marijuana is right for them or if \nit is not.\n  I am pleased to see some change taking place in Congress. We almost \npassed my amendment last month which would have given veterans fair \ntreatment, enabling their primary doctor to consult with them. Just \nthis last week in the Senate, there was approved in committee \nessentially the same amendment, and it is on its way to the Senate \nfloor to give equal rights to veterans for medical marijuana.\n  This is the latest step in the evolution that we have seen now where \nfour States and the District of Columbia have declared adult use legal, \nand we are seeing further progress at the local level.\n  The tide is building. We are turning away from a failed program of \nprohibiting; arresting; and, in some cases, incarcerating, while \ndenying the science.\n  We as a Nation are turning to approaches that are more honest and \nworkable, that tax and regulate to allow for important research and \npublic education that will allow people to make informed choices about \nthe use of these substances or not.\n  We are already seeing the social, economic, and law enforcement \nadvantages in this shift at the State level, and we should capitalize \non this movement at the national level as well.\n  It is exciting to see a bipartisan group of legislators in a sea of \nlegislative dysfunction coming together to promote bringing this \ncountry into the 21st century in terms of marijuana policies, doing it \nright.\n  This week, during consideration of the Commerce, Justice, Science, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we are likely to see numerous \namendments dealing with research, hemp, medical marijuana, cultivation, \nenforcement, and respecting States' laws.\n  This is an exciting and encouraging development to be able to make \nthe Federal Government a full partner with the evolution that is taking \nplace on the State and local level.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in such a way that respects the will of \nthe people and the rights of States to forge these new policies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3584-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3584-H3585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FISHING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Austin Scott) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of \nthe American recreational fishermen that, like myself and my family, \nused to have the opportunity to fish for red snapper in the Federal \nwaters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I can't help but think how sad it is that we have people in here \narticulating why illegal drugs should be made legal while we continue \nto allow Federal agencies to take away the rights of the American \nsportsmen and the men and the women who just want to take their kids \nfishing.\n  Maybe if we spent more time outdoors fishing and hunting, we wouldn't \nhave the problems that we have in this country with drugs.\n  Now, technically, Mr. Speaker, we still have the right to fish in the \nGulf of Mexico in the Federal waters, as long as you can do it in the \ncrumb of the season that has been left for the recreational fishermen.\n  Dr. Roy Crabtree and the National Marine Fisheries Services have left \na 10-day season for the not-for-hire recreational angler who just wants \nto take his or her kid fishing, 10 days.\n  In 2007, Mr. Speaker--if you want to know how fast this has gone \ndownhill--we got to fish 194 days; so, in the short span of about 8 \nyears, they have taken 95 percent of the opportunity of the American \nsportsmen to fish in the Gulf of Mexico's Federal waters for red \nsnapper away from them.\n  When they started the reductions, they promised that, as soon as the \nstock was restored, the season would be restored. Now, they give us the \nexcuse: Well, because there are so many of them and they are so much \nbigger, you are catching that many that much faster.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, this makes no sense. The commercial fishermen, \nships, long lines and winches, and their powerful lobbyists, they get \nto fish year round for the same species. Dr. Roy Crabtree and the \nothers at the National Marine Fisheries Services again virtually \neliminated the fishing season for the recreational angler, reducing it \nto 10 days.\n  Now, I support the commercial fishing industry. I like to buy a piece \nof red snapper at the restaurant. I like to buy it at the grocery \nstore. There is plenty of fish out there for all of us.\n  The 10 days that we have as recreational anglers--if it is bad \nweather, well, that is just too bad. If you have got to work that day, \nwell, that is just too bad. You see, they pick the days. You don't get \nto pick the days, Mr. Speaker; and, if you can't fish on that day, that \nis just too bad for you. If you can afford it, the charter boat season \nnow is 45 days.\n  Now, I will just tell you, I have never seen this much bias in \nanything I have ever done, especially in the rulemaking process, unless \nsomeone is being bribed or blackmailed or had a personal financial \ninterest in the rulemaking, which brings me to the next point.\n  The vote to split the recreational season at the expense of the \nAmerican angler, who just wants to fish with their family--not being \nforced to hire a charter boat--this was done by the Gulf Council on a \nsplit vote of 7 to 10 in which, according to news sources, 3 of the \nmembers that voted to do this didn't disclose that they sit on the \nboard of a group that lobbies for the charter boat industry.\n  Again, I support the charter boat industry, but the idea that someone \ncould sit there and vote to make a season for themselves 45 days as \nlong as you can you pay them to take you, but 10 days if you don't pay \nthem--Mr. Speaker, to be quite honest, Federal law stipulates those \nwith a conflict must disclose it and shall not vote on those issues \nwhere a conflict exists.\n  The conduct of the National Marine Fisheries Services in allowing \nthat vote is in direct contrast to the rights of the Americans who just \nwant to fish in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I, for one, am not going to sit back and let this continue; and, when \nthe CJS appropriations act is on the floor, Mr. Speaker, I hope that we \nhave the opportunity to correct what I believe to be illegal actions by \nthe National Marine Fisheries Services and Dr. Roy Crabtree.\n\n[[Page H3585]]\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ODESSA PERMIAN HIGH SCHOOL \nFOOTBALL TEAM'S FIRST STATE CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Conaway) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Odessa Permian High School football team's first State \nchampionship title. As a member of that team, I am especially excited \nto gather with my teammates this weekend to look back over the 50 \nyears.\n  They say everything is bigger in Texas, and high school football is \nno different.\n  Mr. Speaker, when our team earned the title that bitterly cold \nDecember day, it was the start of one of the most storied high school \nfootball dynasties in Texas. We were led by the Texas coaching legend, \nGene Mayfield, who was as tough as his reputation suggests. He was \nknown for his motivational skills, and he could motivate. Coach \nMayfield and the coaching staff did not inherit a State-championship-\ncaliber team that year; rather, through his influence and direction, he \nmolded our team into something that many doubted we could ever become.\n  His emphasis on preparation, competition, and expectation to win \ndrove our team to demand more of each other. We suffered during his \nnotoriously tough workouts. You could find our team running in the \nsandhills of Monahans Sandhills State Park or challenging each other \nwith bicycle races, wrestling matches, or any of the other various \nevents that he could find that would hone our competitive spirit and \nbuild a drive to win and a spirit to never quit.\n  Mr. Speaker, unbeknownst to us as kids, the values Coach Mayfield was \ninstilling in us that year would carry with us for the rest of our \nlives. He was teaching us more than how to be good football players; he \nwas teaching us how to become men. I personally view Coach Mayfield as \none of the most influential men in my life, and I believe that my \nteammates would say the same.\n  It was through our shared experiences that our team bonded together. \nIn 1965, it drove us to win, and we were seeing the fruits of our \nlabors with each game night. Those experiences created relationships \nthat have endured over five decades.\n  This Friday, my teammates and I will gather to renew those bonds and \nreminisce, but also to become the recipients of this year's Odessa \nPermian High School Black Shirt Award. Every year, this award is given \nto a school organization, individual, or group that have achieved a \nstandard of excellence and inspired a passion in the Permian High \nSchool alumni and student body.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have been a part of that historic season \nand to have played with some of the best teammates you could ever ask \nfor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3585-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Their crime: the chiefs had \ntried to reinstate traditional Samoan practices outlawed by the German \ncolonial regime. The Samoans remained in the Marianas until 1915, when \nthey were repatriated by another colonial power--Japan.\n  Their story was almost lost in time. But thanks to the work of the \nNorthern Marianas Humanities Council, the history of these exiles has \nnow been documented.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3585-7", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING OUR AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS\n\n  (Mr. TIBERI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TIBERI.

It is astounding because it is not true.\n  There are 22,000 American Whirlpool workers. They are makers of \niconic brands like Whirlpool, Maytag, and KitchenAid. More than 80 \npercent of Whirlpool products sold in the United States are made in the \nUnited States. Their products come from Ohio communities like Clyde, \nMarion, Greenville, Ottawa, and Findlay, Ohio, not to mention Whirlpool \nplants in other States.\n  Believe the numbers, Mr. Speaker. One in every five jobs in Ohio \ndepends on trade. With new trade agreements, barriers abroad will be \nremoved so Whirlpool and other manufacturers have the opportunity to \nsell their American-made products overseas.\n  Let's spread the truth: trade supports American jobs, and increased \ntrade will build a healthy American economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3585-8", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3585-H3586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PASS A LONG-TERM HIGHWAY AND TRANSIT TRUST FUND BILL\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE.

Let's get to work on a \nbipartisan, long-term plan to invest in our Nation's roads, our \nbridges, and our ports. We have to believe in ourselves. We have to bet \non the American worker and on American business. If we invest in \ninfrastructure, they will pay us back with productivity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3586-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

EARLY REPAYMENT OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 213 of the \n     Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (43 U.S.C. 390mm), any \n     landowner within the Northport Irrigation District in the \n     State of Nebraska (referred to in this section as the \n     ``District'') may repay, at any time, the construction costs \n     of project facilities allocated to the landowner's land \n     within the District.\n       (b) Applicability of Full-Cost Pricing Limitations.--On \n     discharge, in full, of the obligation for repayment of all \n     construction costs described in subsection (a) that are \n     allocated to all land the landowner owns in the District in \n     question, the parcels of land shall not be subject to the \n     ownership and full-cost pricing limitations under Federal \n     reclamation law (the Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, \n     chapter 1093), and Acts supplemental to and amendatory of \n     that Act (43 U.S.C. 371 et seq.), including the Reclamation \n     Reform Act of 1982 (13 U.S.C. 390aa et seq.).\n       (c) Certification.--On request of a landowner that has \n     repaid, in full, the construction costs described in \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior shall provide \n     to the landowner a certificate described in section 213(b)(1) \n     of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (43 U.S.C. \n     390mm(b)(1)).\n       (d) Effect.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) modifies any contractual rights under, or amends or \n     reopens, the reclamation contract between the District and \n     the United States; or\n       (2) modifies any rights, obligations, or relationships \n     between the District and landowners in the District under \n     Nebraska State law.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As we begin the debate on this particular bill, I am pleased that the \ngentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith) is here with us to introduce this \nvery effective and important bill.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska \n(Mr. Smith) to explain his legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank my colleague from Utah for yielding.\n  Under Federal reclamation law, irrigation districts which receive \nwater from a Bureau of Reclamation facility typically repay their \nportion of the capital costs of water projects under long-term \ncontracts.\n  Under its current contract and current law, Northport is exempt from \nannual capital repayment if this carriage fee exceeds $8,000 per year. \nGiven that the carriage fee has greatly exceeded this amount every year \nsince the 1950s, Northport's capital repayment debt has been stagnant \nat over $923,000 since 1952.\n  So long as the debt endures, landowners are subject to burdensome \nreporting requirements and acreage limitations, and no leverage is \ngenerated for the Federal Government.\n  I introduced this bill to provide members of the Northport Irrigation \nDistrict early repayment authority under their dated reclamation \ncontract.\n  Allowing producers within the Northport Irrigation District to pay \noff their portion of the contract means the government will receive \nfunds otherwise uncollected, and landowners will be relieved of costly \nconstraints which threaten family-owned operations.\n  For example, at a Water, Power, and Oceans Subcommittee hearing last \nyear, one member of the Northport district testified that acreage \nlimitations will prohibit parents who own land in the district from \npassing down or even selling farmland to sons and daughters who also \nown land in the same district.\n  As the chairman mentioned, similar legislation has passed under \nbipartisan majorities and, according to the CBO, could generate as much \nas $440,000 in Federal revenue.\n  This is a very simple bill which would make a big difference to some \nfamily farmers in western Nebraska.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 404 would authorize landowners served by the \nNorthport Irrigation District to prepay the remaining portion of \nconstruction costs allocated to them for the North Platte project. In \nexchange, the landowners who pay will no longer be subject to acreage \nlimitations and other requirements associated with the Reclamation \nReform Act.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this good bill, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This bill is an excellent piece of legislation that solves a problem \nthat should never have existed in the first place.\n  It is curious that in many cases throughout the West, the current \nFederal law does not allow a landowner to make an early repayment on \nFederal irrigation projects. It is an outdated law and a hurdle that is \nsilly. It is similar to a bank prohibiting a homeowner from paying off \nhis or her mortgage early.\n  Congressman Smith's bill removes the Federal Bureau of Reclamation \nrepayment prohibition for individual landowners within the Northport \nIrrigation District. In return for those payments, though, these \nfarmers will no longer be subject to the acreage limitation and the \npaperwork requirements imposed by the Reclamation Reform Act.\n  This bill will accelerate revenue coming into the Treasury. It is \nbased on two recent precedents that passed in both Republican- and \nDemocrat-controlled Houses. Today, we are trying to continue those \nefforts by adopting this particular bill.\n\n[[Page H3587]]\n\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the sponsor of this \nexcellent piece of legislation, to explain his bill.\n  Mr. CRAMER. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his good work \non this important legislation.\n\n[[Page H3588]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, during the last Congress, while I served on the Natural \nResources Committee, we held an oversight hearing regarding the child \nprotection crisis on the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation in North Dakota \nin response to the numerous child deaths, as well as whistleblower \nreports that were detailing unsafe tribal placement of almost 40 foster \nchildren in abusive homes, many of which were headed by known convicted \nchild sex offenders.\n  In an effort to protect these children and children around the \ncountry, I introduced the Native American Children's Safety Act, a bill \nthat Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota has also introduced in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  This bill implements across-the-board minimum protections for \nchildren placed in foster care at the direction of a tribal court. \nThese standards, Mr. Speaker, mirror existing national requirements for \nnontribal foster care placements, ensuring that tribal children receive \nat least the same, if not higher, standards of foster care as nontribal \nchildren placed in foster care.\n  This bill is bipartisan. I believe it is noncontroversial. It was \nreported out of the Natural Resources Committee in both this Congress \nand the last Congress with unanimous consent.\n  I also want to take the time to thank several members of the \nadministration, particularly the BIA, as well as Health and Human \nServices, for their assistance in refining the bill. I also want to \nthank the National Indian Child Welfare Association, which assisted in \nrefining the bill, as well as the National Congress of American \nIndians.\n  All of these refinements to the bill help make the bill better. More \nimportantly, it provides flexibility to the tribes in fulfilling the \nobligations of the bill, and I think it makes it a much better bill.\n  I thank everybody who was involved, as well as my colleagues, and \nhope that we can pass it without objection today.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Currently, Native America tribes and their tribal courts use \nprocedures and guidelines that vary significantly from tribe to tribe \nwhen placing a Native American child in a foster home.\n  Current law does not require that the Federal Government or Indian \ntribe perform vigorous background checks on foster parents or foster \nhomes in order to ensure the safety, health, and protection of Native \nchildren.\n  Consequently, there have been appalling cases of Native American \nchildren ending up in dangerous and unsafe living conditions because \nthey were placed in an overburdened foster care system that failed to \nensure sufficient background checks of placement homes. We critically \nneed background checks of individuals and institutions selected to \nfoster Native youth.\n  H.R. 1168 strengthens background checks on prospective foster care \nparents prior to placement of Native children into foster homes and \nsets forth a uniform manner in which Federal and tribal agencies \nserving tribes may conduct such checks.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with me in support of Native American \nchildren by supporting passage of Mr. Cramer's bill, H.R. 1168, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this has been fully explained. To protect Indian foster \nchildren and provide these background checks is a wonderful thing. It \nis well overdue. I appreciate and commend the gentleman from North \nDakota, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1168.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3588-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3588-H3589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REVOCATION OF MIAMI TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA CHARTER\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

It is important that Congress remove these hurdles \nfor investors, business partners, and potential customers.\n  As lawmakers, it is our job in Congress to foster an atmosphere that \npromotes economic growth across the country. I take this responsibility \nvery seriously, and I hope that you will join me today in eliminating a \nneedless economic burden on the Miami Tribe in my home State of \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, at the request of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, H.R. 533 \nsimply revokes a corporate charter issued to it by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act and the Indian Reorganization \nAct, many tribes were issued corporate charters in the 1930s and 1940s \nthat were aimed at enabling them to better manage their own affairs and \npursue business relationships with private entities.\n  For some tribes, these corporate charters have proven unnecessary and \nend up hindering their business opportunities, as they will inevitably \ncome up in negotiations with private entities and are looked upon with \nsuspicion.\n  The charter must be revoked by an act of Congress, and Mr. Mullin, on \nbehalf of his constituents, is simply being a good Congressman and \ncomplying with the tribe's request through this bill.\n  Similar legislation has passed over the years without event, and I \nask my colleagues to stand with me in support of Mr. Mullin's \nnoncontroversial bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me say just a few words about this particular piece legislation \nby myself. It is a one-page piece of legislation that should be easy to \nread--and those are always dangerous because they are easy to read--\nthat grants the request from the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to revoke a \ncharter of incorporation which was issued back in the New Deal era--a \n1936 law that was implemented\n\n[[Page H3589]]\n\nin 1940. And as we know, any of those pieces of legislation that age \nthat well have got to be reviewed at a specific period of time.\n  Right now, we have a situation in which this tribe funds itself in a \ncumbersome situation with an outdated document that puts on limitations \nand uncertainty in the tribe business when they don't have to, because \nthey are dealing instead with the business activities that come through \ntheir tribal constitution.\n  They are doing it the right way. And unfortunately, it requires an \nact of Congress to allow them to do what they ought to be doing and are \ndoing in the first place and just clean up this act. So only we can do \nthat.\n  It is in accordance with the tribal wishes, and it is in accordance \nwith Congressman Mullin, who represents this particular tribe in the \nHouse. He has sponsored this. This is a good bill. The Department of \nthe Interior does not object to this piece of legislation. An identical \nversion passed in the House in the 113th Congress by a voice vote. I \nwould hope we would do it again, and this time make sure we go all the \nway through the system and do what is right for this particular tribe.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. BEYER. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I am going to speak very slowly as I \nam waiting for someone else to show up on the next bill and would, \ntherefore, yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Mullin) for another couple of anecdotes as to why this \npiece of legislation is needed. I will tug on the gentleman's coat when \nhe shows up and he can quit.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, you know, this is a piece of legislation \nthat unfortunately we have tried 2\\1/2\\ years, way too long, to try to \nget through this body; but it also opens an important conversation \nabout taking a look at all of these charters.\n  Why is it that Congress has to come together to pass commonsense \nlegislation that should be up to the tribes themselves to make the \ndecision? When they are hindering the businesses and the atmosphere \nthat these tribes are able to operate under, they are not able to go \nout and provide jobs to not just their members but, also, to the \ncommunities which they live in and they thrive in.\n  Miami Tribe is a large employer of the city of Miami. The city of \nMiami has been in a situation where they have lost two major employers, \nand they look to these tribes like this in the community to create not \njust jobs at a casino, but manufacturing jobs, jobs that help our \nnational defense. Yet they are hindered constantly by the effect that \nthey can't simply do the work without asking Congress' permission.\n  They are a sovereign nation. Why is it that they would have to \ncontinue to come back on something that isn't needed, something that \ndates all the way back to the 1930s? Unfortunately, this is exactly \nwhere we find ourselves today.\n  I am so glad that this is actually one of those things that is a \nbipartisan approach. Common sense does prevail in these Halls sometimes \nwhen we can come together and we can work at something that is \nnoncontroversial. Even at that, we started this in the 113th Congress; \nand now we are in the 114th Congress, and we are still talking about \nit. We are 6 months into the 114th Congress, and we are trying to get a \ncommonsense piece of legislation passed.\n  If I remember correctly, last year, when we tried to put this \nthrough, there was only one ``no'' vote. If that is not bipartisanship, \nthen, what is? This should have been on the President's desk already.\n  So I join my colleagues in supporting this bill, but I also want to \nthank them for their patience, for the city of Miami and the tribe of \nMiami for their patience and the opportunity to bring this up again.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I certainly don't want to break any \nprotocols we may have. So, therefore, I want to echo what the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma so brilliantly and so fluently and obviously not slowly \nenough said.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, once again, we will go through this concept \nthat hopefully--does the gentleman from Virginia, even though I realize \nhe has yielded back, would the gentleman like some of my time?\n  Mr. BEYER. I would be happy to take some if the chairman wouldn't \nmind.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Bless you.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to extend my gratitude to the \nCongressman from Oklahoma for teaching me how to say ``Miami.'' I have \nbeen mispronouncing ``Miami'' all through my short presentation. I also \nwant to thank him for his leadership and being so responsive.\n  I think that there are perhaps many other laws on the books that we \nshould look at in a very simple way to revoke the charters, as \nnecessary.\n  I would also like to offer my help to the Congressman from Miami with \nour two Virginia Senators. It sounds like, if it passed this House with \nonly one negative vote last year, that perhaps the Senate is the place \nwhere this is being held up. If we can provide some support to him in \nhis moving this through the Senate side, I would be delighted to do \nthat.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good piece of \nlegislation. I want to thank Mr. Mullin for bringing it up.\n  While we are on the subject, I would like to talk about the necessity \nof ICWA, the Child Welfare Act of this Congress past which I was a \nsponsor of.\n  The gentleman is here. So we won't talk about ICWA today. We will \njust let Mr. McClintock get in here and make his statement. Eventually, \nMr. Speaker, I will talk about the foster care homes, the need for \nvolunteers, so we don't have 300 children in my State staying with \nState supervision instead of adopted. So we will talk about that later.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, with great appreciation to my good \nfriends from Oklahoma and Virginia and Alaska, I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 533.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3589-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3589-H3591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DESIGNATING A MOUNTAIN IN THE JOHN MUIR WILDERNESS AS SKY POINT\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Staff Sergeant Sky Mote, USMC, grew up in El Dorado, \n     California.\n       (2) Staff Sergeant Mote graduated from Union Mine High \n     School.\n       (3) Upon graduation, Staff Sergeant Mote promptly enlisted \n     in the Marine Corps.\n       (4) Staff Sergeant Mote spent 9 years serving his country \n     in the United States Marine Corps, including a deployment to \n     Iraq and two deployments to Afghanistan.\n       (5) By his decisive actions, heroic initiative, and \n     resolute dedication to duty, Staff Sergeant Mote gave his \n     life to protect fellow Marines on August 10, 2012, by \n     gallantly rushing into action during an attack by a rogue \n     Afghan policeman inside the base perimeter in Helmand \n     province.\n       (6) Staff Sergeant Mote was awarded the Navy Cross, a \n     Purple Heart, the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal, a \n     Navy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal, 2 Combat Action Ribbons \n     and 3 Good Conduct Medals.\n       (7) The Congress of the United States, in acknowledgment of \n     this debt that cannot be repaid, honors Staff Sergeant Mote \n     for his ultimate sacrifice and recognizes his service to his \n     country, faithfully executed to his last, full measure of \n     devotion.\n       (8) A presently unnamed peak in the center of Humphrey \n     Basin holds special meaning to\n\n[[Page H3590]]\n\n     the friends and family of Sky Mote, as their annual hunting \n     trips set up camp beneath this point; under the stars, the \n     memories made beneath this rounded peak will be cherished \n     forever.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  There are some times when we can do nothing to repay the sacrifice \nthat our fellow men have done for us; but, in some small way, we can \ntry to show our gratitude. This is one bill that does that.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. McClintock), the sponsor of this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the chairman of \nthe Committee on Natural Resources, for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, Marine Staff Sergeant Sky Mote cared about a lot of \nthings--his fellow Marines, his country, his family, his community--but \nhis father, Russell, recalled, ``He never cared about medals. He never \nshowed them to us. Once,'' he said, ``I found one in his laundry.''\n  The irony is that Staff Sergeant Sky Mote received the second highest \nmedal that our country can bestow upon a Marine, the Navy Cross, for \nhis heroism in defending his fellow Marines on the last day of his \nlife, August 10, 2012.\n  The Navy Cross is in addition to the Purple Heart, the Navy and \nMarine Corps Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement \nMedal, two Combat Action Ribbons, and three Good Conduct Medals that he \nearned during his 9 years of exemplary service to our Nation.\n  In the U.S. Marine Corps, that prides itself on maintaining the \nhighest standards of the American military tradition, Staff Sergeant \nSky Mote stands conspicuously above and beyond.\n  On that day, that last day of his life, Sergeant Mote was at his post \nin the tactical operations center of the 1st Marine Special Operations \nBattalion in Helmand province. On that day, a so-called Afghan police \nofficer opened fire on the Marines who had come there to help that \ncountry.\n  When the attack broke out, Sergeant Mote was in an adjoining room. He \ncould have easily escaped to safety. According to the Navy's citation, \n``He instead grabbed his M4 rifle and entered the operations room, \ncourageously exposing himself to a hail of gunfire in order to protect \nhis fellow Marines. In his final act of bravery, he boldly engaged the \ngunman, now less than 5 meters in front of him, until falling mortally \nwounded.''\n  According to the citation, it was Mote's actions that stopped the \nattack and forced the attacker to flee. It was this heroism for which \nhe received the Navy Cross.\n  We know that he didn't care much about medals, but he cared so deeply \nabout his Marine Corps brothers that he gave his life for them. Many \nwho would have perished that day will go on to lead long and productive \nand prosperous lives because Sky Mote sacrificed his own for them, as \ndid Captain Matthew Manoukian of Los Altos Hills, California, who also \ngave his life to defend his fellow Marines that day.\n  Staff Sergeant Mote and his unit had been in the thick of the \nfighting in Afghanistan, often functioning as a commando force. During \ntheir tour in Puzeh, he and his unit were often engaged in daylong \nfirefights, and Mote in particular had often exposed himself to grave \ndanger.\n  His family didn't know a lot of this at the time. His stepmother, \nMarcia, said: ``He'd always say, `I'm going to be on a camping trip' or \n`I'm going to go on a hike.' He didn't want to give us any reason to \nworry.''\n  His father said that, although his son was indifferent to medals, he \nwas intentionally proud of his EOD badge designating his service as an \nexplosive ordnance disposal technician.\n  Russell Mote explained: ``He was just a humble person doing his job, \nand his job was to protect his team. He was not like a gung ho military \nperson. You wouldn't know he was in the Special Forces.''\n  To the EOD technicians, bombs are not something to be avoided, but \nsomething to be sought out and disarmed. On one such day, Mote defused \ntwo IEDs; crawled through a heavily seeded minefield to save the life \nof his team leader, who had been severely wounded by a third; and then \ndirected the evacuation of his unit. On that day, Sergeant Mote had \nearned a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with a V for valor.\n  On another very different day nearly 3 years ago, Sergeant Mote \nreturned home for the last time. Thousands of his countrymen stretched \nout more than a mile on El Dorado Hills Boulevard to silently express \ntheir gratitude and respect for this hometown hero.\n  Hundreds more lined overpasses to pay their respects along the \nmotorcade route. Still more stood silent vigil in front of Silva Valley \nElementary School and Rolling Hills Middle School, where he had \nattended, as the procession passed by. A thousand more waited for him \nat the church.\n  Many knew him by his deeds; a fortunate few knew him as a person and \nrecounted stories of his growing up in that community. His father \nrecalled: ``Sky loved life, family, and friends, and he loved being a \nMarine. He loved to surf. He loved to hunt and hike in the Sierra.''\n  Marcia perhaps put it best when she said: ``He was just everybody's \nfriend, and he would do anything for anybody.''\n  Sky Mote was 27 on that fateful day in Afghanistan. He was born June \n6, 1985, in Bishop, California. When he was still young, his parents \ndivorced, and his father brought his children to El Dorado. He married \nMarcia, and there, they raised Sky and their four other sons.\n  There, Sky joined the 4-H. He raised pigs and rode horses. He joined \nthe Civil Air Patrol. At Union Mine High School, he lettered in track \nand cross country. He camped and biked and hiked with his family \nthroughout the Sierra.\n  From the time he was a child, he spoke of some day joining the \nmilitary and defending his country. Right after graduation in 2003, he \ndid just that. Nine years later, he returned home to be laid to rest by \na country that honors him, a hometown that remembers him, and a family \nthat misses him.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to share a little of what I learned about \nMarine Staff Sergeant Sky Mote because it helps to answer the question \nthat James Michener first asked: ``Where do we get such men?''\n  Well, we get them from the heart and soul of America. We get them \nfrom good and decent families like the Motes. We get them from little \ntowns like El Dorado, California.\n  We come here today, to the Hall of the House of Representatives, to \ntry to honor a hero who didn't care much about medals. Lincoln, at \nGettysburg, noted our difficulty in doing so when he looked over the \nquiet battlefield and noted that ``in a larger sense, we cannot \ndedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave \nmen, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far beyond \nour poor power to add or detract.''\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  But nevertheless, we try.\n  Lincoln was right: we cannot add to the honor of his deeds. We come, \ninstead, to draw inspiration from them. We reflect on a young life, \nwith all the hopes and joys and aspirations of a long and productive \nlifetime ahead, all sacrificed for a country that, to this\n\n[[Page H3591]]\n\nday, represents what Lincoln called the ``last best hope of mankind.''\n  We come in gratitude to know that in every generation, there are such \nheroes among us who will step forth from the safety of hearth and home \nand into mortal peril to protect their fellow citizens. Patton put it \nbest when he said: ``It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. \nRather, we should thank God that such men lived.''\n  We come out of recognition that although the suffering of these \nfallen heroes has ended, the suffering of their families goes on day in \nand day out. There are Gold Star families among us who spend their \nMemorial Days not at barbecues and beach parties but in solemn \nceremonies and quiet vigils around honored graves. We honor their loved \nones in hopes that in some small way, we can help fortify them against \nthe loss that they bear every day of their lives.\n  But most of all, we come in recognition of Shakespeare's plea that \n``this story shall the good man teach his son.''\n  A few years ago, I had the honor to visit members of the 3rd United \nStates Infantry Old Guard who tend the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at \nArlington Cemetery. They are meticulously dressed and painstakingly \ndrilled as they honor the memory of our fallen warriors.\n  It is quite an impressive sight. And on a warm spring day like this, \nthousands of tourists will show up to watch and to join the Old Guard \nfor a moment to honor the sacrifices memorialized at the tomb.\n  Tourists don't often show up during hurricanes or in driving \nsnowstorms or at 2 o'clock in the morning in sleet and hail, but the \nOld Guard does. They commit 2 years of their lives to this service, \nunder the strictest of conditions.\n  I asked this young sergeant, ``Why? Why do you do this?''\n  His answer was simple and direct: ``Because, sir, we want to \ndemonstrate to our fellow Americans that we will never forget.''\n  For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I bring this bill to the House today \nwith the unanimous support of the entire California congressional \ndelegation. We do so to ensure that our fellow Americans never forget \nMarine Staff Sergeant Sky Mote.\n  In consultation with his family, we have identified a mountain in the \nJohn Muir Wilderness of the Sierra National Forest overlooking where \nSky Mote and his family often camped and hiked. This bill proposes that \nit forever more be known as Sky Point as a token of our Nation's \nrespect of his heroism, its appreciation of his sacrifice, its sympathy \nfor his family, and of its solemn pledge that succeeding generations of \nhis countrymen will never forget him.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 979 will designate a mountain peak in the John Muir \nWilderness of the Sierra National Forest in California as Sky Point in \nrecognition of fallen Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Sky Mote.\n  Sky served our country honorably as a U.S. marine for 9 years. He had \none tour of duty in Iraq and two in Afghanistan. As a member of the 1st \nMarine Special Operations Battalion, he was deployed to Afghanistan as \npart of Operation Enduring Freedom. However, on August 10, 2012, Sky's \nbattalion received heavy gunfire from an attacker dressed as an Afghan \npolice officer.\n  Jumping into action, Sky exposed himself to the gunfire in order to \ndistract the shooter and draw his attention away from his fellow \nMarines. In his final act of valor, he engaged the attacker in the \nopen, allowing his comrades to find safety.\n  For his heroic actions, Sky received the Navy Cross, a Purple Heart, \nthe Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal, a Navy-Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal, two Combat Action Ribbons, and three Good Conduct \nMedals.\n  The mountain peak this bill seeks to name in his honor was very \nspecial to him. Every year, creating lasting memories, Staff Sergeant \nMote and his family would set up camp beneath its point on hunting \ntrips to the area. By designating that mountain peak ``Sky Point,'' we \nwill honor Sky Mote's memory and ensure his selfless sacrifice for his \ncountry and fellow Marines is not forgotten.\n  I just hope that the many hunters, mountaineers, and backpackers who \nvisit Sky Point have an opportunity to learn of the man for whom the \npeak is named.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, we can name this unnamed peak as a \nsmall measure of our Nation's gratitude to this noble soldier, noble \nwarrior, Staff Sergeant Sky Mote, for all he has done for us on our \nbehalf. It is a fitting tribute, and it is the least that we can do for \nhim and his family.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Arizona \n(Mr. Grijalva) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1335 makes a decent Federal law a better Federal \nlaw, and I commend the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for his \nleadership and his dedication to strengthening and updating our Federal \nfisheries laws.\n  The bill that we have before us today on the floor represents years \nof hard work on a comprehensive reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act. That is why this bill was \ngiven such a high priority by our committee and was such a major effort \nof trying to make this one of the first bills we brought out.\n  This bill was originally passed in 1976, was updated in 1996 and \nagain in 2006, and illustrates the same principle: that all bills age. \nAnd though principles of government may be eternal, specific \nadministrative laws are in need of constant review by a legislative \nbody. That is our job. This bill does that. It is a good bill for our \neconomy. It is a good bill for our jobs.\n  In 2012, the seafood industry had a sales impact of $141 billion, $59 \nbillion in value-added impacts, and supported 1.3 million jobs earning \n$39 billion in income.\n  The U.S. commercial fishermen directly contributed with 9.6 billion \npounds of fish and shellfish harvested, earning another $5.1 billion in \nrevenue from their catches. There are 11 million recreational saltwater \nanglers, spending $25 billion on trips and gear in 2012, generating $58 \nbillion in sales impacts and supporting 300,000 to 400,000 U.S. jobs.\n\n[[Page H3592]]\n\n  Commercial and recreational fishermen and the seafood industry that \nmanages how the fish get from the boat to our table, they support this \nlegislation. I want to reemphasize that that is perhaps unique. For the \nfirst time, all three elements--commercial, seafood industry, \nrecreational fishermen--are all in support of updating this law in this \nparticular fashion.\n  This bill provides flexibility, and it is a bill for the entire \nNation. So it provides the flexibility that is essential for the \nfishing community in New England. It provides and incorporates State \nand local data on making fish population assessments, which is \nsignificant for the fish community in the Gulf of Mexico. It provides \ngreater transparency as to how management decisions are made in a very \nopen way, which is what it is supposed to be doing in the first place.\n\n  The proposed changes were not developed overnight. The Natural \nResources Committee held 10 hearings, heard more than 80 witnesses over \nthe last 4 years in deliberating over the changes that are needed to \nthis particular law. That is why I am very pleased with the positive \nstatements that have been made by both sides of the aisle on this \nlegislation.\n  During the last Congress, the ranking member at that time said ``the \nchanges that were negotiated on a number of provisions of the bill'' \nwere something for which he thanked the majority.\n  Another one of the minority members was quoted also as saying: ``I do \nappreciate the fact that you reached out to us on the Democratic side \nof the aisle and many of the provisions, as you mentioned, that are in \nthe bill did come from input from the Democratic side.''\n  Those words speak for themselves. This bill is the product of years \nof work, having reached out to Members on both sides of the aisle, \nhaving reached out to Members in different regions of our country, \nreached out to stakeholders of varying perspectives, and we reached out \nto the agency to craft a reauthorization that improves the process. We \nhave done that.\n  It is unfortunate in my mind the administration recently announced \nopposition to this bill. Rather than giving you my thoughts on that--or \nmaybe that is a reason why you would support it in the first place--let \nme simply quote the New Bedford Standard-Times. They did an editorial \nin their paper in that bastion of conservatism, Massachusetts. They \ndisagreed with the White House's opposition to the bill, and they ended \nby saying: ``Looking at the bill and its accomplishment of making \nmanagement more responsive to science, and contrasting it with the \nempty arguments of the White House policy statement, it seems very \nclear where politics fits into this.''\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill is a win for consumers. It is a win for the \nindustry that puts food on our tables. It is a win for the restaurants. \nIt is a win for the recreational fishermen. It is a win for better and \nmore transparent science. It is a win for our environment. It is a win \nfor the American taxpayers. There is no significant increase in the \ncost, but there is a significant increase in the solutions in this \narea, which is, once again, why all the major players who were involved \nin this--both the commercial side, recreational side--are in common \nagreement that this is the way we need to go forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Last year, the Natural Resources Committee reported a bill almost \nidentical to this one with only one Democratic Member voting in favor. \nDubbed the ``Empty Oceans Act'' by fishermen and conservationists \nacross the country, the bill met stiff opposition both on and off \nCapitol Hill, and the Republican leadership did not bring it up for \nconsideration by the full House. That showed remarkable restraint and \ngood judgment.\n  Fast forward 1 year to today's debate and the vote on legislation \nthat has the same flaws and has drawn the same opposition. The only \nreal difference is this time around, not a single committee Democrat \nvoted to report the bill. Committee Republicans did not reach out to us \nto discuss changes that might have made this a bipartisan effort, even \nthough the original Magnuson-Stevens Act and the 1996 and 2006 \nreauthorizations were bipartisan and passed both Houses of Congress \nwith virtually no opposition.\n  Those efforts made necessary, legitimate, and incremental changes to \nU.S. fisheries law that have moved us closer and closer to achieving \nthe goal of sustainable, profitable fisheries. We had an opportunity to \nreauthorize Magnuson and continue moving in the right direction, but \nonce again, House Republicans have let partisanship get in the way of \nprogress.\n  Instead of working with us to craft thoughtful, targeted legislation \nto update Magnuson, Republicans have taken this as an opportunity to \nassault bedrock conservation laws while at the same time taking us back \nto fisheries management policies that we know have failed fishing \ncommunities in the past.\n  As Chairman Bishop said himself, when testifying before the Rules \nCommittee last month, these are ``not just modest amendments, these are \nmajor amendments.'' I could not agree more.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Provisions in the bill which will end successful efforts to rebuild \noverfished stocks and coastal economy are major amendments. Short-\ncircuiting public review under NEPA is a major amendment. Overriding \nthe Endangered Species Act, the Antiquities Act, and the National \nMarine Sanctuaries Act laws that have made fisheries more sustainable \nand productive by protecting vulnerable sea life and valuable ocean \nhabitat are major, major amendments.\n  These amendments are also unnecessary. NOAA recently announced that \nthe value of U.S. fisheries has reached an all-time high, while the \nnumber of overfished stock has reached an all-time low. We should \ncelebrate these gains, but also recognize we have room for improvement.\n  Not all fisheries have received the benefit of the transition to the \nsustainable harvest levels because transition is still underway. For \nexample, overfishing of Atlantic cod in New England waters occurred in \n2013 and 2014, despite the Magnuson mandate to end overfishing. The \nscience-based conservation measures in the law will end this \noverfishing, rebuild the stocks, but not if the bill before us were to \nbecome law.\n  We must stay the course: fully rebuild fisheries that can contribute \nand will contribute $31 billion to the economy and support half a \nmillion new jobs. We cannot afford to go back to the bad old days where \npolitics trumped science in fishery management. Instead, let's go back \nto the drawing board and work together on a bill to reauthorize \nMagnuson-Stevens and keep improving on our fisheries.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally.\n  The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. McClintock) assumed the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3592-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed bills of the following titles in which the \nconcurrence of the House is requested:\n\n       S. 184.

Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the sponsor of this piece of \nlegislation. He is the senior member of our committee, as well as \nsomeone who knows more about this issue than probably anyone else on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Thank you to the chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. Chairman, history is a wonderful thing. People who went through \nthe\n\n[[Page H3593]]\n\nsame experiences see things differently. For the record, I would like \nto correct the ranking member. While he is correct that the Magnuson \nbill that eventually became public law, H.R. 4946, passed the House \nunder suspension of the rules, the original bill which passed the \nNatural Resources Committee, H.R. 5018, passed after a very long \nmarkup, with a vote of 26-15, with only four Democrats voting in favor \nof the bill. The gentleman from Arizona voted against the bill and \nsigned dissenting views with six other Democrats. So this point that \nthe previous reauthorization acts were noncontroversial and nonpartisan \nis not true. I think whoever wrote that for the gentleman ought to, \nagain, do a little correct history.\n  Mr. Chairman, as one who sponsored this bill way back in 1975, and it \nbecame law in 1976, it is probably the most successful legislation that \never passed this House to create a sustainable yield of fisheries for \nthe United States of America. And to have someone try to hijack this \nlegislation by interest groups when all those involved--the fishermen, \nthe recreational, the commercial, the restaurants, the conservationists \nthat know fisheries, the State of Alaska and all other States--support \nthe Magnuson Act and the improvements we have made in this bill--yes, \nwe have some flexibility.\n  The bill would amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act, \nthe premier law, as I mentioned before. It allows for regional \nmanagement of fisheries. The law gives guidance through its national \nstandards and creates the process that allows the councils to develop \nfishery management plans. The councils provide a regional or \nconstituent-based approach.\n  Remember, this is not about the government. This bill was written by \nthis Congress for the people, not NOAA, not NMSA, not the State \nDepartment, not the Sierra Club, and not the Pew group. It was written \nfor fishermen for sustainable yields of fish for the communities. It \nprovides a regional concept. It is critical to the protection of \ncoastal economies and for allowing the stakeholders to be part of the \nmanagement of the fisheries.\n  To address the ever-changing needs of fisheries and fishing \ncommunities--and I have been through this thing four times from the \noriginal to today--the Congress has passed various amendments to this \nact. Changes were based on knowledge of the times gained through \nexperience, improvements in science, and better management techniques.\n  In the mid-1990s, Congress addressed overfishing, included \nprotections for habitat, improvements for fisheries science, and \nreductions in bycatch. These were the issues of the time, and they were \naddressed as needed. A factor of that time also included the lack of \nresources to fund stock assessments to provide needed data to the \nregional fishery management councils, something that continues to be an \nissue today.\n  Mr. Chairman, a lot of decisions are made without science. The act \nwas last amended in 2007. Congress included measures to set science-\nbased annual catch limits to prevent overfishing, including a \nrequirement to end overfishing within 2 years. Accountability measures \nwere adopted, which meant harvest reductions if harvest levels were \nexceeded. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, we have \nnow reached the point where overfishing has effectively ended in this \ncountry.\n  H.R. 1335 started being developed 4 years ago. The committee held \nover a dozen hearings, with testimony from over 100 witnesses. As with \npast reauthorizations and in line with a main purpose of the act--to \nbalance conservation with economic use of the resource--H.R. 1335 \nfollows a middle road.\n  While many today may complain the bill's flexibility rolls back \nscientific protections, that is just not accurate. The flexibility in \nthe bill is based on science. Rebuilding of fish stocks will be based \non the biology of fish stock. Harvest levels will still be based on \nscience and at levels where overfishing will not occur. The regional \ncouncils will continue to follow recommendations of their Science and \nStatistical Committee.\n  Mr. Chairman, during every reauthorization cycle, the Magnuson-\nStevens Act is updated to be closely in sync with current-day science, \nmanagement techniques, and knowledge. As the fishermen, communities, \nthe councils, and fishery managers develop better techniques and learn \nlessons from implementing the law, Congress can take that knowledge to \nimprove that law.\n\n  Flexibility is cornerstone of the law. The Magnuson-Stevens Act \npromotes regional flexibility recognizing differing ocean conditions, \nvariations in regional fisheries, different harvesting methods and \nmanagement techniques, and distinct community impacts.\n  Again, I want to stress this, Mr. Chairman. This bill was written for \nfish and communities, not all these other interest groups. As I said in \nthe Rules Committee, I will not stand by and watch other interest \ngroups hijack this piece of legislation, taking away the sustainable \nconcept of our fisheries and the healthy concept of our fisheries and \nthe healthy concept of our communities for other reasons and other \ncauses. If you want to do that, do it in an independent legislation. We \ndon't need any ocean antiquity acts.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional \n1 minute.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, we don't need any sanctuaries in \nthis bill. We don't need some outside groups telling the fishermen, the \ncommunities, and the scientists--it is our belief--when they know \nlittle about it.\n  I happen to have the largest coastline in the whole of the United \nStates all put together, and we have done the job we should be able to \ndo. This bill makes this job easier for the United States of America \nfor giving us the ability to have a sustainable yield of fish and the \ncommunities to be taken care of.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I agree with the distinguished chairman, Mr. Young, \nthat the Magnuson Act is working and that we should leave it alone and \nallow it to work. The inclusion of previous reauthorizations of the \nAlaskan model, science-based, has been a key reason why it continues to \nwork.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps), my colleague.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1335, which \nwould undermine the proven and effective management of our Nation's \nfisheries. For nearly 40 years, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, MSA, has worked to protect America's \nfisheries and coastal economies. In more recent years, it has \nestablished programs to protect and restore depleted fish stocks, \nensuring these resources will be around for years to come. And, Mr. \nChairman, these programs are working. In fact, last year marked the \nlowest number of fishery stocks subject to overfishing or overfished.\n  Ensuring that fish stocks are healthy is essential to the long-term \nsuccess of the fishing industry and to food and job security. But \nprotecting and restoring these stocks require that we both acknowledge \nthe need to manage our fisheries and fund the science necessary to \nproperly assess their health. Unfortunately, H.R. 1335 does just the \nopposite.\n  Instead of working in a bipartisan manner to improve and modernize \nMSA, H.R. 1335 would dismiss and roll back existing effective \nmanagement efforts. It would weaken proven management standards. It \nwould reduce the efficacy of fish stock rebuilding programs, and it \nwill undermine existing laws that work in concert with MSA to protect \nour fisheries. And it would create gaping loopholes that allow for \noverfishing and mismanagement under the guise of increasing \nflexibility. These misguided provisions would threaten the viability of \nan entire industry and harm the health of our oceans simply to benefit \na few special interests.\n  Mr. Chairman, effective fishery management ensures a sustainable \nindustry by accounting for uncertainty and environmental change. And \nMSA works\n\n[[Page H3594]]\n\nhand in hand with other environmental legislation to ensure the long-\nterm viability of fishery resources. Yet H.R. 1335 needlessly unravels \nthis well-balanced system by undercutting other existing protections \nunder key longstanding laws like the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, \nlike the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy \nAct.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is bipartisan agreement on the need to protect \nand promote America's fishermen and the fishing industry, but rather \nthan building on what is already working under current law, this bill \nwould gut the proven management system that is currently in place.\n  We should work together and be striving to enhance smart, effective \nmanagement and provide the resources our Nation's fishing communities \nare asking for. H.R. 1335 is shortsighted and counterproductive, and I \nurge all my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Wittman) to further speak about a position or an \nissue that has the support of the recreation community and the industry \nat the same time, which is unique. He is one of the senior members of \nour committee.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, as co-chairman of the Congressional \nSportsmen's Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1335, the \nStrengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in \nFisheries Management Act, and would like to thank my colleagues, \nChairman Rob Bishop and Subcommittee Chairman Don Young, for all their \nefforts to bring this important piece of legislation to the House floor \nfor a vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, according to the latest report released by the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in 2012, the U.S. domestic \nseafood industry had a sales impact of $141 billion and supported \napproximately 1.3 million jobs. H.R. 1335 makes the necessary reforms \nto support these jobs and our fishermen by promoting better science and \nrequiring State and local data to be considered in Federal \ndecisionmaking about fisheries.\n  Last year I spoke with commercial fishermen from the Pacific Coast, \nAtlantic Coast, and the Gulf of Mexico, and the common theme in our \ndiscussions was the need for better data and scientific analysis to \nimprove management.\n  The U.S. has a long and profitable heritage in fishing. To continue \nthat heritage, we need to have quality, diverse data and scientific \nanalysis to facilitate educated decisionmaking on fishery management. \nH.R. 1335 allows for just that.\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill increases transparency and provides much-\nneeded flexibility in the law for fishery managers to properly consider \nthe environmental and economic impacts of decisions affecting fishing \ncommunities. And it is important to note that H.R. 1335 makes all of \nthese key reforms to fisheries management without authorizing any new \nadditional Federal spending. We can do the job with the existing \nresources.\n  This bill also makes great strides in the saltwater recreational \nfisheries. Saltwater recreational fishing alone has a $70 billion \nimpact on our Nation's economy and supports over 454,000 jobs. Marinas, \ngrocery stores, restaurants, motels, lodges, tackle shops, boat \ndealerships, clothing manufacturers, gas stations, and a host of other \nbusinesses and entities benefit from the money spent by recreational \nanglers.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  This industry does not just impact coastal communities but enables \njob creation and robust economic development in a variety of regions \nacross the country.\n  Improving recreational data collection and a transparent review of \nallocations in the Southeast are all great tools that H.R. 1335 gives \nNOAA to effectively manage a recreational industry that is a \nsignificant economic player in the United States economy.\n  H.R. 1335 is widely supported by a coalition of sportsmen and \nconservation groups, including the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation \nand the Center for Coastal Conservation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1335 in support of \naccess to our Nation's resources and the 1.3 million jobs that are \nsupported by fishing.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In addition to more than 100 commercial and recreational fishing \ngroups and related businesses that have all opposed this legislation \nfrom the Atlantic Coast, Pacific Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and related \nfishery and commercial areas, John Sackton, Seafood News, a respected \nmarket analyst for seafood, said that this act is a ``recipe for \noverfishing, unsustainability, and would move U.S. world-class \nfisheries management backwards.''\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), \nranking member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for the \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 1335, legislation that is very important \nto reauthorize the historically bipartisan Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  While I have nothing but the utmost respect for my colleague from \nAlaska (Mr. Young), I am afraid that I fear that this legislation would \ntake our fisheries management system in the wrong direction.\n  The bottom line is Magnuson-Stevens is working today. U.S. fisheries \nhave been remarkably successful since the last reauthorization in 2007, \nand if it isn't broken, why should we try to fix it?\n  According to NOAA, 37 important fish stocks have been rebuilt to \nhealthy population levels since 2000, and the number of stocks subject \nto overfishing has been cut nearly in half since 2006.\n  H.R. 1335 would eliminate critical conservation tools that have been \nessential to our recent success and would also undermine critical \nenvironmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act and the \nEndangered Species Act. I hope that we can work towards a compromise so \nthat Magnuson-Stevens can be reauthorized in a bipartisan manner, as \nthe last two bills were. Until then, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposing H.R. 1335.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice), another great worker and \na member of our committee.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support \nof H.R. 1335, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing \nFlexibility in Fisheries Management Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would, first of all, like to thank the bill's \nsponsor, our colleague from Alaska (Mr. Young), for his continued \nleadership on this important issue. Additionally, I commend Chairman \nBishop for ensuring that this bill has gone through regular order while \nbeing considered by the Natural Resources Committee.\n  H.R. 1335 makes necessary improvements to the Magnuson-Stevens Act. \nAs you know, Mr. Chairman, our U.S. commercial fishermen generated $5.1 \nbillion in revenue between 2012 and 2014, and I know that with these \nnecessary changes and improvements our fishermen will be able to \ncontribute even more to our economy.\n  In addition to the impact that H.R. 1335 has had on our commercial \nfishing industry, this legislation also has a strong impact on the \nrecreational side of the industry. For an industry that generates $58 \nbillion in sales while supporting nearly 400,000 jobs, H.R. 1335 \nencourages our local professionals to have a more active role in \ndetermining regulatory measures rather than the one-size-fits-all \nmanagement approach that has been used in the past.\n  Furthermore, H.R. 1335 will also adjust the method of counting red \nsnapper mortality. This is an important issue for the recreational \nfishermen because it will increase access to the waters in the Gulf of \nMexico so that our Nation's sportsmen have the ability to enjoy our \nnatural resources while making valuable contributions to the economy at \nthe same time.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation has been crafted in a delicate way to \nensure the necessary balance between our commercial and recreational \nfishermen. Both sides of the fishing industry will benefit from this \nbill and provide our States with more input.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1335.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pallone)\n\n[[Page H3595]]\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1335, the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization before us today.\n  Management of fisheries in the United States is extremely important, \nespecially in my home State of New Jersey, where the fishing industry \nis an important economic driver of the State's economy, generating \nbillions of dollars a year in revenue and supporting tens of thousands \nof jobs.\n  This bill passed out of the House Natural Resources Committee without \na single Democratic vote, and President Obama has threatened to veto \nit. This doesn't need to be a partisan issue. We should be working \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to make commonsense reforms to \nMagnuson-Stevens.\n  There are important fishery management reforms in this bill that I \nstrongly support, such as the flexibility language and modifications to \nthe annual catch limit requirements. However, I am troubled by the \nlanguage in the bill that makes unnecessary changes to NEPA, the \nEndangered Species Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and the \nAntiquities Act.\n\n  This bill would vest much of the authority over these statutes in the \nfishery management councils instead of with the appropriate Federal \nagency. It is not appropriate to vest regulatory authority for these \npurposes in a body like a fishery management council.\n  Fishery managers play an important role in crafting fishery \nmanagement measures in consultation with NOAA fisheries. Yet, they lack \nthe expertise to appropriately review and analyze the impacts and \nrequirements of NEPA or the Endangered Species Act.\n  The legislation, Mr. Chairman, does include specific language I \nauthored on recreational data collection, and I would like to thank the \nauthors for including this important section. The goal of this language \nis to ensure the fishery management councils are collecting the best \ninformation possible about recreational fishing. It would implement a \ngrant program to allow States to improve recreational data collection \nand require the National Research Council to issue a report on \nimprovements that have been made and need to be made with recreational \nfishing data collection and surveying. This will help us understand \nwhat is actually happening with fishing in any given year and ensure \nthat we aren't needlessly closing healthy fisheries.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are positive reforms to Magnuson-Stevens in this \nlegislation, but unfortunately it weakens important environmental laws \nsuch as NEPA and the ESA in the process. I think that is unfortunate. I \nwish we could have had a bipartisan bill that actually reforms \nMagnuson-Stevens in a preferable way.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey joining us here. I have to \nadmit in somewhat chagrin, I quoted you earlier in my speech when you \nwere saying something very positive about this bill last time around. \nBut I would also like to state for the record the concept of the Garden \nState Seafood Association, which is from your home State of New Jersey \nand which also supports this bill, as they had said simply that it \nadjusts ``certain specific problematic regulations that have not proven \nto function as intended since they were added or amended in the last \nreauthorization a decade ago.''\n  There are problems with the status quo this bill fixes.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), \nalso a farm worker of our committee, and with appreciation for an \namendment that he added in committee that made a significant impact, \nespecially for the recreational fisheries of America.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the \nchairman of the committee.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1335, the Strengthening Fishing \nCommunities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee for \nincluding my amendment in support of the findings of the Morris-Deal \nCommission.\n  One of the top priorities of the Morris-Deal Commission was requiring \na review, and adjustment if warranted, of the allocations of mixed-\nsector fisheries.\n  Despite the tremendous importance that allocation decisions have in \nmaximizing the benefits that our fisheries provide to the Nation, \nFederal fisheries managers have refused to revisit allocations--most of \nwhich were determined decades ago--primarily because of a lack of clear \nguidance on how decisions should be made and because these decisions \nare inherently difficult.\n  My amendment included in the committee text would prompt the \ndevelopment of criteria that should be considered in allocation \ndecisions and require periodic allocation reviews. The language does \nnot prescribe any specific shifts in existing allocations but rather a \nscience-based review and potential adjustment if needed.\n  Recognizing the high number of important recreational fisheries in \nthe region, the geographic scope of this provision is limited to just \nthe South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico.\n  You see the poster beside me. As vice chairman of the Congressional \nSportsmen's Caucus, I represent 1.3 million anglers in the \norganizations on this poster that they belong to that support this \nbill.\n  Let us be clear: the goal here is to allow more fishermen, whether \nthey are commercial fishermen or recreational anglers, to be able to \ntake more fish in a responsible manner. We want policy based on sound \nscience compatible with the facts in the water, not the uninformed \nopinions of an agenda-driven desk jockey bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.\n  This provision was in the MSA reauthorization bills introduced by \nSenators Rubio and Begich in the 113th Congress.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues on the Natural Resources \nCommittee for helping include this language, and I urge passage of the \nfinal bill. This is common sense to reauthorize Magnuson-Stevens. The \ngentleman from Alaska has done a tremendous job on this, and I urge \npassage.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaine (Ms. Pingree).\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Grijalva for the time.\n  I rise to support the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, \nbut not the bill we have before us today.\n  Like many of my colleagues here in Congress who represent coastal \nStates, I know the importance of a vibrant fishery and the importance \nof Federal policy in this area that keeps our Nation's fisheries moving \nforward. I live on a small offshore island, and many of my neighbors \nmake their living as fishermen, as do many of my constituents.\n  The most lucrative fishery in my area is for lobsters, and it is one \nof the most successful and sustainable fisheries in America because \nlobstermen and -women have taken the long-term view.\n  It is so successful and so sustainable because it has been carefully \nregulated for decades. Strict rules have led to bigger and bigger \ncatches and rising income for fishermen.\n  This fishery is proof that building a strong fishery happens first by \nensuring there is a resource for fishermen to harvest.\n  Iconic species like haddock and pollock have been devastated by \noverfishing. They can still make a comeback, but not if we turn our \nbacks on them and the fishermen who depend on them.\n  The collapse of many of these fisheries has taken its toll on fishing \nfamilies and fishing communities, but slowly rebuilding these species \nis rebuilding our hope for the future.\n  Now is not the time to abandon these efforts. Now is not the time to \ngive up on the progress we have already made.\n  The only way to guarantee healthy fishing communities over the long \nterm is to rebuild the fish stocks using science-based methods, and I \nwould ask my colleagues to support more funding for science.\n  The future of many coastal communities is based on sustainable \nfisheries, not rolling back management systems that give just a few \nfishermen a short-term boost.\n  I urge my colleagues to support many of the amendments that will be \non the floor this afternoon that will try to improve this legislation, \nand I urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill.\n\n[[Page H3596]]\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur), another hard-working \nmember of our committee.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, there are probably almost as many boats \nas people in my district, and that is because I represent one of the \nmost beautiful stretches of the Atlantic Ocean, from north to south, \nthe southern part of the Jersey Shore.\n  I have thousands of charter and commercial fishermen and tens of \nthousands of recreational fishermen who either make their living from \nthe sea or get some respite and go out and do some recreational \nfishing.\n  I hear from them all the time that the current Magnuson-Stevens Act \nis simply not working any more for them. It is outdated. It is \narbitrary. We are continuing to protect fish stocks that have been \ncompletely rebuilt, and it is based on knee jerk, not sound science \ntoday. It is desperately in need of reform.\n  The economic impact in my State alone is $1.3 billion from the \nrecreational side and over $2 billion from the commercial side. It is \n30,000 jobs. There is nobody who lives along the coast who wants to go \nback to the Wild West days when anyone can catch whatever they want and \ndestroy the fish stocks. Nobody wants that, but the current system is \nnot working, and it needs to be reformed. This is a good bill that \noffers real solutions.\n  It preserves fish stocks; yet it recognizes the needs of our \nfishermen, and it relies on fact-based science. An amendment that I \nproposed and I am particularly pleased with is that it encourages \nmarine students to be involved in the data collection, and it requires \nthe government to look to them for that. We can do it at a lower cost \nand with better results.\n  I encourage my colleagues not to let the perfect become the enemy of \nthe good. It is a good bill, and it deserves to be approved. I urge my \ncolleagues to stand behind it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Graham).\n  Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, in the panhandle of north Florida, red \nsnapper is a way of life. Thousands of commercial fishermen and charter \nboat captains depend on a healthy catch to make a living.\n  Tens of thousands of recreational fishermen spend their free time and \nare personally invested in fishing, and hundreds of restaurants serve \nred snapper to hundreds of thousands of visitors to the area every \nyear. Seafood is a $7 billion industry the Gulf, and red snapper is a \nbig part of it.\n  Like any valuable asset, we need to preserve our fisheries for future \ngenerations. I applaud the chairman and the ranking member for opening \nthis dialogue about how we can improve current law, protect our ocean \nresources, and best serve our constituents. Unfortunately, I think this \nbill falls short in its current form.\n  My constituents tell me there are more red snapper in the Gulf than \nthere have been in a long time. I think that shows, at least in part, \nthat this law is working, but I also hear of widespread distrust of the \nsystem and of the data that the system produces. In that regard, \nMagnuson isn't working nearly as well as it could, and I want to \nrecognize some of the healthy reforms in this bill that could improve \nthe situation.\n  It is an extraordinary challenge to count all of the fish in the \nsea--it is nearly as hard to count how many fish are being caught--but \nI think we could do both better by getting the States and stakeholders \nmore involved and by promoting modern electronic monitoring \ntechnologies as this bill does.\n  Despite those good provisions, Florida would not be Florida without \nample opportunities for recreational fishing and a robust commercial \nfishing sector. While current law isn't perfect, I think the \ncontentious nature of this floor debate is a good indication that this \nbill isn't going to do anything to narrow the divisions between \nsectors.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. GRAHAM. The better alternative is to keep doing what is working \nand to improve data collection techniques where they are lacking.\n  To that end, I am proud to support an increase of $10 million, \nincluded in the CJS appropriations bill, aimed at improving the stock \nassessments and research needs for Gulf of Mexico fish stocks. These \nare the kinds of efforts that build real confidence in the fishery. I \nlook forward to a meaningful conversation about how we can work \ntogether going forward.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the courtesy you gave \nto the gentlewoman from Florida in allowing her to finish her \nstatement. She illustrates very clearly how the problems that exist are \nstructural problems that can't simply be solved if we just add more \nmoney to the situation.\n  To further that issue, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from \nFlorida for her comments.\n  In Texas, we have a great snapper fishing industry as well--anglers, \nrecreational. We have charter boat captains. We have a lot of \ncommercial industry as well. By the way, my daughter and first three \ngrandchildren live in Florida, so Florida is my second home.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to talk about H.R. 1335 and a proposed amendment \nby the gentleman from Louisiana, my great friend, Garret Graves, to \nchange the snapper fishing system.\n  The problem is that the plan that has been developed in his amendment \nis actually a plan that was developed by five people in secrecy who \nwant to change the way NOAA does things and turn it over to the five \nStates. That is a bad idea, and I will tell you why for just a whole \nbunch of reasons.\n  The current plan has been working since 2007, which actually doubled \nthe population of snapper. Indeed, it has provided a 30 percent \nincrease in the quota this very season. Businesses have been working \nall along the Texas coast and--to my gentlewoman friend from Florida--\nthe Florida coast and the whole Gulf Coast area to develop lasting \nfisheries because their livelihoods depend on it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am an air conditioning contractor. We have an air \nconditioning commission there in Texas that regulates us. We want \npeople on that commission who understand the HVAC industry. We do \neverything in the industry to promote the industry, to make sure that \nwe have a good, stable industry that takes care of customers in Texas.\n  I have to know and believe that it is the same way about the fishing \nindustry. They want the fisheries to last. Restaurants depend on it. \nAmericans depend on it. It is not just the anglers but those who want \nto go eat at some of the restaurants the gentlewoman from Florida \nreferenced. There are a lot of groups opposed to Mr. Graves' \namendment--the National Restaurant Association, the Texas Restaurant \nAssociation. Mr. Chairman, I have a list of 42 others.\n  Gulf red snapper is an American treasure, and it should be accessible \nto all, not just to those who can get a boat and a trailer and go fish \nfor themselves. They ought to be available to all of the restaurants. \nWe have heard the facts and figures about the number of jobs and the \namount of revenue that have been brought in and how big that industry \nis.\n\n  My good friend from Louisiana, Dr. John Fleming, who is a member of \nthe committee, has publicly stated that some tweaking is needed, but by \nall three groups of stakeholders: charter boat fishing, the commercial \nfishing industry, and the individual anglers. I heard with my own ears \nthe chairman of the Natural Resources Committee state his willingness \nto work with all three groups in the coming days.\n  Mr. Chairman, government should not be in the business of picking \nwinners and losers. To allow the group of five States to implement a \nplan--an unknown plan, I might add--would only put pressure on those \nindividual States to outsupply the other States with a longer fishing \nseason to attract anglers, tourists, and their money to outcompete the \nother States.\n  Fisheries would be devastated, and the livelihoods, jobs, and markets \nthat are supplying red snapper to restaurants all across the country \nwould be gone. Ultimately, it is the American consumers, who have come \nto like the\n\n[[Page H3597]]\n\nlocal seafood, who would be disenfranchised, not to mention the \nbusinesses that supply them.\n  Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater or, dare I say, the \nfish with the saltwater. Let's bring all parties together in a \nthoughtful, deliberate, meaningful discussion that benefits all \ninvolved, not just a few.\n  For this reason, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe gentleman from Louisiana's amendment, well intentioned though it \nmay be.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time \nremains?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to my esteemed \ncolleague from California (Mr. Lowenthal), a member of the Natural \nResources Committee.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, if gutting the successful conservation \nprovisions of Magnuson were not enough, the problem also is that this \nbill will also weaken other bedrock environmental laws.\n  First, it makes Magnuson then in this reauthorization the controlling \nstatute in the case of any kind of conflict with the Antiquities Act or \nthe National Marine Sanctuaries Act.\n  If we think about this, there is no rationale for giving the councils \nthat are authorized in Magnuson the authority to regulate fishing in \nmarine sanctuaries or in monuments. Those areas represent just a tiny \nfraction of U.S. waters, and now, they are managed by scientists and \nother staff who consider more than just fishing interests.\n  We are really here to understand how do we balance fishing with the \nother purposes in order to protect vulnerable species and habitats. For \nthe same reason that we don't allow State fish and game departments to \nmake decisions about hunting in national parks or monuments on land, \nwhich we don't allow, these councils should not make decisions about \nfishing in our parks, our national marine sanctuaries, or in our \nnational monuments at sea, but that is not enough.\n  The bill also takes a swipe at the Endangered Species Act by \nrequiring these councils, not Federal agencies which are now \nresponsible for the recovery of species, to implement the fishery \nrestrictions necessary for Endangered Species compliance. These \ncouncils lack expertise, and they lack the resources to implement the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  What are we going to end up with? We are going to end up with \nrecoveries that are going to be delayed, and the negative impacts to \nfishing communities are going to be prolonged, just the very thing that \nwe wish not to happen.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. As I said before, these assaults on key conservation \nlaws are far outside the scope of a fisheries bill. We are really \ntalking about a fisheries bill. We should not be talking about gutting \nkey conservation laws.\n  It is unfortunate that an historically bipartisan effort like the \nMagnuson reauthorization has now become the subject of an \nantienvironmental crusade.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), who will address an issue that will be \npart of this bill and the discussion as it comes up.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. I thank the chairman, and I would also \nlike to thank Don Young for helping those of us recreational anglers as \nwe try to remedy an injustice that has been done to the American \nsportsmen of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I have listened to some of my colleagues say we should be fair and \npeople should come to the table. Let me tell you what is happening at \nthe table.\n  Mr. Chairman, the commercial fishermen get to fish 365 days a year \nfor red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico. They get to use long lines and \nwinches; yet the National Marine Fisheries Services and Dr. Roy \nCrabtree, through the Gulf Council, have chosen to limit to 10 days the \nman and the woman who just want to take their kid fishing, 10 days.\n  They think, by expanding the recreational season back to where it was \nbefore, that somehow that would hurt the fish in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Now they tell us that the reason they have had to cut us to 10 days \nis because there are so many more fish today and they are so much \nlarger today that the recreational fishermen simply catch them much \nfaster.\n  Well, in 2007, the recreational angler had 194 days to fish with \ntheir families in the Gulf of Mexico--194 days. In 8 years, they have \ntaken the American family, the American sportsman, down to simply 10 \ndays. It is proof that the American sportsman doesn't have a chance \nwith the Federal Government in charge of the rulemaking process in the \nGulf of Mexico with regard to the recreational snapper season.\n  The Garrett amendment, which I support, as I support the chairman's \nmain piece of legislation, would simply give the States the right to \nset, based on science--not some arbitrary number, but based on \nscience--the recreational seasons and bag limits for the recreational \nangler in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is the only way--that is the only way--that the \nrecreational season will be restored as we, the recreational anglers, \nwere promised it would be restored when the stocks came back.\n  Now, one of the things I think we also need to discuss as we go \nforward with regard to snapper is who do the snapper belong to.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, there are about 300 people \nthat are currently allocated about 50 percent of the fish, the red \nsnapper, in the Gulf of Mexico. When the commercial quota goes up, they \nautomatically get an increase. Those fish belong to the public, and I \nthink it is time to discuss whether or not any increase in the \ncommercial quota should actually come and be auctioned as any other \npublic resource would be when we made those additional resources \navailable.\n  For now, the Garrett amendment goes a long way towards restoring the \nrights of the American angler, and I certainly hope that this House \nwill support it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In closing, Congress first enacted the Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act in 1976, and the primary goals were two: to end the \nunregulated fishing by foreign fleets in U.S. waters, and to develop \nour domestic fleets that could reap the economic benefits of all the \nfishery resources, considerable resources that our Nation had.\n  The law worked. Foreign fishing was phased out and investments in \ndomestic fleets were increased. Unfortunately, this capitalization \nworked so well that domestic fishing soon replaced foreign fleets in \noverexploiting U.S. fisheries.\n  In 1996 to 2007, the reauthorizations were enacted to end \noverfishing, period, promote rebuilding of overfished stocks, protect \nfish habitats, improve fisheries and habitats, and minimize bycatch. \nThese changes ended overfishing in nearly all fisheries and put \noverfished stocks on a path to rebuilding. Most important, they \ninsulated fishery management councils from pressure to make politically \ndriven decisions that hurt fishing communities in the long run.\n  Contrary to those previous reauthorizations, H.R. 1335 was developed \nwith very little input from Democrats and was ordered reported on a \nparty line. I should note, at the last reauthorization, the other body \nmade significant changes to the House-passed legislation and created a \nmore bipartisan template that many of us could support.\n  The supporters of this bill will argue that the requirement to \nrebuild overfished stocks needs more flexibility, but the Magnuson Act \nhas already proven to be plenty flexible. The law allows councils to \ndelay rebuilding when the biology of the stock environmental conditions \nor international management considerations present challenges. Because \nof these broad but fair exemptions, more than 50 percent of all \noverfished stocks have rebuilding plans longer than a 10-year baseline \nin the act.\n  Further, current law gives councils 2 years to put a rebuilding plan \nin place and an additional year to reduce, rather than end, \noverfishing. That is 3 years of lead time before significant harvest \nrestrictions go into effect.\n\n[[Page H3598]]\n\n  What is more, the act only requires a rebuilding plan to have a 50 \npercent likelihood of success. If a council loses this coin flip, it \ndoes not have to shut down the fishery; instead, it has to start over. \nThis is exactly how things have played out over the past few years with \nAtlantic cod in New England, where many argue the act has been too \nflexible.\n  History shows us that when councils have an excuse to delay \nrebuilding overfished stocks, the job will never get done. This bill \nmakes up the following excuses that allow councils to avoid rebuilding:\n  It is too hard to work with other countries that may be impacting the \nstock of the fish, so we should just catch more, too, and deplete the \nstock faster;\n  The stock of the fish cannot be rebuilt by only limited fishing, so \nthere is no point to trying to limit fishing if the effort is 99 \npercent of the problem;\n  It is inconvenient to rebuild the overfished stocks that swim with \nhealthy stocks, so we should just keep catching the weak ones until \nthey are listed under the Endangered Species Act;\n  And my personal favorite, there are unusual events that make \nrebuilding more difficult.\n  These excuses are each bad enough alone, but together they would \nrender the rebuilding requirements of Magnuson completely meaningless. \nThis bill would not give the Magnuson Act more flexibility; it would \nbreak it. With that, I urge a ``no'' vote on the legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  There are some agencies of government that, if a bird were to fly \nover the Capitol, they would claim credit for it. That, perhaps, is one \nof the situations in which we find ourselves today. The problem is the \nstatus quo is not effective; it is not working.\n  Those who work and live in this area deal with this industry. They \nrecognize that there is something that needs to be changed. That is \nwhy, as I stated earlier, the Garden State Seafood Association said \nthere are problematic regulations that have not proven to function as \nintended--that is, in the status quo--while the National Fisheries \nInstitute, another group that actually supports this bill, wants to do \nso because it would more effectively coordinate with the councils who \nare currently there.\n  We have a situation right now in which Southerners have spoken here--\nthe gentleman from Texas, the gentlewoman from Florida--about problems \nthat exist within the status quo. We are presenting, now, a bill that \nis supported by those who are working in the industry, supported by \nthose who are commercial fishermen, and it is also supported by all the \ngroups that represent the recreational fishers. They realize that this \nbill needs more flexibility.\n  To have a standard 10-year plan for every species when some of those \nspecies don't last 10 years is silly; it lacks common sense. We need to \ndo that. There needs to be transparency, as some decisions are made \nbehind closed doors. This bill mandates that that would not be the \ncase. It needs to make sure that scientific data from all sources is \nused and recognized. That is not happening in the status quo. There \nneeds to be the ability of cutting red tape.\n\n  Some people have talked about the change of NEPA without recognizing \nfirst that the law already mandates a similar process to NEPA, which \nhas the exact same information. Requiring all these agencies to go \nthrough their process and then go through NEPA does not add to \neffectiveness or efficiency but does add to the opportunity of greater \nlitigation costs.\n  All those issues are addressed in this particular bill. It needs to \nbe reauthorized. We need to move forward. This is one of the bills that \nhas taken a long time. It is 4 years in the process, with lots of \ndiscussion, lots of amendments. We are now moving this bill forward so \nit can go to the Senate. They can work their will. We can come back to \na conference if necessary, but we must move forward in this for the \nbenefit of the communities that use this area as their livelihood as \nwell as this area as their recreation. The present system has flaws \nthat need to be fixed.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to \nH.R. 1335, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing \nFlexibility in Fisheries Management Act. This short-sighted legislation \nundermines the longterm sustainability of fish populations putting fish \nstocks, coastal communities, and our nation's economy at risk.\n  In California, we are fortunate to have access to one of the world's \nmost productive marine ecosystems. The California Current system drives \nhighly productive fisheries that support 158,000 jobs and more than $25 \nbillion annually in commercial and recreational sales impacts. \nNationwide, fisheries generated $199 billion in sales impacts in 2012 \nand provided 1.7 million jobs. Commercial and recreational fisheries \nare a critical part of this nation's economy whose continued prosperity \ndepends on getting fisheries management right.\n  In 2015, California entered its fourth year of extreme drought. This \nwinter's snowpack levels were the lowest since 1950 and precipitation \nlevels are at critical lows. That spells bad news for California \nsalmon. High water temperatures lead to poor survival and low flows \nleave salmon stranded in drying pools. Unfortunately, this is not the \nfirst time we have faced this problem. In 2008, low flows and high in-\nstream temperatures coupled with low ocean productivity caused a crash \nin salmon populations, and for the first time since 1848, the \nCalifornia salmon fishery was closed and declared a federal fishery \ndisaster. The Pacific Fishery Management Council had already prepared a \nfishery management plan for salmon, in accordance with the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) guidelines, that \nprompted the fishery closure and set strict limits on harvest while the \nstock was rebuilding. Since the closure, salmon fisheries have \nrebounded, due in no small part to the swift action of the Council \nunder the fishery management plan and rebuilding guidelines established \nby the MSA.\n  While we cannot make it rain in California, we can ensure that well-\ninformed management of offshore salmon fisheries do not jeopardize the \nsustainability of this commercially-valuable species. The more fish we \nconserve in the ocean, the more return to streams to spawn, increasing \nour chances of making it through this drought with a salmon fishery \nintact.\n  The fact is, MSA is working. The implementation of stock rebuilding \nplans and annual catch limits have resulted in the recovery of 37 fish \nstocks since 2000. NOAA's 2014 Status of Stocks report indicates that \nfish stocks that are overfished or subject to overfishing are at an \nall-time low. This is a far cry from the overexploited, overcapitalized \nfisheries of the past. We should be moving forward to build on those \nsuccesses, not rolling them back. Since 2006, commercial fisheries \nrevenue has risen 43 percent, and the rebuilding of all U.S. fish \nstocks would provide an additional $31 billion in annual sales impacts \nand support 500,000 new jobs. Instead, H.R. 1335 would delay rebuilding \ntimelines and allow exemptions to continue overfishing on depleted \nstocks, which is both ecologically and economically irresponsible. \nCurrent MSA provisions have proven their effectiveness in rebuilding \nstocks and provide the way forward for realizing our fisheries' full \neconomic potential. There's something to be said for the old adage, \n``If it's not broken, don't fix it.''\n  That's not to say that fisheries management should remain stagnant. \nJust as scientific data collection and fisheries science is changing \nand improving, our fisheries management statute should also change to \nreflect the best available science. Fisheries managers and scientists \nhave acknowledged that there are areas for improvement, including \nproviding more clarity and flexibility within the current statutory \nlimits. To that end, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is \ncurrently undertaking a revision of the National Standard 1 guidelines, \nthe regulations that govern fisheries management objectives and stock \nrebuilding timelines, to provide greater clarity on which fish stocks \nrequire rebuilding plans, greater flexibility for rebuilding timelines, \nand to incorporate the latest in ecosystem-based fisheries management. \nThe proposed revisions would address many of the concerns outlined in \nthis bill without undermining the critical conservation measures that \nhave led to MSA's success. The determination on how to best manage fish \nstocks for a sustainable, profitable future is best left to the \nscientists, not Members of Congress.\n  Our oceans are increasingly under threat from climate change and \nocean acidification, making strong, effective fisheries management more \ncritical than ever. Unfortunately, H.R. 1335 does not deliver and I \nurge a NO vote on H.R. 1335.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n\n[[Page H3599]]\n\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Natural Resources, printed in the bill, it shall be in \norder to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nconsisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-16.

Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in \nthe report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered \nread, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally \ndivided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be \nwithdrawn by the proponent at any time before action thereon, shall not \nbe subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for \ndivision of the question.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Dingell\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \nHouse Report 114-128.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 14, strike line 15 and all that follows \n     through page 16, line 3 and insert closing quotation marks \n     and a following period.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Dingell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, the National Environmental Policy Act, \nalso called NEPA, is a critically important law, not only for \nprotecting the environment, but also for protecting the people's right \nto participate in government decisionmaking. Sadly, H.R. 1335, the bill \nwe are considering today, would short-circuit public review and comment \non fisheries management decisions, casting NEPA aside in favor of an \ninadequate, poorly defined process that would make regional fishery \nmanagement councils the ultimate arbiters of whether or not their own \ndecisions would impact coastal communities and ocean ecosystems.\n  Forcing important NEPA analysis to be fast-tracked onto a council's \ntimeline would eliminate crucial oversight steps that provide \nstakeholders an opportunity to impact the public policy. While I know \nmy colleagues had good intentions, the practical impact of this \nlanguage means that local communities and businesses will not have the \nsame opportunity to comment and have input on decisions that will \nimpact their livelihood.\n  I don't think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really \nwant to limit public participation in this manner. My amendment simply \nstrikes the harmful language from the bill that undermines NEPA because \nlimiting transparency and accountability is not the right thing to do.\n\n[[Page H3604]]\n\n  NEPA has a simple premise: look before you leap. For decades, NEPA \nhas improved our environment and fostered fairness in our communities \nby ensuring that government remains accountable to the people. The NEPA \nprocess requires Federal agencies to review their proposed actions in \nlight of their potential impacts on the human environment: the places \nwhere we all live, work, and play.\n  Most importantly, NEPA gives the public an opportunity to review and \ncomment on actions proposed by the government, adding unique \nperspectives to the evaluation process that highly specialized, \nmission-driven agencies might otherwise ignore. In that way, NEPA is \nthe ultimate check on Big Government, a uniquely American and \nquintessentially democratic--small D--law written and executed to help \npeople protect their rights and freedoms. Our Founding Fathers would \ncertainly be proud.\n  I hope that my colleagues will agree that existing NEPA protections \nshould be preserved, and I ask that you vote in favor of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, in response to the amendment, I \nsimply have to say no, it does not assume the system.\n  We do have a problem with transparency in the process that we have. \nThe underlying bill changes that by requiring these decisions to be \nmade public and made openly, but the specific issue that dealing with \nNEPA misses a step, misses an important point here.\n  Current law requires fishery management plans contain a fishery \nimpact statement. That is required by law now, required by the bill as \nwell. That is in line with everything you go through to do an \nenvironmental impact statement under NEPA.\n  What this amendment would do is simply require the process to do \neverything twice. You do a fishery impact statement first, and then you \nrestate and redo the same business with the same cost attached to it \nfor the NEPA analysis. That is simply red tape.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  It is an unnecessary delay. It makes some of the scientific \ninformation obsolete before they are done. It burdens the management \nand the resource council, which is why those, once again, who work in \nthis system have said this is an unnecessary part and one of the \nreasons they like the efficiency that has been added by the basic, \nunderlying bill.\n  The most important reason, though, why you don't want to accept this \namendment is, if you add two different approaches, two different \nstatements that have to be made, you give attorneys two different \nopportunities to litigate. You give more opportunities to litigate, \nmore opportunities to delay, and that is ridiculous. It lacks common \nsense because you are doing the same thing in both processes. Cut the \nred tape, cut the litigation opportunity, cut the delays, and help us \nmove forward.\n  I reject this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Michigan has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. \nPingree).\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Dingell \namendment.\n  As many of us in Congress know, our Nation's fisheries do not work on \nartificial timelines. If we want to be sure that fishery plans are \ngetting the critical National Environmental Policy Act analysis that \nconserve and preserve our resources, we can't force these NEPA studies \nto be fast-tracked.\n  The underlying bill would force important environmental analyses to \nbe rushed and, therefore, cut stakeholders out of the process due to \nrapid timelines.\n  At a time when we are trying to make sure that we keep stakeholders \nengaged in the process, they would actually get less consideration \nunder the bill that we have on the floor today.\n  We need to ensure that our communities are given a chance to weigh in \non these plans, and in that process that we take a thorough look at the \nenvironmental impacts of these plans.\n  My colleague has said that her amendment would restore common sense \nand requires us to look before we leap. I couldn't agree more.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose artificial timelines for environmental \nreviews, and I urge my colleagues to support the Dingell amendment.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to quickly respond to some of the \ncomments made by the other side.\n  Federal agency responsibility for NEPA is effectively being \neliminated by this law and an alternative, undefined process is being \nestablished hindering the public's ability to influence policies and \nprotect their rights.\n  Stakeholders, including businesses and individuals, would get less \nconsideration in the council process and would not have a way of \nvoicing their concerns and influencing the directions of plans or \nprojects that could threaten the environment or the livelihoods of \nthese people. It is simply common sense that plans to manage our \nvaluable resources be properly assessed before resources are harvested.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alaska \n(Mr. Young), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I would just, again, like to remind my \ncolleagues this was requested by the communities so there wouldn't be a \ndelay. We are not eliminating NEPA. There is already a process in the \nMagnuson Act which was not there in the original act, I will say that, \nand I did support it when it went in. But to duplicate it and to \nrequire outside interests that they cannot respect those in the \ncommunity--which is really what her amendment would do. It lets other \noutside interest groups get involved in this issue of sustainable \nfisheries.\n  This has always been a fishery community bill, not an outside bill or \ninterest groups getting into the issues of sustainability and community \nactivity through transparency. What you do is you start a duplication \nof the process. It is not necessary. We are not eliminating NEPA. We \nare just adding to it.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Let me close by simply saying this. The \nenvironmentally friendly approach would be not to accept this amendment \nbecause think of all the trees you are going to save from reprinting an \nextra report that says the same thing over again.\n  We are already doing this process in the law. Requiring NEPA plus the \nfishery statement is simply a replication of the process that is \nalready there. It does not need to be there. You are not cutting anyone \nout, as has been said. It is simply one of those things that you need \nto do it the first time and do it right the first time, and you don't \nhave to redo it a second time to allow lawyers to then come up with \nanother chance to litigate one more time.\n  I reject the amendment. I urge its rejection.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan will be \npostponed.\n  The Chair understands that amendment No. 2 will not be offered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Keating\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \nHouse Report 114-128.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 28, line 7, strike ``and''.\n       Page 28, line 11, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 28, after line 11, insert the following:\n       ``(C) fishery research and independent stock assessments, \n     conservation gear engineering, at-sea and shoreside \n     monitoring, fishery impact statements, and other priorities \n     established by the Council as necessary\n\n[[Page H3605]]\n\n     to rebuild or maintain sustainable fisheries, ensure healthy \n     ecosystems, and maintain fishing communities.''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Keating) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, my amendment builds off of years of \nefforts to reform the use of the asset forfeiture fund. During this \ntime, NOAA has conducted internal reviews and audits for the use of \nasset forfeiture monies. Yet I believe it is important that we \nauthorize specific uses to help our struggling fishermen and, at the \nsame time, promote sustainable fishing.\n  My amendment would ensure that forfeiture funds are used for five \nthings: first, enhancing fishery research and stock assessments. This \nbill authorizes the use of State personnel and resources, things like \ncooperative research between industry and public science and use of \nvessels to serve a data-poor fisheries. My amendment expands beyond \ndata-poor fisheries by authorizing broader use of forfeiture funds for \nresearch and independent stock assessments.\n  This is particularly important in the Northeast, where timely \ninformation may be the difference between the success or failure of a \nsmall fishing business.\n  Secondly, it deals with at-sea and shoreside monitoring. If there is \none concern that I have heard consistently voiced from fishermen from \nNew Bedford to the South Shore to Provincetown in Massachusetts, it is \nthe transition of funding for monitoring from NOAA to fishermen.\n  It has been nearly 3 years since the Department of Commerce declared \na fishing disaster in the Northeast. As the fishing industry continues \nto face the long-term challenges coming back from this disaster, this \nis no time to switch the burden of the cost of monitoring onto them.\n  Third, it advances conservation gear engineering. Additional funds \nwill help fishermen develop and adopt new gear and technology to \nimprove efficiency, reduce the impact on the marine environment, and \npromote sustainable fishing for future generations.\n  Commercial and recreational fishermen use an array of gear to target \ntheir catch. An unfortunate and fatal consequence is the inclusion of \nuntargeted fish, turtles, and marine mammals as bycatch. Fortunately, \nthere have been efforts underway nationwide to promote sustainable \nmeans of fishing, like scallopers in New Bedford developing the turtle \ndredge to protect sea turtles from interaction during scalloping, and \nthe New England Aquarium collaborative that has developed acoustic \npingers that successfully warn marine mammals away from gill nets.\n  Fourth, the amendment will help with additional research for fishery \nimpact statements. Under the bill, councils are required to develop \nfishery impact statements that take into account the purpose of a \nproposed management plan and its potential impact on fisheries and \nfishing communities. In doing so, the bill shifts the responsibility \nfrom NEPA to the councils. And while I have concerns about how this \nwill be implemented, I do believe it is critical that we provide \ncouncils with adequate resources.\n  Finally, the bill and the amendment will help funding priorities of \nthe regional fishery management councils, like efforts to rebuild or \nmaintain sustainable fisheries and ensure healthy ecosystems.\n  There is no doubt that additional funding for these efforts is a win \nfor fishermen on all coasts of our country.\n  With that, I yield the balance of my time to my colleague from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Moulton).\n  Mr. MOULTON. I would like to thank my colleague and friend from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Keating) for the time, and for all the work that he \nhas done, along with Mr. Lynch, on behalf of our Commonwealth's fishing \ncommunities.\n  I rise in strong support of this amendment, which clarifies the uses \nof NOAA's asset forfeiture fund so we can make smart investments in \nscientific research and preserve an economically viable fishing \nindustry.\n  This amendment will provide our fishermen, shoreside businesses, and \nfishing communities with the assurance that the money in NOAA's asset \nforfeiture fund will go towards improving the science behind \nsustainable fishery management practices.\n  Additionally, the amendment offers fisheries councils the resources \nthey need to better serve our fisheries and fishing communities.\n  At the end of the day, both the fishermen and the environmentalists \nwant the same thing: healthy and sustainable fisheries. I believe that \nthe amendment will help achieve this objective through meaningful and \ntargeted uses of NOAA's asset forfeiture fund. I urge a ``yes'' vote on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. KEATING. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim \nthe time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to \nthe amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nUtah?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. In 2010, the Department of Commerce inspector \ngeneral reported that NOAA was misusing these funds for all sorts of \npurposes not actually helping the fishing community. That is one of the \nreasons why we are clearly saying the status quo has problems, and this \nbill needs to go forward.\n  This bill recognized that these funds should not be used to add to \nthe bureaucracy, and therefore in the base bill we actually put in \nprovisions to allow up to 80 percent of these enforcement funds to be \nused for collection and data and science.\n  What Mr. Keating and others have done, though, is take the process \none step further in something I think is a very commonsense solution to \na problem that we do have in the status quo. I appreciate what you are \ndoing, and I support this amendment.\n  I urge everyone to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Keating-Lynch-\nMoulton amendment to allow monies from the asset forfeiture fund to be \navailable for expanded uses. I want to commend my colleagues from \nMassachusetts for their continued efforts on behalf of our fishing \nindustry.\n  Massachusetts has a long and proud fishing history. in fact, the \n``sacred cod'', a nearly five foot long woodcarving of an atlantic \ncodfish, has hung in the Massachusetts House of Representatives since \n1794, representing the importance of the cod fishery to the \ncommonwealth.\n  We all know the state of the fishing industry today. Depleted stocks \nand the policies put in place to rebuild those stocks have exacted a \nheavy toll. And we have all heard the stories of fishing families \nstruggling to make ends meet and keep their generations-long family \nbusinesses alive. Our amendment is a common sense amendment which, if \nadopted, will build on and improve the systems put in place to assess \nand rebuild stocks while also providing some financial relief to the \nmen and women who continue to earn a living at sea.\n  Our amendment, if adopted, will provide the funding necessary for \nfisheries councils to undertake certain reporting requirements of the \nunderlying bill. Our amendment will also provide funding for \nindependent research and stock assessments and for the development and \nimplementation of gear that will reduce the impact on the marine \nenvironment and promote sustainable fishing for future generations. \nAnd, importantly, this amendment will also provide a funding stream to \npay for at-sea and shore-side monitoring, a financial burden that \nfishermen simply cannot bear.\n  We simply cannot allow the money in the NOAA's asset forfeiture fund \nto be wasted when fishermen stand to benefit from targeted scientific \nresearch and resources dedicated to the fishing industry.\n  The health of the resource is the basic building block upon which all \nindustry dependents rely. And it is critical that all parties; \nfishermen, fisheries councils, researchers and conservationists work \ncooperatively and also strike an appropriate balance towards \nsustainability. Our amendment provides the financial support to help \nall stakeholders further invest in and maximize the outcomes of their \npiece of the larger puzzle.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Keating-Lynch-Moulton Amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \nHouse Report 114-128.\n\n[[Page H3606]]\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 13 (page 34, after line 22), add the \n     following:\n       (h) Process for Decommissioning Oil and Gas Platforms and \n     Drilling Rigs.--The National Ocean Council, operating under \n     Executive Order 13547, shall convene a meeting of \n     representatives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental \n     Enforcement, the States represented on the Gulf of Mexico \n     Fishery Management Council, and stakeholders, to develop a \n     process for decommissioning oil and gas platforms and \n     drilling rigs that eliminates harm to the Gulf of Mexico red \n     snapper stock of fish and enhances conservation of habitat of \n     such stock.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, the bill before us, H.R. 1335, \nundermines nearly two decades of progress making U.S. fisheries \nprofitable and sustainable.\n  A few weeks ago, NOAA reported that overfishing has hit an all-time \nlow, and the number of rebuilt stocks has hit an all-time high, largely \nbecause of the success of the Magnuson-Stevens Act reforms of both 1996 \nand 2007--the same reforms that this bill today before us would \nundercut.\n  In an attempt to add some good policy to an otherwise unproductive \nbill, I am offering an amendment to improve the management of one \nimportant fish stock: the Gulf of Mexico red snapper.\n  Last year, during a series of Natural Resources Committee hearings on \nfisheries policies, we heard from members and witnesses who were irate \nover the fact that the Interior Department was allowing offshore oil \nplatforms and drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico to be decommissioned \nin a way that was killing red snapper and destroying important snapper \nhabitat. After intense questioning, it became clear that in the current \nprocess for decommission rigs, NOAA, which is part of the Department of \nCommerce, is not regularly consulted by Interior agencies.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  As a result, NOAA does not even conduct surveys to determine if the \nDepartment of the Interior is about to dismantle a productive \nartificial reef teeming with red snapper and other fish.\n  Mr. Chair, I agree with my colleagues from the Gulf States who feel \nthis is ridiculous and needs to stop; but how do we do it? Then I \nremembered that we already have a mechanism in place for resolving \nexactly this kind of multistakeholder conflict at sea. It is called the \nNational Ocean Policy.\n  Through the National Ocean Policy, the National Ocean Council \nfacilitates commonsense governance of public resources. Like air \ntraffic control for the seas, the council coordinates all of the users \nof our oceans and helps them determine safer, less contentious, and \nmore efficient utilization of ocean resources.\n  My amendment would direct the agencies responsible for implementing \nthe National Ocean Policy to work with the Gulf States and other \nstakeholders to develop a transparent process that would preserve red \nsnapper habitat during rig decommissioning.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote for more recreational fishing \nopportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and a vote for a bipartisan \nsolution to promoting red snapper habitat.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Lowenthal amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Young) on this particular amendment.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, this same amendment was offered in \ncommittee; it failed. It is my understanding that rigs and platforms \nare already required to eliminate harm under their leases. In fact, \nmost of the fishermen I talk to on the Gulf say the platforms are \nreally manmade reefs, and the red snapper love them.\n  Overall, I don't support giving the National Ocean Council any \nauthorities. The council is created by executive action, and until the \nCongress passes legislation regarding the National Ocean Policy, \nCongress should not implement measures to support it.\n  This is not an action of Congress. This is an action by executive \norder. Remember, this bill originally was sustainable yield, \nsustainable communities, nothing to do with an ocean council deciding \nwhat is going to happen to override the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  This is a bad amendment, and I oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. As you just heard from the other side of the aisle, \nMr. Chair, they agree with me that there needs to be more coordination \namongst all the stakeholders to make smart decisions about rig \ndecommissioning in red snapper habitat; but they refuse to move forward \nwith this proposal simply because they oppose the National Ocean Policy \nwhich incidentally, as we all know in this room, that its predecessor \nwas the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which was first established by \nPresident Bush.\n  They oppose the National Ocean Policy on the grounds that it is a \nprogram that is authorized by an executive action or an executive order \nof a President that they don't like. This seems to me to be pretty \npetty.\n  Why would we create now a new group to bring together the \nstakeholders to address just this one issue, when we already have a \ncouncil and a policy that can do exactly what everyone wants to be \ndone?\n  National Ocean Policy is not a failed policy like some suggest, nor \nis it an instance of executive overreach. It is merely a commonsense \nway to facilitate multistakeholder collaboration on complex ocean \nissues.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment directs agencies and stakeholders to work \ntogether to come up with solutions to decommission rigs that work for \neveryone involved. This is a commonsense solution that promotes red \nsnapper habitat and more recreational fishing opportunities.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Lowenthal amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves).\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom California for offering this amendment. We had the opportunity to \ndiscuss this in committee.\n  I am very sensitive to the fact that we do things in a manner that \nsustains all of our fisheries and protects our ecosystem.\n  However, as we discussed in committee, I did request of you, number \none, that if you let us get together as Gulf States, continue to work \ntogether with the Department of the Interior--as I mentioned in \ncommittee, we have even larger concerns about the way that some of this \nimportant reef structure, such as rigs and reefs programs and others, \nhave been handled by the Federal Government.\n  I respect the gentleman for offering this amendment, but I am going \nto vote in opposition, giving us time to work together with industry, \nwork together with the fisherman, and find the right way to do this to \nensure that we protect the species.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, allow me to conclude the debate, if \nI may.\n  Last year, in Congress, we had a hearing where we saw a huge number \nof red snappers who were killed by the removal of a decommissioned oil \nplatform that had been authorized by the Department of the Interior. \nThis amendment does not really change that.\n  What this amendment would do is an attempt--hopefully, futile \nattempt--to basically give validity to the administration's National \nOcean Policy, a policy that was done without transparency, almost in \nthe cover of darkness, and implemented by executive order.\n\n[[Page H3607]]\n\n  What we are talking about is not something that is an executive \naction, but, as properly said by the last two speakers from our side, \nit is a legislative action, and this bill takes that legislative \nresponsibility and does it the right way.\n  We do not need a nontransparent executive order to be enforced here. \nWhat we need to do is allow the agencies of jurisdiction to actually do \ntheir job, defend their rules, and allow the legislative branch to work \nits will.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee).

Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentleman \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering today \nmakes a few clarifications to the underlying bill.\n  It modifies language in the bill allowing for the use of graduate \nstudents in the collection of recreational fishing data. The fields of \nscience the graduate students are studying is expanded, and when the \nstudents can be used is clarified.\n  The amendment also clarifies that guidance prepared by the National \nAcademy of Sciences regarding the economic benefits of commercial and \nrecreational fishing within the mixed-use fisheries is to be given to \nthe south Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico councils.\n  The amendment will also modify the provisions in law regarding the \ncouncil review of limited access programs to include not only the \nbenefits of the program, but also any adverse impacts.\n  Lastly, the amendment includes language to allow stock assessments to \ninclude information from universities, fishermen, fishing communities, \nand research institutions, in addition to State and Federal fisheries \ndata.\n  It will also require a schedule for when stock assessments should \noccur and allows for a waiver if certain stocks don't need assessments.\n  These are good additions to the legislation, and I urge the Members \nto support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. The catch share reporting requirements and stock \nassessment mandates in this amendment would impose significant new \ncosts on NOAA, but the amendment provides no additional funding.\n  The majority already complains that NOAA does not conduct stock \nassessments frequently or quickly enough. This unfunded mandate would \nfurther slow that process.\n  Further, these concepts have not been vetted by the Natural Resources \nCommittee. We have not had an opportunity to get feedback on the \nlegislation from NOAA, the agency that would inevitably be responsible \nfor implementing it.\n  We need to hear from the administration about any potential costs or \nunintended consequences of this amendment.\n  In particular, the rigid requirements of the guidelines envisioned in \nthis bill would take away the discretion of expert scientists and \nundermine an ongoing effort NOAA is conducting to improve stock \nassessments across regions.\n  Further, the mandates, deadlines, and reports would likely cost money \nthat is not authorized to be appropriated.\n  I would like to have additional input on the requirements this bill \nimposes with respect to developing and following new guidelines on data \ncollection and on cost recovery by the agency.\n  For these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I disagree with the gentleman from \nNew Mexico's comments on this. This does not add an additional cost, \nand why people say that, I don't know.\n  All this does is very simple, and I explained it when I explained my \namendment, and I urge the passage of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. My good friend, Mr. Young, is perpetually trying to \nmove me to New Mexico. I still love Arizona and will remain in Arizona.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to say that the reasons of opposition have not \nchanged to the amendment. The unintended consequences, the lack of full \ninformation as to what the data collection will be, any impending costs \nthat would be secured that NOAA would have to undertake, and feedback \nboth by the agency that would be responsible, feedback from the Natural \nResources Committee, and feedback by the administration to this \namendment would be, I think, important additions in order for this \nHouse to be able to make an informed decision on the amendment.\n  Lacking that information, I remain urging a ``no'' vote on the \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Graves of Louisiana\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-128.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment made in \norder.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Graves) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, when I was a child growing up in south Louisiana, \nrecreational fishing for red snapper, we were allowed to go out all \nyear round. All year long, we could go out and go enjoy fishing with \nour family and access the bounties of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  As a matter of fact, the Gulf of Mexico is so productive, we don't \njust have great recreational fishing in south Louisiana; we have great \ncommercial as well. We have some of the best restaurants in the Nation.\n  We have a very robust commercial fishing industry. In fact, Mr. \nChairman, it is the second biggest commercial fishing industry only to \nthe State of Alaska, which I think is unfair because they get to weigh \ntheir crab shells.\n  Mr. Chairman, the reality is that we have seen the National Marine \nFisheries Service, over the last several years, continue to use science \nthat is not as robust as what the States are using to manage their \nfisheries.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. Chairman, access for the recreational fishermen went down from \nyear round when I was a child. Even in the 1990s, it was nearly 200 \ndays, down to this year, where the National Marine Fisheries Service \nsays that it is limited to only 10 days for recreational fishing. \nParents and their children can go out for 10 days.\n  Meanwhile, for the first time ever, the National Marine Fisheries \nService has split up the charter for hire and the recreational to allow \nthe charter for hire to go out for 45 days and effectively allow the \ncommercial fishermen to go out year round.\n  I want to be clear, Mr. Chairman. This isn't about pitting the \ndifferent fishing sectors against one another. What this is about is \nensuring that we are using the best science and ensuring that we are \nproviding access to all fishers--the recreational, the charter for \nhire, and the commercial. It needs to be based upon the best science. \nWe can have much better management of that resource by ensuring \nconsistency between State waters and Federal waters.\n  The five Gulf States have come up with a plan. Unanimously, the five \nGulf States have come up with a plan to manage those fisheries by the \nfive fish and game agencies among the five Gulf States.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply codifies that agreement of the five \nGulf States and allows those States to manage the red snapper fishery \nidentical to how the striped bass fishery is managed on the Atlantic \ncoast.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I am disappointed to see this amendment \nback again after it failed to pass in committee.\n  I understand that recreational fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico want \nto be able to keep more of the red snapper they catch, but the solution \nis not to steal fish from a responsibly managed and accountable \ncommercial sector that provides millions of Americans the opportunity \nto choose healthy, fresh, sustainable Gulf red snapper at stores and \nrestaurants; nor is it the solution to hand management over to Gulf \nStates before they have developed a plan for managing the resource that \nconsists of more than just ``trust us.''\n  Simple arithmetic shows that there are too many people putting too \nmuch pressure on the red snapper stock just to sustain a recreational \nfishing season that lasts for more than a few days. To address that \nproblem, private boat anglers will need to present creative solutions \nsuch as those that the commercial and charter for hire sectors have \ndeveloped.\n  NOAA is doing an incredible job rebuilding this stock under Magnuson, \nand the Gulf Council has the ability to debate and adopt a regional \nmanagement approach or other alternative management strategies without \ninterference from Washington.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I understand the concern of the \ngentleman from Louisiana on the current status of red snapper \nmanagement in the Gulf of Mexico and your interest to support actions \ntaken by the Gulf States that are supported by many of your \nconstituents.\n  The amendment being offered today is a start in the process, but I \nrespectfully suggest it needs further discussion. I support regional \nsolutions but have concerns with proposals that will take the red \nsnapper fishery outside of the Magnuson-Stevens Act management process.\n  I am willing to continue to work with the gentleman from Louisiana, \nChairman Bishop, and other Members, as well as fishing groups involved, \nto try to find a resolution to the management issues impacting the red \nsnapper fishery.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is supported by \nthe American Sportfishing Association; the Billfish Foundation; CCA, \nthe Coastal Conservation Association; the Center for Coastal \nConservation; the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation; the \nInternational Game Fish Association; National Marine Manufacturers \nAssociation; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Recreational Fishing \nAlliance; and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am struggling with understanding the concerns that I \nrecently heard expressed by the other side.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is identical to how the Atlantic striped bass is \nmanaged on our East Coast. Why is there not an amendment to withdraw \nthat authority if it is so problematic to have the five Gulf States \nconsistently manage the natural resources in their State waters, as \nthey do today, and in the adjacent Federal waters?\n  It has been proven through various hearings that the committee has \nhad that the science being used by the States is much better than the \nscience that is being used by the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I will continue to reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to include in the Record a one-pager that \nwas released by the various groups that I\n\n[[Page H3611]]\n\ncited, and I would also like to include in the Record a document that \nwas written in March of this year by the five Gulf States that explains \nthe management.\n\n         The State-Based Solution to Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper\n\n       In March 2015, the directors of the state fish and wildlife \n     agencies from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and \n     Texas announced an agreement for state-based management of \n     Gulf of Mexico red snapper, which in recent years has \n     experienced increasing privatization of this public resource \n     and decreasing recreational fishing opportunities.\n       Gulf of Mexico red snapper is presently managed by the Gulf \n     of Mexico Fishery Management Council, under the National \n     Marine Fisheries Service. The states' agreement, which is \n     predicated on transferring management authority away from the \n     Council, describes the key elements of a plan in which the \n     five Gulf states would coordinate management of red snapper \n     throughout the Gulf of Mexico through the proposed Gulf \n     States Red Snapper Management Authority.\n       Numerous regional and national fisheries organizations have \n     come out in support of the states' plan. The recreational \n     fishing community has long had a strong relationship with \n     state fish and wildlife agencies because of their ability to \n     manage fisheries resources in a way that allows for healthy \n     populations and public access. Most all of the nation's most \n     popular saltwater recreational fisheries are managed by the \n     states. Rarely, if ever, does overfishing occur in state-\n     managed recreational fisheries.\n       States are also tremendously successful at managing \n     commercial fisheries. Nothing in the Gulf states' plan \n     proposes to change how the commercial red snapper fishery is \n     managed.\n       It has become abundantly clear that the current Gulf red \n     snapper management system cannot produce successful outcomes \n     for recreational fishermen. Somewhere along the way of \n     rebuilding the fishery, to where it's now at an abundance \n     level beyond anyone's expectations, management went off the \n     tracks. A new path forward is needed, the states' are to be \n     commended for their willingness to take on this task.\n       Representatives Garret Graves of Louisiana and Jeff Miller \n     of Florida are championing this plan. They are working to \n     ensure congressional action on this issue aligns with the \n     five Gulf states.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 13, 2015.\n       To Whom It May Concern: Management of the red snapper \n     fishery in the Gulf of Mexico continues to be a major \n     challenge with increasing dissatisfaction among anglers and \n     serious calls for restructuring the Gulf red snapper \n     management system. As a result, a number of proposals and \n     various drafts of legislation for changing this system have \n     emerged. Recognizing that significant changes are being \n     considered, the marine fisheries directors from the five Gulf \n     States have been engaged in an effort to develop and document \n     an alternative to the current management strategy that has \n     mutual agreement and support. Together, we have developed a \n     framework for cooperative state-based management of Gulf red \n     snapper; the enclosed document outlines the conceptual \n     elements of that plan.\n       Under this alternative concept, the Gulf States would \n     coordinate management of red snapper throughout the Gulf of \n     Mexico through a new, independent body called the Gulf States \n     Red Snapper Management Authority (GSRSMA). The GSRSMA would \n     be comprised of the principle marine fisheries managers from \n     each Gulf States, and the management authority for Gulf-red \n     snapper would no longer reside within the Gulf of Mexico \n     Fishery Management Council.\n       The GSRSMA framework outlines a straightforward process \n     that would allow states to use flexible management approaches \n     to manage red snapper to meet local needs as well as Gulf-\n     wide conservation goals. Each state would be responsible for \n     all management of red snapper in their respective state and \n     adjacent federal waters. The GSRSMA would approve each \n     state's management plan, coordinate population assessments, \n     provide consistent accountability measures, and distribute \n     federal funding for research, assessment, and management.\n       Each state fisheries management agency places great value \n     in working together in partnership and collaboration to \n     ensure we have a robust, sustainable, and accessible red \n     snapper fishery in the Gulf. The states recognize the \n     importance of the red snapper fishery to the fabric and \n     identity of local communities throughout the Gulf as well as \n     the tremendous economic impact that it provides each state.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present to you the GSRSMA \n     concept agreed upon by each state. If there are any questions \n     or comments about the concept, please do not hesitate to \n     contact any of us directly.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robin Riechers,\n       Director of Coastal Fisheries, Texas Parks and Wildlife \n     Department.\n     Randy Pausina,\n       Assistant Secretary, Office of Fisheries, Louisiana \n     Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.\n     Jamie Miller,\n       Executive Director, Mississippi Department of Marine \n     Resources.\n     Chris Blankenship,\n       Director, Marine Resources Division, Alabama Department of \n     Conservation and Natural Resources.\n     Jessica McCawley,\n       Director, Division of Marine Fisheries Management, Florida \n     Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n       Enclosure.\n\n         Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority (GSRSMA)\n\n       This document outlines elements of a plan in which the Gulf \n     States would coordinate management of red snapper throughout \n     the Gulf of Mexico through the Gulf States Red Snapper \n     Management Authority (GSRSMA).\n\n\n                               Management\n\n       The governing body of GSRSMA would be comprised of the \n     principal fisheries manager (or his/her proxy) from each of \n     the five Gulf States. There would be a rotating chair serving \n     a two-year term. All actions of GSRSMA would be by majority \n     vote. The primary function of the GSRSMA would be approval of \n     each state's or group of states' Red Snapper Fisheries \n     Management Plan (hereafter referred to as the Plan) which \n     would address all components (commercial and recreational) of \n     the Gulf States red snapper fishery. The Plan may extend to \n     multiple years with annual review of specific components to \n     include, but not limited to: assessment methodology, data \n     collection, annual management measures and timelines.\n       The Plan would include an initial three-year prohibition on \n     any actions that might affect individual fishing quotas or \n     management structure of the commercial fishery, effective \n     from date of adoption by GSRSMA. During this period, NOAA \n     Fisheries through the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management \n     Council would continue to manage the commercial fishery under \n     existing regulations.\n       Each state would be responsible for the management of the \n     fishery in their respective state territorial sea and \n     adjacent exclusive economic zone (EEZ) water using the best \n     available science and information. The states would be \n     required to ensure overfishing will not occur through the \n     full range of management and assessment strategies available \n     to each state or group of states acting in concert. These \n     strategies would not be limited to those based on total \n     allowable catch. The GSRSMA, as a whole would annually review \n     and approve the red snapper management actions of an \n     individual state or groups of states acting in concert. If \n     the status of the fishery in each state is in equilibrium or \n     expanding, no change in management actions may be required. \n     If the status of the fishery is below equilibrium or \n     declining, the responsible state or states would be required \n     to take appropriate action to revise existing management \n     actions to establish equilibrium, and those actions would \n     have to be approved by the GSRSMA.\n       The GSRSMA or each state would be required to prepare an \n     annual report on the status of the fishery based on the \n     individual states (or states acting in concert) management \n     strategies and assessment methodologies. The GSRSMA will \n     conduct a periodic gulf-wide population review of red snapper \n     on a schedule not to exceed every 5 years.\n\n\n                               Assessment\n\n       Each individual state or group of states would conduct an \n     assessment of the status of red snapper populations within \n     their adjacent waters. The full range of assessment \n     methodologies would be available to each state or group of \n     states using the best available science to inform management \n     actions.\n       Assessments would be conducted periodically on a timeline \n     determined by the GSRSMA. Assessment methodologies and data \n     collection strategies for both fisheries dependent and \n     independent data would be approved by the GSRSMA. The GSRSMA \n     would be required to conduct a periodic and Gulf-wide \n     population review of the health of the fishery and status of \n     red snapper on a schedule not to exceed five years between \n     such assessments.\n\n\n                             Accountability\n\n       Each Gulf state would formally agree to comply fully with \n     management measures developed through the GSRSMA-approved \n     Plan under a memorandum of agreement. The GSRSMA could \n     request additional accountability actions through the \n     Secretary of Commerce if a Gulf state or group of Gulf states \n     adopted management measures or regulations significantly \n     inconsistent from the red snapper management framework \n     identified in the Plan when such inconsistent measures could \n     negatively impact the interests of other Gulf states with \n     regard to red snapper management.\n       The procedures established as part of the Striped Bass Act, \n     Sec. 5153--Monitoring of Implementation and Enforcement by \n     Coastal States would serve as a model for developing \n     procedures for action through the Secretary of Commerce \n     specific to the red snapper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico. \n     Federal action to provide accountability and ensure \n     consistency would be limited to the federal waters adjacent \n     to the state(s) that adopted inconsistent management measures \n     or actions.\n\n[[Page H3612]]\n\n     Under no circumstances would federal authority or action \n     supersede that of an individual state within designated state \n     waters.

State \n     regulations related to red snapper under the Plan would apply \n     to all fishing activities associated with red snapper landed \n     in a given state, not just state registered vessels.\n       State waters for all Gulf States would extend to nine \n     nautical miles for the purpose of uniform enforcement and \n     management actions related to red snapper.\n\n\n                                Funding\n\n       Federal funding specific to red snapper now going to \n     federal research, assessment and management would be \n     appropriated to the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission \n     and passed through to the states for use and distribution \n     under the GSRSMA.\n       Federal funding of enforcement that is currently provided \n     to the Gulf States for fisheries enforcement shall not be \n     reduced because of transfer of red snapper management to \n     GSRSMA. Federal agents will work in concert with deputized \n     state agents to enforce state regulations approved by the \n     GSRSMA.\n       The National Marine Fisheries Service will continue to \n     provide access to all fisheries data and services available \n     before transfer of red snapper management under the same \n     arrangements and conditions after the transfer of management \n     authority to GSRSMA.\n       Figure 1.

I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, in the same way Federal lands must \nbe accessible to sportsmen and -women, so must our Federal waters as \nwell.\n  I concur with the gentleman that there is an access problem with the \nred snapper. The underlying bill extends the Gulf State coastal waters \nto 9 miles, requires fish to be counted around reefs, and requires the \nincorporation of State and local data on red snapper management so that \nthe red snapper population will be counted.\n  Almost everyone agrees that the population is undercounted, but \ncounting more fish does not guarantee that recreational fishermen will \nhave more days in Federal waters.\n  I want to work with the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Miller of \nFlorida, and any other coastal States Representatives to have hearings \nand move along other bills that may come about.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just want to say \nthat I appreciate Chairman Bishop's offer to move legislation that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and I will be \nintroducing soon that pertains to this exact issue and to have hearings \non this as well.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chair, in Louisiana, we fish--whether that's \nenjoying a Saturday on the water for fun or making a living as a \ncommercial or charter fisherman.\n  That's why I stand with my Louisiana colleague, Garret Graves, in \nsupport of this common-sense amendment.\n  As an expert on policies affecting our Gulf Coast, Congressman Graves \nknows it is rare for all 5 Gulf states to agree when it comes to ocean \nmanagement and conservation policy.\n  So it's remarkable when these 5 states come together on a proposal to \ntransfer Red Snapper management in the Gulf of Mexico away from the \nfederally managed program that continues to fail recreational anglers.\n  That's all this common-sense amendment does--make this existing \nmanagement agreement into law.\n  I believe as Representative Graves does when states come together to \npresent a working proposal to Congress, we as their Representatives \nshould listen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support states' rights and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. With that, I withdraw the amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Wittman\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in House Report 114-128.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 29. AUTHORITY TO USE ALTERNATIVE FISHERY MANAGEMENT \n                   MEASURES.\n\n       Section 302(h) (16 U.S.C. 1852(h)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (8) as paragraph (9); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (7), the following:\n       ``(8) have the authority to use alternative fishery \n     management measures in a recreational fishery (or the \n     recreational component of a mixed-use fishery), including \n     extraction rates, fishing mortality targets, and harvest \n     control rules, in developing a fishery management plan, plan \n     amendment, or proposed regulations.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Wittman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would give the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, Fisheries the authority \nto implement management practices better suited to the nature and scope \nof recreational fishing.\n  I hope we can all agree that commercial and recreational fisheries \nare fundamentally different activities, with dissimilar harvest data \ncollection systems that can benefit from different management \ntechniques.\n\n[[Page H3613]]\n\n  Commercial fisheries are managed for yield. Commercial landings can \nusually be counted or weighed in realtime; thus, quotas can be enforced \nin realtime. This allows managers to close a fishery well before the \nallowable catch is exceeded. In short, a commercial fishery's catch can \nbe managed in realtime based on data from verified landings.\n  Recreational fisheries are different and should be managed for \nexpectation, as opposed to yield. Anglers fish for a variety of \nreasons, but a lack of fish will make them go less frequently or stop \naltogether. Anglers and fishermen need to believe they will have \nopportunity to encounter fish, with the hopes they may catch some, \npossibly including some large enough to take home.\n  Instead of yield, abundance and age structure are key elements to \nrecreational fisheries since those factors govern both the rate of \nencounters and the size of fish caught. Maximizing yield has little \nmeaning in most recreational fisheries. That is why NOAA's National \nMarine Fisheries Service should manage recreational fisheries based on \nexpected long-term harvest rates, not strictly on yield or poundage-\nbased quotas.\n  This strategy has been successfully used by State fisheries managers \nin our freshwater and coastal fisheries, providing exceptional \nrecreational fishing opportunities while ensuring sustainable fish \npopulations.\n  By managing the recreational sector based on harvest rate as opposed \nto a poundage-based quota, managers have been able to provide \npredictability in regulations while also sustaining a healthy \npopulation.\n  While the Magnuson-Stevens Act does not specifically prohibit such an \napproach, it should specifically direct the National Marine Fisheries \nService and regional councils to consider alternative strategies to \ncommercial management for appropriate recreationally valuable \nfisheries.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that provides \nadditional flexibility to improve the management of important \nrecreational fisheries.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I understand and appreciate the \nmotivation behind the gentleman's amendment. Recreational fisheries are \ninherently different from commercial fisheries. The language is similar \nto the alternative rebuilding strategy section in the underlying bill, \none of the few parts that does not harm conservation efforts.\n  However, that provision states clearly that the alternative \nstrategies must be in compliance with the requirements of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act, including ending overfishing, setting science-based catch \nlimits, and sticking to rebuilding timelines.\n  This amendment does not include those safeguards and, therefore, \ncould be construed as to allow overfishing or delay the rebuilding of \noverfished stock. We have made too much progress in managing fisheries \nto backtrack now.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would tell the gentleman from Arizona \nthat this amendment does not in any way stop National Marine Fisheries \nService or the councils from preventing overfishing and making the \nneeded changes to management.\n  This bill purely provides them the flexibility and adaptability to \nproperly manage recreational fisheries which, as the gentleman from \nArizona said, we all know are different than those commercial \nfisheries.\n  I want to make sure that they have the opportunity to manage the \nfisheries properly and especially in light of recreational fishermen \nand the local economies that depend on viable, sustainable recreational \nfisheries.\n  We know that we have to make sure we are making good resource \ndecisions, and we do that by providing that flexibility and \nadaptability. This amendment allows us to do that.\n  It allows recreational fisheries and the management thereof to be \ntreated different than commercial fisheries which we have all seen \nthrough time we must do if we are to manage them in the best interest \nnot only of the resource itself--that is the fish--but to manage it in \nthe best interest of our recreational fishermen and the economies that \ndepend on them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, without the safeguards that are included \nin the Magnuson-Stevens Act being part of this amendment, we continue \nto recommend a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in House Report 114-128.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 274, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Huffman) and a\n\n[[Page H3615]]\n\nMember opposed each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of our amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  I do want to express my respect and appreciation for the gentleman \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Young) and his commitment to fisheries management \nissues over the years. I know many Members, including myself, are very \nconcerned about the sustainability of the fishing industry in our own \ndistricts.\n  I represent about a third of the California coast, including many \nworking coastal communities; and the importance of marine fisheries to \nmy district and, I would say, to our country cannot be overstated.\n  U.S. fisheries have not only shaped the cultural identity of coastal \ncommunities, such as those I represent and our country, but they have \nalso contributed economically in a very significant way, nearly $90 \nbillion and 1.5 million jobs.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Recreational fishing provides important opportunities to bring \nfamilies and communities together, and, of course, subsistence fishing \nis a culturally significant tradition that provides an important food \nsource for many people.\n  However, I do not believe that H.R. 1335 represents a constructive \napproach to ensuring abundant resources for current and future \ngenerations of fishermen. This bill would take us backward in many \nrespects. It would roll back important elements of the Magnuson Act \nthat are critical to making fisheries and the fishing industry in the \nUnited States economically and environmentally sustainable. I also \ndon't believe that successful fisheries management has to include \ntaking potshots at bedrock environmental laws like the Endangered \nSpecies Act, the Antiquities Act, and NEPA, as this bill seeks to do. \nFor these reasons, I can't support it.\n  Congress first enacted the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 1976, with two \nmain goals: first, to put an end to unregulated fishing by foreign \nfleets in U.S. waters, and, second, to develop domestic fleets that \ncould reap the economic benefit of our considerable fisheries \nresources. It worked, and it worked so well that domestic fishing soon \nreplaced foreign fleets in overexploiting U.S. fisheries.\n  The 1996 reauthorization required regional fisheries management \ncouncils, for the first time, to end domestic overfishing and to \ndevelop rebuilding plans, and then the 2007 reauthorization added an \nimportant timeline for rebuilding plans and also enforced catch limits. \nThe original law, together with these amendments, established a \nfisheries management system in the United States that is now a model \nfor the rest of the world.\n  The important point here is that all three of these acts were \nbipartisan bills, developed and approved by Republicans and Democrats \nalike, because everybody recognized the need to maintain sustainable \nfish stocks and to support domestic commercial and recreational \nfishing. Now, these were also effective progressive endeavors that \ndrastically improved the fisheries in our country. In fact, our Federal \nfisheries today have the lowest ever number of stocks that are \noverfished or subject to overfishing, and a total of 37 stocks have \nbeen rebuilt. This is evidence that our science-based approach to \ndetermining stock status and the managing for sustainability is \nworking.\n  But contrary to previous bipartisan acts of Congress, this bill was \ndeveloped with very little input from Democrats. Subsequently, it was \npassed out of committee on a strict party-line vote--no Democrats \nvoting in favor and not a single Democratic amendment accepted. Every \nwitness at each hearing that the committee held on this topic in the \nlast Congress agreed on one thing: the Magnuson-Stevens Act was largely \nworking.\n  This is not a situation where we should be overhauling the law in a \nwholesale way. It is a situation where we should be making small \nimprovements so that the law can continue to work well into the future.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, we want to have meaningful discussions with our \nRepublican colleagues and develop bipartisan legislation in the spirit \nof previous successful Magnuson Act authorizations. To this end, I \nintroduced the Fishing Economy Improvement Act with my friend, Mr. \nSablan, and we are offering a germane version as a substitute amendment \nthat would reauthorize Magnuson and leave intact the core conservation \nand management provisions, including the requirements to rebuild \noverfished stocks and set annual catch limits.\n  The substitute amendment would also make improvements to the act. It \nwould prioritize cooperation between scientists and fishermen on \nresearch efforts, a collaboration that produces useful information, \nbreeds confidence in the system, and improves management outcomes. It \ninfuses new funding into cooperative research, allowing the agency to \naccept outside funding, and it modernizes fishery collection and \nmanagement by encouraging the use of electronic monitoring.\n  The amendment makes improvements to the operations of the regional \nfishery management councils, as well, by increasing transparency and \npublic participation in the process; and it requires that the councils \nconsider the interests of Native Alaskans, Pacific Islanders, and \nAmerican Indians, who often depend on fish for their livelihoods, in \nfishery management plans.\n  Our hope is that we can use this reauthorization process to start a \nthoughtful, constructive, and bipartisan conversation about fisheries \nmanagement in the United States. At a time when our oceans face many \nstressors, including the combined effects of pollution, acidification, \nand ocean warming, it is essential that we reauthorize Magnuson and \nbuild on the act's legacy of successful science-based management.\n  Mr. Chairman, the fishermen and coastal communities I represent and \nthose whom my colleagues represent deserve that conversation; and, more \nimportantly, they deserve a bill that honors the decades of work that \nhave gone into making American fishery management more sustainable, \nboth economically and ecologically. I urge my colleagues to support our \nsubstitute amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the amendment that has been presented by \nthe gentleman from California. It is a much better amendment than was \npresented in the committee in which there were elements that were in \nthere that dealt with the California drought, that dealt with NGOs \nbeing able to contribute that should never have been a part of it, and \nI appreciate his not putting those in this particular amendment that is \non the floor. But at the same time, it does roll back all the \nflexibility that was significant and important here. It rolls back the \ntransparency that needs to be in effect.\n  The underlying bill specifically requires the scientific and \nstatistical committees to develop the scientific advice provided to the \ncouncils in a transparent manner and allows them to allow for public \ninvolvement in the process. It requires councils to provide Webcasts or \naudio of each council meeting and posting such recordings on their Web \nsite within 30 days of that particular meeting, and it requires an \nopportunity for public comment or proposals that are relating to the \nuse of electronic monitoring technology. Those would also not be \nincluded if this amendment were to take place.\n  Some of the ``bedrock'' laws that are referred to here are indeed not \ntaken out of the process. That was handled in one of the other debates \nwe had on a different amendment, which simply says what we are trying \nto do is avoid just going through the motions a second time, to try and \ncut the red tape for more efficiency so that a NEPA law or fish \nmanagement act, they are the same thing, why do it twice when once is \nsufficient? Why waste the time, energy, and effort of public bodies to \ndo that? And all those, once again, would be reinstated, that double \neffort would be reinstated at the same time.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, this bill, as a 4-year process, not a recent \nprocess,\n\n[[Page H3616]]\n\ngoes back to several other times. And in my opening statement, I did \nquote from the leadership of the minority party at the time 2 years \nago, in that committee, how much they were grateful for the input they \nhad on this bill and for taking ideas from the Democrat side that were \nincorporated, and those ideas are still in the base bill.\n\n  It is one of the concepts here that I would love to have a bipartisan \nbill. But more importantly, I want to have a good bill, a bill that \nsolves the problems. You have heard speeches from both sides of the \naisle that simply the status quo is not working. There are too many \nproblems that need to be solved. That is one of the reasons why the \nunderlying bill is still being supported by all the people who are \ninvolved in the industry--by the commercial side, by the charter \nfishing side, and by the recreation people--and the first time that has \never happened.\n  So I commend the gentleman from Alaska for having done a good \nprocess, and I would say go with the underlying bill. It has a better \nchance of moving us forward to provide better progress and better \nsignificance in the future.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaine (Ms. Pingree), a district that certainly understands the \nimportance of sustainable commercial and recreational fisheries.\n  Ms. PINGREE. I thank Mr. Huffman for giving this opportunity and for \ncaring so deeply about our coastal communities and our fisheries.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Huffman-Sablan amendment \nbecause it would update the process we use to manage our Nation's \nfisheries without throwing away core programs. In particular, the \nHuffman-Sablan amendment would modernize fishery data collection by \nusing electronic monitoring and fisheries survey technologies. These \nare the technologies that our fishermen need to update the current \nprogram, and they are the wave of the future--no pun intended.\n  I think it is helpful for all of us to recognize the fact that NOAA's \nbudget for the so-called wetside programs has been facing devastating \ncuts as well as the sequester cuts over the past several years. As a \nresult, now more than ever, we need to look at about how we can make \nour dollars do more with our fisheries. Electronic monitoring is a \nplace where we can make an investment in the future that will help our \nfishermen today.\n  Also, the substitute amendment will ensure that we leave intact \nconservation programs that have been helping us to address overfished \nstocks. In the Gulf of Maine, we have seen the crisis in our fisheries \nfirsthand, and we want to make sure that we are not forgetting all the \nwork that our men and women who make their livings on the water have \ndone. We do not want to roll back important conservation and management \nguidelines.\n  So again, Mr. Chairman, I support the Huffman-Sablan amendment. I \nappreciate my colleagues for working on this, and I urge all of my \nother colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Young), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment, I am \npleased to report he has accepted some portion of our bill, but there \nis some question about the Endangered Species Act. We had a case in \nAlaska where NOAA, which I don't know how it happened, they put the \nSteller sea lion on endangered species because of fishing. There was no \nreal connection between the fishing and the so-called decline in the \nSteller sea lions, and they killed a community with no science. We come \nto find out the Steller sea lion had moved away from the area where \nthere was more abundant food, not from fishing. The fishing hadn't \ncaused any problem at all, but it killed that community.\n  I argue that in this case, if any of the fishing is endangered, that \nis okay, the fish itself. But when you have a species hurt the fishing \ncommunity and it didn't affect the sustainable yield, you see why I \nthink this amendment is incorrect.\n  I think you have to consider, again, the purposes of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act, which originated in the House, was for sustainable \nfisheries and sustainable communities. When you have another act \ninterfere with that, that doesn't have any science, then I think it is \nincorrect.\n  So I understand what the gentleman is saying. Electronically \nmonitoring fisheries is good. The gentlewoman from Maine mentioned \nthat. It is in the bill. There is a lot in this bill that is in the \nSablan amendment. But what you are trying to suggest, you roll back the \ntransparency and, I think, the community activity, which hurts the \noriginal base bill, which is the bill that I sponsored.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would just note that the process for \nlisting under the Endangered Species Act requires best available \nscience. It is a very rigorous and public process, and it is subject to \nbeing challenged in various ways. So we think it is robust and has \nproven itself.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer), who also represents a coastal State that \nunderstands the importance of sustainably managing our fisheries.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Huffman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to speak in support of the Huffman-Sablan \nsubstitute amendment. This amendment would complement, rather than \noverhaul, the fishery management process in place under the Magnuson-\nStevens Act, MSA.\n  While the current MSA may not be perfect, we have heard from many \ngroups again and again that it works. We have made incredible gains \nsince the last reauthorization in 2007.\n  In its annual report issued in April, NOAA reported that the number \nof domestic fish stocks listed as overfished or subject to overfishing \nhas dropped to an all-time low since 1997. Three more fish stocks were \nrebuilt to target levels in 2014, bringing the total number of rebuilt \nU.S. marine fish stocks to 37 since 2000. This amazing progress is a \nresult of the combined efforts of NOAA, the regional fishery management \ncouncils, the fishing industry, and other stakeholders.\n  NOAA currently has pending proposals to tweak the implementation of \nMSA. That process should be allowed to continue. What is needed now are \nupdates to the MSA that address specific issues that keep the law \ncurrent, not a weakening of the law and rollback of conservation \nmeasures such as those proposed in H.R. 1335.\n  H.R. 1335 would undermine the great improvements we have made to make \nour fisheries economically and environmentally sustainable, without \naddressing some important factors impacting our fisheries today. For \nexample, I had hoped to offer an amendment to H.R. 1335 that would have \nproduct councils with a way of taking the effects of climate change \ninto account when establishing annual catch limits and rebuilding \ntimelines, but the Rules Committee declined to allow me to offer it on \nthe floor today, despite the critical need for us to deal with the very \nreal impacts that climate change is already having on our oceans and \nour fisheries.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Huffman-Sablan \namendment, which would modernize the data collection and management of \nfisheries data, improve recreational fisheries data collection and \nreporting, and provide a way for NOAA to accept outside funding to \nsupport cooperative research efforts between scientists and fishermen.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have nothing further, and I urge an \n``aye'' vote on the amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity of \ngoing through all these amendments. This is one amendment that does not \nnecessarily move us forward in the process. I wish it did. It did not. \nSometimes there are even little tiny bits and pieces that happen to be \nin there that are one of the reasons why, if we were starting from \nscratch again, I would ask to be removed.\n  For example, Mr. Huffman does name one of the funds in here--the \nfisheries conservation and management fund--after a gentleman whose \nassociation's members have been party\n\n[[Page H3617]]\n\nto more than 20 Federal cases brought against the Federal agency since \n2007. Much of that litigation has been aimed at the Bureau of \nReclamation water projects and farmers and ranchers who serve by them. \nCongress should not be rewarding such serial litigation. That is one of \nthe things I would have asked to have been removed had we started from \nscratch in this process.\n  But above all, the amendment simply erases the flexibility, erases \nthe transparency, and erases the science improvements that are part of \nthe underlying bill that are so essential; that the elements of those \npeople who live in these communities, who recreate in these areas, who \nuse the commercial side, the fishing side, have all said we are not \ndoing what we need to do; that the present system does have flaws in it \nand needs to be changed, and we need to move forward on that bill. The \nunderlying bill does that. This amendment does not do that.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this particular amendment and urge us to move \nforward with the bill as written.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chair, I am offering an Amendment in the Nature of a \nSubstitute for H.R. 1335, which was submitted to the Rules Committee by \nmy colleague Mr. Huffman.\n  Mr. Chair, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct is a sterling example of good federal policy and has helped make \nthe United States the world leader in sustainable fisheries management.\n  When we last reauthorized Magnuson-Stevens in 2007, we required the \nuse of annual catch limits to end and prevent overfishing.\n  Using this management tool--annual catch limits--we have increased \nthe number of American fish stocks with populations sufficiently large \nthat we can count on their ability to continue reproducing.\n  Using annual catch limits as our guide, we have reduced the number of \nstocks being fished in excess of maximum sustainable yield--to an all-\nrime low.\n  Magnuson-Stevens has proven to be effective environmental policy.\n  It is also good economic policy.\n  U.S. fisheries contributed nearly $90 billion and 1.5 million jobs to \nthe economy in 2012. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration estimates that, when we have fully rebuilt our \nfisheries, they will add another $31 billion to our national economy \nand produce 500,000 new jobs.\n  Of course, we learn as we go; and there are ways that Magnuson-\nStevens could be made even more effective as environmental and economic \npolicy. The Huffman-Sablan amendment in the nature of a substitute \nprovides some of that fine-tuning.\n  And our amendment does that without undermining the annual catch \nlimits regime and other core principles that have made Magnuson-Stevens \nso effective.\n  H.R. 1335, on the other hand, risks back-sliding on the progress we \nhave made.\n  I recognize that some of these issues are technical in nature, but \nbear with me.\n  H.R. 1335 would allow non-target stocks in a fishery to be defined as \necosystem component species, which are not subject to annual catch \nlimits, even if these non-target stocks are depleted or overfished. For \ninstance, H.R. 1335 would allow Atlantic halibut to be reclassified as \nan ecosystem component species, no longer subject to an annual catch \nlimit. Yet, Atlantic halibut today are finally rebuilding after decades \nof decline. H.R. 1335 would put that progress at risk.\n  Another problem with H.R. 1335 is that it tries to conform the \ntimelines in the National Environmental Policy Act with timelines in \nMagnuson-Stevens. This could force the Secretary of Commerce to approve \nfishery management plans that have not had the full benefit of National \nEnvironmental Policy Act analysis--particularly, by reducing the amount \nof time that the public has to comment on federal action. I do not \nthink we want to be cutting the public out of this important decision-\nmaking process.\n  A third problem area for H.R. 1335 is that it prohibits information \nsharing. Fisheries data collected by NOAA in the process of \nadministering Magnuson-Stevens could not be used in the management of \nother marine resources managed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, \nthe National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Antiquities Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Nor could \nthe Magnuson-Stevens fisheries data be used in managing offshore energy \nexploration and development, or water pollution, or coastal resources. \nThat does not really make much sense.\n  The substitute amendment Mr. Huffman and I are offering avoids these \npitfalls. We simply want to improve fisheries research and management \nto benefit fishermen and fishing communities.\n  How does our amendment do that?\n  By implementing electronic monitoring to lower costs for the fishing \nfleet;\n  By improving the collection of fisheries data, which we all agree is \nlacking;\n  By increasing cooperative research and management efforts between \nscientists and fishermen;\n  By making the operations of the Regional Fishery Management Councils \nmore transparent and open to public participation;\n  By allowing the Councils to select individuals who have expertise on \nsubsistence fishing practices, so we incorporate the interests and \nexpertise of Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and Indian Tribes; and\n  By recognizing the subsistence fishing may encompass more than \npersonal consumption, but also includes some small-scale, low \ntechnology, commercial fishing.\n  And our amendment makes these improvements in Magnuson-Stevens \nwithout undermining core policies that have made the Act so effective.\n  Magnuson-Stevens is passed due for reauthorization.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 336 would direct the General Services \nAdministration on behalf of the National Archives to convey property in \nAlaska to the city of Anchorage.\n  I am pleased to be the sponsor of this legislation, which will bring \nsavings to the taxpayer. The National Archives has determined that it \nno longer needs the property to be conveyed in the bill and wants to \nsell it as part of its efforts to shrink its space footprint and reduce \ncosts to the taxpayer.\n  The bill will require fair market value for the property based on an \nindependent appraisal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation, and \nI yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 336 which directs the General \nServices Administration, the GSA, on behalf of the Archivist of the \nU.S., to convey 9 acres of property in Anchorage, Alaska, to the local \nmunicipality in exchange for its fair market value.\n  The Archivist and GSA has reported this property as underutilized and \nthat there is no need to keep this property in the Federal real estate \ninventory. This sale is consistent with the policy supported by the \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has directed GSA \nto help other Federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded \nproperty.\n  As a result, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Gibbs) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 944, introduced by my colleague, Representative LoBiondo, \nreauthorizes the National Estuary Program found in section 320 of the \nClean Water Act. Estuaries are unique and highly productive waters that \nare important to the ecological and economic basis of our Nation.\n  Congress first authorized the National Estuary Program in 1987, \namendments to the Clean Water Act to promote the protection of the \nnational significant estuaries in the United States that are deemed to \nbe threatened by pollution, development, or overuse.\n  Unlike many of the programs under the Clean Water Act, the National \nEstuary Program is a nonregulatory program. Instead, it is designed to \nsupport collaborative, voluntary efforts of Federal, State, and local \nstakeholders to restore degraded estuaries.\n  Using consensus building in a collaborative decisionmaking process \ninstead of a top-down regulatory approach, the National Estuary Program \nhas been effective at promoting locally based involvement. In addition, \nit leverages non-Federal money for restoration activities by providing \nfunding for the program.\n  In reauthorization of the National Estuary Program, H.R. 944 makes \nprudent fiscal adjustments. The bill reauthorizes section 320 of the \nClean Water Act through 2018 in the amount of $27 million a year. This \namount is consistent with appropriations over the past 5 years, and, in \nrecognition of the fiscal realities of today, decreases the authorized \nlevel of funding by $8 million a year.\n  H.R. 944 also directs more funds to where they need to be in the \nindividual estuaries in the program. The bill achieves this by reducing \nthe amount\n\n[[Page H3619]]\n\nof discretionary funds made available to the EPA.\n  Finally, the bill allocates a portion of eligible program funds for \ncompetitive awards to Federal, State, and local stakeholders to address \ncertain high priority estuary needs, including algae blooms, hypoxia, \nflooding, and invasive species. This is identical to a bill that passed \nthe House by voice vote in the last Congress.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 944, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 944.\n  I am pleased the House is considering H.R. 944, a bill that I \nintroduced along with Congressman LoBiondo and Congressman Murphy to \nreauthorize the National Estuary Program through 2020.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work in pulling this \nlegislation together.\n  Estuaries are critically important to the health of our Nation's \nenvironment and our economy. Their waters are a unique mixture of \nfreshwater, drainage from the land, and salty seawater. Estuaries \nprovide vital nesting and feeding areas for many aquatic plants and \nanimals. They also help maintain healthy ocean environments by \nfiltering out sediment and pollutants from rivers and streams before \nthey flow into the ocean.\n  In addition to improving habitat for critical wildlife like salmon, \nrestoring estuaries can have important carbon sequestration effects.\n  For example, a report last year on the Snohomish Estuary in my \ndistrict found that currently planned and in-progress restoration \nprojects will result in at least 2.55 million tons of CO2 \nsequestered from the atmosphere over the next 100 years. That is the \nequivalent of a year's worth of emissions from a half a million \nautomobiles.\n  Over half of the U.S. population lives in coastal areas, including \nalong the shores of estuaries. These areas provided 69 million jobs and \ncontributed $7.9 trillion to the economy recently. These gains come \nfrom commercial and recreational fishing, as well as tourism and other \nforms of regulation recreation. By one estimate, restoring our estuary \nareas could create more than 30 jobs for every $1 million invested.\n  In the Pacific Northwest and across the country, healthy estuaries \nlike the Puget Sound support fish, birds, and other wildlife, and \nsustain important economic and recreational activities like trade, \nfishing, tourism, and many other forms of outdoor recreation.\n  Estuaries in the Pacific Northwest also serve as habitat and spawning \nareas for salmon, another critical driver for our regional economy.\n  Unfortunately, human activities have led to a decline in the health \nof estuaries, threatening them in many coastal parts of the country. \nPopulation growth in areas abutting estuaries have led to an increase \nin storm water runoff and sewage discharges, ultimately polluting the \nwaters with toxins.\n  Fortunately, the National Estuary Program, which would be authorized \nby H.R. 944, is an important part of remedying these problems facing \nour Nation's estuaries. Since 1987, the program has operated \nsuccessfully at the EPA in partnership with other State and local \nentities and has fostered innovative solutions to local water quality \nprograms.\n  Funding from the program helps create solutions to nurture estuaries \nback to health, like the comprehensive plan we have for the Puget Sound \nrecovery.\n  This bipartisan legislation that we have today will ensure that local \norganizations across the country, in partnership with the EPA, can \nprotect and restore estuaries for the benefit of future generations.\n  I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it as \nwell.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo).\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman \nGibbs and Chairman Shuster and Ranking Members DeFazio and Napolitano \nfor helping bring H.R. 944, the National Estuary Program \nReauthorization, to the floor.\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues Mr. Posey and Mr. Murphy of \nFlorida, and especially Mr. Larsen, who has been great to work with on \na number of issues.\n  This version of the National Estuary Program Reauthorization is \nfiscally responsible by reducing the authorization levels by $8 million \nwhile ultimately increasing the amount of money each estuary program \nwill receive. It is a very commonsense approach that helps get the job \ndone.\n  This reauthorization will detail just how the EPA is to spend the \nauthorized and appropriated money.\n  Unlike many of the programs under the Clean Water Act, the National \nEstuary Program is a nonregulatory program. That was mentioned before, \nbut I think it bears repeating: it is a nonregulatory program.\n  Instead, it is designed to support collaborative, voluntary efforts \nof Federal, State, and local stakeholders to restore degraded \nestuaries. I think this is exactly the approach that will get results, \nand an approach that will encourage people to be working together for \nsomething that really can actually see a very positive result with our \nestuaries.\n  Unfortunately, the National Estuary Program has been losing money due \nto EPA administrative costs. By setting limits of 5 percent for \nadministrative costs for the EPA, we can guarantee 80 percent of the \nfunding goes to the end user, the NEP, and not bureaucratic salaries \nand red tape.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  In this year's reauthorization, we have set aside 15 percent of the \nfunding for a competitive award program. This program will seek \napplications meant to deal with urgent and challenging issues that \nthreaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas.\n  By structuring how the money is spent and lowering authorization \nlevels, this legislation strikes the right balance of fiscal and \nenvironmental responsibility.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 944.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, \nso I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 944.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 944, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Chair, on Monday, June 1st, 2015, I was absent \nduring rollcall vote No. 264. Had I been present, I would have voted \n``yea'' on the Dingell Amendment to H.R. 1335--Strengthening Fishing \nCommunities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act.\n  (By unanimous consent, Mr. Wittman was allowed to speak out of \norder.)\n\n\n                    Sportsmen's Trophy Presentation\n\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, recently, the Congressional Sportsmen's \nCaucus held its annual Member shoot-out, where Members get together \nfrom the Republican and Democrat sides and shoot a round of sporting \nclays, skeets, and trap. It is a friendly day where we get together and \nhave some great competition. It is in the interest of the shooting \nsports and of our outdoor efforts there. And it was a great privilege \nto be there with the other Members.\n  We had a record turnout this year of Members from both sides of the \naisle. We are blessed that Team Republican will retain the shoot-out \ntrophy this year but by a narrow margin, with a winning score of 235-\n227.\n  It is a real honor for me to serve as the co-chair of the \nCongressional Sportsmen's Foundation. I have Congressman Jeff Duncan of \nSouth Carolina here, who is our co-vice chairman; and we also have \nCongressman Tim Walz, who is our other co-chairman.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from the great \nState of Minnesota (Mr. Walz), the co-chair of our caucus.\n  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the gentleman from \nVirginia for yielding.\n  Congratulations to the gentleman and his team and to everyone who \nparticipated.\n  Congratulations to Mr. Duncan of South Carolina, who was the \nRepublican top gun, and to Mike Thompson of California, who was the \noverall top gun. Congratulations to them.\n  As the gentleman said, this is the largest bipartisan caucus in the \nCongress. The Congressional Sportsmen's\n\n[[Page H3621]]\n\nFoundation--the folks who are out there protecting our hunting, \nfishing, and outdoor heritage--thank you to all of them and to all the \nsponsors who made this possible.\n  It is great day for a great cause, and it shows that there are many \nthings that bind us together.\n  So I congratulate the gentlemen, and we look forward to a friendly \ncompetition again next year.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, 2-minute voting will continue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment printed in House Report 114-128 offered \nby the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) on which further \nproceedings were postponed and on which the noes prevailed by voice \nvote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). Is the \ngentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. PETERS. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Peters moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1335 to the \n     Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROTECTING FISHING COMMUNITIES FROM TOXIC POLLUTION.\n\n       In the aftermath of an oil or hazardous materials spill \n     none of the amendments to fishery conservation requirements \n     made by sections 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, and 15 of this Act shall\n\n[[Page H3622]]\n\n     apply to any fishery impacted by such spill until--\n       (1) the relevant Regional Fishery Management Council has \n     fully assessed the impacts of the spill to stocks of fish, \n     fishing communities, and the marine environment;\n       (2) the polluter has paid for any cleanup or removal of \n     pollution related to the spill in the marine environment that \n     impacts a fishery, restored such fisheries to limit the long-\n     term impact on stocks of fish, and provided compensation for \n     the economic and job loss to the United States fishing \n     industry and communities; and\n       (3) the polluter has paid for testing of fish to ensure \n     that consumers are protected from toxins that have entered \n     the food chain, and for testing of water quality to help \n     fishermen avoid areas of pollution and find the safest areas \n     to fish.\n\n  Mr. PETERS (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will proceed immediately to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, preserving our beaches and bays and our coastal \ncommunities for future generations has to be a bipartisan endeavor. \nCongress passed landmark fisheries legislation in 1976 and reauthorized \nit in 1996 and 2006 with broad support from both parties.\n  Unfortunately, today's bill is a partisan one that will undermine our \nfour-decade history of responsible and successful fisheries management. \nIt creates loopholes and lessens transparency and accountability, which \ncan only harm our coastal communities.\n  My amendment today is simple: give communities and regional experts \nat fishery management councils input, and increase the ability of local \nagencies to hold polluters more accountable after a spill.\n  Just a few weeks ago, on the California coast north of Santa Barbara, \na pipeline ruptured beneath a coastal cliff, spilling 105,000 gallons \nof crude oil onto the beach and tidelands and into the Pacific Ocean. \nDespite rapid cleanup efforts from environmental officials and \nvolunteers from across the State, the leak killed abundant marine life, \nincluding lobsters, seals, kelp bass, and local fish populations. It \nalso forced the closure of local State beaches during the Memorial Day \nweekend, depriving local businesses of revenue from visitors coming to \nenjoy the scenic California coast.\n  Now, the short-term harm has been evident, but the long-term damage \nto the marine life, coastal ecosystems, and biodiversity, including \nfisheries and food stocks that are part of the region's economy, that \ndamage won't be known for some time.\n  What is clear is that coastal communities deal with the harm from a \nspill long after the initial cleanup ends, and they deserve greater \noversight over those who caused the damage.\n  My amendment addresses this issue in three ways: first, it directs \nthe regional fishery management council to conduct a full environmental \nassessment of the spill; second, it requires the responsible party to \npay for any pollution cleanup and restoration of the harmed fishers, \nand to provide compensation for economic and job losses due to the \nspill; and third, it protects public safety and food quality by \nrequiring that polluters pay for testing of toxins in fish and in local \nwaters to help fishermen determine the safest areas for fishing.\n  These provisions are necessary because, as we have seen from past \ncleanups, the long-term direct and indirect environmental damage is not \nalways immediately apparent, particularly on fish and wildlife \npopulations and marine biodiversity. This is our experience.\n  For example, despite massive cleanup efforts following the infamous \nExxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, a 2007 study conducted by NOAA found \nthat 26,000 gallons of oil from the Exxon Valdez were still trapped in \nthe sand along the shoreline of Alaska. Those thousands of gallons of \noil that remain decades later continue to damage fragile marine \necosystems and wildlife habitat and breeding grounds.\n  That 1989 spill caused more than $300 million in economic harm to \nmore than 32,000 Alaskans whose livelihoods depended on commercial \nfishing in that region. And in Santa Barbara, where last month's spill \noccurred, tourism, both on- and offshore, are central to the regional \neconomy and will undoubtedly be harmed by this pollution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent San Diego, California, where the marine \nindustry, the maritime industry, and our large natural harbor are key \nto the region's tourism economy which supports 158,000 local jobs and \n$18.3 billion in economic impact. A spill like this could devastate our \nlocal economy and irreparably harm our delicate ecosystem.\n  It is imperative that Congress hold responsible parties accountable \nin the case of a destructive oil spill. We should all agree that \nsupporting coastal communities and the businesses that depend on \nrivers, bays, lakes, beaches, and oceans deserve support and shouldn't \nbe forced to pay for the mistakes of polluters.\n  Join me in supporting our local economies, protecting our coastal \nenvironments, ensuring public safety for consumers, and setting a \nhigher standard for accountability.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to \nrecommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion \nto recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, on the policy level, this stuff is \nalready covered in the Oil Pollution Act, the Superfund covers it, and \nif you are really serious about doing this, lines 8 and 9 would be \nchanged to ``NOAA,'' as they are in the current statute. They have the \nexpertise and the money to actually accomplish it.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, if I could say to all of you, with apologies to \nthose who have been sending emails and dear colleagues around here, \nthis amendment, you should simply throw it back. It is not a keeper. \nThis is simply a fish story that is based on a big whopper. This \namendment would actually take the bill, and it would gut it, clean it, \nand filet it. So, please, do not fall for this hook, line, and sinker.\n  I am not fishing for compliments here. But we have been floundering \nto find a solution for a long time, and that is why the underlying bill \nhas a boatload of support for it.\n  I realize this is as good as it gets. I am okay, but those involved \nin the fishing community recognize that the status quo is not working \nas it was intended to work and needs to be fixed in some particular \nway. That is why, on the underlying bill, the commercial industry, the \nfishing industry, and the recreationists already are in support and \nhave publicly said that. That is the first time all three groups have \nactually gotten together on this particular bill.\n  They realize there needs to be change in the status quo. They realize \nthere needs to be transparency, which the underlying bill gives and is \nnot there in the status quo. They realize that the science that has \nbeen used under the status quo is crappy and that this mandates \nmultiple sources, better sources being used to make these final \ndecisions.\n  So, just for the halibut--and I had one for ``bass,'' but I have \nalready censored it myself--vote ``no'' on the amendment and support \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-\nminute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute \nvote on passage of the bill, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 155, \nnays 233, not voting 54, as follows:\n\n[[Page H3623]]\n\n                             [Roll No. 266]\n\n                               YEAS--155\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Grijalva\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Girls Count Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page H3625]]\n\n       (1) According to the United States Census Bureau's 2013 \n     international figures, 1 person in 12, or close to \n     900,000,000 people, is a girl or young woman age 10 through \n     24.\n       (2) The Census Bureau's data also illustrates that young \n     people are the fastest growing segment of the population in \n     developing countries.\n       (3) Even though most countries do have birth registration \n     laws, four out of ten babies born in 2012 were not registered \n     worldwide. Moreover, an estimated 36 percent of children \n     under the age of five worldwide (about 230,000,000 children) \n     do not possess a birth certificate.\n       (4) A nationally recognized proof of birth system is \n     important to determining a child's citizenship, nationality, \n     place of birth, parentage, and age. Without such a system, a \n     passport, driver's license, or other identification card is \n     difficult to obtain. The lack of such documentation can \n     prevent girls and women from officially participating in and \n     benefitting from the formal economic, legal, and political \n     sectors in their countries.\n       (5) The lack of birth registration among girls worldwide is \n     particularly concerning as it can exacerbate the \n     disproportionate vulnerability of women to trafficking, child \n     marriage, and lack of access to health and education \n     services.\n       (6) A lack of birth registration among women and girls can \n     also aggravate what, in many places, amounts to an already \n     reduced ability to seek employment, participate in civil \n     society, or purchase or inherit land and other assets.\n       (7) Girls undertake much of the domestic labor needed for \n     poor families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, \n     tending livestock, caring for younger children, and doing \n     chores.\n       (8) Accurate assessments of access to education, poverty \n     levels, and overall census activities are hampered by the \n     lack of official information on women and girls. Without this \n     rudimentary information, assessments of foreign assistance \n     and domestic social welfare programs are difficult to gauge.\n       (9) To help ensure that women and girls are considered in \n     United States foreign assistance policies and programs, that \n     their needs are addressed in the design, implementation, and \n     evaluation of foreign assistance programs, and that women and \n     girls have the opportunity to succeed, it is important that \n     girls be counted and have access to birth certificates and \n     other official documentation.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) encourage countries to support the rule of law and \n     ensure girls and boys of all ages are able to fully \n     participate in society, including by providing birth \n     certifications and other official documentation;\n       (2) enhance training and capacity-building in key \n     developing countries, local nongovernmental organizations, \n     and other civil society organizations, including faith-based \n     organizations and organizations representing children and \n     families in the design, implementation, and monitoring of \n     programs under this Act, to effectively address the needs of \n     birth registries in countries where girls are systematically \n     undercounted; and\n       (3) incorporate into the design, implementation, and \n     evaluation of policies and programs measures to evaluate the \n     impact that such policies and programs have on girls.\n\n     SEC. 4. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT COUNTING OF GIRLS \n                   IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Secretary and the Administrator are \n     authorized to prioritize and advance ongoing efforts to--\n       (1) support programs that will contribute to improved and \n     sustainable Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems \n     (CRVS) with a focus on birth registration;\n       (2) support programs that build the capacity of developing \n     countries' national and local legal and policy frameworks to \n     prevent discrimination against girls in gaining access to \n     birth certificates, particularly where this may help prevent \n     exploitation, violence, and other abuse; and\n       (3) support programs and key ministries, including, \n     interior, youth, and education ministries, to help increase \n     property rights, social security, home ownership, land tenure \n     security, inheritance rights, access to education, and \n     economic and entrepreneurial opportunities, particularly for \n     women and girls.\n       (b) Coordination With Multilateral Organizations.--The \n     Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to coordinate \n     with the World Bank, relevant United Nations agencies and \n     programs, and other relevant organizations to encourage and \n     work with countries to enact, implement, and enforce laws \n     that specifically collect data on girls and establish \n     registration programs to ensure girls are appropriately \n     counted and have the opportunity to be active participants in \n     the social, legal, and political sectors of society in their \n     countries.\n       (c) Coordination With Private Sector and Civil Society \n     Organizations.--The Secretary and the Administrator are \n     authorized to work with the United States, international, and \n     local private sector and civil society organizations to \n     advocate for the registration and documentation of all girls \n     and boys in developing countries, in order to help prevent \n     exploitation, violence, and other abuses and to help provide \n     economic and social opportunities.\n\n     SEC. 5.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development.\n       (2) Foreign assistance.--The term ``foreign assistance'' \n     has the meaning given the term in section 634(b) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2394(b)).\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of State.\n\n     SEC. 7. SUNSET.\n\n       This Act shall expire on the date that is five years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 802, the Girls Count Act of 2015. It is \nidentical to H.R. 2100, the House version of the bill, which my staff \nhas worked on for 3 years now.\n  I want to thank Senator Marco Rubio and his staff for moving this \nbill through the Senate so we can soon get this important piece of \nlegislation to the President's desk.\n  Madam Speaker, the Girls Count Act of 2015 is an important measure \nbecause what many people don't realize is that approximately 51 million \nchildren around the world are not registered at their births. That is \none-third of all children under the age of 5 worldwide.\n  What does this mean? It means that these children lack a birth \ncertificate, preventing them, oftentimes, from having access to \nfundamental rights which we here in the United States take for granted. \nIt means they have no proof of their ages, parentage, or even of their \ncitizenship. They are essentially nonpeople, oftentimes, in the eyes of \nthe law.\n  For girls in particular, the lack of a birth registration certificate \nincreases their vulnerability to trafficking and exploitation. These \ngirls grow up facing high barriers to work, education, and political \nparticipation. Tragically, too often, these girls are treated in their \nown countries as if they really don't exist, as if they really don't \ncount at all.\n  All of this is happening in places where we need women and girls to \nactively shape their countries' futures because, indeed, women serve as \nthe backbone of stable, healthy societies all around the world. They \nare breadwinners and caregivers and peacemakers and the educators of \nthe next generation.\n  For these reasons, I introduced and authored the Girls Count Act to \ndirect the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment to support efforts aimed at improving birth registry-birth \ncertificate programs in developing countries and others.\n  This step, which actually seems quite simple, will ensure that every \nchild gets access to voting rights, land tenure rights, health \nservices, and an education. Critically, Girls Count authorizes the \nState Department and USAID to support programs to protect girls' legal \nrights, particularly economic and property rights, and to build legal \nand policy frameworks to prevent discrimination against women and \ngirls.\n  Your support of the Girls Count Act of 2015--those who have supported \nthis legislation--will not only help to prevent human and sex \ntrafficking in developing countries by aiding in identifying displaced \npersons and international adoption cases, but it will\n\n[[Page H3626]]\n\ngive girls and women around the world access to the fundamental rights \nthat they so rightly deserve.\n  I want to thank Congresswoman McCollum and Congressmen Smith and \nSherman for their support in introducing this legislation in the House, \nas well as to thank the 44 other bipartisan Members--this is a \nRepublican and a Democratic bill--who have given their support.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues in the Senate, especially Senator \nMarco Rubio, for backing this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of S. 802, the Girls Count Act of 2015.\n  I want to thank Representatives Chabot and McCollum for introducing \nthe House companion to this bill.\n  Madam Speaker, around the world, over a third of children under the \nage of 5 have no registration of their births. Most of these children \nare girls.\n  I remember my grandmother--my mother's mother--who came to this \ncountry before World War I from Eastern Europe. She didn't have a \ncertificate and didn't really know for sure what year she was born or \nwhat time she was born.\n  She knew it was December--she thought it was December--but she didn't \nhave it, I remember. Here we are now, many, many years later, and we \nhave the same problem in many areas around the world.\n  Not existing on paper can shatter a person's life. With official \ndocumentation comes certain protections, and without those protections \na person becomes an easy target for child labor, human trafficking, and \nchild marriage. Down the line, many of these children will be unable to \ninherit land or money, to start a business, or even to open a bank \naccount.\n  This sort of marginalization often hits women the hardest. \nUnregistered women are more likely to be confined to their homes and to \nbe invisible to the outside world. They enjoy only limited choices and \nopportunities, and their marginalization drags down the prosperity of \ntheir communities.\n  Birth registration has most recently become an acute problem in \nSyria. The ongoing civil war has caused countless internally displaced \nand refugee children to go unregistered. As a result, these children \nface a high risk of entering into early or illegal marriages, of being \nsex trafficked, of being forced into child labor, or of being recruited \nby terrorist groups.\n  S. 802 will ramp up efforts to get more children registered around \nthe world. It authorizes the State Department and USAID to work with \nlocal governments to ensure equal access to registration programs. It \nuses existing funding to more effectively address this increasingly \nserious problem.\n  This bill would complement the work of organizations around the world \nengaged in the important work of protecting vulnerable children, and it \nwould put pressure on other governments to act.\n  While improving birth registration systems helps the most vulnerable \npopulations, it has positive ripple effects across a society. \nGovernments with better records can provide better services, tailor \nmore effective policies, and bring more people into full participation \nin their economies. This basic practice can help make entire countries \nstronger.\n  Getting children registered at birth helps get them off to a good \nstart, and this bill will help make that happen. Madam Speaker, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is now my great pleasure to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), one of the \ncoauthors of this bill and someone who has worked endlessly to make \nsure this bill passes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to support the Girls Count \nAct.\n  I want to thank Mr. Chabot and his staff for working alongside my \noffice on this important bill. I want to thank Mr. Royce and, of \ncourse, Mr. Engel for their support in moving this bill forward.\n  Madam Speaker, we can all agree that every child deserves to have his \nbirth, name, and identity recognized by his government. Every child \ndeserves access to an education and to health services. Without a \nrecognized identity, that is just not possible. Unfortunately, UNICEF \nestimates that 230 million children under the age of 5--and that is \nmostly girls--do not have birth certificates.\n  Without this piece of paper, they are effectively invisible to their \ngovernments, invisible to the world. These invisible girls are likely \nnot to be able to attend school or to access the needed health \nservices. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for a girl to \ninherit, to vote, or to simply be a full and active member of her \ncommunity.\n  This girl would be at high risk of being confined to her home, of \nbeing forced into early marriage, or of being sold into human \ntrafficking. Without a birth certificate, she will likely face a bleak \nfuture. None of us would want this for her.\n  The Girls Count Act is exactly what the title says; it helps ensure \nthat all girls and boys are counted by their governments. The bill \nhelps support the efforts of the Secretary of State and the \nAdministrator of USAID to work with international organizations and \nNGOs to improve birth registration for all children. Every child \ndeserves to have his birth recognized, and it deserves to be recognized \nby his government.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and my \nright to close.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Once again, let me say that getting children registered at birth \nhelps get them off to a good start. This bill encourages governments to \nenact laws and policies that give all children, including girls, a \nchance at being full participants in society. I strongly support this \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I want to again compliment Ms. McCollum and Mr. Chabot for their hard \nwork on this very important piece of legislation. This should be a \nunanimous ``yes.'' I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to thank Congresswoman McCollum and also the ranking \nmember, Mr. Engel, for their leadership on this issue. Both of them \nhave been very important parts of seeing this through the House. It \nwent through the other body recently as well, so it is working its way \nto the President's desk, and we are very encouraged by that.\n  Madam Speaker, many of us are deeply concerned by the appalling acts \nof injustice that are committed against women and girls around the \nworld on a daily basis. The headlines are, oftentimes, hard to \nbelieve--acid attacks in Iran, death at the hands of a savage mob in \nAfghanistan, the kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria--yet the \ndisenfranchisement of women and girls around the world is not just an \nhumanitarian issue; it is a development issue, and it is a security \nissue as well.\n  How can a nation thrive when half of its citizens are oftentimes \ndenied their most basic human rights? The Girls Count Act--this act, \nthe one that we are talking about this evening--recognizes the \nsuffering and aims to empower those who have been cast into the shadows \nof their societies.\n  Birth registration is one of the first steps in the fight to preserve \nan individual's basic rights under the law in that particular country. \nIt is also a critical means to ensuring the full participation of women \nand girls in their communities. Whether it is voting or owning property \nor employment or health care or a whole range of things. Let's help \ngirls count.\n  Again, I want to thank the House for supporting the passage of this \nmeasure. This will be the second year now--2 years in a row--that this \nHouse, I believe, will support it, and I encourage all of my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, as we pass the bipartisan Girls Count \nAct of 2015, I'd like to emphasize the importance of advancing women's \nrights around the world. In 2015, it is completely unacceptable that \nwomen still do not posses the same rights as men.\n\n[[Page H3627]]\n\n  My grandmother raised her family and put food on the table to ensure \nthat her children and grandchildren received the education and care \nthey deserved. I am incredibly proud of my grandmother and all women \nlike her who are the rocks of their families. I am fighting for women's \nrights because it is each generation's obligation's to ensure that the \nnext generation is better off than the previous. I fight for my \ndaughter and granddaughter, who I hope will one day live in a world \nwhere there is true gender equality.\n  In a time where women should be equal to men, there are unspeakable \natrocities being committed all over the world. For example, Boko Haram \nkidnapped over 300 school girls, drawing the ire of global activists. \nBy passing this legislation, we will become leaders in the worldwide \nfight against misogyny. This bill requires countries around the world \nto develop civil registration and statistical programs to better trace \nwomen's information. In addition, it prevents governments from \ndiscriminating against women, while creating a policy framework to \nimprove access to economic and property ownership. I sincerely hope \nthat governments draft strong legislation that changes the current \npolicy.\n  I am grateful that our chamber has taken this important step to \nensure that countries around the world recognize the need to improve \nwomen's access to basic rights. I want to thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for supporting women's rights.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by \nthanking my good friend and colleague Congressman Steve Chabot for his \nleadership and hard work in shepherding the Girls Count Act as it makes \nits way to the President's desk. It is important legislation that will \nmake an impact in the lives of so many girls and young women around the \nworld.\n  Like last year, I am an original co-sponsor of the House version of \nthe Girls Count Act, and I think that the version introduced in both \nHouses this Congress is even better than the one that the House passed \nlast year, as it explicitly recognizes the great work that so many \nfaith-based organizations do around the globe.\n  There is a need for the legislation, because in too many parts of the \nworld, girls are discriminated against simply for being a girl. Indeed, \nthis disregard for the value of the girl child often begins in the \nwomb, in countries such as India and China, where we see the horrific \npractice of sex-selective abortion. This cruel practice in turn has led \nto a gender imbalance which has fed other crimes against women, such as \nsex trafficking, bride selling and prostitution.\n  I chaired a hearing two years ago on the problem of ``India's Missing \nGirls,'' which addressed the problem of violence against the girl child \nin India. Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide have led to \nlopsided sex ratios: in parts of India, for example, 126 boys are born \nfor every 100 girls. Perhaps the best figures we have concerning the \nmagnitude of the problem come from India's 2011 census figures, which \nfind that there are approximately 37 million more men than women in \nIndia.\n  In China, too, we see the brutal effects of a one-child policy that \ncauses baby girls to be killed before birth; where only one child per \ncouple is permitted in a society that has a traditional preference for \nsons, the predictable result is that a disproportionate number of girls \nwill be killed in the womb.\n  As Mara Hvistendahl recounted in a book I recommend to all of my \ncolleagues, Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls, and the \nConsequences of a World Full of Men, in Asia alone, there are 160 \nmillion missing girls, roughly the same amount of women and girls as \nthere are in the United States. The result of this sex-imbalance is a \nworld where there is greater political instability, with violence \ninside the womb begetting violence outside as well.\n  Today's legislation, which seeks to have every girl counted and \nregistered, marks a small but important step toward a world where every \nchild, boy or girl, is equally valued and cherished for her or his \ninherent, God-given dignity from the moment of conception.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, S. 802.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3627-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3627-H3632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PROTECT AND PRESERVE INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY ACT\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 1493) to protect and preserve international cultural \nproperty at risk due to political instability, armed conflict, or \nnatural or other disasters, and for other purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect and Preserve \n     International Cultural Property Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Ways and Means, the \n     Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Finance, the Committee \n     on Armed Services, and the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) Cultural property.--The term ``cultural property'' \n     includes property covered under--\n       (A) the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural \n     Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, concluded at The \n     Hague on May 14, 1954 (Treaty Doc. 106-1(A));\n       (B) Article 1 of the Convention Concerning the Protection \n     of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by \n     UNESCO on November 23, 1972 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``1972 Convention''); or\n       (C) Article 1 of the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting \n     and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of \n     Ownership of Cultural Property, adopted by UNESCO on November \n     14, 1970 (commonly referred to as the ``1970 UNESCO \n     Convention'').\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Over the years, international cultural property has \n     been looted, trafficked, lost, damaged, or destroyed due to \n     political instability, armed conflict, natural disasters, and \n     other threats.\n       (2) During China's Cultural Revolution, many antiques were \n     destroyed, including a large portion of old Beijing, and \n     Chinese authorities are now attempting to rebuild portions of \n     China's lost architectural heritage.\n       (3) In 1975, the Khmer Rouge, after seizing power in \n     Cambodia, systematically destroyed mosques and nearly every \n     Catholic church in the country, along with many Buddhist \n     temples, statues, and Buddhist literature.\n       (4) In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, \n     ancient statues carved into a cliffside in central \n     Afghanistan, leading to worldwide condemnation.\n       (5) After the fall of Saddam Hussein, thieves looted the \n     Iraq Museum in Baghdad, resulting in the loss of \n     approximately 15,000 items, including ancient amulets, \n     sculptures, ivories, and cylinder seals. Many of these items \n     remain unrecovered.\n       (6) The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami not only \n     affected 11 countries, causing massive loss of life, but also \n     damaged or destroyed libraries, archives, and World Heritage \n     Sites such as the Mahabalipuram in India, the Sun Temple of \n     Koranak on the Bay of Bengal, and the Old Town of Galle and \n     its fortifications in Sri Lanka.\n       (7) In Haiti, the 2010 earthquake destroyed art, artifacts, \n     and archives, and partially destroyed the 17th century \n     Haitian city of Jacmel.\n       (8) In Mali, the Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group Ansar \n     Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in the ancient city of \n     Timbuktu--a major center for trade, scholarship, and Islam in \n     the 15th and 16th centuries--and threatened collections of \n     ancient manuscripts.\n       (9) In Egypt, recent political instability has led to the \n     ransacking of museums, resulting in the destruction of \n     countless ancient artifacts that will forever leave gaps in \n     humanity's record of the ancient Egyptian civilization.\n       (10) In Syria, the ongoing civil war has resulted in the \n     shelling of medieval cities, damage to five World Heritage \n     Sites, and the looting of museums containing artifacts that \n     date back more than six millennia and include some of the \n     earliest examples of writing.\n       (11) In Iraq and Syria, the militant group ISIL has \n     destroyed numerous cultural sites and artifacts, such as the \n     Tomb of Jonah in July 2014, in an effort to eradicate ethnic \n     and religious minorities from contested territories. \n     Concurrently, cultural antiquities that escape demolition are \n     looted and trafficked to help fund ISIL's militant \n     operations.\n       (12) On February 12, 2015, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously adopted resolution 2199 (2015), which \n     ``[r]eaffirms its decision in paragraph 7 of resolution 1483 \n     (2003) and decides that all Member States shall take \n     appropriate steps to prevent the trade in Iraqi and Syrian \n     cultural property and other items of archaeological, \n     historical, cultural, rare scientific, and religious \n     importance illegally removed from Iraq since 6 August 1990 \n     and from Syria since 15 March 2011, including by prohibiting \n     cross-border trade in such items, thereby allowing for their \n     eventual safe return to the Iraqi and Syrian people.''.\n       (13) United Nations Security Council resolution 2199 (2015) \n     also warns that ISIL and\n\n[[Page H3628]]\n\n     other extremist groups are trafficking cultural heritage \n     items from Iraq and Syria to fund their recruitment efforts \n     and carry out terrorist attacks.\n       (14) The destruction of cultural property represents an \n     irreparable loss of humanity's common cultural heritage and \n     is therefore a loss for all Americans.\n       (15) Protecting international cultural property is a vital \n     part of United States cultural diplomacy, showing the respect \n     of the United States for other cultures and the common \n     heritage of humanity.\n       (16) The United States Armed Forces have played important \n     roles in preserving and protecting cultural property. In \n     1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established a \n     commission to advise the United States military on the \n     protection of cultural property. The commission formed teams \n     of individuals known as the ``Monuments Men'' who are \n     credited with securing, cataloguing, and returning hundreds \n     of thousands of works of art stolen by the Nazis during World \n     War II.\n       (17) The Department of State, in response to the Convention \n     on Cultural Property Implementation Act, noted that ``the \n     legislation is important to our foreign relations, including \n     our international cultural relations. The expanding worldwide \n     trade in objects of archaeological and ethnological interest \n     has led to wholesale depredations in some countries, \n     resulting in the mutilation of ceremonial centers and \n     archaeological complexes of ancient civilizations and the \n     removal of stone sculptures and reliefs.''. The Department \n     further noted that ``[t]he United States considers that on \n     grounds of principle, good foreign relations, and concern for \n     the preservation of the cultural heritage of mankind, it \n     should render assistance in these situations.''.\n       (18) The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield was founded in \n     2006 to support the implementation of the 1954 Hague \n     Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the \n     Event of Armed Conflict and to coordinate with the United \n     States military, other branches of the United States \n     Government, and other cultural heritage nongovernmental \n     organizations in preserving international cultural property \n     threatened by political instability, armed conflict, or \n     natural or other disasters.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the \n     United States to--\n       (1) protect and preserve international cultural property at \n     risk of looting, trafficking, and destruction due to \n     political instability, armed conflict, or natural or other \n     disasters;\n       (2) protect international cultural property pursuant to its \n     obligations under international treaties to which the United \n     States is a party;\n       (3) prevent, in accordance with existing laws, importation \n     of cultural property pillaged, looted, stolen, or trafficked \n     at all times, including during political instability, armed \n     conflict, or natural or other disasters; and\n       (4) ensure that existing laws and regulations, including \n     import restrictions imposed through the Office of Foreign \n     Asset Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury, are \n     fully implemented to prevent trafficking in stolen or looted \n     cultural property.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Such subcommittees or taskforces may be \n     comprised of a subset of the Committee members or of such \n     other members as the Chair determines appropriate.

EMERGENCY PROTECTION FOR SYRIAN CULTURAL PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determination.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (b) of section 304 of the Convention on Cultural Property \n     Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 2603) (relating to a \n     Presidential determination that an emergency condition \n     applies with respect to any archaeological or ethnological \n     material of any State Party to the Convention), the President \n     shall apply the import restrictions referred to in such \n     section 304 with respect to any archaeological or \n     ethnological material of Syria, except that subsection (c) of \n     such section 304 shall not apply. Such import restrictions \n     shall take effect not later than 120 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Annual Determination Regarding Certification.--\n       (1) Determination.--\n       (A) In general.--The President shall, not less often than \n     annually, determine whether at least one of the conditions \n     specified in subparagraph (B) is met, and shall notify the \n     appropriate congressional committees of such determination.\n       (B) Conditions.--The conditions referred to in subparagraph \n     (A) are the following:\n       (i) The Government of Syria is incapable, at the time a \n     determination under such subparagraph is made, of fulfilling \n     the requirements to request an agreement under section 303 of \n     the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (19 \n     U.S.C. 2602).\n       (ii) It would be against the United States national \n     interest to enter into such an agreement.\n       (2) Termination of restrictions.--The import restrictions \n     referred to in subsection (a) shall terminate on the date \n     that is five years after the date on which the President \n     determines that neither of the conditions specified in \n     paragraph (1)(B) are met, unless before such termination date \n     Syria requests to enter into an agreement with the United \n     States pursuant to section 303 of the Convention on Cultural \n     Property Implementation Act, in which case such import \n     restrictions may remain in effect until the earliest of \n     either--\n       (A) the date that is three years after the date on which \n     Syria makes such a request; or\n       (B) the date on which the United States and Syria enter \n     into such an agreement.\n       (c) Waiver.--\n       (1) In general.--The President may waive the import \n     restrictions referred to in subsection (a) for specified \n     cultural property if the President certifies to the \n     appropriate congressional committees that the conditions \n     described in paragraph (2) are met.\n       (2) Conditions.--The conditions referred to in paragraph \n     (1) are the following:\n       (A) The foreign owner or custodian of the specified \n     cultural property has requested such property be temporarily \n     located in the United States for protection purposes.\n       (B) Such property shall be returned to the foreign owner or \n     custodian when requested by such foreign owner or custodian.\n       (C) Granting a waiver under this subsection will not \n     contribute to illegal trafficking in cultural property or \n     financing of criminal or terrorist activities.\n       (3) Action.--If the President grants a waiver under this \n     subsection, the specified cultural property that is the \n     subject of such waiver shall be placed in the temporary \n     custody of the United States Government or in the temporary \n     custody of a cultural or educational institution within the \n     United States for the purpose of protection, restoration, \n     conservation, study, or exhibition, without profit.\n       (4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     prevent application of the Act to render immune from seizure \n     under judicial process certain objects of cultural \n     significance imported into the United States for temporary \n     display or exhibition, and for other purposes (22 U.S.C. \n     2459; Public Law 89-259) with respect to archaeological or \n     ethnological material of Syria.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``archaeological or ethnological material of \n     Syria'' means cultural property of Syria and other items of \n     archaeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific, or \n     religious importance unlawfully removed from Syria on or \n     after March 15, 2011; and\n       (2) the term ``State Party'' has the meaning given such \n     term in section 302 of the Convention on Cultural Property \n     Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 2601).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I submit for the Record letters between the committees of \njurisdiction.\n  Madam Speaker, the history of civilization is under attack. The \nIslamic State, also known as ISIS, continues to wreak havoc throughout \nIraq and Syria, laying a path of death and destruction in order to \nestablish and expand its caliphate.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  No offense is more appalling than the terrorists' complete disregard \nfor human life. ISIS has unleashed a campaign of sickening violence \nagainst Shi'a Muslims and fellow Sunnis who do not share their radical \nbeliefs, as well as against vulnerable religious and ethnic minorities. \nThis includes its public beheadings and executions and the selling of \nwomen and girls into sexual slavery.\n  Besides the human toll of ISIS' deplorable acts, we also mourn the \nloss of society's cultural heritage, as the extremists loot and destroy \ntheir way through ancient sites in the territories they conquer. We \nhave seen heartbreaking footage of ISIS drilling their way through \npriceless artifacts in Mosul and bulldozing magnificent Mesopotamian \nruins in the 3000-year-old city of Nimrud. ISIS claims the annihilation \nof cultural sites is meant to counter idolatry, but clearly these \nterrorists have another goal: to remove all traces of the region's rich \nand diverse religious and cultural past. By eliminating all evidence of \nhumanity's common heritage, they are paving the way for their own \nhorrifying brand of Islamist extremism.\n  What we are witnessing is a cultural genocide. For ISIS, however, \nthis looting of antiquities is big business. Some reports indicate that \nthey are earning as much as $100 million annually from the sale of \nstolen artifacts, which they often sell to middlemen who can peddle \nthese treasures in old-fashioned markets or online.\n  Earlier this year, the United Nations Security Council adopted a \nresolution that urged member states to take steps to prevent the \ntrafficking of Iraqi and Syrian cultural properties, and just last \nweek, all 193 U.N. members agreed to step up the prosecution of those \nengaged in this illegal trade.\n  I want to commend the Committee on Foreign Affairs' ranking member, \nElliott Engel, for introducing this bipartisan bill that we have before \nus this evening and for his continued leadership on this critical \nissue. This bill, the Protect and Preserve International Cultural \nProperty Act, will help the U.S. do its part to counter the smuggling \nand sale of stolen Syrian antiquities.\n  Specifically, the bill will improve coordination of U.S. efforts to \nprotect cultural property and prevent these artifacts from being \nremoved since the start of Syria's civil war from being sold or \nimported into this country, into the United States. It is important to \nnote that the legislation's emergency import restrictions are not \ndesigned to continue into perpetuity and can be waived under certain \nconditions for the temporary safekeeping of cultural property within \nthe United States.\n  I also want to make clear that this bill only restricts the import of \ncertain Syrian antiquities that have been removed from that country \nduring the current conflict. Nothing in this legislation is meant to \ninterfere with the legal sale of antiquities that do not fall under \nthis category nor with other aspects of the import process.\n  I want to again thank Eliott Engel, the ranking member of our \ncommittee, for his work on this measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 2015.\n     Hon.

I am writing to confirm that, \n     although there are certain provisions in the bill that fall \n     within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed \n     Services, the committee will forgo action on this bill in \n     order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration.\n       I am glad we agree that forgoing consideration of the bill \n     does not prejudice the Committee on Armed Services with \n     respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the \n     provisions contained in the bill or similar legislation that \n     fall within the committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate \n     your support for the appointment of committee members to any \n     House-Senate conference convened to consider such provisions.\n       Thank you for agreeing to place a copy of your letter \n     acknowledging our jurisdictional interest, along with this \n     response, into the Congressional Record during consideration \n     of the measure on the House floor.

Ed Royce,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 2170 Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Royce, I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     1493, the ``Protect and Preserve International Cultural \n     Property Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs and in addition to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.

Our \n     Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an \n     appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks \n     that you support any such request.\n       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 1493, and would ask \n     that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be \n     included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 1493.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 2015.\n     Hon.

Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of my legislation, \nH.R. 1493, as amended, and yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, we have worked very, very hard on this bill. This is a \nvery, very important bill. So let me first thank Chairman Ed Royce for \nhis efforts to move this bill forward. He is a good partner on the \ncommittee, and we couldn't have gone this far without him. I also want \nto thank the lead cosponsors, Representative Chris Smith and \nRepresentative Bill Keating, who have been champions on this issue. I \nwant to thank Mr. Chabot for his support and his eloquence in speaking \nfor the bill.\n  One of the things that we do on the Committee on Foreign Affairs is, \nwherever possible, we work in a bipartisan fashion, and this is a \nperfect example of working together in a bipartisan fashion for \nsomething that is really just so important.\n  Madam Speaker, by now we have all seen footage of ISIS extremists \ntaking sledgehammers, as Mr. Chabot mentioned, to ancient, \nirreplaceable artifacts across the territory they control. Now, these \nare not random acts of vandalism. We are witnessing a deliberate \ncampaign to attempt to rewrite world history. From the tomb of Jonah in \nMosul to Yazidi shrines in Sinjar, ISIS is leveling sites that preserve \na record of the region's rich and diverse past. I think Mr. Chabot put \nit very well when he said the same thing.\n  We have seen this tactic before. In Afghanistan, the Taliban wiped \nout the Bamiyan Buddhas in March of 2000. Who can forget that? During \nthe Holocaust, the Nazis systematically targeted Jewish property as \npart of their effort to wipe out an entire race.\n  Now, some people will say why are we talking about the destruction of \nancient ruins while so many people are suffering and dying at the hands \nof ISIS? That is not important. Of course, we need to stay focused on \nstopping the violence and alleviating the dire humanitarian situation \nfestering across the region, but the reality is that we cannot separate \nthese issues so easily. After all, before ISIS reduces these sites to \nrubble, the group loots everything they can carry, traffics the \nartifacts on the black market, and uses those resources to fund their \nviolent rampage.\n  So it is directly connected to the murder and killing of so many \ncivilians and their brutality. They use these artifacts to get money so \nthat they can keep their war machine going, so that they can keep their \nkillings going, so that they can keep their brutality going. So the two \nare connected.\n  ISIS has ransacked thousands of artifacts from dozens of World \nHeritage Sites, places like cities of Mari and Dura Europos, which were \nvirtually untouched before this crisis. These places are now lost to \nhistory, and their destruction has funneled, as I said before, millions \nof dollars into ISIS' coffers.\n  We need to cut off the source of funding and at the same time work to \npreserve this imperiled cultural history. There is already a good \neffort underway, a global effort underway.\n  In February, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling on \ngovernments to prohibit trade of cultural property looted from Syria \nand Iraq. The Security Council found that this step would reduce ISIS' \noperational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks. Our \nWestern allies have cracked down on traffickers trying to sell looted \nartifacts from Iraq and Syria. Now is the time for the United States to \ndo more, and that is precisely what this bill does.\n  First of all, this bill takes steps to ensure the antiquities \ntrafficking that is lining ISIS' pockets is not taking place within our \nborders. This legislation would impose tough, new import restrictions \non cultural artifacts removed from Syria similar to restrictions we \npassed in 2004 with respect to Iraq. So we are doing the same thing \nthat we did in Iraq in 2004 with Syria, trying to prevent these looted \nartifacts from funding the terrorist machine.\n  Nothing in this legislation would interfere with the legal sale or \nexhibition of antiquities that were not smuggled out of Syria during \nthe current crisis, and there are exceptions to allow artifacts to come \nhere for protection and restoration. These new rules would remain in \neffect until the crisis in Syria is resolved and America is able to \nwork with a new Syrian Government to protect cultural property from \ntrafficking under a bilateral agreement in accordance with America's \nnational interests.\n  Secondly, this bill enhances collaboration among government agencies \nalready working on this problem. This bill would bring together \nprograms, from the Smithsonian, to the Pentagon, to Homeland Security, \nthrough a new interagency body with a single coordinator. It would \nimprove congressional oversight to make sure we are efficient in the \nway we are addressing this challenge. These steps will not replace the \nauthorities of existing bodies but will help ensure their programs work \ntogether effectively.\n  This bill represents the newest chapter in a long tradition. Since \nWorld War II, America has led the world in protecting historical \nproperty from those bent on its destruction. That leadership is needed \ntoday. We must act swiftly to confront this threat, to cut off a \ncritical source of ISIS funding, to stand up to this barbaric brand of \npsychological warfare, and to stop those determined to rewrite history. \nI urge all colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I thank Mr. Chabot again.\n  Madam Speaker, let me close by noting that with each passing day, \nISIS is selling looted artifacts to the highest bidder, further \nfinancing death and destruction. Whatever is left behind, they reduce \nto rubble, leveling religious sites, digging up ancient cities, and \nerasing the last traces of long lost civilizations whose histories have \nremained in soil and sand for thousands of years, and these people \ndestroy that.\n  We must stand up to these acts. We must do more to cut off ISIS' \nfunding and save cultural property. That is why it is so important. To \nhelp achieve this effort, we need to pass H.R. 1493. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I would first ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 944.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, the whole world continues to recoil in horror at ISIS' \ndepravity. The ancient cities that face destruction at its hands are \nconsidered the birthplace of modern civilization. Just weeks ago, ISIS \nconquered the ancient city of Palmyra, the so-called jewel of the \ndesert. Recent reports that ISIS has not destroyed these sites may give \nsome of us hope, but judging from their prior barbaric acts, it is \nprobably just a matter of time before they do the same thing there as \nthey have done so horrifically in other places.\n  The legislation before us today--and I again want to thank Mr. Engel \nfor introducing the legislation--and oversight of the U.S. agencies \nresponsible for recognizing and protecting cultural property, ensuring \nthat such treasures are protected to the best of our ability, that is \nwhat this legislation would do.\n  I appreciate the other committees of jurisdiction for working with \nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs on this measure, particularly the \nCommittee on Ways and Means for its assistance on the critical import \nrestrictions on this bill.\n  As Mr. Engel mentioned, when one is looking at this, we are looking \nat cultural things which have been--let's face it--destroyed forever. \nSome of these things are thousands of years old, and you can't bring \nthem back. And you can't help but think--we are talking about physical \nthings here, but we have also seen them do other horrific things.\n\n[[Page H3632]]\n\n  When they take a Jordanian pilot and in a particularly barbaric \nfashion essentially set him on fire in a cage, when they take people \nout to a beach and one by one behead them, when they sell innocent \nwomen and young girls into slavery, over and over again, we have seen \nthese horrific things happening, and it is time the world stood up to \nthis group, both for the horrific things they are doing on historic \nartifacts which can't be brought back, but also the human lives that \nthey have so callously extinguished. This group must be stopped. Let's \nhope that this evening we are at least taking a step in that direction.\n  I again thank Mr. Engel, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, as we vote on H.R. 1493 in the House \ntoday, I would like to share with you the series of unfortunate and \nbarbaric events that have plagued The Cultural Museum of Mosul and \nrobbed the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan of their \nhistorical lineage.\n  No stranger to war and tribal conflict, the people of Mosul, Iraq \nhave suffered persecution and displacement under the Ottoman Empire, \nBritish colonial rule, and various tyrannical regimes. Despite all \nthese hardships, Mosul was once a city of commercial importance to the \nregion. Commerce and trade brought a rich exchange of history and \nculture to Mosul, which was preserved in the Museum of Mosul.\n  The museum provided a connection to a national identity and pride, \nwhich was once flourishing and prosperous. They say it is important to \nknow your past so that you can learn from the mistakes of previous \ngenerations and better prepare for the future that is ahead. The people \nof Mosul were robbed of that opportunity in April of this year by ISIS. \nJust days before the reopening of the museum, which was looted during \nthe Iraq War in 2003, ISIS released a horrific video showing militants \nusing sledgehammers to demolish stone sculptures and other centuries-\nold artifacts.\n  The world watched in horror and disbelief as centuries of Assyrian \nhistory were obliterated in minutes. As we fight against the injustices \nperpetrated by ISIS militants around the world we must also fight to \npreserve the cultural integrity of these historical civilizations. I \nwant to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \ndedication in preserving the historical treasures of the people of \nMosul. ISIS has robbed these people of their freedoms but we must \nprotect their past so that they may have a better future.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by \nthanking Mr. Eliot Engel, the Ranking Member of the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee, for his bill, the Protect and Preserve International \nCultural Property Act, H.R. 1493.\n  I am privileged to be the lead co-sponsor of this bill, just as I was \nlast year.\n  This bill could not be more timely, given the depredations of ISIS \nthat we see played out on our TV screens when we turn on the nightly \nnews--the horrific beheadings and killing of Christians and other \nreligious minorities such as Yezidis by Islamist fanatics.\n  These murderers help finance their terror in part by looting cultural \nantiquities and coins from areas of Syria and Iraq that they control. \nCongress has already acted with respect to banning importation of \n``blood antiquities'' from Iraq, which this bill would now extend to \nSyria. As such, this bill is part of the war on terror, helping to dry \nup sources of terror financing.\n  We also see that these fanatics will destroy what they cannot loot. \nThis bill increases the inter-agency cooperation, including involvement \nof ``Monuments Men'' units of our armed forces, in striving to protect \na cultural heritage which is part of our world's patrimony.\n  Finally, I want to highlight a provision of this bill that was not in \nthe version we passed in the last Congress, but one which is an \nimportant addition, namely, a safe-harbor provision for those who seek \nto bring into the country important cultural artifacts that are being \nthreatened with destruction, This safe harbor provision allows them to \nbe placed in the temporary protective custody of the United States \ngovernment or a museum.\n  I want to close by thanking Ranking Member Engel for introducing this \nimportant piece of legislation, and would like to thank him and all \nstaff members who worked so hard on bringing this important legislation \nto the floor tonight.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1493, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3632-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMEMBERING THE FIREFIGHTERS LOST IN HOUSTON'S FIRE OFF THE SOUTHWEST \n                                FREEWAY\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. OLSON.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rabbi Les \nGutterman, my rabbi and a man who has served for more than 40 years as \nthe senior rabbi for Temple Beth-El in Providence, Rhode Island.\n  Rabbi Gutterman's unique insight and his sharp sense of humor have \nserved the members of his congregation magnificently during times of \npersonal struggle and times of great celebration.\n  As a member of the congregation at Temple Beth-El, I have often \nrelied on Rabbi Gutterman's wise counsel and spiritual guidance, and I \nconsider his friendship a great blessing in my life.\n  A native of Flint, Michigan, Rabbi Gutterman first came to Providence \n45 years ago after earning a bachelor's degree from the University of \nMichigan and a Doctor of Divinity from Hebrew Union College.\n  At the time, just 27 years old, he could not have imagined the impact \nhe would have on our State and on the families in his congregation. But \njust 3 years later, Rabbi Gutterman would be appointed the senior rabbi \nfor Temple Beth-El, making him one of the youngest senior rabbis in the \nUnited States.\n  Today, he is known to all of us as ``Rhode Island's rabbi,'' a \nhumble, caring servant of God who has tended to the spiritual needs of \nthis great community for nearly half a century.\n  While we will miss his presence at Temple Beth-El, I know that all of \nus are wishing him, his wife Janet, and his daughters Rebecca and \nElizabeth the very best as he embarks on a well-deserved retirement.\n  Thank you, Rabbi Gutterman, for your devotion to our community and \nfor the gentle, caring guidance and love you have provided to us for so \nmany years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3632-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3632-H3634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, with trade deals on the horizon, \nPresident Obama has asked Congress to grant him trade promotional \nauthority, also called fast track, to ``write the rules for the world's \neconomy.'' This measure would allow the President to pass sweeping \ntrade partnerships without the input of the American people through \ntheir elected representatives in the normal process. Despite the \nvarious myths circulating about TPA, I sincerely believe that it is not \nin the best interest of our Nation, as written at this time.\n  You have heard it said that a vote against TPA is a vote against \ninternational trade, but actually, a vote against TPA is a vote for a \nbetter construct and trade agreement.\n  I am a strong supporter of trade when deals are negotiated \nstrategically in the best interest of the United States economically, \nmilitarily, and diplomatically. With the President leaving office in \njust months, I have serious\n\n[[Page H3633]]\n\nconcerns about the rapid pace and content of any deal that could have \ndecades of implication.\n  Many have said TPA will strengthen our international relationships, \nand that may be, but while TPA would fast-track the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, in specific, currently being negotiated by the President \nwith 11 other Pacific nations, I am not convinced that this is a \npartnership that must be done in haste before the President leaves \noffice.\n  We currently trade with 6 of the 11 other members. Our vital yet \ndelicate relationship with China--a country not included in the Trans-\nPacific Partnership--would likely be damaged by a rivalry for economic \ninfluence in the region. The Trans-Pacific Partnership rewards nations \nwith serious human rights violations while slighting our faithful trade \npartners with shared values in Europe. While I support the lifting of \ntrade barriers and promoting better standards of living, I believe we \nmust do the right track, not the fast track.\n  Others have claimed TPA will strengthen national security. On this \npoint we should take careful note. The President has used dangerous and \nisolating language regarding China, with words coming from the White \nHouse like ``hegemony'' and ``containment'' to ask for the TPA, or the \ntrade promotional authority, but we must note that China is not our \nenemy. Therefore, we should not put it on the path to become one.\n  By isolating China, we could easily transform our capabilities-based \ndefense strategy to a threat-based one, with all of the implication and \ndecades of effort that that would entail. It would affect all of our \nfuture defense spending and could even begin Cold War II. The trade \npromotional authority can be granted and trade agreements inked without \nmaking China excluded, or worse, our enemy. We need to use the next 20 \nmonths to repair the relationships as we move towards better trade \nagreements.\n  The trade promotional authority, some say, gives Congress a seat at \nthe negotiating table. But the TPA allows Congress to set broad \nobjectives for negotiation--and that comes at a high price. Under the \ntrade promotional authority, Congress sacrifices its authority to make \nany changes on the final deal, and they are left with a simple ``yes'' \nor ``no'' vote.\n  I believe the American people deserve their voice in trade agreements \nwhich impact all of our livelihoods and affect all of our families' \nfinances. And while trade is vital to economic opportunity and our \ninternational friendships, I cannot support granting the President \npermission in light of these concerns with trade promotional authority.\n  Madam Speaker, America has long been fascinated with China. From the \ntime of Columbus, who sought to find a western approach to China and \ninstead discovered America, we have been drawn to its ancient culture \nand its people. The earliest American vessel pulled into a Canton port \nin 1748. Forty years later, we began free trade with the Cantonese.\n  The first mention of China obtaining a favored nation status was \nactually as early as 1844, when we signed the Treaty of Wanghia. The \nway seemed open to engage China and her market. But there were \nconcerns. Wrote one negotiating diplomat regarding this treaty: ``It is \nthe most uncivilized and remote of all nations . . . it is in an \nisolated place outside the pale, solitary, and ignorant. Not only are \nthe people entirely unversed in the forms of edicts and laws, but if \nthe meaning be rather deep, they would probably not even be able to \ncomprehend. It would seem that we must make our words somewhat \nsimple.''\n  What is amusing is that the diplomat was Chinese, and his comments \nwere directed toward the United States.\n  China moved ahead slowly and cautiously with its relations with the \nWest. The interplay of Western covetousness with Chinese reluctance \nkept the door to China at a mere crack. European attempts to force the \ncrack with opium and acquisition of port cities broadened the natural \ndistrust.\n  Unlike demands of Europe, though, the United States wanted trade, not \nterritory. U.S. Ambassador Burlingame was able to secure the first \ntreaty that China ever made with any Western nation in 1861, and China \nwas regarded as an equal. Chinese workers began to flock to the United \nStates and literally began to move mountains in California as economic \nopportunity thrived.\n  Unfortunately, the goodwill of Lincoln faded in just one generation. \nThe plundering of Chinese port cities by European competitors changed \nhow Americans began to view China. The flood of Chinese immigrants to \nCalifornia became an easy target for any setback on its economic \nascent. Equals were now called coolies. Racism reached such a height \nthat in 1882 the United States Congress--this body--passed and the \nPresident signed the first ever act that excluded a specific race on \nimmigration. We did not even make any pretense about it, calling it the \nChinese Exclusion Act. The provisions remained in effect for nearly 60 \nyears.\n  As these events played out, Commodore Perry of the United States Navy \nentered Tokyo in 1850 and demanded that Japan ``open up.'' The Japanese \nobliged.\n  Japan embarked on a stunning modernization program, where China was \nreluctant. In an incredible span of only 50 years, Japan adopted \nWestern technology, governance, law, industry, and military doctrines. \nHer rise from mystic feudalism to world power alarmed the West. In \nresponse, the goodwill of Lincoln towards China would take hold again \nin the form of his youthful personal secretary, John Hay, now an older, \nwiser, and towering figure of respect serving as the Secretary of State \nin 1900.\n  Hay saw the best way to compete with Japan would be to open up China \nto trade while protecting her territory. Hays' open-door policy was \nwidely heralded across the globe as the solution to imperial Japanese \nascendancy. This would have long-lasting implication, but one important \nside effect was to restore U.S.-Chinese relations. Hay even secured a \nguarantee from Japan in 1908 to respect China's ``open door,'' \nindependence, and territory. It would last only 7 years.\n  As China moved to become more enlightened to the West with Sun Yat-\nsen's revolution in self-governance in China, Imperial Japan made what \nwas known as the 21 Demands during World War I.\n  Great Britain and U.S. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan \nmoved quickly to prevent Japan from attempting to make China its own \nprotectorate. American-Chinese relations warmed even further when the \nUnited States declared China's right to autonomy with tariffs and trade \nin 1928.\n  As once-warm Japanese relations with the United States turned sour \nover Imperial Japanese policy in China regarding Manchuria, America \nestablished what became the Stimson doctrine, which refused to \nrecognize Japanese acquisitions in China and upheld China's rights to \nits own sovereignty.\n  The 1930s saw a mercurial Imperial Japan plunder China, pull out of \nthe League of Nations, and commit horrific atrocities in Nanking and \nHong Kong. The U.S. responded by calling for a global quarantine \nagainst Japan in defense of China in 1937. China's own struggles \ninternally with Mao Zedong's Communists paled in comparison to losing \nits industrial heart and its coast to the Imperial Japanese army.\n  By 1941, America was sending lend-lease war material and economic aid \nto China in her defense. American volunteer pilots cut dashing figures \nas they flew American P-40 Warhawks for the Chinese Air Force as the \nfamed Flying Tigers.\n  Ultimately, America's defense of China led it to be attacked at Pearl \nHarbor and resulted in a brutal Pacific and Chinese theater of war \nduring World War II.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  The United States committed an entire effort in China, with ``Vinegar \nJoe'' Stilwell as the commanding general; the building of the Burma \nRoad; and by training, equipping, and launching a Chinese Army to \nattack Japanese forces. Immigration restrictions that were imposed in \n1882 were now finally repealed. America had sympathy for China's \nstruggle.\n  By war's end, China was an important partner and ally. Her struggle \ndid not end, however. Ripped again internally by civil war once the \nJapanese were defeated, China would be led by Mao Zedong and the \nCommunist Party.\n  The United States did not recognize Communist China, but neither did \nit\n\n[[Page H3634]]\n\nmaterially aid fleeing Nationalist Chinese on the continent. A period \nof isolation and strained relations with the United States began once \nagain under Mao.\n  In 1949, China began to arm Communists in French Indochina. The U.S. \nbecame embroiled in a deadly struggle with North Korea and countered \nher assault in the south with an attack that pushed them all the way \nnorth to the Yalu River on the Chinese border.\n  Alarmed, China struck back. For the first time since 1900, Americans \nand Chinese were fighting each other. By 1953, an uneasy line had \nsettled on the Korean Peninsula.\n  Chinese relations remained cool with the West, but were not always \npromising with the Soviet Russia. When the U.S. fought in Vietnam, \nChina continued to arm and send troops to the Communist government of \nHo Chi Minh.\n  Then a series of odd events from 1969 to 1971 brought Americans and \nChinese back to warmer relations in the most unlikely way. When Soviet \nRussia attacked outposts on the northern border of China, Mao Zedong \nreassessed relationships with the United States.\n  He reasoned that China could not be isolated by both world powers. \nOvertures from President Nixon in his inaugural address and a series of \nping-pong matches created dialogue for the first time in decades.\n  In 1971, Henry Kissinger went on a secret mission to China, opening \nthe way for Nixon's visit with Mao. Who would have thought that the man \nthat shunned the United States in favor of communism and the President \nthat built his reputation on fighting communism would both come to \nrealize that our nations, despite their differences, needed each other.\n  Mainland China was now officially recognized by the United Nations. \nThe U.S. set up diplomatic offices. Trade agreements opened. Relations \nwarmed by the 1980s, with state visits from both countries. As the \nhorizon brightened and the Chinese people hoped, the Chinese Government \ncracked down on dissidents in Tiananmen Square. The U.S., alarmed, \nimposed sanctions and restrictions.\n  Tensions loomed through the 1990s, culminating with the U.S. bombing \nof the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, during the Kosovo \ncampaign.\n  Calmer heads prevailed and tensions eased. By 2001, trade \nrestrictions were loosened once again. China pledged a deep commitment \nto fight the war on terror and committed material aid in great amounts \nfor the effort.\n  By 2006, China-U.S. relations deepened under the strategic economic \ndialogue. Business in both countries increased as commerce offered \ngreat economic opportunity for both countries.\n  On the verge of a bright future, we now see today with timidity and \nfear, where we should see opportunity and favor with regard to China.\n  China needs us, and we need China; yet we see, in the last week, \nMadam Speaker, a week of a barrage of negative press on China, covering \neverything from hedging them on trade, to condemning them and their \ndevelopment of island outposts in the China Sea, to framing them up as \nthe new military threat that must be checked by the United States.\n  Dialogue and diplomacy are cheaper than tanks and tomahawks. Does the \nUnited States really wish to believe that we can leave a capabilities-\nbased military to create some new threat-based military and it would be \nin our favor?\n  While China is not our enemy, we could certainly set the conditions \nto make them one in the future. It would be a tragic mistake. It would \ndevour our diplomacy, drain our defense, and diminish our domestic \npriorities.\n  Worse, it could set the course for some future horrific conflict \nbetween dozens of friendly nations that we currently trade with, \nincluding China--including China. Where is the dialogue on including \nChina in the Trans-Pacific Partnership?\n  I have not heard it from this Chamber or the White House. Sure, we \nclaim they can join if they meet the standard, only after we use every \nanti-Chinese statement in trying to make the case for the trade \npromotion authority. That is not very reassuring.\n  Some say we must not include China at all in the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership because of their human rights record. Others object because \nthey are a Communist nation. Others cite the fact that China has been \nour former enemy.\n  Well, here are some thoughts to ponder. If we can forgive Germany and \nJapan for horrific human rights violations in World War II, can we not \nreach out to China? If we can embrace former enemies who reformed their \nexisting Communist governments, such as Vietnam, can we not reach out \nto China?\n  If we can turn former enemies, such as Great Britain, Canada, Mexico, \nSpain, the Philippines, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Japan, and \nVietnam, into our top trading partners, can we not also reach out to \nChina?\n  China needs petroleum and natural gas, and we have plenty of it. We \nhave both ready to export. China wants to lay thousands of miles of \nroad in ambitious projects for her commerce. We have the raw materials \nfor asphalt, industry to make their road-paving machines, and colleges \nto educate their engineers.\n  Madam Speaker, we need China; 3.8 million Chinese nationals live and \nwork in the United States. That is more than the population of my home \nState of Oklahoma. China constitutes our greatest trading partner, \nworking with thousands of businesses that bolster our economy and \nbetter our quality of life. Our peoples are historically and deeply \nintertwined. We must proceed with wisdom and caution.\n  While we love trade and while we love economy, we can work out \ndifferences, rather than magnify them and deepen suspicion and concern. \nInstead, we can dialogue.\n  The same standards that people often cite with regard to China and \nhow she is stealing technologies or making shoddy goods were the same \ncharges that we leveled against Japan in the 1960s and South Korea in \nthe 1980s; yet we no longer have those concerns about those allies \ntoday with their incredible effort, economy, and technology.\n  Our peoples are historically and deeply entwined, the United States \nand China, and we must work hard to maintain that.\n  Madam Speaker, I would hope that our colleagues and our President \nwould temper the rhetoric with regard to discussions on trade and using \nit as some new effort to hedge or contain China, rather than to embrace \nand trade with that nation.\n  Whatever differences we may have can be worked out in the spirit and \ngood will of Lincoln.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3634-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3634-H3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Westerman). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. \nKelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority \nleader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to \nonce again have the opportunity to stand on the House floor and to \nanchor the Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour with the \ndistinguished gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Today, we will discuss the many economic challenges facing so many \neveryday Americans; and, specifically, tonight, we want to examine some \nof the economic barriers, some of the policy possibilities, and the \noutlook on job prospects for African Americans in districts that we \nrepresent across the country.\n  It is worth beginning with the fact that we are now about 6 years \nremoved from the end of what historians and economists deem the Great \nRecession. America's economy has rallied. We have inched our way closer \nand closer to full recovery. In fact, the beginning of 2015 saw the \nmost sustained period of job creation in this century.\n  The fact remains that, in spite of the steady stream of progress and \neven in the midst of our positive job numbers, there are still too many \npeople being left behind. Many of these people live in communities like \nthe ones I represent in Cook County and Kankakee.\n\n[[Page H3635]]\n\nMany of these people can be found in urban, central, or rural America.\n  I guarantee that we all know someone out there who is still in the \nmidst of their own personal economic recovery. The fact remains that \nmany communities of color are struggling mightily in their recovery. In \nmany Black and Brown neighborhoods, unemployment remains at a crisis \nlevel--this, even as our economy continues to rebound.\n  I am reminded of a quote by a former National Urban League president \nand civil rights hero that the hardest work in the world is being out \nof work. That is something that I personally believe.\n  So often, I will hear folks say that America's unemployed have made a \nchoice to not work, that vulnerable Americans looking for work are \ndoing so because they have made poor decisions. We hear this time and \ntime again, especially in this Chamber, about folks need to go pull \nthemselves up by their bootstraps.\n  I can tell you that I have seen people tug in vain on their \nbootstraps to no avail. Many families still need help in their \nrecovery. As Representatives, we need to hear their cry and do more.\n  Marc Morial, who has followed in the footsteps of Whitney Young and \ntaken the helm of the National Urban League, was recently quoted as \nsaying: ``It is clear that for too many Blacks and Latinos, our \nNation's economic recovery is only something they read or hear about.''\n  America's comeback is bypassing large swaths of people in Black and \nBrown neighborhoods, and that is dangerous not only to those \ncommunities, but to our Nation. A recovery that leaves millions of its \ncitizens behind will ultimately threaten America's sustained growth.\n  Even before the Great Recession, Black unemployment has consistently \nbeen twice as high as White unemployment. I think Congressman Payne and \nmy colleagues gathered here this evening would agree that we have to \naddress this problem now.\n  To again quote Mr. Morial, of the National Urban League, ``For Blacks \nand Latinos in America, the economic devastation of the Great Recession \nis as real today as it was when it began in 2007.''\n  Consider these statistics on the economic reality of many Africans \nAmericans, according to a Brandeis University study. A typical Black \nhousehold has accumulated less than one-tenth of the wealth of a \ntypical White one, and that number is getting worse.\n  Over the past 25 years, the wealth gap between Blacks and Whites has \nnearly tripled. Now, this is largely because homeownership among Blacks \nis so much lower. Housing is often America's greatest asset and a major \ncomponent of their overall wealth.\n  African Americans typically have lower incomes than Whites, which \nalso makes it harder for them to save and build wealth. The median \nincome for Black households is less than 60 percent of that of White \nones. Finally, the jobless rate for Black Americans is twice that of \nWhites.\n  Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. The necessity in responding to \nthis economic crisis should be an American imperative. We cannot be \nlimited by narrowly focusing on a pre-Recession economy.\n  The Members of this House should be strategizing to support a bold \nand inclusive economy that propels us into a sustainable future. More \ncan be done by us, and this administration has proven to have been \nwilling to take the positive steps necessary to put us on a more \nprosperous path.\n  Regardless of where some of our colleagues are when it comes to the \nPresident, I think we are all in agreement that more Americans in the \nworkforce and more economic stimulation benefits all of us.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  The question is still relevant: How do we create a stronger economy \nand a more perfect union? Where do we go from here?\n  I am very pleased again to be joined tonight by my distinguished \ncolleague from the Congressional Black Caucus as we discuss this \nimportant analysis of the economy and job opportunity in our \ncommunities.\n  The insight and policy prescriptions are critical and valuable in our \ncontinuing march toward a more perfect union. Let me first yield to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my dynamic coanchor.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I first want to start by thanking my \ncolleague from Illinois, Congresswoman Kelly, for coanchoring this \nSpecial Order with me.\n  Thanks also to the members of the Congressional Black Caucus that \nwill be joining us, and a special thanks to everyone watching at home.\n  It is wonderful to be here to talk about our shared priorities. \nTonight, as stated by my colleague, we are going to address two of the \nmost pressing issues for African American communities, jobs and \neconomic development.\n  Since the Recession ended, much of the United States has experienced \neconomic recovery. However, African American communities continue to \nface significant challenges to securing jobs, escaping poverty, and \naccumulating wealth.\n  It is a disturbing and unacceptable reality and a reminder that \nCongress has a moral responsibility to create avenues of economic \nprosperity for African American communities. Our focus must be on the \neconomic issues that matter most to African American communities, \nincluding employment, income, and wealth.\n  According to an April report by the U.S. Congress Joint Economic \nCommittee, at 10.1 percent, the unemployment rate for African Americans \nis double the rate for White Americans. African Americans are 2.5 times \nmore likely than White Americans to face long-term unemployment, and \nover 20 percent of African Americans in their early twenties are still \nunemployed. This hurts earning prospects and long-term employment.\n  Given the higher rates of unemployment in African American \ncommunities, it is no surprise that African American communities also \nhave lower incomes and less wealth, and African Americans are more \nlikely to live and stay in poverty.\n  According to the April Joint Economic Committee report, the median \nincome of an African American household is only $34,600, almost $24,000 \nless than White households in this country. African Americans are \nalmost three times more likely to live in poverty than White Americans. \nAfrican American households have 13 times less wealth than White \nhouseholds.\n  In my State of New Jersey, the statistics are equally as grim. In New \nJersey, the poverty rate for African Americans hovers at 22 percent and \nis three times that of White Americans, at 6.6 percent. The \nunemployment rate for African Americans is 11.1 percent, and that is \ntwice that of White Americans, at 5.5 percent.\n  According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, in New Jersey, in the 10th \nCongressional District, the unemployment rate for African Americans is \n19.1 percent, which was 2.5 times that of White Americans, at 7.5 \npercent. These glaring disparities betray the American promise, that \nworking hard leads to economic stability.\n  African American women's unemployment today--more women are the \nprimary breadwinners for their families than ever. In fact, 30 percent \nof women earn more than their husbands. Women make up nearly half of \nour Nation's workforce.\n  However, on average, full-time working women earn just 77 cents for \nevery dollar a man earns, and African American women earn just 64 cents \nfor every dollar a man earns.\n  African American women have been hit particularly hard by \nunemployment. According to the National Women's Law Center, in April, \nAfrican American women's unemployment was at 8.8 percent, higher than \nthe peak of total women's unemployment during the Recession. Compare \nthat to the 4.2 percent unemployment rate for White women and to the \nnational unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.\n  We need a more widely shared recovery. We cannot strengthen our \nhouseholds or our economy when such large disparities exist.\n  The Congressional Black Caucus is committed to tackling this \nchallenge. The CBC has fought for much-needed investment in job \ntraining, in education, and in employment opportunities to equip people \nof color and people from low-income communities with the skills needed \nto compete in today's economy.\n\n[[Page H3636]]\n\n  Education is definitely key to this prosperity. It is best when we \ninvest in it and make it possible for all youngsters--all Americans--to \nget a good education.\n  Education is the path to success, but many people simply can't afford \nit. African Americans lag sharply behind White Americans in educational \nattainment as well. It is a consistent theme that we hear--whether it \nis poverty, education, wealth, job opportunities--that these \ncommunities lag behind.\n  We need a strong nation, irrespective of what community you live in. \nHere in Congress and at this CBC, we fight every day to make sure that \nall Americans have an equal opportunity to prosper in this Nation.\n  I see we have been very fortunate to be joined by several of our \ncolleagues.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. It is my pleasure and delight to yield to the \ngentlewoman from Oakland, California (Ms. Lee), who always has great \nthings to share with us.\n  Ms. LEE. First, let me thank you, Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman \nPayne, for hosting this Special Order. Your leadership is so important \nfor these critical discussions.\n  We are trying in many ways under your leadership to really tell the \ntruth and let the entire country know exactly what the economic status \nis, what the job opportunities and educational opportunities are in the \nAfrican American community, and how those disparities continue to grow \nand, really, how we need to really do everything we can here to begin \nto close those gaps and disparities, so thank you very much once again.\n\n  We stand here tonight to discuss economic opportunity--of course, I \nhave to say the lack of opportunity in the Black community. In recent \nmonths, we have seen communities across this country--including \nBaltimore and my hometown of Oakland, California, in my congressional \ndistrict--demand an end to the systemic and institutional racial biases \nthat plague our society.\n  People, especially young people, are calling for an end to centuries \nof oppression. They are fighting for equality of opportunity, the \nopportunity for every American to live the American Dream.\n  Too many places in our Nation are tales of two cities. One city is \nbright, shiny, and new. It is home to new condominiums and fancy \nrestaurants. The other city is left with boarded up stores, abandoned \nhomes, and too many people without a job and without hope.\n  I know Congresswoman Kelly, Congressman Payne, Congressman Jeffries, \nmyself, all of us represent these cities, these two cities within one \ncontext, one environment, one framework, one boundary.\n  We all know that the inequality of opportunity really is not a new \nphenomenon. We have lived with these structural injustices for \ncenturies, but it wasn't until the race riots erupted in Watts, \nChicago, and Detroit in 1968 that our government began to take some \nnotice.\n  After the riots, President Johnson convened the Kerner Commission to \ninvestigate the root causes of the unrest. The Kerner report clearly \nshowed a nation moving towards two societies: one Black, one White--\nseparate and unequal. While the Kerner report identified the problem, \nour Nation failed to truly address it. There still is not liberty and \njustice for all.\n  The Kerner report also called for better training for police, new \ninvestments in jobs and in housing, and the end of de facto \nsegregation. Now, this report really could have been written last \nmonth.\n  Sadly, nearly 50 years later, we still live in a country where the \ncolor of your skin and the ZIP Code in which you were born determines \nyour future, but I am proud to be working with members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus to continue to address these persistent \ninequalities in our Nation by working on policies and programs to \ncreate economic growth, educational opportunities, and job \nopportunities.\n  For example, we know that Black children are disadvantaged from day \none. More than one in three Black children are born in poverty. That is \none in three. In the world's richest and most powerful Nation, a third \nof all African American children are forced to grow up with the harsh \nreality of poverty, day in and day out. This is outrageous. It is \nunacceptable.\n  The cycle of poverty continues in the school systems that \ninstitutionalize this discrimination. While Black students represent \njust 18 percent of preschool enrollment, they account for 42 percent of \npreschool student expulsions.\n  Can you believe that? Preschool student expulsions--that is really a \ndisgrace. We are talking about kids ages 2 to 5 years old. These kids \ndon't even get a start, let alone a Head Start. What in the world are \nchildren that young doing being expelled from preschool?\n  Then in high school, the graduation rate for Black students is 16 \npoints lower than the rate for their White peers. Black students are \nfar less likely than their White counterparts to obtain a 4-year \ncollege degree, and the crisis and inequality extends from education to \nthe economy itself.\n  Over the past four decades, the unemployment rate for Blacks has \nremained nearly double the rate for Whites. Today, the unemployment \nrate in the Black community stands at 10.1 percent; that is reported. \nNow, to put that into context, the current African American \nunemployment rate is higher than the national average was at the height \nof the Great Recession.\n  In addition to higher unemployment rates, African Americans are also \nnearly completely locked out of some key economic sectors, especially \nthe tech sector.\n  Only 1 in 14 technical workers in Silicon Valley is African American \nor Latino. That is 1 in 14. That is why the CBC has launched the TECH \n2020 initiative to work with the tech sector to increase workforce \ndiversity and investments in STEM education and to expand market \nopportunities for businesses to ensure that the jobs of today and \ntomorrow are open to all.\n  For African Americans in the workforce, our Nation's inequalities are \nalso evident in their paychecks. Congressman Payne just laid out the \nstatistics for women. While women earn 77 cents on the dollar that a \nman earns, it is just 64 cents for African American women. The median \nincome for Blacks is a mere $34,000. That is nearly $24,000 less than \nthe median income for Whites.\n  Most Black families hold their wealth in home equity, so the Great \nRecession hit the Black community particularly hard. Too many families \nlost everything, and many more Black families are struggling as home \nprices fail to keep pace with the stock market. Of course, the net \nworth now of African American families is now 6 cents to the dollar for \nWhite families.\n  The time for action is now. These communities, our communities, \ncannot wait any longer. We must come together like never before to \naddress the inequalities in our Nation that leave Black families \nbehind.\n  In my role as co-chair of the CBC's Task Force on Poverty and the \nEconomy and chair of the Democratic whip's Task Force on Poverty, \nIncome Inequality, and Opportunity, we are working very hard to give \nBlack families a fair shot. We are talking about all families, not \nleaving any family behind.\n  I am proud to be working with more than 100 of my colleagues to \nadvance policies that build pathways out of poverty into the middle \nclass for everyone, for all Americans.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Yes, Black lives, like all lives, do count.\n  We have introduced the Half in Ten Act to develop a national strategy \nto cut poverty in half in the next decade. This bill would lift more \nthan 22 million Americans out of poverty into the middle class in just \nthe next 10 years by doubling down and coordinating proven antipoverty \nprograms.\n  The Congressional Black Caucus also took a stand on poverty in its \nalternative budget proposal. We called for robust investments in \neducation, infrastructure, and affordable housing programs that would \nensure opportunities for all. We must keep up this fight until Congress \nmakes these long overdue investments.\n  We need to strengthen the social safety net and invest in proven \nantipoverty programs such as the earned income tax credit and the \nSupplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. These were initiatives \nbegun 50\n\n[[Page H3637]]\n\nyears ago under President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society program, and \nthey are working.\n  We also need to raise the minimum wage and fight for a living wage. \nThat is why we are cosponsors, and we are very proud to be cosponsors, \nof H.R. 122, the Original Living Wage Act, sponsored by Congressman Al \nGreen, which starts by raising the minimum wage for Federal workers and \nbuilding up to a living wage. And Congressman Bobby Scott's Raise the \nWage Act, H.R. 2150, would increase the minimum wage to $12 by 2020. \nThirty-five million Americans would benefit from this.\n  Also we wrote a letter signed by 72 colleagues urging the President \nto adopt a fair chance hiring policy at the Federal level for \nindividuals who have been previously incarcerated. A fair chance hiring \npolicy would level the playing field and help stop the cycle of \nrecidivism that is plaguing our communities. This is simply the right \nthing to do. The Federal Government should not put up barriers to work \nfor those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and \nhaving paid their dues to society.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am saying tonight, and I think all of us are \nsaying, that we need to give families the opportunity to build wealth \nand live the American Dream. We can end poverty not just in the African \nAmerican community, but in the entire United States as a whole. So we \nhave got to keep calling for action.\n  As Dr. King said in his ``Two Americas'' speech that he gave on April \n14, 1968, at Stanford University, 1968, he said: ``We must come to see \nthat social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It \ncomes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of dedicated \nindividuals.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we must be those dedicated individuals working for the \nsocial progress that is so desperately needed. When you look at the \nanalysis of the economy, job opportunities and educational \nopportunities in the African American community, we must win this fight \nbecause the gaps and the disparities are too great. Only then will \nAmerica be strong, because we have to remember that we are a country \nwhere everyone is equal under the law. In fact, when you have \ncommunities with such horrible statistics as we are laying out tonight, \nsuch horrible economic and educational gaps, our country is not as \nstrong as it could be. And so we are saying that we want liberty and \njustice for everyone, that all lives matter, including Black lives.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Lee. Thank you for \nyour hard work, your dedication, and all of your insight. You are so \nright about ZIP Codes that determine so much, unfortunately. And we \nhave to give every young child, every family, a fair chance, and \nhopefully we will see the day when some of the bills that we have put \nforward actually are brought to the floor and voted on in a positive \nway. So thank you so very much.\n  It is now my pleasure and honor to call to the floor and introduce \nCongressman Hakeem Jeffries, from the great State of New York and the \nborough of Brooklyn. Thank you Hakeem.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois, Robin Kelly, for yielding, for her very generous \nintroduction, and certainly to my good friend and classmate, Donald \nPayne, for co-anchoring this Special Order. And as well, I want to \nacknowledge the presence of distinguished Congresswoman Barbara Lee \nfrom California for her continued eloquence and contribution on such a \nsignificant issue.\n  I really count it an honor and a privilege to once again have the \nopportunity to come to the House floor to participate in this Special \nOrder hour, this CBC hour of power, co-anchored by the dynamic duo of \nD. Payne and R. Kelly. We really appreciate their continued \ninvolvement, eloquence, and leadership in helping to articulate for the \nAmerican people, as part of this conversation that we are able to have \nperiodically, the issues of great importance to the African American \ncommunity, but issues that I believe are also of great importance to \nthe broader American community.\n  Poverty is an issue that certainly impacts the city of Newark that \nCongressman Payne represents, the city of Oakland that Barbara Lee \nrepresents, the city of Chicago that Congresswoman Kelly represents, \nand part of the city of New York that I represent in part. Even though \nthe ZIP Codes for those four particular municipalities may be \ndifferent, the issues of lack of economic community opportunity, of \ncourse, are largely the same. Far too many people do not robustly have \nan opportunity to pursue the American Dream in a manner that is \nconsistent with what America is supposed to be, a place where, if you \njust work hard and stay on the right path, you have an opportunity to \nlift yourself up out of the station that you may have been born into in \nlife. But we know, unfortunately, that race seems to play a role in \nthat capacity to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.\n  In fact, while one in three Whites who find themselves in poverty \nhave the ability, it appears, to elevate themselves out of it--and \nthose numbers may even be a little higher--only one in five African \nAmericans appear to have the capacity to lift themselves out of an \nimpoverished condition that they find themselves in.\n  Why that is the case is something that I think we need to be able to \nexplore, because regardless of race, it should be a matter of fact here \nin America that everyone has got a chance to be able to provide for \ntheir families to live a middle class lifestyle.\n  Now, the interesting thing that I found upon my arrival here at the \nCongress is that issues related to poverty really shouldn't be a Black \nissue or a White issue, a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It \nshouldn't be an urban issue or a rural issue. It is an American issue. \nIn fact, when you look at what has often been defined as persistently \npoor counties, counties where 20 percent of the population have been \nbelow the Federal poverty line for 30 or more years, more of those \npersistently poor counties are actually represented in this wonderful \nbody by Republicans than by Democrats. So for the life of me, I haven't \nbeen able to figure out why we have not been able to come together and \nfind common ground to deal with the problem of poverty in America, \nbecause this is not some narrow constituent issue that those of us in \nthe Congressional Black Caucus happen to have and our friends on the \nother side of the aisle aren't experiencing in terms of the people that \nthey represent. This is actually an issue that needs to be addressed by \neverybody.\n  So I am hopeful that as we stand on this House floor, as we extend \nour hands out in partnership to the other side of the aisle, that we \ncan begin to deal with some of these issues, like, for instance, giving \nAmerica a raise. For the life of me, I haven't been able to figure out \nwhy we would essentially endorse a policy, a minimum wage standard that \nmeans you can work full-time, 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, and \nstill, when raising a family of three or four, live below the Federal \npoverty line. Why aren't we making work pay in America?\n  Now, we are seeing that places like Los Angeles that recently raised \nthe minimum wage to $15 an hour are leading the way at the local level, \nand I guess that makes sense. Brandeis once said that State government, \nlocal governments, are laboratories of democracy, and here I found that \nthe House is probably more like the lion's den of democracy. But it \nseems to me that we should be able to figure out a pathway toward \ndealing with some commonsense solutions to dealing with the economic \nproblems that face everyday Americans, like investing in research and \ndevelopment, investing in education and job training, investing in \ntechnology and innovation, investing in transportation and \ninfrastructure, and investing in the American worker in a way that \nmakes sense because the deck has been stacked against him, the African \nAmerican worker or the individual within the African American community \nthat is desperately trying to seek work.\n  We are suffering from double-digit unemployment in this recovery. \nWhen other communities seem to have been able to get back on track and \nour unemployment numbers are still higher than the collective number \nduring the Great Recession, that is a scandal. We should all have a \nproblem with that.\n  But the deck generally is stacked against the American worker. Since \nthe early 1970s, the productivity of the American worker has increased \nin excess of 275 percent. American workers have been more productive \nover the\n\n[[Page H3638]]\n\nlast 40-plus years, yet during that same time period, wages have \nincreased less than 10 percent. They have remained stagnant. The deck \nis stacked.\n  The increase in productivity of the American worker has gone to the \nprivileged few, and we have seen that that has continued during this \nrecovery where corporate profits are way up, the stockmarket is way up, \nand CEO compensation is way up, but people in the African American \ncommunity and others are still struggling to be able to recover from \nthe devastating impact that the collapse of the economy had on our \ncommunity and on many communities throughout America.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank my good friends for raising the \nissue, for once again standing before the American people to address \nthis great issue of significance.\n  We were all in recess over the last few days back at home, spread \nacross the country, but now we have come back. We are here for 4 \nconservative weeks to do the people's business, and I am hopeful we can \nfigure out a way to deal with a laser-like focus the problems \nconfronting the persistently poor and those who are in the middle class \nor trying to become part of the great American middle class.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you very much, Congressman Jeffries. You \nalways have great words, well thought out and so meaningful. I really \nappreciate your comments.\n  With that, I would like to turn it over to the woman from the great \nState of Ohio, my colleague, my freshman colleague and now sophomore \ncolleague, Congressman Joyce Beatty.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you to my colleague, the gentlewoman from \nIllinois, and to my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus this \nevening for holding this Special Order hour focusing on the economy and \njob opportunities in our community. I know tonight that we will speak \nto America and to the folks in this Chamber talking about the issues \nthat revolve around the economy and jobs and how it affects African \nAmericans.\n  I want to join my colleagues tonight and talk about those things that \nget in the way when we talk about our education system, when we talk \nabout the young African Americans going to prison, and when we talk \nabout the cost of higher education, Mr. Speaker. But I also want to say \nthank you, thank you to the HBC universities for educating African \nAmericans. I want to say thank you to those African Americans who are \nin positions to help spur the economy, and having an African American \nin the White House. That is because along the way there has been hope \nand opportunity.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  So before I talk about those things that get in the way, I want to \nmake sure that we send the message to a 12-year-old boy in my district, \nto a freshman in college, to individuals like my young nephew and my \nnieces and my grandchildren, that there will be hope and opportunity \nbecause there are Members in this Chamber and members in the \nCongressional Black Caucus who will come and stand up and build that \nhope and opportunity to make a difference because we will come with \nresolve.\n  But tonight, I want to share that, while much has changed for African \nAmericans since the 1963 March on Washington, one thing has not \nchanged. The unemployment rate among Blacks is about double that among \nWhites, as it has been for almost the past six decades.\n  Mr. Speaker, the current unemployment rate for African Americans is \n9.6 percent. This is nearly twice the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for \nWhite Americans.\n  Although the national unemployment rate has continued to decline \nsince 2008, a significant race gap still remains. African Americans are \nalmost three times more likely to live in poverty than White Americans.\n  African Americans, like all Americans, want economic mobility, access \nto high wages, the ability to support themselves and their families in \na middle class lifestyle, while earning wages to allow for the \naccumulation of wealth.\n  To move forward in creating economic opportunities in the African \nAmerican community, we must remain focused, focused as the members of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus are, on how we can bridge the divides in \nour society, and how we can bring our Nation closer together.\n  It is well established in the fact that students of color face \nharsher punishments in schools than their White peers, leading to a \nhigher number of youth of color in detention, suspension, and even \nbeing expelled.\n  African American students are arrested far more often than their \nWhite classmates. Black and Hispanic students, Mr. Speaker, represent \nmore than 70 percent of those in school-related arrests or referrals to \nlaw enforcement. African Americans make up two-fifths and Hispanics \none-fifth of confined youth today.\n  Disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in our \nschools, but also how we fund education. This is true in K-12, and it \nis also true with higher education.\n  While we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life, \nAfrican Americans are less likely to obtain education beyond high \nschool than White students, and they are less likely to earn a degree.\n  And for those African American college students who are able to make \nit to graduation, after graduating they graduate with more student debt \nthan White students. Continued Federal and State cuts to tuition \nassistance, grant programs, and work study opportunities continue to \nthreaten African American access to a better education.\n  We must confront these injustices head on. We have an obligation to \nfind real solutions to these problems that have plagued our communities \nfor generations. We must promote policies that increase the pace of job \ncreation, expand opportunities for the long-term unemployed to reenter \nthe workforce. We must provide incentives for businesses to hire and \nmake investments in revitalizing schools, infrastructures, and our \nneighborhoods.\n  Like we did 50 years ago as we were in Selma, we must continue to do \nthat again today. We must continue to stand arm in arm so we can bring \nan end to the disparities that hold our hard-working families back from \nachieving the middle class dream and the dreams of all Americans that \nwe all should be equal, Mr. Speaker.\n  And again, to my colleagues, thank you for holding this Special Order \nhour. Thank you for working with the members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus and all of our colleagues so we could move forward and not have \nthe disparities that you have heard about tonight.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you Congresswoman Beatty, and thank you \nfor your words, and also thank you for your insight, as well as our \nother colleagues that have shared this evening with us tonight. We \nreally, really appreciate it. And we hope that when we come back next \nyear this time that we can see some improvements and not have to talk \nabout the same things over and over and over. We have heard back from \n1968 some of the same statistics, and here we are so many years later \nstill having to talk about the same thing. So we hope to see progress \ntoward this economic stability for the African American family.\n  We have heard from my colleagues some staggering statistics. The \nstory is even more disconcerting for our Nation's youth. Workers 19 \nyears old and younger are finding it more difficult than ever to find \nquality afterschool and summer employment. The unemployment rate for \nWhite youth age 16 to 19 stands at 14.5 percent--again, roughly half \nthat of their Black teenage counterparts, who have an unemployment rate \nof 27.5 percent.\n  Over one in four Black teenagers who are looking for work are unable \nto find it. Over one in four. This is simply unacceptable. As a Nation, \nwe must do more to invest in underserved communities and provide \nopportunities for self-empowerment and growth for our Nation's youth.\n  Denying African American teens a summer job could cause them to miss \nout on a lifetime of opportunities and experiences. Many high school \nstudents use the summer months to work and put money aside for college. \nBut if there are no jobs to be found, Mr. Speaker, many students will \nbe denied the opportunity to attend college and will forever be shut \nout from many opportunities and will forever be shut out\n\n[[Page H3639]]\n\nalso from the many jobs that require a college degree.\n  With college graduates earning an average of $45,000 per year, \ncompared to those only with a high school diploma earning an average of \n$28,000 per year, lacking a college degree can set noncollege graduates \nup for a lifetime of economic difficulties and frustrations. That is \nalmost $1 million in lost wages over the course of a lifetime.\n  I have been working in my district to connect employers with eager \nyoung employees. In April, I hosted my second annual Youth Employment \nSummit, where local youth aged 15 to 24 could connect with area \ncompanies. Many were hired on the spot, and even more were scheduled \ninterviews for jobs and internships this summer.\n  But job fairs alone are not the answer, Mr. Speaker. As a Nation, we \nneed increased investment in job training, infrastructure investment, \nand community development. In the long run, any economic growth that \ndoesn't allow for full participation of all Americans, including those \ntraditionally marginalized like minorities and young people, will not \nbe sustainable. Our economy must work for everyone, not just a select \nfew.\n  Continuing to leave underserved communities behind will only \nperpetuate and expand the great disparities in wealth between American \ncitizens and continue to breed a cycle of poverty, violence, and a \nsense of helplessness in those communities.\n  Reinvesting in our Nation's youth and our Nation's minority \ncommunities is not only vital to our country's economic health but to \nits public health as well.\n  Lack of economic opportunity leads to violence, and violence only \nperpetuates a lack of economic opportunity. The two go hand-in-hand, \nand, if not addressed, it will create a downward spiral, preventing any \npositive growth for our Nation's youth and disadvantaged communities.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will recognize the first annual National Gun \nViolence Awareness Day. Like many of my colleagues, I will wear orange. \nOrange is the color hunters wear to alert their companions of their \npresence, to avoid being shot. It is a warning color. Orange screams: \n``Don't shoot.''\n  Too many of my constituents often feel like they have to wear orange \nwhile walking down their block on Chicago's South Side. In fact, \ntomorrow is Hadiya Pendleton's birthday. As we all know, she was shot \nwhile playing in a park or running away.\n  Mr. Speaker, I often say that nothing stops a bullet like a job. The \nsurest way to decrease violence and increase economic prosperity in \nunderserved communities is to expand access to jobs and education.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois and also the \ngentlewoman from Ohio for joining us this evening. Her thoughts and \ncomments are always salient and to the point, and we appreciate her \nsupporting us in this effort. We sophomores have to stick together. It \nis just always a delight for me to be able to hear what Mrs. Beatty has \nto say in terms of the topics that we discuss. She has demonstrated \ntrue leadership in the CBC since her arrival.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth, \nand there are many issues, many mottos, many sayings that go along with \nthis Nation. And one of them is that all men are created equal. But why \ndo we continue to find such gaps in all people being created equal and \nthe circumstances some communities find themselves in?\n  Like anyone, young African Americans would like to grow up, educated \nwell, raise their families, and eke out an income that sustains them \nand creates a quality of life that all people deserve. But that doesn't \nhappen. We have the haves and the have-nots, the 99 percent and the 1 \npercent. And too often it seems like that is what our Nation is built \non. Sure, we talk about equality, we talk about equal rights, but for \nsome reason, in many instances, it just doesn't seem to fit the \ncircumstance.\n  Wages for working people have stagnated, as my colleague from New \nYork said, over 15 years, but we have watched the top 1 percent make \nmore and more money. Their quality of life is something people would \ndream about, hear about in fairy tales. But, no, some people are living \nthat well while others struggle every single day.\n  And what would it be in a Nation if we were held to these different \nvirtues, to these different mottos, to these different sayings? Well, \nit would mean, Mr. Speaker, that people needing food stamps wouldn't be \ngoing up. That is not something people look forward to. That is a last-\nditch effort to feed your family. That is desperation. That is not a \ngoal to aspire to.\n  Too many times we feel that people in this country that have not made \nit or have found it difficult to be successful, well, they are just not \ndoing what they need to do. There are systemic structural circumstances \nin this Nation that keep people from attaining success. And until we \ndeal with those issues, we will continue to see what we see.\n  And let me just say that why wouldn't we want more people to have \nprosperity? Why wouldn't we want more people to be doing well? That \nmeans they are paying into the system, that they don't have to rely on \nthe system and take out of the system. The more people paying in, the \nmore it reduces the burden of the rest of us. I don't see why that is \nnot clear.\n  I made the same example during our talks about the Affordable Care \nAct. The more people you have paying into the system, the less we have \nto pay because, guess what. When there is someone who is not paying \ninto the system, guess who picks up the burden--the rest of us.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  If you disburse that cost over more people--it is basic economics--\nguess what happens? It reduces it for everyone.\n  Here we are in the greatest nation in the world--no question about \nit--and at times, we are talking around the world about how other \ncountries should treat their people. You have to look inside, and \npeople are able to point back at us and say: Wait a minute. Why do you \nhave communities such as that? Why is there such disparity? How can you \ntell us when we see what is happening in your nation?\n  Mr. Speaker, we can't talk out of both sides of our mouths. If we are \ngoing to be the greatest nation, then we have to act like it and stand \nup and do the things that make it a great nation.\n  There is no reason we cannot find a way out of this problem. We are \nable to create jobs as we have smart businesspeople throughout this \nNation if there were an incentive for them to do it, but the status quo \nis all right with them because their value continues to go up, that of \nthe 1 percent, so why should they change?\n  If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That is their motto. They are doing \nbetter and better while, for the rest of us, our quality of life goes \ndown or remains stagnant.\n  Mr. Speaker, this has had an adverse impact on African American \nbusinesses, and in an increasingly connected economy, it is also \ndetrimental to the broader economic growth in this country in that all \npeople are not able to have a living wage or to take care of their \nfamilies.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Kelly, for her leadership \nand for leading tonight's Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order \nhour.\n  In closing, as we welcome the continued recovery and growth of our \neconomy, we must keep in mind that work remains to build an equal \nsociety and to expand opportunities for African Americans across the \ncountry. African American communities are not sharing in the economic \nrecovery.\n  We have a moral obligation to tackle the economic challenges facing \nBlack communities and to create avenues of economic prosperity for all \nAmericans. The CBC will be at that fight for as long as necessary. It \nis our agenda that works for all Americans, African Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, White Americans.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Payne.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank my colleagues for giving the \nCongressional Black Caucus and this Congress the opportunity to put the \nimportant economic concerns of this Nation's in the spotlight this \nevening. Millions of Americans are living on the brink.\n  These aren't merely concerns for these individuals and their \nfamilies;\n\n[[Page H3640]]\n\nthey are national concerns. I have always believed that what makes our \nNation great is our recognition that everyone should have the ability \nto live and rise to their full potential. Economic parity is one of the \nmost fundamental issues facing us as a nation right now.\n  I hope, in this hour, we have appropriately shed some light on some \nof the concerns of the Congressional Black Caucus when it comes to the \neconomy and to job opportunities in our communities--or the lack of \nthem.\n  Again, I want to thank my coanchor, the Honorable Donald Payne, Jr., \nwho himself is a strong defender of the economic possibilities of \nNewark, of Orange, and of communities across New Jersey's 10th \nCongressional District.\n  I will close as I began this evening in saying that the time to act \nis now. The necessity in responding to the economic crises of Black \nemployment and underemployment should be an American imperative. The \ntime is now to support a bold and inclusive economy that propels us \ninto a sustainable future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my \ncolleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus in opposition to income \ninequality in the United States. As millions of Americans remain \nwithout work, while others are underpaid or underemployed, it is \nimperative that we address the growing threat to our country that is \nincome inequality.\n  Since the 1970s, we have witnessed a dangerous trend develop where \nwage growth for middle and lower income households has become stagnant \nwhile incomes at the very top continue to rise sharply. From 1973 to \n2005, real hourly wages for the top 10 percent rose by 30 percent or \nmore, whereas the bottom 50 percent of all Americans experienced only \nmarginal real wage increases of a little more than 5 percent.\n  The income gap is further amplified when comparing races. Overall, \nCaucasian males earn a median income of more than $40,000 per year \nwhile African American males average roughly $30,000 during the same \ntime period. Hispanic Americans average just over $26,000 each year. \nThese discrepancies by race are particularly alarming, considering that \nthese figures are even lower for women.\n  The percentage of wealth controlled by the richest Americans is \nanother disturbing fact that is often overlooked. The top 1 percent of \nAmericans own 40 percent of our entire nation's wealth, while the \nbottom 80 percent of Americans share only 7 percent of the nation's \nwealth. In historical terms, the last time our nation faced such a wide \nincome gap was during the 1920s leading up to the Great Depression.\n  Mr. Speaker, while Congress struggles with raising the minimum wage, \nmillions of working individuals and families across the country \ncontinue to struggle with stagnant pay and rising inflation. Until we \ntake a serious look at comprehensive reform to curb income inequality, \nthe consequences will continue harming our communities of color, and \nprove catastrophic for our nation's economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Jolly (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of a \nflight delay.\n  Mr. Bishop of Georgia (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n  Ms. Castor of Florida (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on \naccount of her daughter's high school graduation.\n  Mr. Clyburn (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and June 2.\n  Mr. Gene Green of Texas (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on \naccount of a delayed flight.\n  Ms. Jackson Lee (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and the \nbalance of the week on account of official business.\n  Mrs. Napolitano (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n  Mr. Takai (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nattending daughter's graduation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/house-section/article/H3640-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 246.
