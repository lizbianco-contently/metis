Mr. Speaker, the President's legacy of \ntragic failure is more revealing every day as refugees flee conflict, \nwith children drowning at sea. He should change course to build peace \nand avoid murderous attacks on American families.\n  I appreciate The Washington Post's editorial page, Editor Fred Hiatt, \nwho clarified last week:\n  ``He withdrew all U.S. troops from Iraq when experts advised that a \nresidual force of 15,000 would help to keep a fragile peace. He bombed \nLibya to overthrow its dictator but opposed a small NATO training force \nthat might have stabilized the new government.''\n  The President's failure to enforce a declared red line in Syria, the \nPresident's abandonment of the people of Iraq, the President's \ncapitulation to the autocrats of Iran allowing nuclear development, and \nthe President's betrayal of Israel have been catastrophic and created \nchaos.\n  It is not too late for the President to change course to promote \npeace in the Middle East. To allow safe havens for Islamist radicals \nabroad is a threat to American families at home. Senator Lindsey Graham \ntells the truth.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8417-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ISIS THREAT IS NOT A MYTH\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, ISIS has vowed to takes its murderous \nIslamic jihad to America. There are ISIS fighters already here and more \non the way. Meanwhile, the President wants to add thousands more \nunvetted Syrian refugees to the mix, this when his own FBI Director \nsays the Federal Government cannot effectively conduct proper security \nchecks on these Syrian nationals.\n  Over half of the State Governors have refused to take refugees \nbecause of the inability to fully vet them. But the administration says \nStates have to take the refugees, whether they like it or not.\n  The law says the Federal Government must ``consult'' with States \nregarding refugee resettlement, but it is unclear if they can be \nrejected by the States. That is why I have introduced the States' Right \nof Refugee Refusal Act. This bill gives State Governors the choice to \naccept refugees or not.\n  Let's resolve this now with legislation, not lawsuits. We don't have \nyears to wait for the courts to decide. Meanwhile, let's ramp up aid to \nSyrian refugee camps overseas and encourage our Middle Eastern allies \nlike the Saudi Arabians to step up and help.\n  The ISIS threat is not a myth.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8417-8", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8417-H8418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   USA FREEDOM ACT PRESERVES LIBERTY\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\n[[Page H8418]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LaMALFA.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (S. 611) to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to reauthorize \ntechnical assistance to small public water systems, and for other \npurposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Grassroots Rural and Small \n     Community Water Systems Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (Public \n     Law 104-182) authorized technical assistance for small and \n     rural communities to assist those communities in complying \n     with regulations promulgated pursuant to the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.);\n       (2) technical assistance and compliance training--\n       (A) ensures that Federal regulations do not overwhelm the \n     resources of small and rural communities; and\n       (B) provides small and rural communities lacking technical \n     resources with the necessary skills to improve and protect \n     water resources;\n       (3) across the United States, more than 90 percent of the \n     community water systems serve a population of less than \n     10,000 individuals;\n       (4) small and rural communities have the greatest \n     difficulty providing safe, affordable public drinking water \n     and wastewater services due to limited economies of scale and \n     lack of technical expertise; and\n       (5) in addition to being the main source of compliance \n     assistance, small and rural water technical assistance has \n     been the main source of emergency response assistance in \n     small and rural communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) to assist small and rural communities most effectively, \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     should prioritize the types of technical assistance that are \n     most beneficial to those communities, based on input from \n     those communities; and\n       (2) local support is the key to making Federal assistance \n     initiatives work in small and rural communities to the \n     maximum benefit.\n\n     SEC. 4. FUNDING PRIORITIES.\n\n       Section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300j-1(e)) is amended--\n       (1) by designating the first through seventh sentences as \n     paragraphs (1) through (7), respectively;\n       (2) in paragraph (5) (as so designated), by striking ``1997 \n     through 2003'' and inserting ``2015 through 2020''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) Nonprofit organizations.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Administrator may use amounts made \n     available to carry out this section to provide grants or \n     cooperative agreements to nonprofit organizations that \n     provide to small public water systems onsite technical \n     assistance, circuit-rider technical assistance programs, \n     multistate, regional technical assistance programs, onsite \n     and regional training, assistance with implementing source \n     water protection plans, and assistance with implementing \n     monitoring plans, rules, regulations, and water security \n     enhancements.\n       ``(B) Preference.--To ensure that technical assistance \n     funding is used in a manner that is most beneficial to the \n     small and rural communities of a State, the Administrator \n     shall give preference under this paragraph to nonprofit \n     organizations that, as determined by the Administrator, are \n     the most qualified and experienced in providing training and \n     technical assistance to small public water systems and that \n     the small community water systems in that State find to be \n     the most beneficial and effective.\n       ``(C) Limitation.--No grant or cooperative agreement \n     provided or otherwise made available under this section may \n     be used for litigation pursuant to section 1449.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few minutes to explain why we are \npushing this bill and what the bill does.\n  The smallest water systems of our country account for 77 percent of \nall systems. These smaller and rural communities, with populations of \n10,000 or less, have a high percentage of systems in significant \nnoncompliance with drinking water regulations and face significant \nchallenges in maintaining,\n\n[[Page H8419]]\n\nreplacing, or upgrading aging and obsolete drinking water and \nwastewater infrastructure.\n  A major source of financial stress for small and rural drinking water \nsupply systems is compliance with a number of drinking water \nregulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under the \nSafe Drinking Water Act.\n  Unlike water systems in larger markets, these same small and rural \ncommunities do not have the rate base or access to capital markets to \nfund the cost of some projects and still maintain affordable rates. As \na result, these communities depend heavily on Federal and State grants \nand subsidized loan programs to finance their needs.\n  Many times, simply giving them more money is not the answer. These \ncommunities may need access to technical professionals to help find the \nmost cost-effective way to meet these new standards. Technical \nassistance offered by EPA has historically enabled small public water \nsystems to identify affordable repair and replacement options for their \nsystems.\n  Currently, section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act provides \nEPA authority to provide technical assistance to ``small public water \nsystems'' to enable these systems to achieve and maintain compliance \nwith applicable Federal drinking water regulations and to help small \npublic water systems respond to environmental stressors, including \nthrough ``circuit-rider'' and multi-State regional technical assistance \nprograms, training, and preliminary engineering evaluations.\n  S. 611 reauthorizes EPA's technical assistance program through 2020 \nfor small public water systems, maintaining the existing funding level \nof $15 million annually, including 3 percent for technical assistance \nto public water systems owned and operated by Indian tribes.\n  In addition, S. 611 authorizes EPA funding under section 1442 of the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. This funding is used to provide grants or \ncooperative agreements to nonprofit organizations to provide technical \nassistance to small public water systems. This technical assistance \nwill help these systems achieve and maintain compliance with national \nprimary drinking water regulations.\n  These grants or cooperative agreements are supposed to go to \nnonprofits with a history of providing certain types of on-site \ntechnical assistance and training, and EPA should give preference to \nthose nonprofits that the Administrator determines are most qualified \nand experienced in providing training and technical assistance to small \npublic water systems that small public water systems find most \nbeneficial and effective.\n  Finally, S. 611 prohibits these grants and cooperative agreements \nfrom being used to bring a citizen suit under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct.\n  The Senate passed this bill by unanimous consent. The Energy and \nCommerce Committee reported it by voice vote. Our strong vote today \nsends this bill right to the White House and, I expect, into law.\n  I urge all Members to support S. 611.\n  And I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Tonko, and the gentleman \nfrom Mississippi (Mr. Harper), my colleague, for their diligence in \npushing this legislation forward.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I too rise in support of S. 611, the Grassroots Rural and Small \nCommunity Water Systems Assistance Act. This legislation will \nreauthorize funding to nonprofits that provide technical assistance to \nsmall public water systems under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Small and rural water systems face unique challenges. These systems \nhave a smaller rate base, making it difficult to afford necessary \nupgrades and maintenance, and often lack the expertise to comply with \nnational drinking water standards.\n  S. 611 will prioritize funding to nonprofits that provide technical \nassistance to these small public water systems, giving them the needed \nexpertise to tackle these challenges. This is a small but a very \nimportant step towards resolving our Nation's drinking water problems.\n  As we know, aging infrastructure, problems with source water quality, \nand limited budgets are taking a toll on drinking water systems. The \nchanging climate is creating further challenges. Public water systems \nare facing extreme conditions that are endangering our drinking water. \nSevere storms, algal blooms, extreme droughts, and saltwater intrusion \nare some of the examples of the conditions these systems face, all of \nwhich are affecting public water systems' ability to provide safe \ndrinking water to our communities.\n  Small public water systems rely on technical assistance from \nnonprofit organizations to navigate everything from routine maintenance \nto managing these complex situations to ensure that the water that they \nprovide is safe for their consumers.\n  S. 611 is one step of many that we must take to address our Nation's \ndrinking water issues. Our Nation's water systems serve over 272 \nmillion people, and, according to EPA, they require infrastructure \ninvestments of $334 billion over the next 17 years.\n  I look forward to continued bipartisan support for water-related \nlegislation, including reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nand State Revolving Fund, so that we can address the myriad of issues \nthat are facing our drinking water systems.\n  I would like also to thank Environment and the Economy Subcommittee \nRanking Member Tonko and Representative Harper for their work on this \nimportant issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, the State of Mississippi has led in this \nlegislation from our former colleague, now-Senator Roger Wicker.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Harper), the \nauthor on the House side of the committee.\n  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Across our country, over 90 percent of community water systems serve \na population of less than 10,000. The 1996 amendments to the Safe \nDrinking Water Act authorized technical assistance for small and rural \ncommunities to assist them in complying with rules and regulations \npromulgated under the act.\n  This important technical assistance and compliance training ensures \nthat Federal regulations do not overwhelm the resources of small and \nrural communities. It also allows small communities access to \nassistance which is necessary to improve and protect their water \nresources. Without these initiatives, effective implementation of the \nSafe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act in rural areas would be \nnearly impossible.\n  In addition to being the main source of compliance assistance, rural \nwater technical assistance has been invaluable in emergency responses \nin small and rural communities.\n  Rural water technicians led the assistance effort in the wake of \nHurricane Katrina, where hundreds of communities relied on assistance \nfrom the local and surrounding State rural water associations for \nimmediate assistance in restoring drinking water and sanitation \nservices.\n  S. 611, the Grassroots Rural and Small Community Water Systems \nAssistance Act, would help ensure that this technical assistance \ncontinues.\n  As the author of the House companion bill, H.R. 2853, I appreciate \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee's commitment to this issue and \nespecially want to thank Chairman Shimkus and Ranking Member Tonko and \nthe entire Environment and Economy Subcommittee staff for the time and \neffort they have invested in discussions, negotiations, legislative \nhearings, and markup of this legislation.\n  Throughout this process, my friend Kirby Mayfield, who is the \nexecutive director of the Mississippi Rural Water Association, and Mike \nKeegan with the National Rural Water Association and others have \nprovided a wealth of knowledge in helping to develop and shepherd this \nlegislation.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Roger Wicker and his staff for \nsharing my deep interest in this issue and for authoring S. 611 and \nworking towards its passage in the Senate and in the House.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, thank you for your attention to this issue that \naffects so many of our constituents.\n  I encourage all Members to support S. 611.\n\n[[Page H8420]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), a distinguished member of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nthe Environment and the Economy. And I thank him for his work on this \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for \nyielding.\n  I rise in support of this bill. S. 611, the Grassroots Rural and \nSmall Community Water Systems Assistance Act, reauthorizes a small but \nimportant program that delivers technical assistance and training to \nour community water systems.\n  I want to thank Representative Harper for introducing H.R. 2853, the \nHouse companion bill to Senator Wicker's bill, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of that legislation.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Upton, our Ranking Member Pallone, \nChairman Shimkus, and the Energy and Commerce staff for working with us \non report language to clarify language in this bill so that we can \nindeed provide a wide range of technical assistance that would help \nsmall water systems, such as source water protection, system monitoring \nand efficiency, sustainability, and water security aspects.\n  Many small and rural communities, with populations of 10,000 or less, \nface challenges in maintaining and upgrading aging water \ninfrastructure. The ratepayer base for these small systems simply does \nnot provide a sufficient operating budget to support full-time \ntechnical positions.\n  Source water quality problems, resulting in system shutdowns and \nexpensive treatment processes, are an increasing problem for far too \nmany public water systems due to inadequate attention to nonpoint \nsource pollution.\n  In other areas, drought has affected both water quality and quantity, \nchallenging the ability of water utilities to meet their basic service \nobligations.\n  Technical assistance for small systems is essential to finding the \nmost cost-effective solutions to these problems. I know that the \nCircuit Rider program in New York serves many small public water \nsystems and provides essential technical support to small system \noperators.\n  S. 611 would authorize the appropriation of $15 million annually, \nfrom 2016 to 2020, for the Environmental Protection Agency's program \nthat provides technical assistance to these given systems.\n  The previous authorization for this program expired back in 2003. It \nhas been nearly 20 years since we last authorized this program, along \nwith the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, the SRF, the primary \nsource of Federal funding for water infrastructure.\n  The Drinking Water SRF's authorization also expired in 2003. It too \nneeds to be reauthorized and at a higher level than was provided in \n2003 to support all systems, small and large, to make the necessary \nrepairs and the necessary upgrades.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Across our country, we experience over 700 water main breaks per \nday--700 per day--breaks that result in losses of treated water, not \njust water that is lost in those breaks, but consumer tax dollars and \nrate dollars, and with a growing backlog of drinking water \ninfrastructure needs, estimated at $384.2 billion over the next 20 \nyears in the EPA's fifth national assessment of public water system \ninfrastructure needs. That indeed is staggering.\n  It is clear we should be doing much more to assist our States and \nwater utilities to reduce this backlog. Recently we came together to \npass a bipartisan, long-term surface transportation bill. It had the \noverwhelming bipartisan support of this House.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that our roads and bridges are in \ndesperate need of investment. But we cannot forget about the hidden \ninfrastructure, the critical, unseen, out-of-sight and out-of-mind \ninfrastructure that we rely upon to deliver safe, reliable, and \naffordable drinking water. We have neglected this essential \ninfrastructure for far too long already. It, too, needs more Federal \nfunding and a long-term reauthorization.\n  Infrastructure does not repair itself. It does not improve with age. \nOur inaction is only adding to the expenses of State and local \ngovernments and forcing increases in water utility rates for given \nconsumers.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 611 is a good bill and a good start. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill, but I hope we use this opportunity as \na challenge, as a challenge to recognize that this is just the \nbeginning of the drinking water infrastructure issues that we face. We \nmust come together to reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving \nFund.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, again I want to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important measure, S. 611.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot to be done on \ninfrastructure, and safe drinking water is among those important \nthings. My district is very large and rural, with 33 counties in \nsouthern Illinois. This bill will help.\n  We need to do what we can now, and hopefully this success, as my \ncolleague Mr. Tonko has said, will help us build on future areas where \nwe can work together. Mr. Tonko will continue to be a rabid dog on this \nissue, and I appreciate his commitment for further discussions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 611.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8420-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8420-H8423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         STRENGTHENING STATE AND LOCAL CYBER CRIME FIGHTING ACT\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. \nPierluisi) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3490 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves a vital \npurpose in preparing State and local law enforcement to combat computer \nand cybercrime, and I am pleased to support this legislation.\n  The United States Department of Justice has declared that cybercrime \n``is one of the greatest threats facing our country'' and that \ncybercrime has ``enormous implications for our national security, \neconomic prosperity, and public safety.''\n  The Justice Department has also stated that ``the range of threats \nand the challenges they present for law enforcement expand just as \nrapidly as technology evolves.''\n  With this in mind, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves \nthe vital purpose of providing legal and judicial professionals a free \ncomprehensive education on current cybercrime trends, investigative \nmethods, and prosecutorial and judicial challenges.\n  The National Computer Forensics Institute is a 32,000-square-foot \nfacility located in Hoover, Alabama. This Institute boasts three \nmultipurpose classrooms, two network investigations classrooms, a mock \ncourtroom, and a forensics lab.\n  Special agents of the United States Secret Service staff the \nInstitute and work diligently training attendees in modern counter-\ncybercrime procedures and evidence collection. When the attendees \nleave, they take with them the critical knowledge and equipment \nrequired to conduct autonomous and thorough cybercrime investigations \nat their home agencies.\n  Since its creation in 2008, the Institute has earned praise for its \nwork in preparing America's local law enforcement in how to deal with \nthese important technology issues.\n  Over the last 7 years, the Institute has instructed law enforcement \nprofessionals from every State in the country and from over 500 \ndifferent law enforcement agencies.\n  In fact, law enforcement in my own district has benefited from NCFI \ntraining, including Lynchburg Commonwealth's Attorney Mike Doucette and \nhis staff.\n  Each professional educated at the Institute is a force multiplier for \nthe Secret Service. After successful completion of the program, the \nstudents can bring their new knowledge back to their local agency to \ninform their colleagues how to properly conduct computer forensic \ninvestigations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that, for our Nation to successfully \ncombat the cybercrime threat, we must support legislation such as H.R. \n3490. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for \nsponsoring this important legislation.\n  Authorizing the existing National Computer Forensics Institute in \nFederal law will cement its position as a high-tech cybercrime training \nfacility and will help law enforcement professionals nationwide in \ntheir efforts to combat cyber- and computer crimes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3490, the Strengthening State \nand Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act. This bill establishes the National \nComputer Forensics Institute as an official Federal program which will \nbe managed by the Department of Homeland Security and operated by the \nUnited States Secret Service.\n  I support this bill because it addresses a topic that is critically \nimportant to our country. Cybercrime poses an enormous threat to \nnational security, economic prosperity, and public safety. The range of \nthreats and the challenges they present for law enforcement expand just \nas rapidly as technology evolves.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, during the past decade, our Federal law \nenforcement community has observed a significant increase in the \nquality, quantity, and complexity of cybercrimes targeting private \nindustry, including our financial services sector.\n  These crimes include intrusions, hacking attacks, the installation of \nmalicious software, and data breaches that have exposed the personal \ninformation of millions of U.S. citizens as well as members of our law \nenforcement and intelligence services.\n  To date, the National Computer Forensics Institute has trained more \nthan 800 State and local law enforcement officers and approximately 238 \nprosecutors. With this legislation, the Institute will continue to \neducate State and local law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and \njudges on current trends in cyber- and electronic crimes investigations \nand the Institute will train them on proper procedures to conduct these \nimportant investigations.\n  In addition, the National Computer Forensics Institute will continue \nto work to protect our citizens' personal information from unwarranted \ngovernment intrusion. By establishing national standards for conducting \ncybercrime investigations, the Institute will promote these important \nprivacy interests.\n  Finally, it is important to highlight the successful efforts that \nhave already taken place to combat the ever-growing threat of \ncybercrime. As the operator of the National Computer Forensics \nInstitute, the Secret Service has demonstrated its expertise in \npursuing cybercrime investigations.\n  The Secret Service's investigations have resulted in over 4,900 \narrests, associated with more than $1.4 billion in fraud losses and the \nprevention of over $11 billion in potential fraud losses during the \npast 5 years.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will assist law enforcement \nin continuing to combat the threats cybercrime poses to national \nsecurity, economic prosperity, and public safety.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Ratcliffe), the chief sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership \non these issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3490, the Strengthening \nState and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act. This bill will authorize the \nNational Computer Forensics Institute, or NCFI, which is located in \nHoover, Alabama.\n  Mr. Speaker, when FBI Director Jim Comey recently testified before \nthe House Judiciary Committee, he told us that ``an element of \nvirtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI \nfaces is cyber-based or facilitated.''\n\n[[Page H8422]]\n\n  I want to pause and let that sink in for a minute because it makes a \nperfect case for this bill. The fact that our Federal law enforcement \nis seeing a cyber element to almost every national security threat and \ncrime problem is incredibly compelling because you can be certain that \nour State and local law enforcement are seeing the same trend, but with \na lot fewer opportunities to learn how to address it.\n  Now, we have all seen the crime shows on TV where pieces of DNA \nevidence--a strand of hair or a drop of blood--are used to solve a \ncase. But in today's world, we have to rely upon digital evidence, an \nemail that was sent or an online purchase that was made or geolocation \ntechnology that places an individual at the scene of the crime.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's cybercriminals present new challenges to law \nenforcement, prosecutors, and judges. It no longer takes a \nsophisticated cybercriminal to compromise personal and sensitive \ninformation of U.S. companies and everyday Americans. Any criminal can \nnow easily obtain from the dark Web the cyber exploit tools that are \nneeded to create this type of havoc.\n  And so, with the ever-increasing number of cyberattacks, it is vital \nthat our State and local law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges be \nproperly trained to respond to cybercrime and to protect the American \npeople.\n  The NCFI, which my bill authorizes, does just that. The NCFI was \ncreated in 2007 by the State of Alabama and is now operated by the \nUnited States Secret Service for the purpose of training State and \nlocal law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges on how to \ninvestigate cyber- and electronic crimes, on methods for conducting \ncomputer and mobile device forensic examinations, and on performing \nnetwork intrusion investigations.\n  The NCFI has already garnered a reputation as the premier crime-\ntraining center in the Nation, supporting State and local law \nenforcement investigators, prosecutors, and judges. To date, it has \nalready trained and equipped more than 4,500 local law enforcement \nofficials from all 50 States.\n  These NCFI graduates--all of whom are now equipped to hit back on \ncybercrime--represent more than 1,500 agencies nationwide, including \nagencies from Texas' Fourth Congressional District that I represent, \nlike the Greenville Police Department, the Hunt County District \nAttorney's Office, and the Collin County Sheriff's Office.\n  Kelli Aiken, an assistant district attorney from Hunt County, told us \nthat her training at the NCFI had ``transformed their evidence \ncollection and prosecution, leading to more successful apprehensions, \nmore prosecutions, and more convictions.''\n  So you see, Mr. Speaker, this isn't some highly theoretical bill \nwhere the rubber never meets the road. This piece of legislation takes \nwhat is already working and formalizes these practices to better \namplify their impact going forward.\n  This bill gives our law enforcement across the country the necessary \ntools and training to successfully fight cybercriminals in the 21st \ncentury. That is why I am honored to introduce it and why I am grateful \nfor its vote today here in the House.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Palmer).\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  As has been noted, prior to 2008, training for State and local law \nenforcement in cybercrimes was difficult to find.\n  Recognizing this problem in 2007, the State of Alabama took the lead \nand offered the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security \nproperty and funds to construct a state-of-the-art facility if the \nFederal Government would fund the training and allow the Secret Service \nto operate it. I am proud to say this facility is located in my \ndistrict in the city of Hoover.\n  Since the NCFI opened its doors in May of 2008, State and local law \nenforcement officers, as has been mentioned already, have come from all \nacross the Nation for vital training in this one-of-a-kind facility, \nwhere they are trained by Secret Service agents on the same equipment \nand software that our Secret Service agents use. NCFI has trained law \nenforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges from all 50 States, and \nliterally has graduates from hundreds of agencies around the country.\n  I am very proud of the work that NCFI is doing, that it is being \nrecognized, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3490.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3490, the \nStrengthening the State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act, which \namends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in the Department \nof Homeland Security a National Computer Forensics Institute.\n  As the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security and Investigations, as well as a senior Member of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security, I am well aware of the threats that our \nnation faces in cyberspace.\n  H.R. 3490 directs the U.S. Secret Service to disseminate homeland \nsecurity information related to the investigation and prevention of \ncyber and electronic crime, including threats or acts of terrorism, to \neducate, train, and equip state, local, tribal, and territorial law \nenforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 3490 includes two important amendments that I \noffered during the Homeland Security Markup.\n  The first Jackson Lee Amendment provides local, state, territorial \nand tribal law enforcement access to the cybercrime expertise of the \nSecret Service in collecting, retaining and processing evidence found \non digital devices.\n  This amendment makes vital federal cybercrime investigative resource \navailable to local, state, territorial and tribal law enforcement.\n  The U.S. Secret Service maintains Electronic Crimes Task Forces \nfocusing on identifying and locating international cyber criminals \nconnected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data breaches, and other \ncomputer-related crimes.\n  The Secret Service's Cyber Intelligence Section has directly \ncontributed to the arrest of transnational cyber criminals responsible \nfor the theft of hundreds of millions of credit card numbers and the \nloss of approximately $600 million to financial and retail \ninstitutions.\n  The Secret Service also runs the National Computer Forensic \nInstitute, which provides law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and \njudges with cyber training and information to combat cybercrime.\n  The second Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. 3490 provides assurances \nthat nothing in this Act shall be construed to abridge or impair the \nrights of persons in the United States protection by the Fourth and \nFifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  As the work law enforcement and national security personnel must rely \nmore and more on their ability to access information in cyber space or \nwhat might be stored on personal devices, it is important that the \npublic knows and understands that their Constitutional rights must and \nwill be protected.\n  I know that the Chairs and Ranking Members of the House Committees on \nthe Judiciary and Homeland Security, and many other colleagues have \nworked side-by-side to assure that our efforts to combat terrorism at \nhome do not diminish the liberties that we all cherish.\n  I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 3490.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3490, the \n``Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act''.\n  H.R. 3490 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the \nNational Computer Forensics Institute, or NCFI, as operated by the U.S. \nSecret Service to educate and train State, local, tribal, and \nterritorial law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges about \ntechniques and procedures related to the investigation and prevention \nof cyber, electronic, and information security crimes, including \nthreats or acts of terrorism.\n  The training model used at the Institute is based upon the Secret \nService's successful cyber investigative strategy, which relies on \npartnering with and sharing information between academia, private \nindustry and law enforcement to combat the ever-evolving threat of \ncyber crime.\n  This bipartisan measure, authored by the Chairman of the Committee's \nCybersecurity Subcommittee Chairman, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. \nRatcliffe, does a couple of important things.\n  First, to ensure that the important work of the NCFI continues, it \nauthorizes this federally funded training center, which has operated in \nHoover, Alabama since 2008, in the Homeland Security Act.\n  Second, it seeks to raise the quality of cyber forensic training \nprovided throughout the Department of Homeland Security by directing\n\n[[Page H8423]]\n\nthe NCFI to seek opportunities to coordinate with the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center (FLETC), including by helping to ensure \nthat such training reflects timely, actionable, and relevant expertise \nin homeland security information related to cyber and electronic crime \nand related threats.\n  Lastly, it directs the Secret Service to expand its network of \nElectronic Crime Task Forces through the addition of task force \nofficers, prosecutors, and judges educated and trained at the \nInstitute, in addition to academia and private sector stakeholders.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3490, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8423-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8423-H8426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OPEN BOOK ON EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. \nPierluisi) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on H.R. 3279 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H8424]]\n\n  I would like to begin by thanking Representative Doug Collins and \nConstitution Ranking Member Steve Cohen for introducing this important \ngovernment transparency legislation.\n  Every year, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, the Federal \nGovernment, through settlement or court order, pays millions of dollars \nin legal fees and costs to parties to lawsuits and administrative \nadjudications that involve the Federal Government. However, despite the \nlarge amount of taxpayer dollars paid out each year, the Federal \nGovernment no longer comprehensively keeps track of the amount of fees \nand other expenses awarded pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n  Nor does the government compile and report on why these fees and \nexpenses were paid and to whom these costs were awarded. This is \nbecause, in 1995, Congress repealed the Department of Justice's \nreporting requirements and defunded the Administrative Conference of \nthe United States, the agency charged with reporting this basic \ninformation to Congress.\n  The Administrative Conference was reestablished in 2010, but the \nrequirements to report on fee and cost payments have not been \nreenacted. Accordingly, there has been no official governmentwide \naccounting of this information since fiscal year 1994--over 20 years \nago.\n  This lack of transparency is troubling, given that the Equal Access \nto Justice Act is considered by many to be the most important Federal \nfee-shifting statute. Fundamentally, the act recognizes that there is \nan enormous disparity of resources between the Federal Government and \nindividuals and small businesses who seek to challenge Federal actions.\n  Congress enacted the Equal Access to Justice Act to provide \nindividuals, small businesses, and small nonprofit groups with \nfinancial incentives to challenge the Federal Government or defend \nthemselves from lawsuits brought by the Federal Government. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, the act was adopted with the ``specific \npurpose of eliminating for the average person the financial \ndisincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.''\n  But how can we know if the act is working well toward this end if we \nhave no data on the awards? Without the data this bill requires the \nAdministrative Conference to compile and report, we have nothing more \nthan anecdotal evidence as to whether the act is providing some measure \nof relief to the financial disincentive to seeking judicial and \nadministrative redress against the Federal Government.\n  The legislation we are considering today will end this lack of \ntransparency and restore the reporting requirements that were repealed \nin 1995.\n  I want to once again thank Representatives Collins and Cohen for \nintroducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3279, the Open Book on Equal Access to \nJustice Act, as amended. I support this measure for several reasons.\n  To begin with, it strengthens the Equal Access to Justice Act, an \nimportant law that has helped senior citizens, veterans, the disabled, \nand nonprofit organizations vindicate their rights against unreasonable \ngovernment action.\n  Under the so-called American rule, parties to adjudicative matters \ntypically pay their own litigation costs, subject to certain statutory \nexceptions. One of these exceptions is the Equal Access to Justice Act, \nwhich allows a party to be reimbursed for litigation costs when he or \nshe is victorious against the Federal Government under specified \nconditions.\n  For example, if the United States can show that its position was \n``substantially justified'' or that ``special circumstances'' would \nmake an award unjust, then the prevailing party is not entitled to be \nreimbursed for his litigation costs. In addition, only certain parties \nare eligible to be reimbursed for their litigation costs under the act, \nbased on their net worth or exempt status, among other factors.\n  Whether these restrictions still make sense is an open question, as \nCongress simply does not have adequate information to assess the \neffectiveness of the act. This is because there has been no \ncomprehensive Federal report on the total amount of fees awarded under \nthe act since 1995, and, as a result, there has simply been conjecture.\n  Fortunately, H.R. 3279 addresses this shortcoming by requiring annual \nreports on the amount of fees paid under the act to prevailing \nlitigants against the government. As a result of this legislation, \nCongress will know on an annual basis the agencies that have been \nrequired to reimburse parties for their litigation costs, the claims \ngiving rise to the litigation, and the amount of the awards made under \nthe act, as well as the basis for them. With this information, Congress \nwill be in a much better position to assess the implementation of the \nact and the performance of the agencies as litigants.\n  Another reason why I support this bill is that it respects the \nprivacy interests of the parties who are reimbursed for their \nlitigation costs pursuant to the act. Unfortunately, prior versions of \nthis legislation were unnecessarily intrusive. Organizations such as \nthe National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives \nand the Paralyzed Veterans of America expressed serious concerns that \nthese earlier versions of the bill would ``infringe the privacy of \nvulnerable people who have applied for social security and veterans' \nbenefits.''\n  These are real concerns, especially given the fact that the bill \nrequires the information collected be made available to the public \nthrough the Internet. As currently drafted, however, H.R. 3279 strikes \nthe right balance between encouraging transparency while respecting the \nlegitimate privacy interests of parties.\n  Finally, I support this bill because it recognizes the important role \nthat the Administrative Conference of the United States has \nhistorically played in helping Congress identify inefficiencies among \nthe Federal agencies and ways to save taxpayer dollars.\n  In addition to requiring the Conference to prepare an annual report \nto Congress detailing the litigation costs reimbursed by the Federal \nGovernment to parties, the bill also requires the Conference to provide \n``any other relevant information that may aid Congress in evaluating \nthe scope and impact of such awards.''\n  Given the excellent work and scholarly analysis that have been \nhallmarks of the Conference, I expect its report and its attendant \nfindings will be an invaluable aid to Congress.\n\n  As the Judiciary Committee is the authorizing committee for the \nConference, I encourage our friends on the Appropriations Committee to \nensure that the Conference has adequate funding to implement this \nimportant legislation.\n  In closing, I want to recognize my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for their diligence in helping to craft this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  The gentleman from Georgia, Doug Collins, and the gentleman from \nTennessee, Steve Cohen, as well as the gentlewoman from Wyoming, \nCynthia Lummis, have cooperatively worked to effectuate a commonsense \nbill that will improve the efficiency and accountability of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3279.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the chief sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for \nyielding and his work in bringing this to the floor, and I appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3279, the Open Book on \nEqual Access to Justice Act. I introduced this legislation with a \nbipartisan group of cosponsors to provide additional transparency and \noversight of taxpayer dollars awarded under the Equal Access to Justice \nAct.\n  I want to thank all of the original cosponsors of this legislation \nfor their support. In particular, my friend from Tennessee, Steve \nCohen, a member of the Judiciary Committee, but also a special thank \nyou also to Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming, who has been an advocate of \nthis legislation. I just want to thank her for her tireless work and \nleadership on this issue as we move forward.\n\n[[Page H8425]]\n\n  H.R. 3279 passed the Judiciary Committee on a voice vote on October \n27, 2015. Almost identical legislation passed both the Judiciary \nCommittee and the full House on a voice vote last Congress.\n  The bill reinstates needed transparency and accountability measures \nto ensure that the Equal Access to Justice Act is helping individuals, \nretirees, veterans, and small businesses as intended.\n  Congress originally passed the Equal Access to Justice Act in 1980 to \nremove a barrier to justice for those with limited access to the \nresources it takes to sue the Federal Government and to recover \nattorneys' fees and costs that go along with such suits. The law was \nwritten to provide citizens with the opportunity to challenge or defend \nagainst unreasonable government actions where they otherwise might be \ndeterred by large legal expenses.\n  To be eligible for payment under EAJA, an individual's net worth must \nbe less than $2 million and a business or organization must have a net \nworth of less than $7 million, although the cap does not apply to \ncertain tax-exempt organizations.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act was intended to address the David and \nGoliath scenario where wronged citizens have to go to court and face \nthe Federal Government's vast financial and legal resources. It is past \ntime that we ensure this law is working for citizens in need and for \ntaxpayers alike.\n  Payments of EAJA attorneys' fees come from the budget of the agency \nwhose action gave rise to the claim. While the original Equal Access to \nJustice Act legislation included a requirement to track payments and \nreport to Congress annually, Congress and the agencies halted tracking \nand reporting of payments made through the Equal Access to Justice Act \nin 1995.\n  A Government Accountability Office report indicated that without any \ndirection to track payments, most agencies simply do not do it, and \nCongress and taxpayers are unable to exercise oversight over these \nfunds. In fact, we only have anecdotal evidence about how much we are \nspending on attorneys' fees, the agencies paying out on these fees, and \nwhat types of claims are being covered.\n  This is simple, commonsense transparency.\n  Since 1995, there has been no comprehensive Federal report on the \ntotal amount of fees awarded under the Equal Access to Justice Act. We \nare sorely behind on our oversight responsibilities in this area, and \nH.R. 3279 takes steps to address that problem.\n  H.R. 3279 requires the Administrative Conference of the United States \nto annually report to Congress on the ``number, nature, and amount of \nthe awards, claims involved in the controversy, and any other relevant \ninformation that may aid the Congress in evaluating the scope and \nimpact of such awards.'' This report covers both agency adjudications \nand court proceedings.\n  H.R. 3279 also requires the Administrative Conference to develop and \nimplement an online searchable database to facilitate public and \ncongressional oversight. Agencies would be required to provide \ninformation requested by the ACUS for the development of the database \nand reports, but, importantly, the ACUS would be required to withhold \ninformation from the database if disclosure is prohibited by law or \ncourt order.\n  The Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act ensures that agencies \nare operating under a watchful public eye and that taxpayer dollars are \nbeing spent properly.\n  Our Federal Government is too big, and I believe it needs to be \ndownsized; but until we can make that happen, transparency should be a \nminimum requirement. That is why H.R. 3279 is important. It is common \nsense, plain and simple. Where the Federal Government is spending \nmoney, Congress needs to exercise oversight to ensure it is being done \nthe way the law requires.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  For most people who are facing a suit against the Federal Government, \nit is a once-in-a-lifetime challenge and a daunting suit to undertake \neven if they are completely in the right. We need to make sure the law \nis working for them. Allowing plaintiffs to recoup legal costs when \nthey sue the Federal Government for reparations they deserve is only \nfair.\n  Many Americans do not have the resources to take on our vast and \nsprawling bureaucracy, but the Equal Access to Justice Act gave them \nthe power to do so by removing a barrier to justice for those with \nlimited access to resources. However, since the original reporting \nrequirements were halted by Congress, information on these payments \nmade under the law is severely lacking.\n  Tracking and reporting payments will help preserve the integrity of \nthis law and will help Congress make sure that the law is working \neffectively for the people it was intended to help.\n  It is past time that we shine a light on this issue. We owe \ntransparency to the taxpayers who are financing the law, and we owe it \nto the citizens--the small businesses, the veterans, and the Social \nSecurity claimants--who rely on the law.\n  H.R. 3279 represents a bipartisan agreement that transparency over \npayments made under the Equal Access to Justice Act needs to be \nrestored. The Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act will help to \nensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent as intended under this \nlaw.\n  Past support for this legislation demonstrates a consensus that we \nneed to address this issue and that Americans deserve to know what \ntheir government is doing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3279.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3279, the \n``Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act,'' a bill to amend titles 5 \nand 28 of the United States Code to direct the Administrative \nConference of the United States (ACUS) to prepare an annual report to \nCongress on fees and other expenses awarded to prevailing parties under \nthe Equal Access to Justice Act.\n  As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, former municipal judge \nand staunch believer and advocate for equal justice, I support this \nbill because it will provide Congress with valuable insight and \ncomprehensive data needed to assess the actual effectiveness of the \nEqual Access to Justice Act (EAJA).\n  Specifically, H.R. 3279 will amend the EAJA and the federal judicial \ncode to require the Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the \nUnited States to report to Congress annually on the amount of fees and \nother expenses awarded to prevailing parties other than the United \nStates in certain administrative proceedings and civil action court \ncases (excluding tort cases) to which the United States is a party, \nincluding settlement agreements.\n  Pursuant to the EAJA, these litigation fees include the reasonable \nexpenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, \nanalysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found by the \nagency to be necessary for the preparation of the party's case, and \nreasonable attorney or agent fees.\n  If enacted, H.R. 3279 will require the ACUS to provide the number, \nnature, and amount of awards, the claims involved in the controversy, \nas well as any other relevant information that may assist Congress in \nassessing the scope and impact of such fees awarded.\n  H.R. 3279 further directs that such information be made available by \nestablishing an online searchable database including the name of the \nagency involved, the name of each party to whom the award was made, the \namount of the award, and the basis for finding that the position of the \nagency concerned was not substantially justified.\n  In collecting and providing this data, this bill addresses concerns \nabout the implementation of EAJA and whether Congress needs to \nintervene and amend it.\n  For more than three decades, however, the EAJA has served as an \nimportant vehicle to enhance parties' ability to hold government \nagencies accountable for their actions and inactions.\n  Simply speaking, the EAJA was designed to help the underdog or those \nwith limited resources stand up against government transgressions.\n  EAJA allows individuals, small businesses and nonprofits to recover \ncritical litigation costs and attorney fees from the federal government \nin cases that may otherwise be financially intimidating or restrictive.\n  The EAJA is used to vindicate a variety of federal rights, including \naccess to Veterans Affairs and Social Security disability benefits, as \nwell as to secure statutory environmental protections.\n  The EAJA is an important tool that promotes public involvement in \nlaws that have a significant impact on the public health and safety, \nsuch as the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Air Act and Clean \nWater Act.\n\n[[Page H8426]]\n\n  EAJA also helps deter government inaction or erroneous conduct and \nencourages all parties, not just those with resources to hire legal \ncounsel, to assert their rights.\n  Generally, it has been concluded by policy experts that EAJA has been \ncost-effective, applies only to meritorious litigation and that \nexisting legal safeguards and the independent discretion of federal \njudges will continue to ensure its prudent application.\n  Nonetheless, the good intentions that brought the EAJA into law have \nbeen overshadowed by re-occurring accounts of misuse by a small \npercentage of large environmental groups.\n  A 2011 GAO study (requested by House Republicans) of cases brought \nagainst EPA found: 1. most environment lawsuits (48%) were brought by \ntrade associations and private companies; 2. attorney fees were awarded \nonly about eight percent of the time; 3. among environmental \nplaintiffs, the majority of cases were brought by local groups rather \nthan national groups; and 4. the average award under the EAJA was only \nabout $100,000.\n  Thus, while claims of misuse and abuse are largely misplaced, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this request for further review and analysis, \nso that we may gain a better understanding and congressional clarity on \nthe functional benefits and necessary workings of the EAJA.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3279, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8426-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8426-H8427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IMPROVING CONGRESSIONAL CHARTER OF THE DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. \nPierluisi) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 1755, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Since 1920, Disabled American Veterans has been serving American \nveterans who were wounded in the line of duty. It provides free \nassistance to veterans and their families in obtaining Federal benefits \nand services earned through military service.\n  It represents the interests of disabled veterans, their families, \ntheir widowed spouses, and their orphans before the Federal, State, and \nlocal governments. And it provides a structure through which disabled \nveterans can express their compassion for their fellow veterans through \na variety of volunteer programs.\n  The organization received a Federal charter in 1932. DAV is seeking \nthe enactment of H.R. 1755, which will amend its charter to help \nclarify DAV's charitable mission, explain the educational component of \nits mission, and mandate the assignment of its assets to the Department \nof Veterans Affairs in the event of its dissolution. These changes will \naid DAV in its transition to a 501(c)(3) organization.\n  As the organization explains:\n\n       For decades, DAV has been exempt from Federal taxation \n     under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code . . . \n     Donations to most 501(c)(4) organizations are not deductible \n     for income or estate tax purposes. DAV is a rare exception, \n     as it qualifies to receive deductible contributions as a \n     ``war veterans'' organization.\n       Many donors, even sophisticated donors, believe incorrectly \n     that charitable deductions are available only for gifts made \n     to a 501(c)(3) organization, more commonly known as a \n     ``public charity.'' We believe that this misconception has \n     been limiting DAV's opportunities to gain corporate support \n     and major gifts, including bequests.\n       There is no doubt that DAV's activities of service to \n     wounded and disabled veterans would enable it to qualify as a \n     public charity, exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       To achieve that designation, the organization needs to make \n     application to the Internal Revenue Service. The application \n     requires that certain language be included in the \n     ``organizing document,'' which, in our case, is the Federal \n     charter.\n\n  We can help DAV carry out its vital mission through this legislation. \nI commend Representative Miller for introducing the bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1755, which makes a small but important \nchange to the Federal charter of the Disabled American Veterans. Once \nthis bill becomes law, that Federal charter will better describe the \nmission and actual practice of the organization today.\n  In response to the thousands of veterans who returned home after \nhaving made considerable sacrifices during World War I, the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans was established in 1920. Currently, the organization \nserves our disabled veterans by helping them access all of the benefits \navailable to them, by fighting for their interests in Washington, D.C., \nand by educating the public about the sacrifices they made.\n  This organization remains today every bit as important as it was at \nthe time of its founding 95 years ago. H.R. 1755 simply makes clear \nthat the mission of the Disabled American Veterans is exclusively a \ncharitable one.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1755, which amends the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans' charter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1755, a bill \nwhich modifies the congressional charter for the Disabled American \nVeterans (DAV) to expand the purposes of the organization to include \neducating the public about the sacrifices and needs of disabled \nveterans, as well as educating disabled veterans about the benefits and \nresources available to them.\n  If enacted into law, H.R. 1755 modifies the DAV charter to make \nexplicit that the organization is organized exclusively for charitable \nand educational purposes, a change that would allow the DAV to qualify \nas a ``public charity'' under the Internal Revenue Code.\n  The legislation also provides that upon dissolution or final \nliquidation of the Disabled American Veterans, any assets remaining \nwould be transferred to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the care \nof disabled veterans.\n  Since its founding in 1920, the Disabled American Veterans has been \ndedicated to a single purpose: empowering disabled veterans to lead \nhigh-quality lives with respect and dignity.\n\n[[Page H8427]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, under DAV's existing congressional charter, an \nindividual generally is eligible for membership in the organization if \nhe or she was wounded, gassed, injured or disabled in the line of duty \nduring time of war while serving in the U.S. military.\n  DAV works to ensure that veterans and their families can access the \nfull range of benefits available to them and advocates for the \ninterests of America's injured heroes and their families.\n  Most important, DAV educates the public about the great sacrifices \nand needs of veterans transitioning back to civilian life.\n  On the battlefield, the military pledges to leave no soldier behind.\n  As a nation, let it be our pledge that when they return home, we \nleave no veteran behind.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1755 because it is an important \naffirmation of our commitment to honor the service of disabled veterans \nwith actions that fulfill our commitment to them and their families, \nand which are worthy of a grateful nation.\n  This is also the reason that I co-sponsored the H.R. 333, the \nDisabled Veterans Tax Termination Act, which increases veteran's pay \nand disability compensation and maintains secure, dependable and \nreliable veterans' programs, especially for disabled veterans is very \nimportant.\n  And it is why I also strongly supported and voted to pass H.R. 3202, \nthe Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, which \nexpands access to health care for veterans, addresses the shortage of \nhealth professionals in the VA, ensures access to care for rural \nveterans, and provided funding to establish 27 new VA clinics, \nincluding a new research facility in Houston.\n  And it is why as Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on \nTransportation Security, I championed the Helping Heroes Fly Act (H.R. \n1344), which improves airport security screening for wounded and \nseverely disabled service members and veterans by ensuring personal \nprivacy and consistent application of efficient screening procedures so \nthat our selfless disabled veterans never again have to face lengthy, \ninvasive, and even humiliating screening procedures at our airports.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 1755.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1755, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8427-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8427-H8428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMOVAL OF USE RESTRICTION ON CERTAIN LAND TRANSFERRED TO ROCKINGHAM \n                            COUNTY, VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. LaMALFA.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2288 removes a use restriction from the deed of an approximately \n1-acre portion of land. The property was transferred to Rockingham \nCounty, Virginia, in 1989 to construct a child care facility.\n  H.R. 2288 would remove the restrictions on the land so that any \nnecessary upgrades may be made to the Plains Area Daycare Center in \nBroadway, Virginia, which provides child care for families who \notherwise could not afford it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2288 removes the use restriction on a 1-acre parcel of Federal \nland provided to Rockingham County, Virginia.\n  As was stated, in 1989, Congress authorized Rockingham County to use \na 3-acre parcel of Federal land for the purpose of establishing a child \ncare center under the condition that the land continues to be used for \nthis purpose. If the county no longer needs the land for a child care \ncenter, the land reverts back to ownership by the United States or the \ncounty has the option to purchase it at fair market value.\n  The Federal Government has a long tradition of providing public land \nto State, county, and local governments. The fair use of Federal land \nand a fair return to the American taxpayer has to be at the forefront \nof these transactions. Removing public-purpose requirements and use \nrestrictions should only be done when it is deemed appropriate and \nnecessary.\n  In this particular case, the sponsor of this legislation has worked \nwith the National Park Service to develop legislation that is both fair \nand transparent.\n  The land provided to Rockingham County includes a garage that was \npreviously used by the National Park Service that the county has \ndetermined could benefit the Plains Area Daycare Center. The Park \nService no longer needs the garage, and removing the use restriction on \n1 of the 3 acres will allow this child care provider to access \nfinancial assistance in order to upgrade and rehabilitate the garage so \nit is suitable for its needs.\n  This is a worthy goal. We support the adoption of H.R. 2288 and \ncongratulate the sponsor of the legislation for it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me \nthis time.\n  And I thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), for moving this legislation through \nthe Natural Resources Committee and to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the passage of H.R. 2288. This bill \nsimply removes 20-year-old deed use restrictions on 1 acre of land.\n  For over 25 years, a little over 3 acres of land and its associated \nbuildings, which were previously wholly held by the Federal Government, \nhave been maintained by Rockingham County and the Plains Area Daycare \nCenter in my congressional district, the Sixth District of Virginia.\n  In 1989, the Federal Government deeded these 3 acres of land, with \nrestriction, to Rockingham County. But even prior to this official \ndeclaration, Rockingham County had already been faithfully maintaining \nthe property, which the Federal Government no longer utilized. The \nproperty had previously been used as a garage and maintenance facility \nfor the United States Forest Service.\n  When the government transferred this land to Rockingham County in \n1989, the condition was that this property was to be used for public \npurposes. The county decided that the nonprofit Plains Area Daycare \nCenter in Broadway, Virginia, which provides child care on a sliding \nscale to many families who otherwise could not afford child care, would \nbenefit from the use of the old garage. Therefore, Congress enacted \nPublic Law 101-479, which allowed the deed to be changed from public \nuse to the particular use of the child care center.\n  Donations by the community, totaling $75,000, turned the garage \nbuilding into a nursery, a daycare, and an after-school care facility. \nAdditionally, the creation of the daycare center provided\n\n[[Page H8428]]\n\nfor the creation of a playground that the center supports and is open \nfor public use.\n  To be clear, the center and the playground are the sole reasons that \nthis previously abandoned government land is being used by the \ncommunity.\n  I have visited the Plains Area Daycare Center on many occasions and \nhave seen the immeasurable investments this center is making in the \ncommunity by providing high-quality child care. Since opening in 1991, \nthe center has always been at capacity and is the only facility of its \nkind in the community.\n  However, after two decades of consistent use, the facility is in \ndesperate need of repair. Unfortunately, because of the narrow way \nPublic Law 101-479 was drafted and because of the terms of the deed, \nthe daycare center has been unable to get a loan to complete the much-\nneeded renovations.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  To solve this issue, my legislation would remove the deed use \nrestrictions from the 1 acre of property on which the building resides. \nWhile I would like to have seen the entire 3 acres released, this \nlegislation is the result of a compromise that has been endorsed by the \nNational Park Service and Rockingham County.\n  By passing this legislation and allowing Rockingham County and, in \nreturn, the Plains Area Daycare Center more authority over the land, it \nwill ensure that more children and more of the community will be served \nby this land.\n  This bill is the result of hard work over the past two Congresses. \nThe House passed related legislation in the 113th Congress. However, \nthe Senate did not act. This Congress, my staff and I have worked \nclosely with Rockingham County and the Natural Resources Committee to \nsee H.R. 2288 brought before the House. I am hopeful that the Senate \nwill take action this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, while my legislation today is simply a formality, it is \nof great importance to those being served by this daycare center in the \ncommunity. For 25 years, the land has been deeded to Rockingham County, \nbut with overbearing restrictions.\n  Since it is clear the Federal Government no longer has a vested \ninterest in the land, it is time to lift those restrictions to allow \nthe Plains Area Daycare Center to reach its full potential.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE: Twenty years ago Congress made its intention clear \nthat a daycare facility was to have use of the property, and I am \npleased to lead the charge in fixing the law.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 2288 to simply remove the deed restrictions on \n1 acre of land so that the necessary upgrades may be made to the \nchildcare center and this community investment can continue to thrive.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In March of this year, I introduced this legislation, the \nPreservation Research at Institutions Serving Minorities, the PRISM \nAct, to ensure that over 400 Hispanic-serving institutions have access \nto a competitive grant program for historic preservation education and \nfor training programs. HSIs are colleges and universities where at \nleast 25 percent of the student enrollment is comprised of Hispanic \nstudents.\n  Current law provides, as was stated by the gentleman, preservation \neducation and training grants for HBCUs, tribal and Hawaiian Native \neducation institutions. My legislation would add HSIs to the list.\n  HSIs represent about 12 percent of all higher education institutions \nin the U.S. They educate over 3 million Hispanic students that are \nenrolled in those universities and colleges.\n  At the markup, the committee adopted an amendment offered by my good \nfriend, Congresswoman Bordallo of Guam. Ms. Bordallo's amendment adds \nuniversities and colleges that are designated as Asian American, Native \nAmerican Pacific Islanders-serving institutions to the list of \ninstitutions eligible for historic preservation education and training \nprograms. I commend the gentlewoman from Guam for bringing this issue \nup. Her amendment makes the bill more inclusive and better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 1541, the Preservation Research at Institutions Serving \nMinorities, or PRISM, Act. H.R. 1541 would make Hispanic serving \ninstitutions and\n\n[[Page H8429]]\n\nAsian American Native American Pacific Islander serving institutions of \nhigher education on par with other minority serving institutions and \nmake them eligible for important historic preservation education and \ntraining.\n  I would like to recognize my colleague, Mr. Grijalva, for his \nleadership in introducing H.R. 1541, and also working closely with me \non my amendment to also include Asian American Native American Pacific \nIslander-serving institutions.\n  Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have \ncontributed to our nation's rich history and unique cultural heritage. \nAAPI contributions to this nation's history are evident from New \nOrleans being a stop on the Spanish Galleon trade route, to the salmon \ncanneries in Alaska, to early Chamorro villages in the Mariana Islands, \nto pineapple fields in Hawaii, or to the tremendous efforts AAPIs made \nin constructing the railroads that crisscross our country. Making \nHispanic serving institutions and Asian American Native American and \nPacific Islander serving institutions eligible for preservation \ntraining and degree programs will further enrich and ensure our diverse \nhistory is shared for generations to come.\n  This bill has bipartisan support, and I commend my colleagues for \ntheir support.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2212, which would direct the Secretary of \nthe Interior to place into trust 300 acres of Bureau of Land Management \nland for the Susanville Indian Rancheria. These isolated and surplus \nBLM lands are adjacent to existing tribal lands in Lassen County, \nCalifornia.\n  Since 2005, the tribe has worked with the local California BLM office \nto one day complete the transfer of these lands, which are culturally \nand historically significant to the tribe.\n  Comprised of the descendants of four tribes within the region--the \nMountain Maidu, Northern Paiute, the Pit River, and the Washoe--the \nSusanville Indian Rancheria has a long history of relocation and \nadversity. The Rancheria's ancestors were party to 18 unratified \ntreaties with the Federal Government, and their lands were taken after \npassage of the Land Claims Act of 1851.\n  Displaced during the California gold rush of the 1850s, the tribe was \nhomeless until 1923, when the Federal Government purchased and placed \ninto trust 30 acres. Since that time, another 120 acres were added by \nCongress in 1978 and approximately 950 acres have been added by BIA \naction.\n  The Rancheria has long ties to this land, which holds a number of \ncultural, historical, and archeological sites, including grinding \nstones, petroglyphs, and other important artifacts. Rancheria members \nalso gather traditional herbs, medicines, and vegetables on the land \nand continue to hunt game in the area as their ancestors did.\n  The land has been classified as surplus by the BLM, which has written \nin support of transferring the parcel to the Rancheria, and it is \nadjacent, again, to the Rancheria's existing lands.\n  The Rancheria intends to continue using the land for traditional \npurposes as well as eventually constructing a cultural center, a \nmuseum, and recreational facilities, including sports fields.\n  At the request of the tribe, the bill includes a prohibition on \ngaming. The Rancheria has long proven to be a conscientious and \nthoughtful neighbor to the City of Susanville, and I have no doubt that \nit will prove to be a good steward of this land.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill was passed by the Natural Resources Committee \nwith unanimous support. The Senate counterpart, sponsored by Senator \nBoxer, who we found agreement on this legislation on, also received \nunanimous support in the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.\n  I urge your support and thank you for your consideration of this \nmeasure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 2212, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), \nour colleague, is indeed a good piece of legislation. Three hundred \nacres of BLM land in the Hidden Valley area of Lassen County, \nCalifornia, will be put into trust for the benefit of the Susanville \nIndian Rancheria.\n  The land in question is not only adjacent to Susanville's current \ntrust land, it is also part of their aboriginal territories. There are \nnumerous cultural and archeological sites on the land that the \nSusanville members seek to protect, including the remains of a historic \nNative American village.\n  In addition, the area is an important traditional hunting ground and \nis utilized for traditional ceremonies. The land has been identified by \nBLM as excess inventory and a cost burden to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a win-win for all parties involved. The \nSusanville Rancheria members will finally have a portion of its \nhistoric land returned, and the Federal Government will save money on \nadministrative costs on land that it does not want.\n  I want to congratulate the sponsor of the legislation. I urge its \nswift passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support of the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the committee's ranking member, and the \nunanimous effort to move this bill out of committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I seek support for my legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2212, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8429-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8429-H8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BILLY FRANK JR.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2270, introduced by my friend, Congressman Denny Heck of \nWashington, and cosponsored by the entire Washington delegation would \nredesignate the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge, located in the \nState of Washington, as the Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife \nRefuge and establish within the refuge the Medicine Creek Treaty \nNational Memorial.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  This bill is intended to honor the life and legacy of Billy Frank \nJr., who dedicated his life to bringing together tribes, government \nofficials, and others to improve treaty rights, tribal sovereignty, \nenvironmental stewardship, and salmon recovery in the Puget Sound area. \nFrank Jr., who passed away in 2014, was awarded the Albert Schweitzer \nPrize for Humanitarianism and the Martin Luther King Jr. Distinguished \nService Award and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.\n  The bill also establishes a national memorial within the refuge to \ncommemorate the signing of the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty, which \nestablished reservation land and the right to fish for Puget Sound area \ntribes.\n  Congressman Heck has worked tirelessly to honor the treaty and the \nlife and work of Billy Frank Jr. I strongly encourage my colleagues to \nvote ``yes'' on H.R. 2270.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2270 designates the national wildlife refuge on the Nisqually \nRiver Delta as the Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge. \nRenaming this refuge will honor Billy Frank Jr.'s legacy on the river \nwhere he spent his life. Billy Frank Jr., who passed away last year, \nhas been recognized for his work defending treaty rights, tribal \nsovereignty, and salmon recovery efforts in his home State of \nWashington.\n  Aside from the awards that were noted by my colleague that he has \nreceived, on November 24, President Obama presented his family with the \nMedal of Freedom honor that he so justly deserved.\n  The bill also creates a national memorial to commemorate the signing \nof the Medicine Creek Treaty in 1854.\n  I want to congratulate and thank my colleague from Washington, \nRepresentative Heck, for his tireless work and advocacy on behalf of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I again commend the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Heck), my friend, for his quality legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), the sponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, just last week we were home \ncelebrating Thanksgiving, and we were giving thanks for everything we \nare blessed with, everything we cherish--frankly, probably a lot of the \nthings we take for granted.\n  For those of us in the Pacific Northwest, we give thanks for the \nPuget Sound, we give thanks for our salmon, we give thanks for all the \nnatural beauty that surrounds us, and we give thanks that Billy Frank \nJr. was in our lives.\n  As was indicated earlier, in addition to the many other awards he \nreceived in his lifetime, just last week the President conferred upon \nBilly Frank Jr., posthumously, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is \nliterally no exaggeration to suggest that what Martin Luther King meant \nto civil rights and Nelson Mandela meant to South Africa, Billy Frank \nJr. meant to the entire Pacific Northwest, indeed, to indigenous people \nthroughout the globe.\n  He is a fitting person for the prestigious honor that we hope to \nbestow on him today. We have an opportunity to do something today--and \nI recommend we seize it--to preserve his legacy in the place he called \nhome.\n  Billy Frank Jr. was, indeed, the foremost advocate for restoration of \nNative American fishing treaty rights in the Pacific Northwest. He \ncherished clean water and healthy salmon runs. He was a key voice in \nthe recovery of the Puget Sound.\n  He also, as has not been mentioned, proudly served our Nation in the \nUnited States Marine Corps. He was an MP, I believe, during the Korean \nwar.\n  He got along with everyone. He was open and inclusive. His energy \nwas, literally, infectious.\n  We were deeply stunned in May of 2014 that he passed away even \nthough, at the age of 83, we thought Billy would live forever. He is \ngone, but his spirit is not and his story is not. His courage and \nbelief in us is here because, you see, Billy wandered the Halls of \nCongress frequently and testified numerous times. He respected this \ninstitution, and he was a powerful voice within our Chambers.\n  His story is in the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in the 10th \nCongressional District, which I have the privilege to represent, which \nwe now protect to give our wildlife a clean and sustainable home.\n  Billy grew up at a place called Frank's Landing, which is literally \njust a hop, skip, and a jump from the refuge. He fished in the \nNisqually River, in and next to the area where the refuge is now. That \nis the location where he was arrested more than 50 times for advocating \nfor his treaty fishing rights.\n  This bill will rename that refuge after Billy Frank Jr. Also, as has \nbeen indicated, it calls for the establishment of a national memorial \nat the exact place of the signing of the Medicine Creek Treaty in 1854. \nThat was the first treaty in the State of Washington between Indian \npeople and the newly established territorial government. In this case, \nit was between the people of the Nisqually, the Puyallup, Squaxin \nIsland, and the Muckleshoots.\n  Throughout his storied career, people often asked Billy: How is it \nyou do this, get up every day and so effectively advocate on behalf of \nclean water and good fish runs? How do you do that decade after decade?\n  He would always tell them the same thing: Tell your story.\n  So when people go to the Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife \nRefuge, they will be able to see why he held fish-ins. They will see \nwhy he risked\n\n[[Page H8431]]\n\narrest. They will see why he ultimately worked with others to help \nprotect his home. Like many young people today, he fought for what he \nbelieved in, but later worked with lawmakers to build consensus. He \nstarted out as a civil rights protestor, civilly disobedient and an \nadvocate. He ended up being one of the great uniters in the history of \nthe Nation and certainly the Pacific Northwest.\n  I hope that when people drive by the sign that directs them to the \nrefuge, maybe they will feel a little of that Billy magic, too. Maybe \nthey will wonder: Well, who was this Billy Frank Jr.? What did he do? \nFor those of us who knew him, it will be a frequent reminder of this \nhero.\n  They say you die twice: the first time, and the second time when they \nstop speaking about you. It is our goal that they never stop speaking \nabout Billy Frank Jr. and the lessons he taught us all. The refuge will \nbe a constant reminder.\n  I knew Billy for almost 40 years. I loved him like a beloved uncle. \nIn fact, I called him Uncle Billy. But I was absolutely not special in \nthat regard. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people did the same thing. \nIndeed, at his memorial service, the official estimate of the number in \nattendance was 10,000. That is how beloved this man was.\n  I would like to thank the members of the House Committee on Natural \nResources who unanimously approved this bill and all the members of the \nHouse delegation from Washington State. I would also like to especially \nrecognize Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and the hardworking \ncommittee staff, both for the majority and the minority, for their help \non this legislation.\n\n  In conclusion, Billy once famously said: ``I don't believe in magic. \nI believe in the sun and the stars, the water, the tides, the floods, \nthe owls, the hawks flying, the river running, the wind talking. \nThey're measurements. They tell us how healthy things are. How healthy \nwe are. Because we and they are the same.''\n  Let's remind visitors that we and they are the same at the Billy \nFrank Jr. Nisqually Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, again, Mr. Heck is to be commended for \nbringing forward such a worthy piece of legislation to honor a man who \nhas done so much in that area. Indeed, this legislation will make sure \nthat his story continues to be told and that he will always be \ncommemorated and memorialized in that region because of that. \nCongratulations to you on this.\n  I am proud to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in standing up today \nfor a true American hero, Billy Frank Jr.\n  For Billy, protecting our natural world and everything that depends \non it wasn't a political issue; rather, it was an innate calling. Folks \nresponded to that.\n  They followed his fearless protests by standing up for civil rights. \nThey followed his example by becoming fishermen themselves in places \nlike South Puget Sound. They followed his lead in championing clean \nwater and fish runs and protecting Puget Sound. They listened to his \nideas about keeping communities vibrant by building tribal youth \ncenters.\n  In the marble Halls of Congress, he convinced so many that tribal \ntreaty rights could not be held back and that we can't keep damaging \nour environment, that we have got to stand up for extraordinary bodies \nof water like Puget Sound. He left tracks all across our State and our \nNation, and his advocacy will live on.\n  To help honor this legacy, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this \nbill sponsored by Congressman Heck that I was proud to cosponsor, \nrenaming the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge the Billy Frank Jr. \nNational Wildlife Refuge. It is the right thing to do to honor all the \nwork that Billy did for all of us. It should serve as a reminder that \nwe need to keep fighting for all of those things he fought for.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, before I yield back the balance of my \ntime, let me thank the chair of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands, Mr. \nMcClintock, and Ranking Member Tsongas for their work and the staff's \nwork on this.\n  Again, to Mr. Heck and the delegation from Washington, this is a \ngreat piece of legislation. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2270, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

DOC. NO. 114-81)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and referred to \nthe Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and ordered to be \nprinted:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States: \n  I am transmitting an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian \nFederal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay \nsystems in January 2016.\n  Title 5, United States Code, authorizes me to implement alternative \npay plans for pay increases for civilian Federal employees covered by \nthe General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of \n``national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the \ngeneral welfare,'' I view the adjustments that would otherwise take \neffect as inappropriate.\n  Civilian Federal employees have already made significant sacrifices \nas a result of 3-year pay freeze that ended in January 2014. In January \n2014 and again in January 2015, increases for civilian Federal \nemployees were limited to a 1.0 percent overall pay increase, an amount \nlower than the private sector pay increases and statutory formula for \nadjustments to the base General Schedule for 2014 and 2015. However, as \nthe country's economic recovery continues, we must maintain efforts to \nkeep our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course. This is an effort that \ncontinues to require tough choices.\n  Under current law, locality pay increases averaging 28.74 percent and \ncosting $26 billion would go into effect in January 2016. Federal \nagency budgets cannot sustain such increases. Accordingly, I have \ndetermined that under the authority of section 5304a of title 5, United \nStates Code, locality-based comparability payments for the locality pay \nareas established by the President's Pay Agent, in the amounts set \nforth in the attached table, shall become effective on the first day of \nthe first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016. \nThese rates are based on an allocation of 0.3 percent of payroll as \nindicated in my August 28, 2015, alternative pay plan for adjustments \nto the base General Schedule. These decisions will not materially \naffect our ability to attract and retain a well-qualified Federal \nworkforce.\n  The adjustments described above shall take effect on the first \napplicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, November 30, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8431-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 1170, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp \nReauthorization Act of 2015. It is sponsored primarily by Senator \nDianne Feinstein of California.\n  S. 1170 extends a requirement for the United States Postal Service to \nproduce and sell a specific semipostal stamp with the proceeds going to \nfund breast cancer research.\n  Importantly, all of the funds collected must be used for breast \ncancer research, and S. 1170 includes explicit language to ensure that \nthis is the case. Since the stamp was launched in 1998, it has raised \nnearly $82 million for breast cancer research.\n  This money is sent to two research programs. The bulk of the money, \n70 percent, goes to the National Institutes of Health, and the \nremaining 30 percent goes to the medical research program at the \nDepartment of Defense. We hold both of these organizations accountable \nand should continue vigorous oversight of them.\n  Both the NIH and Department of Defense select specific programs and \nproposals to receive funding and report on these programs each year. \nThe funds raised by this stamp have helped make meaningful advances in \nthe fight against breast cancer.\n  I urge Members to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of S. 1170, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp \nReauthorization Act of 2015. I thank Senator Feinstein of California \nfor her leadership on the legislation and her commitment to funding \nbreast cancer research. This is a very important bipartisan issue, and \n25 Senators have joined Senator Feinstein in sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, Representative Speier, also from \nCalifornia, for introducing the House companion bill, which has 59 \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank Chairman Chaffetz for bringing this bill to the floor and for \nhis support of this crucial legislation.\n  S. 1170 would extend the authority of the United States Postal \nService to issue the popular semipostal stamp that raises funds for \nbreast cancer research. Currently, Postal Service customers can choose \nto buy a 60-cent breast cancer research stamp. The extra 11 cents above \nthe price of the regular first-class stamp minus the Postal Service's \nadministrative costs go to lifesaving research.\n  Since its first issuance in 1998, the Postal Service has sold almost \n1 billion breast cancer research stamps, generating nearly $82 million \nthat has gone directly to the National Institutes of Health and the \nDepartment of Defense to fund vital research.\n  In a 2014 report to Congress, the National Cancer Institute of the \nNIH has concluded: Having this additional funding has furthered the \ncancer research community's efforts to exploit increasing knowledge of \ngenetics and molecular biology to develop more effective and less toxic \ntreatments for breast cancer.\n  Research funding from this semipostal stamp is critical in the fight \nagainst breast cancer, as one in eight women in the United States will \ndevelop invasive breast cancer during her lifetime, according to the \nAmerican Cancer Society.\n  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women \nafter lung cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that, in 2015, \nabout 40,000 women will die from this disease.\n  If we do not pass the measure before us today, the authorization for \nthe Postal Service to sell the breast cancer research stamp will expire \nby the end of the year.\n  I, therefore, will urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport S. 1170.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California, Ms. Speier.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining in this \neffort tonight. I would like to thank my colleague and coauthor of the \nHouse version of this bill, H.R. 2191, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, for \nher support and leadership on this issue. I want to also thank Senator \nDianne Feinstein and Senator Enzi. Senator Feinstein has supported this \nlegislation. She was actually the original author of the legislation \nback in 1997.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Breast cancer, there is probably not one person in this room who \nhasn't been touched by breast cancer either themselves, through a \nfamily member, or through a friend.\n  Our courageous colleagues, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, \nCongresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and spouses \nof many Members have all been impacted. My mother survived breast \ncancer. One of my best friends did not. My health legislative assistant \nwho worked on this legislation lost her mother to breast cancer. She \nwas only 13 years of age when her mother died.\n  This is an important bill. What is most important about it is the \nfact that we have made some progress. But still, one in eight women \nwill develop breast cancer in her lifetime. It is still the second \nleading cause of death for women in this country.\n  What is really important about this legislation is the genesis of \nthis legislation. It is an all-American story. It reminds me of the \nquote by Margaret Mead:\n  ``Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens \ncan change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.''\n  In this case, there is the story of an immigrant who came to this \ncountry, got educated here, and became a doctor at 26. He became a \nbreast cancer surgeon in Sacramento, California. His name is Dr. Ernie \nBodai. He was concerned and frustrated by the slow pace of breast \ncancer research and all the surgeries he found himself doing over and \nover again.\n  So what did this breast cancer surgeon do? He came to Congress. He \nmade 15 trips to Congress. He spent over $100,000 of his personal money \nto convince Congress to pass a bill authorizing a breast cancer stamp. \nIn so doing, he was able to generate over, as we have heard already \ntonight, $80 million. In fact, we are coming close to having sold \nalmost a million stamps in this country for breast cancer research.\n  One man had a vision. He came to Congress. It took him over 2 years \nto convince us to do it, but we did it. It is time now to reauthorize \nthe legislation, and I am hopeful that we will do it, because it has in \nfact shown to be very effective. In fact, it has been used in finding \ngenes that are protective against breast cancer, linking treatment \noutcomes with certain genes, and identifying women with a low risk of \nrecurrence who can be spared chemotherapy.\n  So, my colleagues, this is an important bill to reauthorize. The \ndeadline is, as we have been told, fast approaching. Let's continue the \nsearch for a cure. Let's be part of that search by buying breast cancer \nstamps and by reauthorizing the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n\n[[Page H8435]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank the gentleman from Utah, and I want to thank him \nfor bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank the majority \nleader, Kevin McCarthy, for bringing this bill to the floor tonight so \nwe can see this authorization through before the end of this calendar \nyear.\n  I am proud to join my friend, Jackie Speier, my colleague from \nCalifornia, and other House colleagues, as well as Senator Dianne \nFeinstein and my Senator and dear friend, Mike Enzi from Wyoming, in \npassing this reauthorization bill.\n  The stamp says, ``Fund the Fight. Find a Cure.'' That is why we are \nhere tonight. This is a budget-neutral way to fund critical research to \ntreat and, hopefully, one day cure this disease.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of the Breast Cancer \nResearch Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2015. To have over $80 million \nraised since 1998 from this stamp for breast cancer research and have \nit be budget-neutral is a wonderful way to acknowledge the importance \nof what we can do as private citizens once the government authorizes \nand empowers us to fund research through something we would buy every \nday anyway, and that is stamps.\n  So, once again, it is so important that we continue to support this \nfunding of medical research and doing it in a fiscally responsible way \nthat could save hundreds of lives. Who knows; maybe that one little \nbook of stamps that you buy that helps fund breast cancer research will \nbe the one that finds the cure.\n  Fund the fight. Find a cure.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague, Jackie Speier; the \ncommittee chairman, Jason Chaffetz; the majority leader, Kevin \nMcCarthy; and everyone who has cosponsored this bill, worked on this \nbill, brought it through the Senate, and brings it to the attention of \nthe House of Representatives tonight.\n  We can fund the fight. We can find a cure. And tonight, this is the \nbest way to move forward with that goal in mind.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank all those involved because, as was noted earlier, \nevery life in this building and across this country and across the \nworld has been touched by breast cancer. I lost my mom to breast \ncancer. I lost my dad to cancer as well--colon cancer.\n  This is a program that seems to work. It has been in place since \nbefore the year 2000. The numbers are quite startling. Instead of \npaying 49 cents for a stamp, you pay 60 cents. And that money, \naccumulated over time, has generated tens of millions of dollars. It is \nsomething that is worthwhile.\n  I appreciate Mr. McCarthy and his passion for this issue. I \nappreciate Mrs. Lummis and her desire to tackle this. I also appreciate \nwhat Ms. Speier and Mrs. Watson Coleman have added to this discussion \nand their passion on tackling this issue. It truly transcends \neverything we do. It touches every life, and it is something we must \nwin and we must overcome. This happens to be one of those government \nprograms that actually works.\n  And so we are suggesting to our colleagues that we vote ``aye'' and \nsupport this and allow it to continue. It is one of the good things we \ndo.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support \nof S. 1170, the ``Breast Cancer Research Stamp Reauthorization Act of \n2015.''\n  I would like to recognize Senator Feinstein for her commendable \nleadership in fighting for greater awareness of breast cancer and \nfinding cures and treatment through breast cancer research.\n  This is a simple yet incredibly power piece of legislation.\n  S. 1170 will reauthorize through December 31, 2019, the Breast Cancer \nResearch Stamp, which will require the U.S. Postal Service to issue a \nspecial postage stamp for first-class mail that costs more than the \nregular first-class stamp in order to raise funds for breast cancer \nresearch.\n  Importantly, agencies receiving these funds from the Postal Service \nmust use them on breast cancer research.\n  Breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in \nthis country.\n  This is an astonishing statistic that cannot be overstated--it must \nbe stopped.\n  Breast cancer is also the most commonly diagnosed cancer among \nAfrican American women.\n  As an African American woman and I am a breast cancer survivor and I \nknow these statistics all too well.\n  As a Member of Congress, a mother, grandmother, sister and wife, it \nis my responsibility and duty to fight to insure that every American \ncan win in the fight against cancer.\n  I understand first-hand how important proper and adequate funding is \nto defeat breast cancer.\n  As a proud cancer survivor, I am also proud to have secured adoption \nof an amendment to the FY 2014 Defense Appropriation Act that increased \nfunding for breast cancer research by $10 million.\n  We must continue to raise funds for research in order to ensure that \nthe women of our nation no longer have to suffer.\n  This bill will ensure that additional funds will be used towards \nlife-saving research to protect all of our grandmothers, mothers, \ndaughters, sisters, aunts and love ones.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, S. 1170.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8435-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 2646\n\n  Mr. YODER.

Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to highlight November as \nEpilepsy Awareness Month.\n  Tragically, across the country today, thousands of families dealing \nwith epilepsy and other debilitating seizure disorders have been forced \nto uproot their families as they travel to States where CBD oil already \nis legalized.\n  Especially in children, Mr. Speaker, CBD oil helps reduce the amount \nand duration of seizures; but over and over again, the government has \nstood in the way of access to lifesaving care for these children.\n  Children across the country like Sophie Weiss deserve better. Sophie \nis\n\n[[Page H8436]]\n\nan inspiring young woman in my district. She suffers from a severe form \nof epilepsy. Without CBD oil, she suffers upwards of 200 seizures each \nand every day.\n  For Sophie and children suffering like her, I helped introduce a bill \nto stop the government from standing in the way of this lifesaving \nrelief. In honor of Epilepsy Awareness Month, I call on my colleagues \nto join me so that we can pass the Charlotte's Web Medical Hemp Act of \n2015 and ensure no other family has to endure the loss of a child as \nthey wait for the approval of this natural, lifesaving option.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8436-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

But it is my \nduty in serving my constituents in Congress to share some of the views \nthat they called me about.\n  One resident who previously taught Syrian refugees said, ``Support of \nthis bill and the accompanying shameful public comments about refugees \nmake us less safe and respond from fear, not strength.''\n  Messages in support of refugees continue to pour in, stating loud and \nclear that America cannot turn its back on refugees. I want to thank \nthe constituents that I serve for their continued feedback.\n  Tomorrow, I will be addressing the House once more about this subject \nat length. I don't want to remain silent about this issue because the \ndistrict that I serve has made it very clear that they care very deeply \nabout it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8436-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IMPORTANCE OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as co-chairman of the \nbipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus, I rise today to \nemphasize the importance of quality CTE programs, which allow students \nto succeed in areas that keep our Nation competitive in the global \neconomy.\n  Last week, I visited a lab at Penn State University, where three-\ndimensional printers were used to create parts for a wide variety of \nindustries, including those which support our national defense. These \nstudents are also among those leading the way in creating metal parts \nwhich once could only be fabricated at powdered metal plants.\n  I was also proud to see very similar programs being offered at the \nhigh school level. I spoke to the superintendent of the St. Marys \nSchool District in Elk County and was pleased to learn that students at \nSt. Marys High School are graduating with many of the skills needed to \nsucceed in these growing vocational and technical fields.\n  I am hopeful that with the next reauthorization of the Carl D. \nPerkins Career and Technical Education Act we can enhance the \npartnerships that bridge the gap between our high schools, technical \nschools, colleges, universities, and employers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8436-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n         HONORING VILLAGE OF PINECREST POLICE OFFICER VERNA GAY\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Throughout his career, Don found \nseveral ways to continue to serve our Nation and fellow veterans.\n  He was commander of Post 370 and Second District commander of the \nAmerican Legion, trustee of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 846, and \nwas serving as local chapter commander of the American Ex-Prisoners of \nWar when he unfortunately passed away.\n  Don also served on my Veterans Advisory Committee for more than 5 \nyears, providing great insight to issues involving our Armed Forces, \nveterans, and their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, without Don's service and sacrifice, along with all the \nmen and women of the Greatest Generation, our Nation would not be as \nresilient and flourishing as it is today, and we remain ever thankful \nfor their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8436-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EMBRACE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, medical technology makes a huge difference \nfor millions of Americans by giving them access to life-improving and \nlifesaving technologies, devices, and treatments. With new \ndevelopments, we should be encouraging the use of these innovations to \nachieve better outcomes and lower long-term health costs.\n  However, the agency that oversees Medicare has continuously made \ndecisions that threaten the use of this technology. As Yogi Berra once \nsaid, ``It's deja vu all over again.''\n  First, the agency proposed rules that would limit access to critical \nspeech-generating devices. Then, it was patients that use lower limb \nprosthetics that could see reduced access.\n  Recently, we have seen proposed rules now that would limit access to \npneumatic compression pumps for those managing a condition called \nlymphedema and those using individually configured Complex Rehab.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has been forced to take action in some of these \ninstances, like when we passed the Steve Gleason Act earlier this year. \nBut the series of proposed rules are now alarming, in that they will \nraise long-term health costs and result in worse outcomes.\n  We need to look at a new path forward when it comes to embracing and \nprotecting access to medical technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8436-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8436-H8444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers be given 5 days in which to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Illinois?\n\n[[Page H8437]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, tonight is a night of action and \nreflection for this Congress. This evening, the Congressional Black \nCaucus will take a look at a number of significant events that have \noccurred this year and discuss the urgent and pressing concerns of \ntoday.\n  In the waning weeks of 2015, we will have this moment of reflection \nin order to examine the issues that have caused our community the \ngreatest concern. This conversation must be had, so we have to have an \nhonest and impactful dialogue that will help Congress engage \ncommunities and act so we can create a better future today.\n  It is said that the blood brother of apathy is the inability to \nprioritize that which is important. Congress cannot afford to be \napathetic any longer. We must get serious about the issues that \nthreaten the true potential of our Nation--issues like gun violence \nthat imperil our safety and security, issues like joblessness and wage \ndiscrimination that are barriers to our collective economic prosperity, \nissues like restrictive voting laws that are fundamentally contrary to \nthe democratic right of American citizens and concerns with bad-apple \ncommunity police.\n  The Congressional Black Caucus has come to this very floor numerous \ntimes to address many of these issues, and, sadly, this body has yet to \nact on many of these concerns.\n  Last week, in my home district, Chicago was rocked by a disturbing \nvideo that was released showing the police shooting of 17-year old \nLaquan McDonald. He had been shot 16 times by his arresting officer. \nMost of the shots were fired when McDonald was no longer standing. Some \nentered through his back.\n  I cannot begin to fully express the depth of my outrage at this \nsenseless killing. The video is nothing short of horrific. Tonight, I \nwant to express my condolences to the McDonald family, for whom the \npain of losing their loved one has undoubtedly been compounded by \nhaving his death on public display.\n  There is a role that Representatives in Congress can play in putting \nthe issues of violence in our communities in the forefront. We have \nchosen not to.\n  As horrifying as the video of Laquan's death is, it needed to be made \npublic because the lingering questions surrounding this case and cases \nlike the death of Walter Scott are equally disturbing.\n  In reflecting on this tragedy, I want to take a moment to give my \nthanks to the many activists in Chicago who expressed their outrage in \na civil and productive way and, particularly, the young activists.\n  I remain encouraged by those who have been at the forefront of the \ncall for justice for Laquan and their positive and productive movement \nfor change. It is an example I hope all Americans will follow in \nhelping to create a fairer, more equitable system of justice for us \nall.\n  So, in that vein, tonight we will have a conversation about how, in \nthe midst of these tragedies and national adversity, the Congressional \nBlack Caucus is working and achieving positive and productive moments \nof change.\n  In this hour, you will hear from my colleagues about efforts the CBC \nhas led to usher in criminal justice reform, about the work of the CBC \nin increasing diversity in the tech sector through our TECH 2020 \ninitiative, about the CBC Health Braintrust work and addressing the \nissue of health disparities through the release of the 2015 Kelly \nReport, about how we are raising awareness and working to bring back \nkidnapped victims of Boko Haram in Nigeria, and about how the CBC has \nbeen a critical broker in numerous legislative efforts before this \nCongress.\n  There is much to discuss this evening because there is much worth \nreflecting on and celebrating.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is Mr. Payne and my last Special Order hour for the \nyear. I must say that, while this time has flown by, it has been an \nhonor and a privilege to represent this distinguished caucus.\n  So I yield to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Donald \nPayne, Jr., my very distinguished partner in crime for this past few \nmonths, or year, actually.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my dear friend and \ncolleague, Congresswoman Kelly, for anchoring this final Congressional \nBlack Caucus Special Order hour. In fact, I would like to thank \nCongresswoman Kelly for coanchoring all the Special Order hours with me \nthroughout 2015. It has been my real honor and pleasure to spend all \nthese Mondays with you bringing forth issues that matter in our \ncommunity.\n  I would also like to thank the CBC chair, Congressman G.K. \nButterfield, for his outstanding leadership this past year.\n  I appreciate you choosing me to coanchor these congressional Special \nOrder hours with Congresswoman Kelly. It is a great honor, and we are a \nbody of 40-plus, so to have that honor to be chosen means a great deal \nto me. And I am certain that 2016's coanchors will proudly serve, as we \nhave.\n  As Congresswoman Kelly mentioned, we are here to reflect on all the \nwork that the Congressional Black Caucus has done throughout the year, \nto look at the accomplishments.\n  In February, we kicked off the CBC Special Order hour by reflecting \non the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma, where we are today, and \nwhere we are headed for tomorrow. Through this hour, we were able to \nset the tone for the Congressional Black Caucus agenda with our leader, \nG.K. Butterfield, at the helm.\n  We remembered all the strides that were made by African Americans to \nthe place that we are today. We reflected on the work that is being \ndone right now through the caucus in the House of Representatives.\n  And, most importantly, during that hour, we looked towards the \nfuture. We intend to put forward the most effort in order to make sure \nthat African Americans are well-represented and afforded equally in all \nphases of these United States.\n  Monday after Monday, we have addressed the many challenges and \ninequalities that face African American communities. We have \ncontributed to this country with blood, sweat, and tears, hard work and \nentrepreneurial ideas and inclusiveness. We aren't owed anything. We \nare a significant thread in the cloth that makes this United States \ngrow.\n  We have talked about criminal justice reform, economics, \nunemployment, underemployment, incarceration, voting rights, felon \ndisenfranchisement, and health disparities, and those are just a few of \nthe issues that we have tackled this year.\n  As we have been known to be called the ``conscience of the \nCongress,'' we continue to put forth issues that are relevant and \nprevalent in today's society. I have just been honored to be part of \nthe spokes-team to bring awareness and raise these issues on a week-to-\nweek basis.\n\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Payne. Thank you for \nthose kinds words. It has truly been an honor serving with you.\n  I yield to the esteemed chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, the \ngentleman from North Carolina, Congressman G.K. Butterfield.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Thank you, Ms. Kelly.\n  Let me begin this evening by first thanking Congressman Donald Payne, \nJr., from the Tenth District of New Jersey for his friendship and for \nhis tireless work on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and on \nbehalf of the people that he represents back home in the great State of \nNew Jersey.\n  Thank you, Mr. Payne, for your work, and thank you for the kind words \nthat you had to say about me this evening.\n  And to my other colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly from the Second \nDistrict of Illinois, not only do you manage the floor on Monday \nnights, Ms. Kelly, on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, but you \nalso are the chair of our CBC Health Braintrust that does so much for \nso many.\n  You also have carved out a niche. You have begun to focus the \nattention of the Nation on the issue of gun violence in our country.\n  So I want to begin this presentation this evening by thanking both of \nyou for your work.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues here this evening, especially the \nnewer ones to this body, may not fully understand what the CBC is. The \nCongressional Black Caucus is an organization.\n\n[[Page H8438]]\n\nIt is a caucus of African American Members of Congress.\n  We were founded in 1971. But, Mr. Speaker, that does not mean that \n1971 was the first year that this body had African American Members of \nCongress. Actually, the first African American was elected to Congress \nin 1870.\n  There were some 21 African Americans who served in this body during \nReconstruction and post-Reconstruction. The CBC formally organized, Mr. \nSpeaker, in 1971 with 13 Members. Over the years, those 13 members have \nnow grown into 46 members.\n  I might say that two of the founding members of the CBC continue to \nbelong to this body. They are Congressman John Conyers from Michigan, \nwho is actually the dean of the House, as well as Congressman Charles \nRangel from the State of New York. They were two of our founding \nmembers.\n  The CBC, as I said, now consists of 46 members. Of the 46 members, \none is from the other body, from the United States Senate, and 45 serve \nhere in the House of Representatives.\n  I might say that one of our 45 members is a Republican Member of this \nbody, our dear friend from Utah (Mrs. Love). And so it is absolutely \ncorrect for us to say that we are bicameral and we are bipartisan.\n  Collectively, we represent 23 States in addition to the District of \nColumbia and the Virgin Islands. Collectively, Mr. Speaker, we \nrepresent more than 30 million people.\n  I might say, of the 21 standing committees that we have here in this \nHouse, 7 of those 21 committees have a CBC member as the top Democrat \non the committee. We call that the ranking member. The gentleman who \nwill speak in just a moment, Mr. Scott of Virginia, is one of those \nranking members on the Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, this past year has been very demanding on CBC members. \nWe have been busy. We have consistently fought back every day and every \nweek against Republican attempts to balance the budget on the backs of \nhardworking Americans--not just African Americans, but hardworking \nAmericans, Black, White, and Brown.\n  The struggle continues. We, as the CBC, have been focused on many \ndifferent things. I will mention just a few. In the interest of time, \nwe have been focusing on criminal justice reform because that is so \nimportant to the African American community.\n  We have been protecting--or trying to protect--the social safety net \nthat many of our vulnerable communities depend on. We have been trying \nto enhance educational opportunities for African American students and \nstrengthening and preserving HBCUs, that is, Historically Black \nColleges and Universities.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have spent considerable energy this year trying to \nhave full enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. As many of my \ncolleagues may know, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in a decision some \nyears ago, 4 years ago--actually, in 2013 it was--that the Voting \nRights Act, at least a part of it--that part that deals with \npreclearance of voting changes--that that section could not be enforced \nuntil this Congress redefined the formula for determining which States \nor which counties should be subject to that part of the Voting Rights \nAct, and this Congress has not acted.\n  This Congress continues to not fully enforce the Voting Rights Act. \nWe have exposed that and we continue to fight. We are talking about \ndiversity in corporate America, and we are going to hear more about \nthat in the years to come.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we have talked about investments in underserved \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have attempted to carry out these priorities. This \nyear the CBC launched the CBC TECH 2020. This initiative brings \ntogether the best minds in technology in nonprofit education in the \npublic sector to increase African American inclusion at all levels of \nthe technology industry.\n  In addition to outlining best practices for diversity principles, CBC \nTECH 2020 has empowered our members to provide resources for African \nAmerican students and entrepreneurs through the introduction of \nlegislation focused on increasing STEM education.\n  I would hope that every American would embrace that concept, the \nconcept of STEM education--science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics--and workforce development, cybersecurity, and copyright \nand patent reform.\n  In August, we traveled to Silicon Valley, talked to the technology \ngiants like Apple, Google, Bloomberg, and Intel about their diversity \nefforts. We were pleased with their response and their willingness to \nimprove the diversity within their companies.\n  This year, Mr. Speaker, we revamped the biweekly CBC message to \nAmerica. We now broadcast across several digital platforms. The \nmessages to America have been highly received. They have been widely \nwatched with some of our most popular messages focusing on criminal \njustice reform, police violence, poverty, education, the importance of \nHBCUs, and ending the stigma of racism in America.\n  Finally, on August 6, the CBC recognized the 50th anniversary of the \nVoting Rights Act. In the 2 years following the Supreme Court's ruling \nto overturn section 4 in the Shelby County v. Holder case, voting \nrights have come under assault, Mr. Speaker. They have come under \nrenewed assault.\n  Since 2010, new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 \nStates, making it harder for millions of eligible Americans to exercise \ntheir right to vote. The CBC has been very vocal on these efforts, \nincluding outreach in Wisconsin. We filed an amicus brief in the States \nof Wisconsin, in North Carolina, and in Alabama.\n  The CBC has asserted for years that Black Americans are unfairly \ntreated and disproportionately exposed to the criminal justice system. \nPolice bias and excessive use of force are real in the African American \ncommunity. We see it every day. We must restore the American people's \ntrust in our criminal justice system.\n\n  Finally, we have worked to expand the economic opportunities for \nAfrican Americans. The CBC, in coordination with the Joint Economic \nCommittee Democrats, have held two public forums in Baltimore and \nHarlem, I might say, entitled ``The American Dream on Hold: Economic \nChallenges in the African American Community,'' where we discussed with \nthose communities the impact of economic challenges and persistent \ninequities facing African American communities across the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are so many more things that I could say about the \nwork of the Congressional Black Caucus. We are busy. We are engaged \nevery day not only representing African Americans, but representing \nevery American who is affected by some of the policies that have been \nenacted by this Congress.\n  Thank you for the time this evening.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield. That was \ncertainly a great list of our achievements. Like you said, that was \njust some of the things that we have been able to accomplish, and there \nis a lot more that you can say. We can go on and on. Thank you for your \nleadership and making sure that we get some of these things done.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Ms. Kelly, I believe you mentioned to Mr. Payne that \nhe was your partner in crime. I want those who may be watching this on \ntelevision to know that was really a joke.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Of course. At this time, I yield to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois and the gentleman from New Jersey for organizing this \nSpecial Order tonight. It takes a lot of work and a lot of time to \norganize these efforts, and I want to thank them both for the time and \neffort that they have put into this.\n  We have heard a lot about what the Congressional Black Caucus has \ndone over the years. There are two areas that I have been personally \ninvolved in with the CBC effort in the areas of education and criminal \njustice reform. On both we have worked hard and achieved bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is a civil rights \nbill, makes sure that the admonition in Brown v. Board of Education \nbecomes a reality. It says that no child shall reasonably be expected \nto succeed in life if denied the opportunity of an education and such \nan opportunity must be made available to all on equal terms. That is \nwhat the Brown decision held.\n  But we know that we don't have equal education in America because we\n\n[[Page H8439]]\n\nfund it primarily through the real estate tax, guaranteeing that \nwealthy areas will have more resources for education than low-income \nareas.\n  So 50 years ago we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nwhich provides funding directed primarily to help the challenges in \neducating low-income children particularly in concentrated areas of \npoverty.\n  No Child Left Behind a few years ago added to that by making sure \nthat we ascertained whether or not there are achievement gaps in \ncertain groups and requires action to be taken to solve those \nachievement gaps.\n  This week we should reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act to ensure that the needs of all children are addressed. \nThat legislation has just come out of conference. It came out of \nconference with an overwhelming--almost unanimous--vote, a bipartisan \nvote. So we look forward to the continuation of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, the next area that we are going to be working on is the \nHigher Education Act, also originally passed 50 years ago. When \nPresident Johnson signed that bill, he pointed out that every child \nshould be able to go to any college in any State. Back then that was \nactually a reality because a low-income student with a maximum Pell \nGrant and a summer job could virtually work his way through college \nwith no debt.\n  Now, because the buying power of the Pell Grant has eroded, instead \nof 75 percent of the cost of education, now it is down to about one-\nthird and the rest has to be picked up with devastating student loans. \nWe need to pass a Higher Education Act that makes access to college a \nreality, not just a dream.\n  We can do that, and there is bipartisan support for that effort. So \nin education we are making progress with the Congressional Black Caucus \nand we have been able to achieve bipartisan support.\n  It is interesting that we have also been able to achieve bipartisan \nsupport in the criminal justice reform efforts. We have a problem in \ncriminal justice now because, for decades, we have been passing all \nthese slogans and sound bites, particularly, mandatory minimums that \nhave run our incarceration rate up to number one in the world by far. \nWe have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent are \nprisoners.\n  Several recent studies have pointed out that our incarceration rate \nis so high that it is actually counterproductive; that is, we have got \nso many children being raised with parents in prison and we have got so \nmany people with felony records that can't find jobs and the prison \nbudget in the Department of Justice is eating up so much of the budget \nthat the other things that can actually reduce crime don't have the \nfunds that they actually need.\n  One bipartisan effort that we were able to achieve late last year was \nthe Death in Custody Reporting Act, which requires any death in the \ncustody of law enforcement--that is a death in jail, a death in prison, \nor death in the process of arrest--will be reported to the Justice \nDepartment so that the discussion about all of these deaths can be \nbased on facts, not just speculation.\n  We also are in the process of trying to pass criminal justice reform. \nThe Judiciary Committee, in a subcommittee task force led by Jim \nSensenbrenner from Wisconsin and myself, had an overcriminalization \ntask force. The one thing we noticed was that 30 States were able to \nreduce incarceration and reduce crime at the same time.\n  One example was Texas. Texas was faced with a $2 billion request for \nprison expansion to keep up with the slogans and sound bites that they \nhad been codifying over the years--$2 billion. Someone suggested, \ninstead of spending $2 billion, how about trying to spend a couple of \nhundred million--research-based, evidence-based targeted expenditures--\nto actually reduce crime, and maybe they wouldn't have to spend all $2 \nbillion.\n  Well, that is what they did. They intelligently spent. With a \nresearch-based and evidence-based approach to reduce crimes, they made \nthose expenditures and looked up. They didn't have to build any new \nprisons at all. In fact, they were able to close some of the prisons \nthey had. Over 30 States have reduced crime and saved money just in \nusing the same strategy.\n  So as a result of the overcriminalization task force, we created a \ncomprehensive criminal justice bill that starts with investments in \nprevention and early intervention, has diversion to drug courts so that \npeople with drug problems can have their problems solved rather than \njust spinning through the criminal justice system, a significant \nreduction in mandatory minimums so they would be reserved for true \nkingpins, not for people caught up in the conspiracy, like girlfriends \nand things like that.\n  Only the true kingpins would get the mandatory minimums. Everyone \nelse would get a sentence that made sense. If you go to jail, then you \nshould be rehabilitated, not just warehoused, and we should have \nfunding for Second Chance programs.\n  The beauty of the bill is that the savings in prison space by the \nreduction in mandatory minimums will be redirected to pay for the \nprevention and early intervention, the drug courts, the prison reform \nefforts, and the Second Chance programs so all of those programs are \npaid for.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  We also have significant funding for police training. As we go \nthrough the trauma of these trials that are going on as we speak in \nBaltimore and Chicago, when you get to a solution, it will undoubtedly \ninvolve police training and probably body cameras, and those are funded \nin the Safe Justice Act by diverting money from the savings in \nmandatory minimums to those programs. We have broad bipartisan support, \nmany very conservative, many very liberal organizations, all supporting \nthe Safe Justice Act and other criminal justice reform efforts. The \nBlack Caucus should be proud of the efforts that they have put in to \nmaking sure that we have a fair and equitable criminal justice system.\n  I would like to thank again the gentlewoman from Illinois for all of \nher hard work and the gentleman from New Jersey for his hard work in \npointing out many of the good things that the Congressional Black \nCaucus has accomplished, many things they have accomplished this year \nand a lot of things we are working on for next year. So I thank you for \nyour hard work and dedication.\n  We have a conference committee report that came out with an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote that will ensure that young people will \nhave their educational needs met. I want to thank the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Kline) for his hard work and cooperation on that bill.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you for the information on the Safety \nJustice Act and education. The two really go hand in hand. If our young \npeople have more skills and are educated, then I think that we will see \nless crime. We always say, in my area, ``Nothing stops a bullet like a \njob,'' so thank you for that information and for all of your hard work.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a \nwoman of great knowledge and experience, and one of my heroes.\n  Ms. LEE. First, let me thank Congresswoman Kelly for those very \ngenerous remarks, but also for your tremendous leadership and for \nstaying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking \ntruth to power each and every week on behalf of the Black Caucus.\n  Also, to you, Congressman Don Payne, thank you very much for your \nleadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues. In \nthe very short time that you have been here, you have hit the ground \nrunning and really have made a tremendous difference.\n  I want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus for the last year or 2 years. I have to \njust say that our leader, Mr. Butterfield, has been a very bold and \ntremendous leader. We have accomplished quite a bit, and we have a lot \nmore to do. While 2015 has been very challenging, I believe that the \nCongressional Black Caucus has really stepped up and made a huge \ndifference not only for the African American community and communities \nof color, but for the entire country.\n  It has also been an inspiring year. We have seen the birth and growth \nof the\n\n[[Page H8440]]\n\nvital Black Lives Matter movement. We have also witnessed powerful and \nmoving protests across the country in places like Missouri, New York, \nand even in my district in Oakland and in Berkeley, California, with \npeople of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice, \nto petition their government, to exercise their democratic rights.\n  I am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and \ndemanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities. \nThey are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st \ncentury. I want them to know that they have allies here in the people's \nHouse.\n  For too long Congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting \nthe African American community and other communities of color. It is \npast time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were \nsent to Washington to do, that the Congressional Black Caucus has done \nfor many, many decades.\n  We need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened \nwith the Voting Rights Act. As you know, this year marks the 50th \nanniversary of this landmark legislation. The Voting Rights Act was \ngutted by the Supreme Court in its Shelby v. Holder decision, and, of \ncourse, Republican State legislators have fallen all over to restrict \nvoting rights across the country everywhere.\n  These dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter ID \nrequirements, elimination of same-day voter registration, and really \nsevere reduction in early voting efforts. We must call these efforts \nfor what they are: Republican attempts to take away one of our most \nfundamental rights. But we will not let this happen.\n  I am so proud of the Congressional Black Caucus--Congresswoman Terri \nSewell and John Lewis and Mr. Clyburn, the entire Congressional Black \nCaucus. Our bill, H.R. 2867, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, \nsponsored by Congresswoman Sewell, who represents Selma, Alabama, would \nrestore the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act for any \nState that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 \nyears in the preclearance process.\n  As Dr. King once said: Give us the ballot, and we will fill our \nlegislative halls with men--and, of course, women--with goodwill.\n  We can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy \nfulfilled. So we need our young people to keep up the street heat and \ndemand that Congress act.\n  It is past time that we get serious about restoring the Voting Rights \nAct and ensuring that all Americans--and that means all Americans--have \nfree and unobstructed access to the ballot box.\n  Also, the serious economic disparities that persist in the African \nAmerican community are very, very evident. According to a report \nreleased earlier this year by the Joint Economic Committee, led by \nranking member Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, and the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, we learned, and it is very glaring, that more than one in \nthree Black children are born into poverty, and the African American \npoverty rate is three times that of White Americans.\n  The cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems, \nwhere Black students account for 42 percent of preschool student \nexpulsions, despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment. Now, \nthat is preschool expulsion. Every time I remember this and say this, \nit really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young \nBlack kids, especially with young Black boys, because there is no way \nanybody, no kids, should be expelled from preschool. That is ages 1 to \n4. That is outrageous.\n  I am the mother, yes, of two fabulous great Black men, and I am the \ngrandmother of two Black boys, and I find statistics like that very, \nvery troubling. For African Americans, we have allowed our school \nsystem to be turned into a pipeline to prison. We must act now to \naddress systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice \nsystems.\n  I want to applaud Congressman Bobby Scott and Congressman Conyers \nbecause they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform, and we \nare beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent \nwork.\n  Our criminal justice system is broken. It needs to be rebuilt from \nthe ground up. So alongside of our CBC colleagues, once again we are \ncalling for comprehensive criminal justice reform.\n  Also, I want to mention our effort, which I co-chair with Chairman \nButterfield, our Tech 2020 initiative. Silicon Valley is right next to \nmy district in California. There are great opportunities there for \neveryone.\n\n  However, the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and \ncontracting with and working with communities of color, especially the \nAfrican American community. So I am very pleased that the Tech 2020 of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus has been initiated. We are working with \nour great leader, Reverend Jesse Jackson, with an inside-outside \nstrategy. Many of the tech companies understand what is taking place \nand that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone.\n  So the Black Caucus along with Rainbow PUSH, along with the tech \nindustry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this \nindustry which provides good-paying jobs and opportunities is an \nindustry that is inclusive, that does not discriminate, and that \nincludes the diversity of this great country.\n  So I have to just say to Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne, \nthank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues \nthat we have been working on. When you look at the issue of poverty, \ncutting poverty in half in 10 years, we know how to do it. We have \nlegislation, the Half in Ten Act, H.R. 258, to do that, and the \nPathways Out of Poverty Act, H.R. 2721. We know how to provide \nopportunities. The Congressional Black Caucus once again is leading on \nall of these fronts. It is a big agenda, but it is an agenda that makes \nour country stronger.\n  So thank you, Congresswoman Kelly, and thank you, Congressman Payne, \nfor the chance to be with you tonight.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Lee. You have brought \nup so many issues that are so interconnected--again, education, \ndiversity inclusion. When you think about preschoolers getting \nexpelled, that is not a good start. And what message does it send to \nthat young man or that young woman or that little boy or that little \ngirl? But all of the things that you talked about--voting rights--are \nall interconnected, and we need to accomplish all of those goals for a \nbetter America, and not just for African Americans, but for everybody.\n  Ms. LEE. Thank you very much.\n  I just want to say that I think what is reflective in the \nCongressional Black Caucus' agenda and all of the work that we have \ndone for so many years is really an effort to show that how, if you \nensure that opportunity is there for everyone, including African \nAmericans and communities of color and people who have been shut out \nand marginalized, our country becomes stronger. This means that \neverybody benefits--not only for the Congressional Black Caucus, this \nis for the entire country. So thank you again for your leadership.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Well, we want to thank you for your leadership \nand all of the work that you have done to make Congress stronger, as \nwell as the caucus stronger.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Brooklyn, New York (Mr. \nJeffries).\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for \nyielding. And I also thank, of course, my good friend and colleague, \nCongressman Don Payne, from across the Hudson River, who does such a \ntremendous job of representing the people of Newark and Essex County.\n  It has been an honor and a privilege to watch my two colleagues \nduring this year preside over the CBC Special Order hour, giving us, as \na caucus, an opportunity to share with the American people some of our \nthoughts and ideas and the issues that we are working on to improve a \nlot of those that we represent in the African American community and \nall across this great, gorgeous mosaic in the United States of America.\n  I am troubled, of course, by the events of the last few days as \nrelates to the Laquan McDonald case out of\n\n[[Page H8441]]\n\nRobin Kelly's hometown in Chicago. About a year ago, many of us from \nthe Congressional Black Caucus were on this very House floor talking \nabout the failure to indict in the killing of Michael Brown; and in the \nsame week, 3 days later, the failure to indict in the strangulation of \nEric Garner, who, of course, was put into an unauthorized choke hold \nand killed as a result of allegedly selling loose cigarettes.\n  It, of course, highlighted the problem of African American men being \nkilled at the hands of police officers, which is a decade-old problem \nthat, hopefully, here in America we will find the courage one day to \nconfront.\n  And now, of course, we are compelled to come to the House floor to \ndeal with the tragedy of the Laquan McDonald case, a 17-year-old shot \n16 times in 15 seconds by an officer who had 20 prior civilian \ncomplaints filed against him. I am no mathematician, but those numbers \nsimply do not add up. The tape comes out and we see what occurred: an \nindividual, Laquan, who was walking away from the officers, not toward \nthe officers. There is no reasonable circumstance, I believe, that led \nto that individual being shot down like a dog on the streets of \nChicago.\n  The officer has now been indicted 13 months later, and, hopefully, \nthe justice system will run its course and the officer will be \nprosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  I am here today to talk briefly about another troubling issue that \nrelates to this problem of the police use of excessive force. That is \nnot just the bad apples who engage in this behavior; it is the fact \nthat, far too often, the police officers in the department, who may not \notherwise engage in excessive force but who have grown up in a culture \nof a blue wall of silence, support these officers either with their \ninaction or, in some instances, by actively participating in a coverup.\n  Now, I know that is hard for a lot of Americans to hear because, \nlisten, I also believe that the overwhelming majority of officers are \nhardworking individuals who are there to protect and serve.\n  I don't take lightly the fact that I am here concerned on the House \nfloor that far too many officers stand by, tolerate, and enable the \nexcessive use of force, sometimes resulting in American citizens being \nkilled without justification.\n  This case actually highlights the problem. Laquan gets killed, and if \nyou look at the reports in the immediate aftermath of his death last \nOctober--and I just pulled a few--here is what we were told.\n  ``The suspect fled, and officers gave chase, police said. When the \nofficers confronted him near 41st Street and Pulaski Road, he refused \ntheir orders to drop the knife and began walking toward the officers, \npolice said.\n  ``Pat Camden, spokesman for the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, \nsaid the teen had a `crazed' look about him as he approached the \nofficers with the knife.''\n  That was reported by CBS.\n  Let's go to NBC. ``Responding officers found a 17-year-old boy `with \na strange gaze about him,' who was carrying a knife and wouldn't drop \nit when police ordered him to do so, Fraternal Order of Police \nspokesman Pat Camden said.\n  ``Other officers used a squad car to try and box the boy in against a \nfence near West 41st Street and South Pulaski Road, Camden said. An \nofficer shot him in the chest when the teen didn't drop the knife and \ncontinued to walk toward officers, police said.''\n  WGN-TV: ``Chicago police officers shot and killed a 17-year-old after \na foot chase near 41st Street and Pulaski . . . Officers shot the teen \nafter he waved the knife at them.''\n  In the interest of time, let me just read one more. This is from the \nChicago Tribune: ``Officers got out of their car and began approaching \nMcDonald, again telling him to drop the knife, Camden said. The boy \nallegedly lunged at the officers, and one of them opened fire.''\n  `` `When police tell you to drop a weapon, all you have to do is drop \nit.' ''\n  I mean, Shakespeare would be proud at the fiction that was put out \nthere to justify the murder of this 17-year-old.\n  Here is what is worse. It has now been reported that in the immediate \naftermath of the shooting four or five officers went to a nearby Burger \nKing and asked to view the surveillance tape. The manager at Burger \nKing gives them the password to the video. They spend a couple of hours \nin Burger King--I mean, a couple of hours in Burger King, allegedly--\nand then they leave.\n  Then internal affairs officers apparently come in the days afterward, \nand they pull the tape. Guess what? Eighty-six minutes are missing. It \nhappens to be the 86 minutes that cover the period of time when Laquan \nMcDonald was killed.\n  When we come to the House floor and people across the country say \nBlack lives matter and they are concerned about the lack of justice in \nthe system, understand that it is not just the excessive use of force; \nit is the fact that far too many officers, law enforcement folks, \nparticipate actively in covering up what has occurred.\n  Until we deal with that cancer of the blue wall of silence, we are \ngoing to continue to have to come to this House floor, and you are \ngoing to continue to see individuals be killed as a result of the use \nof excessive force.\n  It is an American problem that we should confront, and we should \nconfront it boldly and directly and without hesitation if we really \nwant to uplift the best values of our great democracy.\n  I thank Congresswoman Kelly, and I thank Congressman Payne for their \ntremendous leadership.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his profound \nremarks on this occasion.\n  I have my own remarks in reference to what happened to this \nyoungster. That is what he was--a youngster, a child. I have 17-year-\nold triplets. God forbid my children find themselves in that \npredicament.\n  I will not even try to match the remarks by the gentleman from New \nYork. I think he stated the case clearly.\n  Black lives matter. I know there is a segment in this country that \ngets upset when they hear that, but you need to understand what they \nare saying. It is: Why is there no worth to African American lives? \nThat is what they are asking. Why is it so easy that we continually \nfind people of color on the wrong end of these weapons?\n  Then to have it covered up in the manner in which the gentleman from \nNew York stated--86 minutes. Now, my children love Burger King, but you \nonly need 20 minutes if there is a line in Burger King to do what you \nneed to do. But they spent hours there, getting their story right, \nmaking sure everybody would corroborate what they were going to say.\n  That is why ``Black Lives Matter'' exists. That is why we continue to \nbring these issues up. That is why we will not let it go quietly into \nthe night.\n  Everybody has seen that videotape. When did he lunge? When was he \nshot once in the chest? When did any of those things that were reported \noccur in that video? He was walking away. He did still have the knife \nin his hand, but he was walking away. Most of the shots that were put \ninto his body were after he was on the ground. The officer feared for \nhis life.\n  Black lives matter.\n  Our next speaker is the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas, the \nwonderful, dynamic, one of my heroes, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and the \ngentlewoman from Illinois but I want to specifically say Chicago. I \njoin my colleagues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think this is, again, an important statement of the \nvalue of the Congressional Black Caucus. I am glad our tone is such \nthat we are compassionate, we have emotion, but we are detailed.\n  With the remaining time, let me try to be concise on the value of the \nCongressional Black Caucus in American history, its place in this \nCongress to be the provocative orators and articulators of the \nconscience of this Nation.\n  Let me first of all say that I have been privileged but certainly \nhave mourned May 15, when all of us paid attention to fallen law \nenforcement officers who are honored here in the United States Capitol. \nAny number of us has gone to the grounds, and we have hugged those from \nour districts, we have honored families, and we have recognized the \npain.\n\n[[Page H8442]]\n\n  I think many of you recall that there was an assassination of sorts \nof a deputy sheriff in Houston, a number of unfortunate assassinations \nor shootings of police in New York, and I saw the Nation mourn.\n  I think it is important to say this because, often, when we say \n``Black lives matter,'' it seems conflicted. People raise the issues \nthat African Americans or the Nation seem to be hesitant about law \nenforcement officers, and that is not true.\n  I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus and Chairman \nButterfield because we started out this year with a criminal justice \nagenda. I just want to quickly go down memory lane or to reflect very \nquickly to say that it was the leadership and the combined Members who \nraised a number of issues that have brought us to the point that we \nhave actually passed in the Senate and in the House Judiciary Committee \ncriminal justice sentencing legislation.\n  We are not where we need to be, but the Sentencing Reform Act will \nreduce mass incarceration by 11,500. Of those who are currently \nincarcerated, it will give retroactive relief, and an additional 4,000 \nwill benefit each year. Combined with that, it will be 50,000 over 10 \nyears.\n  We are beginning to look at the criminal justice system in a way that \nspeaks to the whole idea of Blacks, minorities, Hispanics, and others \nbeing the fodder for the criminal justice system. In my district in \nHouston, Texas, Black and Hispanic youth make up over 75 percent of the \nmale population age 10 to 24 years, but Black and Hispanic youth \naccount for 85 percent of the youth admitted in our detention centers.\n  We are working on the reduction of sentencing, and I think with the \nhelp of this bipartisan legislation, which has been initiated and \nbrought to the attention of this Congress by members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus in working with other Members of this body, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, we have legislation that should pass.\n  As we all know and as we have been mystified and mourning this tape, \nI know that Congresswoman Kelly in her hometown has been a champion for \njustice, along with her fellow colleagues of the Congressional Black \nCaucus, Bobby Rush and Danny Davis, who have been front and center on \nthese issues. So we must continue the journey of dealing with the \njuvenile justice.\n  Might I say that I hope we will come around the issues of the RAISE \nAct, of the Fair Chance for Youth Act, and of Kalief's Law, ending \nsolitary confinement for young people in the juvenile justice system, \nbanning the arrest record, and, of course, giving alternative \nsentencing to these young people.\n  I want to quickly get back to this horrific shooting, because what \n``Black Lives Matter'' speaks to is coming together around an improved \nlaw enforcement system. That is why I came to the floor today--to be \nable to say, unless we move forward on legislation that deals with best \npractices in our police departments, we are going to continue the \ntension that should not exist.\n  There is no explanation or no answer to the video that has been \nshown. I wonder what the sentencing or the reaction or the ultimate \nresult would have been if there were a video of Darren Wilson and \nMichael Brown. There was not. I still believe that with Michael Brown, \nan unarmed youth, his actor, who happened to be a law enforcement \nperson, should not have gone unpunished.\n  In this instance, we see a video that was completely \nmischaracterized, or, in essence, the story was characterized \ncompletely contrary to the video that was shown. So what is the answer?\n  Law enforcement officers who I work with all the time will indicate \nthat there are bad apples, and they are right. Then work with us to \npass the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, which provides the \nroadmap and the incentive for all of these departments to be accredited \nand to have officers go through the specific training that documents \nhow you address the question of the street.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  It includes video cameras. It includes community-oriented policing. \nIt includes grants to incentivize better training and better training \npractices.\n  We must find an answer in this term of Congress. We should not end \nthis Congress without a complete and reformed criminal justice system, \nincluding dealing with law enforcement, which is clearly what the \nCongressional Black Caucus has been working on.\n  So I am hoping that we can find this common ground because there is \nno explanation that is reasonable or rational of the actions of the \nofficer in Chicago.\n  There is no reasonable explanation to the officer in the Sandra Bland \ncase. Ladies and gentlemen, you remember this young woman dying in a \njail. They have yet to come up with an indictment or a response. They \nhave yet to have an answer of the jail that standards were an \nembarrassment in Waller County.\n  The District Attorney has yet to come forward in the Sandra Bland \ncase. The family has not been notified. The lawyer doesn't know what is \ngoing on. We met with those individuals not to direct them, but to \nensure that they were going to respect this death. Nothing has happened \nabout the stop that we saw in the video. Nothing has happened about the \njail incarceration.\n  I simply have come to the floor to indicate to my colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to work with us on a number of issues that \nthose in the Congressional Black Caucus reach out in the spirit of \nbipartisanship, dealing with the Voting Rights Reauthorization in \nsection 5, providing opportunities for Historically Black Colleges \nwhich we have been at the leadership realm of, making sure that the \ncriminal justice system addresses the overincarceration of our youth, \ndealing with the question of policing, which the Black Lives Matters \nspeaks to it eloquently.\n  We should not be condemned for the massive protests of 10,000 people \ndown this wonderful Michigan Avenue as: There they go again. We have \ngot to find a place at the table to be able to reorient, if you will, \nhow we do policing in America. I would ask my colleagues that we move \nswiftly in this term in this Congress to be able to address this.\n  Let me finish on this one last point. The violence of guns is \noutrageous. I want to speak very quietly about the Planned Parenthood \nincident because I don't want to provoke, but I believe it is important \nto note we always say for those who don't want to hear us about gun \nsafety closing the gun show loophole, banning assault weapons which the \nindividual had.\n  However it plays out, the individual may be determined to have a \nmental health concern or condition, but he had an automatic rifle of \nsome sort. And, unfortunately, we lost several persons in the course of \nthe incident, although the investigation is still ongoing.\n  It also happens in Black-on-Black crime. My friends, our community \ndoesn't ignore that. But what we say is that guns are involved in most \nof these deaths. Not only are guns involved, but we must understand \nthat, when a gun is used by an officer, it is distinct from Black-on-\nBlack crime because it is under color of law.\n  The Congressional Black Caucus comes to the table to ensure that \nthese very sensitive issues are handled with the greatest delicacy, but \nwith the greatest commitment and passion that we want to stop the \nkilling, stop the deaths, and have the decency to reflect on a parent \nlike Mr. Payne, a parent like Ms. Kelly, a parent like myself.\n  Black lives matter. Our children matter. The Congressional Black \nCaucus wants to work to ensure that we have the answers that the \nAmerican people have asked us for and that they deserve.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security as \nwell as the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Investigations, I am pleased to \njoin my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special \nOrder to speak to the issues that members of the 114th Congress must \naddress.\n  No other country imprisons a larger percentage of its population than \nthe United States or spends anywhere near the $6.5 billion that we \nspend annually on prison administration.\n  We now know that the cost of imprisoning so many non-violent \noffenders is fiscally unsustainable and morally unjustifiable and it\n\n[[Page H8443]]\n\nwill take the combined efforts of policy makers, reform advocates, \nlegal professionals, and private citizens to solve the problem.\n  Congress took a giant step forward on the road to reform with a law I \nco-sponsored, the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which eliminated the \ncrack versus powder disparity. Earlier this month, the House took \nanother big step when its Judiciary Committee favorably reported \nanother bill I sponsored, the Sentence Reform Act of 2015 (H.R. 3713), \nwhich will help reform a criminal justice system that often seems less \neffective at reforming criminals and more effecting in inflicting \ncollateral damage on families and communities.\n  Specifically, the Sentence Reform Act will reduce mass incarceration \nby making over 11,500 individuals, who are currently incarcerated, \neligible for retroactive relief and an additional 4,000 will benefit \neach year. Combined, this is over 50,000 in ten years. These estimates \nare conservative, as not all the positive reforms can be quantified.\n  Today, we know also that more and more young children are being \narrested, incarcerated, and detained in lengthy out-of-home placements.\n  Our youth easily encounter law enforcement through the mass transit \non the way to school, the school resource officer at school, and patrol \nofficers on the way home.\n  A youth experience behavior issues when encountered should not be \narrested but assessed for underlying issues that can nearly always be \nhandled without ever having contact with the justice system.\n  At least 75 percent of children within the juvenile justice system \nhave experienced traumatic victimization, making them vulnerable to \nmental health disorders and perceived behavioral non-compliance and \nmisconduct.\n  Numerous studies have also shown that as many as 70-80 percent of \nyouth involved in the justice system meet the criteria for a \ndisability.\n  In my district in Houston, Texas, Black and Hispanic Youth make up \nover 75% of the male population aged 10-24 years.\n  Yet, Black and Hispanic Youth account for 85% of youth admitted in \nour detention centers.\n  A majority of these admissions into detention are for minor and \nmisdemeanor offenses--behavior that should not require locking youth \nup.\n  Especially when the rate of detention continues to reflect \ndisproportionate minority contact and criminalization of minority \nyouth.\n  As we look to reform our juvenile and criminal justice system, and be \nwhat President Obama has called upon us be: ``My Brother's and Sister's \nKeeper''--we must move away from the engrained culture of \ncriminalization as the answer to our problems.\n  These include:\n  I have introduced 13 additional pieces of legislation this Congress \npertaining to Criminal Justice Reform.\n  The RAISE Act (H.R. 3158) which helps young people in the federal \nsystem by providing judges more flexible sentencing options, encourages \ndiversion, increases home confinement opportunities, ends mandatory \nlife without parole, mandates housing and programming specific to the \nneeds of youth, and creates youth-specific diversion and pilot \nprograms.\n  The Fair Chance for Youth Act (H.R. 3156) better enables young people \nto reenter and contribute to our communities by creating a mechanism \nfor sealing or expungement of certain youth criminal records. If we are \never to stop the cycle of recidivism, we must give our young people a \nreal chance to succeed after they have paid their debt to society.\n  Kaliefs Law (H.R. 3155). named in memory of Kalief Browder, to \nestablish more humane rules for incarcerated youth by banning the use \nof solitary confinement, mandating certain minimum standards and \nprocedural protections for pretrial detention and speedy trial rights, \nand ending the shackling of youth at federal court appearances.\n  I am also a co-sponsor of the Fair Chance Act that aims to prohibit \nFederal agencies and Federal contractors from requesting that an \napplicant for employment disclose criminal history record information \nbefore the applicant has received a conditional offer, and for other \npurposes.\n  There now exists a broad and bipartisan consensus that our criminal \njustice system is broken and a historic opportunity to pass meaningful \nlegislation reform the system so that it works for everyone--the \ngeneral public, law enforcement personnel, taxpayers, crime victims, \nand offenders who have served their time, paid their debt to society, \nand anxious to redeem the second chance so they can ``pay it forward.''\n\n  It is past time for us to Ban the Box!\n  Missouri has lately taken center stage when it comes to racial \ntensions: the unrest in Ferguson and the protests at the University of \nMissouri.\n  Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed on Aug. \n9, 2014, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo., a \nsuburb of St. Louis.\n  The shooting prompted violent protests and helped form the Black \nLives Matter Movement.\n  The unrest in Ferguson likely comes from Missouri's acute levels of \nracial segregation.\n  The African-American population is heavily concentrated in the \nsegregated cities of St. Louis and Kansas City.\n  St. Louis is the fifth-most racially segregated city in the United \nStates.\n  The state poverty is located mostly within predominantly black areas.\n  The racial segregation that is rampant in the ``Show Me State'' stems \nfrom white hostility towards African Americans and that hostility \nmagnifies itself on college campuses, including the University of \nMissouri.\n  Protests have been on-going in Columbia, MO since October in response \nto racist incidents that further the rampant racism in the state.\n  For example, in 2010, two white students were arrested for dropping \ncotton balls in front of the Gaines/Oldham Black Culture Center and in \n2011 a student was given probation for racially charged graffiti in a \nstudent dormitory.\n  On September 12, 2015, a Facebook post by the student government \npresident Payton Head complained of bigotry and anti-gay sentiment \naround the college campus, which gained widespread attention.\n  The Mizzou football team announced on November 8th that they would \nboycott playing until the administration took drastic steps.\n  The University President Tim Wolfe and Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin \nboth stepped down on November 9th but the protests are ongoing.\n  October 20, 2014 is an unforgettable day because a young man named \nLaquan McDonald was fatally shot 16 times in the middle of the street \nby Chicago Police officer Jason Van Dyke.\n  Sadly, October 20, will serve as a yearly reminder of the unambiguous \nslaying of a young man who will never have the chance to grow old.\n  More than 500 protesters marched through Chicago for nearly 9 hours \nafter officials released the chilling dash-cam video showing the fatal \nshooting of Laquan McDonald.\n  Protesters marched along Chicago's famous Michigan Avenue the day \nafter Thanksgiving, demanding the resignations of the city's top \nleaders.\n  The Protesters stood in harmony with locked arms outside the doors of \nmajor retailers chanting ``Stop the cover-up'' and ``16 shots! 16 \nshots'' which was the number of times the officer fired upon Laquan \nMcDonald.\n  Other Police killings include:\n  The death of 43-year-old Eric Garner resulting from the application \nof a NYPD police chokehold occurred in the Northeast and the death of \n18-year-old Michael Brown and the resulting events in Ferguson occurred \nin the border state of Missouri.\n  The killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by a Cleveland police office \noccurred in the Midwest and death of unarmed 26-year-old Jordan Baker \nby an off-duty Houston police officer occurred in Texas.\n  In Phoenix, Arizona, Rumain Brisbon, an unarmed black father of four, \nwas shot to death in when a police officer allegedly mistook his bottle \nof pills for a gun.\n  In Pasdena, California, 19-year-old Kendrec McDade was chased and \nshot seven times by two police officers after a 911 caller falsely \nreported he had been robbed at gunpoint by two black men, neither of \nwhom in fact was armed.\n  And, of course, on April 4, the conscience of the nation was shocked \nby the horrifying killing of 50-year-old Walter Scott by a North \nCharleston police officer in the southern state of South Carolina.\n  Nearly 1,000 people in Minneapolis, Minnesota marched to City Hall \nless than a day after five protesters were shot near a Black Lives \nMatter demonstration.\n  This shooting which is seen to be a racially motivated attack has \npushed Minneapolis into the national spotlight.\n  The events in Minneapolis reminded us that we cannot and we must not \nallow tensions, which are present in so many neighborhoods across \nAmerica, to go unresolved.\n  Beyond Broke: Why Closing the Racial Wealth Gap is a Priority for \nNational Economic Security uses the most recently available data from \nthe U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation \n(SIPP) along with the National Asset Scorecard in Communities of Color \n(NASCC) to highlight the current state of America's racial wealth gap.\n  The report findings include:\n  Between 2005 and 2011, the median net worth of households of color \nremained near their 2009 levels, reflecting a drop of 58 percent for \nLatinos, 48 percent for Asians, 45 percent for African Americans but \nonly 21 percent for whites.\n  Hispanic households experienced the largest drop in net worth \nfollowing the recession.\n  More than half of whites own four or more tangible assets, compared \nto 49 percent of Asians and only one in five of African Americans and \nLatinos.\n\n[[Page H8444]]\n\n  African Americans (38 percent) and Latinos (35 percent) are over \ntwice as likely as whites (13 percent) to hold no financial assets at \nall and to have no or negative net worth.\n  At no point in our nation's history has a single human been more \ncapable of inflicting massive death and misery, and our society is \nproducing more individuals who seek to employ such means to carry out \ntheir ill intentions.\n  While it is certainly true that violent crime and homicide rates in \nthis country have been declining in recent years, they are still far \nabove those in other industrialized nations.\n  Most recently, the horrible attack on a Planned Parenthood in \nColorado Springs that took the lives of 3 Americans, including a mother \nand an Iraqi war Veteran.\n  That is just one horrific example of why we must act now to stop gun \nviolence, protect citizens, and end the urban warfare.\n  And we have a plan of action.\n  1. Require universal background checks to keep guns out of dangerous \nhands; an estimated 40% of gun transfers--6.6 million transfers--are \nconducted without a background check. 1/3 of ``want-to-buy'' ads online \nare posted by people with a criminal record. More than 4 times the rate \nat which prohibited gun buyers try to buy guns in stores. That would \nequate to 25,000 guns in illegal hands.\n  2. Ban military-style assault weapons;\n  3. Closing of the gun-show loophole; and\n  4. Increase access to mental health services. We must work to reduce \naccess to firearms for people with suicidal tendencies. 90% of suicide \nvictims should have been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. \nFirearms are the most common method of suicide--51%. We need to ensure \nthat mental health professionals know their options for reporting \nthreats of violence--even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental \nillness is far more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than the \nperpetrator.\n  Every day, 48 children and teens are shot in murders, assaults, \nsuicides & suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, and police \nintervention. Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence.\n  Over 17,000 (17,499) American children and teens are shot in murders, \nassaults, suicides & suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, or by \npolice intervention each year. 2,677 kids die from gun violence each \nyear. Every day, 297 people in America are shot in murders, assaults, \nsuicides & suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, and police \nintervention. Every day, 89 people die from gun violence.\n  Over 108,000 (108,476) people in America are shot in murders, \nassaults, suicides & suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, or by \npolice intervention. 32,514 people die from gun violence each year.\n  The senseless killings in Bamako, Mali, Beirut, and the Bataclan \nTheater in Paris are the most current examples of global terrorism.\n  The terror attacks that unfolded across Paris continue to tear at the \nhearts of all Americans.\n  Those who think that they can terrorize the people of France or the \nvalues that they stand for are wrong. The American people draw strength \nfrom the French people's commitment to life, liberty, the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  In response to these disgusting attacks, I call on my colleagues to \npass my bill H.R. 48 the No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act.\n  This would require the Director of the Terrorist Screening Center to \nreview the completeness of the Terrorist Screening Database and the \nterrorist watch list utilized by the Transportation Security \nAdministration.\n  Despite the recent terrorist attacks around the world, ISIS is not \nthe most deadly terrorist organization.\n  The 2015 Global Terrorism Index found that Boko Haram in Nieria \nkilled 6,644 people in 2014. 77% of deaths were private citizens.\n  This compared to 6,073 at the hands of ISIS.\n  Boko Haram was formed in 2002 and became armed in 2009.\n  In the last six years, Boko Haram has carried out more than 500 \nviolent attacks against a broad array of targets: Christian and Muslim \ncommunities, government installations, schools, hospitals and medical \nfacilities, aid workers, and journalists.\n  Their latest attack on Yola, Nigeria, left more than 30 people dead.\n  Boko Haram became well-known on a global stage when they kidnapped \n200 school girls.\n  During my visit to Nigeria over the summer I met with government \nofficials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, and others to discuss \nwhat is currently being done to bring these girls back to their \nfamilies as soon as possible.\n  Children's rights are human rights, and these types of attacks, \nspecifically targeting of schools, are strictly prohibited under \ninternational law and cannot be justified under any circumstances.\n  Girls and young women around the world absolutely must be allowed to \ngo to school peacefully and free from intimidation, persecution and all \nother forms of discrimination.\n  I have introduced H. Res. 528, Expressing the sense of the House of \nRepresentatives regarding to the Victims of the Terror Protection fund, \nwhich expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: Boko \nHaram and other terrorist organizations be declared an existential \nthreat to the human rights and security of the Nigerian people and \ntheir regional neighbors; the global strategy for ending the suffering \nand creating solutions for displaced persons in Africa includes a \nVictims of Terror Protection Fund, which should provide humanitarian \nassistance to Boko Haram victims; military technical assistance be \nprovided to Nigeria and its neighbors; and the Victims of Terror \nSupport Fund should be modeled after the cases of Khazakhstan and \nEquatorial Guinea where prior kleptocracy initiatives have been created \nto benefit communities and victims in need of support.\n  I also wear red every Wednesday to stand in solidarity with \nRepresentative Wilson in our combined effort to #BringBackOurGirls.\n  A terrible blow was dealt to the Voting Rights Act on June 25, 2013, \nwhen the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Shelby County v. \nHolder, 537 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b), the \nprovision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject \nto Section 5 ``pre-clearance.'' The reason the Court gave for its \nruling ``times have changed.''\n  Times have changed, but what the Court did not fully appreciate is \nthat the positive changes it cited were due almost entirely to the \nexistence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.\n  In the 50 years since its passage in 1965, the Voting Rights Act has \nsafeguarded the right of Americans to vote and stood as an obstacle to \nmany of the more egregious attempts by certain states and local \njurisdictions to game the system by passing discriminatory changes to \ntheir election laws and administrative policies.\n  I am a sponsor of the H.R. 2867, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of \n2015, a bill that restores and advances the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \nby providing a modern day coverage test that will extend federal \noversight to jurisdictions which have a history of voter suppression \nand protects vulnerable communities from discriminatory voting \npractices.\n  I am also a sponsor of H.R. 12, the Voter Empower Act of 2015, which \nprotects voters from suppression, deception, and other forms of \ndisenfranchisement by modernizing voter registration, promoting access \nto voting for individuals with disabilities, and protecting the ability \nof individuals to exercise the right to vote in elections for federal \noffice.\n  This year I had the honor to present the Barbara Jordan Gold \nMedallion for Public-Private Leadership to a pioneer in her own right \nHillary Rodham Clinton.\n  This prestigious award is presented annually to a woman of \ndemonstrated excellence in the public or private sector whose \nachievements are an example and inspiration to people everywhere, but \nespecially to women and girls.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois.

POSTHUMOUS PARDON.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, \n     and controversial figure in the history of the United States \n     who challenged racial biases.\n       (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to \n     parents who were former slaves.\n       (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled \n     throughout the United States, fighting White and African-\n     American heavyweights.\n       (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the \n     opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson \n     was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight \n     the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns.\n\n[[Page H8530]]\n\n       (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first \n     African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of \n     the World.\n       (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a \n     search for a White boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a \n     recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for the ``great \n     white hope''.\n       (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries \n     left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada.\n       (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed \n     the ``Battle of the Century''.\n       (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to \n     rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the \n     racially-motivated murder of African-Americans throughout the \n     United States.\n       (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites.\n       (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were \n     lynched, some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White \n     women.\n       (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 \n     (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the \n     ``Mann Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the \n     transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce \n     ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any \n     other immoral purpose''.\n       (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a \n     White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship \n     and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming \n     that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter.\n       (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on \n     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act.\n       (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped \n     when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, \n     and then married Jack Johnson.\n       (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White \n     woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson \n     had transported her across State lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery''.\n       (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the \n     Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison.\n       (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and \n     various European and South American countries.\n       (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title \n     to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915.\n       (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July \n     1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in \n     the Federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas.\n       (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, \n     but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title.\n       (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War \n     II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating \n     in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause.\n       (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n       (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29, 111th Congress, \n     agreed to July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th \n     Congress that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon \n     for his racially-motivated 1913 conviction.\n       (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that \n     Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon--\n       (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the \n     prosecutorial authority of the Federal Government from the \n     annals of criminal justice in the United States; and\n       (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural \n     contributions of Jack Johnson to society.\n\n     SEC. 9207.

STUDY ON THE TITLE I FORMULA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) provides \n     funding to local educational agencies through four separate \n     formulas that have been added to the law over time, and which \n     have ``distinct allocation patterns, providing varying shares \n     of allocated funds to different types of local educational \n     agencies or States,'' according to a 2015 report from the \n     Congressional Research Service.\n       (2) Minimal effort has been made by the Federal Government \n     to determine if the four formulas are adequately delivering \n     funds to local educational agencies with the highest \n     districtwide poverty averages.\n       (3) The formulas for distributing Targeted Grants and \n     Education Finance Incentive grants use two weighting systems, \n     one based on the percentage of children included in the \n     determination of grants to local educational agencies \n     (percentage weighting), and another based on the absolute \n     number of such children (number weighting). Both weighting \n     systems have five quintiles with a roughly equal number of \n     children in each quintile. Whichever of these weighting \n     systems results in the highest total weighted formula child \n     count for a local educational agency is the weighting system \n     used for that agency in the final allocation of Targeted and \n     Education Finance Incentive Grant funds.\n       (4) The Congressional Research Service has also said the \n     number weighting alternative is generally more favorable to \n     large local educational agencies with much larger geographic \n     boundaries and larger counts of eligible children than \n     smaller local educational agencies with smaller counts, but \n     potentially higher percentages, of eligible children, because \n     large local educational agencies have many more children in \n     the higher weighted quintiles.\n       (5) In local educational agencies that are classified by \n     the National Center for Education Statistics as ``Large \n     City'', 47 percent of all students attend schools with 75 \n     percent or higher poverty.\n       (b) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Institute of \n     Education Sciences shall complete a study on the \n     effectiveness of the four part A of title I formulas, \n     described in subsection (a), to deliver funds to the most \n     economically disadvantaged communities.\n       (2) Contents.--The study described in paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an analysis of the distribution of part A of title I \n     funds under the four formulas;\n       (B) an analysis of how part A of title I funds are \n     distributed among local educational agencies in each of the \n     12 locale types classified by the National Center on \n     Education Statistics.\n       (C) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or \n     unduly disadvantage any of the local educational agencies \n     described in subparagraph (B);\n       (D) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or \n     unduly disadvantage high-poverty eligible school attendance \n     areas in the local educational agencies described in \n     subparagraph (B);\n       (E) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or \n     unduly disadvantage lower population local educational \n     agencies with relatively high percentages of districtwide \n     poverty;\n       (F) the impact of number weighting and percentage weighting \n     in the formulas for distributing Targeted Grants and \n     Education Finance Incentive Grants on each of the local \n     educational agencies described in subparagraph (B);\n\n[[Page H8533]]\n\n       (G) the impact of number weighting and percentage weighting \n     on targeting part A of title I funds to eligible school \n     attendance areas with the highest concentrations of poverty \n     in local educational agencies described in subparagraph (B), \n     and local educational agencies described in subparagraph (B) \n     with higher percentages of districtwide poverty;\n       (H) an analysis of other studies and reports produced by \n     public and non-public entities examining the distribution of \n     part A of title I funds under the four formulas; and\n       (I) recommendations, as appropriate, for amending or \n     consolidating the formulas to better target part A of title I \n     funds to the most economically disadvantaged communities and \n     most economically disadvantaged eligible school attendance \n     areas.\n       (3) Public dissemination.--The Director of the Institute of \n     Education Sciences shall widely disseminate the findings of \n     the study conducted under this section--\n       (A) in a timely fashion;\n       (B) to--\n       (i) the public; and\n       (ii) the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate; and\n       (C) through electronic transfer and other means, such as \n     posting to the website of the Institute of Education Sciences \n     or the Department of Education.\n\n     SEC. 9212.

and\n       (iv) school readiness for children from low-income and \n     disadvantaged families, including during such children's \n     transition into elementary school;\n       (2) to encourage partnerships among Head Start providers, \n     State and local governments, Indian tribes and tribal \n     organizations, private entities (including faith- and \n     community-based entities), and local educational agencies, to \n     improve coordination, program quality, and delivery of \n     services;

and\n       (II) schools described in paragraph (2)(C), which, if not \n     satisfied within a state-determined number of years, shall, \n     in the case of such schools receiving assistance under this \n     part, result in identification of the school by the state for \n     comprehensive support and improvement under subsection \n     (c)(4)(D)(i)(III);\n\n       (ii) periodically review resource allocation to support \n     school improvement in local educational agencies in the state \n     with a significant number of schools identified for \n     comprehensive support and improvement under subsection \n     (c)(4)(D)(i) and schools implementing targeted support and \n     improvement plans under paragraph (2); and\n       (iii) provide technical assistance to local educational \n     agencies in the state with a significant number of schools \n     implementing comprehensive support and improvement plans \n     under paragraph (1) or schools implementing targeted support \n     and improvement plans under paragraph (2); and\n       (B) may--\n       (i) take action to initiate additional improvement in any \n     local educational agency with a significant number of schools \n     that are consistently identified by the state for \n     comprehensive support and improvement under subsection \n     (c)(4)(D)(i) and not meeting exit\n\n[[Page H8555]]\n\n     criteria established by the state under subparagraph \n     (A)(i)(I) and a significant number of schools implementing \n     targeted support and improvement plans under paragraph (2);

Such additional elements \n     or methods must not prevent the State from meeting the \n     minimum requirements for meaningful differentiation, \n     identification for improvement, and school support and \n     interventions under this section, and the State must not use \n     such additional elements or methods to reduce the number or \n     percentage, or change, the schools that would otherwise be \n     subject to the requirements of the State's accountability \n     system as described under 1111(c) and 1111(d).''\n       144. The Senate bill, but not the House amendment, includes \n     a definition for ``category of students.'' The definition \n     includes the same categories as are included in the House \n     amendment in paragraph (3)(B)(ii)(II).\n       See note 143.\n       145. The Senate bill and House amendment have different \n     language requiring States to establish accountability \n     systems.\n       See note 143.\n       146. The Senate bill and House amendment have different \n     requirements for State accountability systems.\n       See note 143.\n       147. The Senate bill, but not the House amendment, requires \n     States to include graduation rates, an academic indicator for \n     elementary and middle schools, and English proficiency in \n     their accountability systems.\n       See note 143.\n       148. The House amendment identifies the subgroups a State's \n     accountability system must identify. The subgroups are mostly \n     identical to the ``category of students'' definition in the \n     Senate bill, except that the Senate bill says ``children with \n     disabilities'' and the House amendment says ``students with \n     disabilities''. See note 145.\n       See note 143.\n       149. The Senate bill permits States to measure student \n     growth in their accountability systems. The House amendment \n     includes a mention of student growth in the assessment \n     paragraph of the House amendment. See note 102.\n       See note 143.\n       150. The House amendment requires a system of school \n     improvement for low-performing public schools receiving Title \n     I funds as part of states' accountability systems. The Senate \n     bill includes section 1114 regarding school identifications, \n     interventions, and supports to improve low-performing \n     schools. See note 238.\n       See note 143.\n       151.

The Senate bill, but not the House amendment, requires \n     State accountability systems to comply with Sec. 1114 of the \n     Senate bill.\n       See note 143.\n       154. The Senate bill, but not the House amendment, requires \n     State accountability systems to include a clear and \n     understandable explanation of school identification and \n     differentiation.\n       See note 143.\n       155. The Senate bill includes the requirement for states to \n     assess 95 percent of their students within the accountability \n     system. The House amendment included this provision within \n     the assessment requirements of the House amendment. See note \n     115.\n       See note 143.\n       156. The House amendment and the Senate bill contain \n     different language related to prohibitions on the Secretary.\n       HR/SR with an amendment to strike paragraph (6) and insert \n     a new subsection (e) of section 1111 as follows:\n       (e) Prohibition.\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this act shall be construed to \n     authorize or permit the Secretary--\n       (A) when promulgating any rule or regulation, to promulgate \n     any rule or regulation on the development or implementation \n     of the statewide accountability system established under this \n     section that would--\n       (i) add new requirements that are inconsistent with or \n     outside the scope of this part;\n       (ii) add new criteria that are inconsistent with or outside \n     the scope of this part;

or\n       (bb) the progress expected from any subgroups of students \n     in meeting such goals;\n\n       (II) specific academic assessments or assessment items that \n     States or local educational agencies use to meet the \n     requirements of subsection (b)(2) or otherwise use to measure \n     student academic achievement or student growth under this \n     part;\n       (III) indicators that States use within the State \n     accountability system under this section, including any \n     requirement to measure student growth, if a State chooses to \n     measure student growth, or the specific metrics used to \n     measure such growth under this part;\n       (IV) the specific weight of any measure or indicator used \n     to identify or meaningfully differentiate schools, under this \n     part;\n       (V) the specific methodology used by States to meaningfully \n     differentiate or identify schools under this part;\n       (VI) any specific school support and improvement strategies \n     that State or local educational agencies establish and \n     implement to intervene, support, and improve schools and \n     student outcomes under this part;\n       (VII) exit criteria established by States under subsection \n     (d)(3)(A)(i);\n       (VIII) provided that the State meets the requirements in \n     subsection (c)(3), a minimum number of students;\n       (IX) any aspect or parameter of a teacher, principal, or \n     other school leader evaluation system within a State or local \n     educational agency;

or\n       (ii) purports to be legally binding; or\n       (D) to require data collection under this part beyond data \n     derived from existing Federal, State, and local reporting \n     requirements.\n       (2) Defining terms.--In carrying out this part, the \n     Secretary shall not, through regulation or as a condition of \n     approval of the State plan or revisions or amendments to the \n     State plan, promulgate a definition of any term used in this \n     part, or otherwise prescribe any specification for any such \n     term, that is inconsistent with or outside the scope of this \n     part or is in violation of paragraph (1).\n       Report Language: ``While it is the intent of the Conferees \n     to allow the Secretary to issue regulations and guidance to \n     clarify the intent and implement the law, Conferees intend to \n     prohibit any such regulation that would create new \n     requirements inconsistent with or outside the scope of the \n     law, including regulations that would take from a State the \n     authority to establish a Statewide Accountability System, \n     thus undermining the intent of Congress that States establish \n     and make decisions regarding the Statewide Accountability \n     System required under this part. For example, the Secretary \n     may issue regulations to implement or clarify the statutory \n     requirement that the State meaningfully differentiate all \n     public schools (such as requiring a statewide accountability \n     system to indicate levels of school performance that are \n     distinct and easy for parents to understand); however, in \n     issuing such regulation, the Secretary may not, for example, \n     require a State to meaningfully differentiate schools using \n     an A-F grading system or other specific scoring rubric.''\n       157.

[1XXX]. FLEXIBILITY FOR EQUITABLE PER-PUPIL FUNDING\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of the program under this section \n     is to provide local educational agencies with flexibility to \n     consolidate eligible Federal funds and State and local \n     education funding in order to create a single school funding \n     system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for low-income \n     and otherwise disadvantaged students.\n       (b) Authority.--(1) In general.--The Secretary is \n     authorized to enter into local flexibility demonstration \n     agreements--\n       (A) for not more than 3 years with local educational \n     agencies that are selected under subsection (c) and submit \n     proposed agreements that meet the requirements of subsection \n     (d); and\n       (B) under which such agencies may consolidate and use funds \n     in accordance with subsection (d) in order to develop and \n     implement a school funding system based on weighted per-pupil \n     allocations for low-income and otherwise disadvantaged \n     students.\n       (2) Flexibility.--Except as described in subparagraph (J) \n     of subsection (d)(1), the Secretary is authorized to waive \n     for local educational agencies entering into agreements under \n     this section any provision of this Act that would otherwise \n     prevent such agency from using eligible Federal funds as part \n     of such agreement.\n       (c) Selection of Local Educational Agencies.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may enter into local \n     flexibility demonstration agreements with not more than 50 \n     local educational agencies with an approved application under \n     subsection (d).\n\n[[Page H8611]]\n\n       (2) Selection.--Each local educational agency shall be \n     selected based on such agency--\n       (A) submitting a proposed local flexibility demonstration \n     agreement under subsection (d);\n       (B) demonstrating that the agreement meets the requirements \n     of subsection (d); and\n       (C) agreeing to meet the continued demonstration \n     requirements under subsection (e).\n       (3) Expansion.--Beginning with the 2019-2020 academic year, \n     the Secretary may extend funding flexibility authorized under \n     this part to any local educational agency that submits and \n     has approved an application under subsection (d), so long as \n     the demonstration agreements with local educational agencies \n     described in paragraph (1) meet the requirements of \n     subsection (d)(2) and subsection (e)(1)..\n       (d) Required Terms of Local Flexibility Demonstration \n     Agreement.--\n       (1) Application.--Each local educational agency that \n     desires to participate in the program under this section \n     shall submit, at such time and in such form as the Secretary \n     may prescribe, an application to enter into a local \n     flexibility demonstration agreement with the Secretary in \n     order to develop and implement a school funding system based \n     on weighted per-pupil allocations that meets the requirements \n     of this section. The application shall include--\n       (A) a description of the school funding system based on \n     weighted per-pupil allocations, including the weights used to \n     allocate funds within the system, the local educational \n     agency's legal authority to use local and State education \n     funds consistent with this section, how the system will meet \n     the requirements under paragraph (2), and how the system will \n     support the academic achievement of students, including low-\n     income students, the lowest-achieving students, English \n     learners, and students with disabilities;\n       (B) a list of funding sources, including eligible Federal \n     funds the local educational agency will include in such \n     system;\n       (C) a description of the amount and percentage of total \n     local educational agency funding, including State, local, and \n     eligible Federal funds, that will be allocated through such \n     system;\n       (D) the per-pupil expenditures (including actual personnel \n     expenditures, including staff salary differentials for years \n     of employment, and actual nonpersonnel expenditures) of State \n     and local funds for each school served by the agency for the \n     preceding fiscal year;\n       (E) the per-pupil amount of eligible Federal funds each \n     school served by the agency, disaggregated by program, \n     received in the preceding fiscal year;\n       (F) a description of how the system will ensure that any \n     eligible Federal funds allocated through the system will meet \n     the purposes of each Federal funding stream, including \n     serving students from low-income families, English learners, \n     migratory children, and children who are neglected, \n     delinquent, or at risk, as applicable:\n       Report Language: ``It is the Conferees' intent that \n     eligible Federal funds will be used with State and local \n     education funds to meet the needs of students from low-income \n     families, English learners, migratory children, and children \n     who are neglected, delinquent, or at risk, as applicable. \n     This should not be interpreted to require that every dollar a \n     local educational agency receives under a Federal program be \n     allocated to a student who otherwise would have been \n     identified under that program, but should be interpreted to \n     require that the weighted student funding system under this \n     section will broadly serve the students and the purposes for \n     which the funding is provided.''\n       (H) an assurance that the local educational agency \n     developed and will implement the local flexibility \n     demonstration agreement in consultation with teachers, \n     principals, other school leaders, including charter school \n     leaders (in a local educational agency that has charter \n     schools), administrators of Federal programs impacted by the \n     agreement, parents, community leaders, and other relevant \n     stakeholders;\n       (I) an assurance that the local educational agency will use \n     fiscal control and sound accounting procedures that ensure \n     proper disbursement of, and accounting for, eligible Federal \n     funds consolidated and used under such system;\n       (J) an assurance that the local educational agency will \n     continue to meet the fiscal provisions in section [1118] and \n     the requirements under sections 1120 and [9501]; and\n       (K) an assurance that the local educational agency will \n     meet the requirements of all applicable Federal civil rights \n     laws in carrying out the agreement and in consolidating and \n     using funds under the agreement.``\n       (2) Requirements of system.--A local educational agency's \n     school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations \n     shall meet each of the following requirements:\n       (A) The system shall--\n       (i) except as allowed under subparagraph (B), allocate a \n     significant portion of funds, including State, local, and \n     eligible Federal funds, to the school level based on the \n     number of students in a school and a formula developed by the \n     agency under this section that determines per-pupil weighted \n     amounts; and\n       (ii) use weights or allocation amounts that allocate \n     substantially more funding to English learners and students \n     from low-income families, and students with any other \n     characteristics chosen by the local education agency, than to \n     other students; and\n       (iii) ensure that each high-poverty school received more \n     per-pupil funding, including from Federal, State, and local \n     sources, for low-income students and at least as much per-\n     pupil funding, including from Federal, State, and local \n     sources, for English learners as the school received in the \n     year prior to carrying out the pilot program.\n       (B) The system shall be used to allocate to schools a \n     significant portion, which percentage shall be agreed upon \n     during the application process and shall include all school-\n     level actual personnel expenditures for instructional staff \n     and actual nonpersonnel expenditures, of all the local \n     educational agency's local and State education funds, and \n     eligible Federal funds; and\n       (C) In establishing the percentage in subparagraph (B), the \n     district shall demonstrate that the percentage under such \n     subparagraph is sufficient to carry out the purposes of the \n     pilot and to meet each of the requirements of (d) and that \n     the percentage of local and State education funds, and \n     eligible Federal funds that are not allocated through the \n     formula does not undermine or conflict with the requirements \n     of the pilot including (d)(2)C).\n       Report Language: ``The Conferees intend that the single \n     school funding system will be used to, from the beginning, \n     allocate a significant portion of all the local educational \n     agency's local and State education funds, as well as eligible \n     Federal funds, and that this portion will continue to \n     increase over time. Reporting on how funds not allocated \n     through the system are being spent will continue to occur. \n     The Conferees intend that the negotiation between the \n     Secretary and school district to establish the initial \n     portion will be based on best practices in the field.''\n       (D) After allocating funds through the school funding \n     system, the local educational agency shall charge schools for \n     the per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local \n     funds, including actual personnel expenditures for \n     instructional staff and actual nonpersonnel expenditures.\n       (e) Continued Demonstration.--Each local educational agency \n     with an approved application under subsection (d) shall \n     annually--\n       (1) demonstrate to the Secretary that no high-poverty \n     school served by the agency received less per-pupil funding, \n     including from Federal, State, and local sources, for low-\n     income students or less per-pupil funding, including from \n     Federal, State, and local sources, for English learners than \n     the school received in the previous year;\n       (2) make public and report to the Secretary the per-pupil \n     expenditures (including actual personnel expenditures that \n     include staff salary differentials for years of employment, \n     and actual non-personnel expenditures) of State, local, and \n     Federal funds for each school served by the agency, and \n     disaggregated by student poverty quartile and by minority \n     student quartile for the preceding fiscal year; and\n       (3) make public the total number of student enrolled in \n     each school served by the agency and the number of students \n     enrolled in each such school disaggregated by each of the \n     subgroups of students, as defined in section 1111(c)(2).\n       (f) Eligible Federal Funds.--In this section, the term \n     `eligible Federal funds' means funds received by a local \n     educational agency under titles I, II, and III, Part A of IV, \n     and Part C of Title V of this Act.\n       (g) Limitations on Administrative Expenditures.--Each local \n     educational agency that has entered into a local flexibility \n     demonstration agreement with the Secretary under this section \n     may use, for administrative purposes, from eligible Federal \n     funds not more than the percentage of funds allowed for such \n     purpose under any of titles I, II, or III, Part A of Title \n     IV, or Part C of Title V.\n       (h) Peer Review.--The Secretary may establish a peer-review \n     process to assist in the review of a proposed local \n     flexibility demonstration agreement.\n       (i) Noncompliance.--The Secretary may, after providing \n     notice and an opportunity for a hearing (including the \n     opportunity to provide information as provided for in \n     subsection (j)), terminate a local flexibility demonstration \n     agreement under this section if there is evidence that the \n     local educational agency has failed to comply with the terms \n     of the agreement and the requirements under subsections (d) \n     and (e).\n       (j) Evidence.--If a local educational agency believes that \n     the Secretary's determination under subsection (i) is in \n     error for statistical or other substantive reasons, the local \n     educational agency may provide supporting evidence to the \n     Secretary, and the Secretary shall consider that evidence \n     before making a final termination determination.\n       (k) Program Evaluation.--From the amount reserved for \n     evaluation activities in section [9601], the Secretary, \n     acting through the Director of the Institute of Education \n     Sciences, shall, in consultation with the relevant program \n     office at the Department, evaluate the implementation and \n     impact of the local flexibility demonstration agreements \n     under this section, consistent with section [9601] and \n     specifically on improving the equitable distribution of State \n     and local funding and increasing student achievement.\n       (l) Renewal of Local Flexibility Demonstration Agreement.--\n     The Secretary may renew for additional 3-year terms a local \n     flexibility demonstration agreement under this section if--\n\n[[Page H8612]]\n\n       (1) the local educational agency has met the requirements \n     under subsections (d)(2) and (e) and agrees to and has a high \n     likelihood of continuing to meet such requirements; and\n       (2) the Secretary determines that renewing the local \n     flexibility demonstration agreement is in the interest of \n     students served under titles I and III, including students \n     from low-income families, English learners, migratory \n     children, and children who are neglected, delinquent, or at \n     risk.\n       (m) Definition of High-Poverty School.--In this section, \n     the term `high-poverty school' means a school that is in the \n     highest 2 quartiles of schools served by a local educational \n     agency, based on the percentage of enrolled students from \n     low-income families.''.\n       8.

Whichever of these weighting \n     systems results in the highest total weighted formula child \n     count for a local educational agency is the weighting system \n     used for that agency in the final allocation of Targeted and \n     Education Finance Incentive Grant funds.\n       (4) The Congressional Research Service has also said the \n     number weighting alternative is generally more favorable to \n     large local\n\n[[Page H8633]]\n\n     educational agencies with much larger geographic boundaries \n     and larger counts of eligible children than smaller local \n     educational agencies with smaller counts, but potentially \n     higher percentages, of eligible children, because large local \n     educational agencies have many more children in the higher \n     weighted quintiles.\n       (5) In local educational agencies that are classified by \n     the National Center for Education Statistics as ``Large \n     City'', 47 percent of all students attend schools with 75 \n     percent or higher poverty.\n       (b) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Institute of \n     Education Sciences shall complete a study on the \n     effectiveness of the four existing title I formulas to \n     deliver funds to the most economically disadvantaged \n     communities.\n       (2) Contents.--Such study shall include--\n       (A) an analysis of the distribution of title I funds under \n     the four current formulas;\n       (B) an analysis of how title I funds are distributed among \n     local educational agencies in each of the 12 locale types \n     classified by the National Center on Education Statistics.\n       (C) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or \n     unduly disadvantage any of the local educational agencies \n     described in subparagraph (B);\n       (D) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or \n     unduly disadvantage high-poverty eligible school attendance \n     areas in the local educational agencies described in \n     subparagraph (B);\n       (E) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or \n     unduly disadvantage lower population local educational \n     agencies with relatively high percentages of districtwide \n     poverty;\n       (F) the impact of number weighting and percentage weighting \n     in the formulas for distributing Targeted Grants and \n     Education Finance Incentive Grants on each of the local \n     educational agencies described in subparagraph (B);\n       (G) The impact of number weighting and percentage weighting \n     on targeting Title I-A funds to eligible school attendance \n     areas with the highest concentrations of poverty in local \n     educational agencies described in subparagraph (B), and local \n     educational agencies described in subparagraph (B) with \n     higher percentages of districtwide poverty;\n       (H) an analysis of other studies and reports produced by \n     public and non-public entities examining the distribution of \n     title I funds under the four current formulas; and\n       (I) recommendations, as appropriate, for amending or \n     consolidating the existing formulas to better target title I \n     funds to the most economically disadvantaged communities and \n     most economically disadvantaged eligible school attendance \n     areas.\n       (3) Public dissemination.--The Director of the Institute of \n     Education Sciences shall widely disseminate the findings of \n     the study conducted under this section--\n       (A) in a timely fashion;\n       (B) to--\n       (i) the public; and\n       (ii) the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate; and\n       (C) through electronic transfer and other means, such as \n     posting to the website of the Institute of Education Sciences \n     or the Department of Education.\n       22.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, on July 22, The New York Times published an \narticle titled ``Afghan Security Forces Struggle Just to Maintain \nStalemate,'' by Joseph Goldstein.\n  Mr. Goldstein writes that, because of extremely high casualty rates \nin the Afghan security forces, there is also a high desertion rate. As \na result, the Afghans are struggling to maintain adequate numbers in \ntheir security forces, meaning, it is becoming extremely difficult for \nthem to keep the Taliban at bay.\n  The article is of great concern for those of us who have watched the \nfight against the Taliban since 2001. We have lost over 2,355 men and \nwomen in Afghanistan, with 20,000 wounded, and spent over $685 billion.\n  The history of Afghanistan has shown that no outside military force \nhas ever changed it, from Alexander the Great, to the British, to the \nRussians. Yet, last year the Obama administration signed a 9-year \nagreement, committing American money and manpower in Afghanistan that \nwas not voted on by the Congress.\n  That is so ironic. We are talking about voting on this agreement with \nIran, but we did not vote to commit our troops and our money to \nAfghanistan for 9 more years.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am concerned by Mr. \nGoldstein's report. Let me give two quotes from his article about the \nability of the Afghan security forces to keep the Taliban at bay that I \nfound very, very concerning.\n  First: ``A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry . . . insisted \nthat desertions remained rare and that there had been no effort to ban \nleaves or to stop rotations away from the front to cut down on the \nnumber of people going absent without leave.''\n  The second quote: ``But interviews with soldiers and police officers \nrepeatedly countered the government's claims. One Army major said . . . \n`Once the soldiers are taken for their breaks, they are unwilling to \ncome back and join their duty.' ''\n  Once again, Mr. Speaker, the Afghan Government is untruthful and \ncorrupt. Yet, we continue to spend billions of dollars at this losing \ncause.\n  It is not fair to the taxpayers of eastern North Carolina, the \ntaxpayers of America, or anybody in this country that pays taxes that \nwe will continue to send money there to build their infrastructure and \nrebuild their roads and then to have the Taliban blow them up. It makes \nno sense.\n  I can assure President Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, that the \nUnited States House continues to spend billions of dollars on Afghan \nreconstruction so the Taliban can continue to destroy what we send over \nthere with the taxpayers' money to be built.\n  We in Congress should stop funding this rathole of a policy in \nAfghanistan, which has basically given the Afghan Government a blank \ncheck every year and will for the next 9 years.\n  History has proven that we will never change this tribal nation, and \nwe should stop trying. Instead, let's focus on fixing our economy here \nin America.\n  God bless our troops, and God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8527-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8527-H8528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RAISE THE GAS TAX ALREADY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, for the last 3 years, I have been coming \nto the floor, arguing against the folly of our attempting to pay for \n2015 infrastructure with 1993 dollars.\n  We haven't adjusted the gas tax since 1993, and that is why we \nhaven't given the American people a 6-year, robust reauthorization of \nthe surface transportation system since 1998.\n  I find myself today in complete agreement with a column by James \nSurowiecki in the current issue of The New Yorker. It is entitled \n``Raise the Gas Tax Already.''\n  He talks about how what is going on in the other body might be \nperceived as progress, might be a good thing, `` `real progress,' \nexcept for one thing: their complicated, jury-rigged plan is only\n\n[[Page H8528]]\n\nnecessary because of the continued refusal by Congress to embrace the \nobvious, economically sensible solution to highway funding, namely \nraising the gas tax. The federal gas tax is, as it should be, a key \nsource of funding for highway spending.'' Locked currently at 18.4 \ncents:\n  ``The problem is that the funding mechanisms the plan relies on are \nas gimmicky and haphazard as ever. The bill would raise money by, among \nother things, lowering the dividend rate paid to banks in the Federal \nReserve system, raising certain customs fees, increasing collection \nrates on unpaid taxes, and selling off a hundred and one million \nbarrels of oil from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.''\n  ``If you're going to have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, you should \nprobably only sell oil from it for strategic reasons, not just because \nyou want to raise some cash.''\n  ``And, from an economic perspective, paying for operating expenses by \nselling off assets is not a good way to manage your money.''\n  ``What's especially infuriating about the bill is that we already \nhave, in the gas tax, an ideal tool for raising money to pay for \nhighway repairs. It's a user tax: if you don't drive, you don't pay it, \nand if you drive less it costs you less.''\n  ``That's why even conservative economists, like Gregory Mankiw . . . \nhave been ardent advocates of gasoline taxes.''\n  ``Indeed, the refusal of Congress to raise the gas tax is the \nultimate expression of how reflexive and irrational the resistance to \ntaxes has become. Opposition to higher income taxes has some \ntheoretical justification: higher marginal rates discourage people from \nworking more and investing. Seen in one light, they're a penalty for \nsuccess. But no such argument exists against the gas tax: all it does, \nin essence, is ask drivers to pay for the roads they use. It's not even \nfair to say that keeping this tax at its current level is a check on \nbig government, since most federal highway spending now goes toward \nrebuilding and repairing roads--maintenance that even conservatives \nrecognize we must do.\n  ``Highway revenue has to be raised somehow. Congress should show some \npolitical spine, discard the Rube Goldberg funding schemes, and stop \ntreating all taxes as bad ones.''\n  I couldn't agree more with that sentiment. Indeed, we have seen six \nRepublican States already this year show some political spine. They \nhave raised the gas tax in Idaho, Utah, Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, \nand Georgia.\n  It is time for us to assume our responsibilities, to rebuild and \nrenew America, that used to have the finest infrastructure in the \nworld, but now is locked into a downward spiral.\n  Renewing and rebuilding America, giving a 6-year, robust \nreauthorization bill will put hundreds of thousands of Americans to \nwork in a matter of months all across the country, and it will make all \nour families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8528-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DRUG FREE AMERICA FOUNDATION CHAIR BETTY SEMBLER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize someone who has \nbeen described as a pioneer in national substance abuse policy and \nprevention and a woman whose dedication, drive, and compassion have \nmade the world simply a better place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Betty Sembler of St. \nPetersburg, Florida, as she retires as chair of the Drug Free America \nFoundation after nearly 15 years of dedicated leadership.\n  Mrs. Sembler has actually dedicated the past three decades of her \nlife to fighting the war on drugs. In 1976, she was 1 of 10 founding \nmembers of Straight, Inc., a nonprofit drug treatment program that \nsuccessfully treated more than 12,000 young people with drug addiction \nin eight cities nationally, from Dallas to Boston.\n  Mrs. Sembler then turned her sights to establishing a national drug \npolicy to reinforce the four critical fronts to combat drug abuse: \neducation, treatment, interdiction, and law enforcement.\n  Mrs. Sembler helped form public policy in the United States' campaign \nagainst drugs through her participation in the White House Conference \nfor a Drug Free America, as a member of the Florida Governor's Drug \nPolicy Task Force, and as a board member of DARE Florida, a national \norganization that provides drug resistance education for elementary and \nmiddle school students.\n  Mrs. Sembler has continued her campaign against weakening drug \npolicies and against legalization of drugs on an international basis. \nShe serves on the board of DARE International as vice chairperson.\n  She accompanied her husband, Mel Sembler, on both of his missions as \nUnited States ambassador, first to Australia and then to Italy.\n  Mrs. Sembler is the founder and board chair of Save Our Society from \nDrugs and the Drug Free America Foundation.\n  Both organizations work to educate people about the effects on \nindividuals, families, and communities, from legalizing and loosening \nrestrictions on drugs while also fighting to reduce drug use, drug \naddiction, and drug-related illnesses and death.\n  Mrs. Sembler serves on the boards of the Republican Jewish Coalition, \nOperation PAR in Pinellas County, the Florida Holocaust Museum, the \nFlorida Governor's Mansion Foundation, the Florida National Guard \nMultijurisdictional Counterdrug Training Advisory Board, the Jewish \nPolicy Center, and St. Petersburg's Menorah Manor.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2008, the DEA Museum Foundation presented its \nLifetime Achievement Award to Mrs. Sembler for her 30 years of \nleadership and commitment to fighting drugs.\n  The Lifetime Achievement Award is the highest honor bestowed by the \nfoundation and recognizes long and sustained commitments to supporting \nlaw enforcement, drug abuse treatment, and drug abuse education.\n  Mrs. Sembler was awarded honorary agent status by the DEA, only the \nsecond such designation to ever be given.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is Mrs. Betty Sembler and her work with \nthe Drug Free America Foundation has positively impacted lives and \nfamilies around the world and has, no doubt, saved lives around the \nworld.\n  Mrs. Sembler, with her grace, friendship, and charm, has impacted \neach and every individual that she has touched throughout her life, \nincluding this Member of Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Mrs. Betty \nSembler for her selfless years of service and for her work leading the \ncharge, pushing back against dangerous drug policies, and promoting \npublic health and public safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8528-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8528-H8529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PUERTO RICO'S DEBT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to make an introduction. This is \nthe beautiful island of Puerto Rico. We own it. It is ours. We are \nresponsible for it.\n  The Congress of the United States governs this island. It is our \ncolony, and we rule over it. It is $73 billion in debt.\n  The Supreme Court said: Puerto Rico is a territory . . . belonging to \nthe United States, but not a part of the United States.\n  And, apparently, the responsibility to govern Puerto Rico falls to \nthe Congress and not to the executive branch, because, for the last 6 \nmonths or more, I have talked with Obama administration officials at \nevery level about Puerto Rico, and their response has been that they \ncannot or will not do anything. The message I received loud and clear \nwas anything to help Puerto Rico had better happen in Congress.\n  But there is no sense of urgency in Congress or anywhere else in \nWashington for real solutions. Puerto Rico's problems are complicated.\n  I am here to say that the Puerto Rican people must begin putting \ndirect pressure on this Congress for action because Puerto Rico's \nproblems are mostly the creation of--you guessed it--Congress.\n  The Jones Act of 1917 made all Puerto Ricans citizens of the United \nStates, just in time for World War I, when 18,000 new draftees were \nneeded.\n  The Jones Act also says that Puerto Rico, unlike any State, can issue \ntriple-exempt bonds, bonds that are free\n\n[[Page H8529]]\n\nof Federal, State, and local taxes. Illinois can't do that. Neither can \nyour State.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  But Puerto Rico was specifically written out of U.S. bankruptcy laws \nby Congress. They cannot declare Chapter 9 or anything else because a \nspecial exemption was made. So Congress creates a tax-free bond haven \nand Wall Street jumps in to buy Puerto Rican debt decade after decade.\n  Puerto Rico has more than 15 times the median bond debt of all 50 \nStates, and bankruptcy is not an option without an act of Congress. And \nget this: the Puerto Rican Constitution says bondholders must be paid \nbefore anything else.\n  Right now, Wall Street is circling the wounded animal like vultures \nwaiting to get their piece; and they are fighting against a bill that \nwould allow Puerto Rico, like any other jurisdiction, to declare \nbankruptcy because that could move decisions about who gets paid and in \nwhat order they get paid into a U.S. Federal court of law.\n  You see, the current situation favors the billionaires and hedge \nfunds because they will get paid before the cops on the beat, the \ndoctors in the hospitals, and the teachers in the schools. Oh, we can't \ninvestigate that crime or take down that drug dealer because we have to \npay the bondholders on Wall Street first.\n  Now, the same people who cash in on debt in places like Greece and \nArgentina are lining up to cash in in the Caribbean by stepping up \ntheir demands for austerity measures, privatization of utilities, and \nrestructuring on their terms that will make them very, very rich at the \nexpense of the Puerto Rican people.\n  Tomorrow, I will discuss how the Puerto Rican people are being \ndistracted by the promises of statehood by every politician who travels \nto San Juan or needs the votes of Puerto Ricans in Orlando, Florida.\n  But today, I want to make clear that the sooner the people here \nrealize that the people in this Chamber are the ones who need to take \naction, the sooner we can make real progress and not get distracted by \npolitics and the pipe dreams of statehood.\n  So for my remaining minute, I want to address the people of Puerto \nRico directly in the language they speak at home around the dinner \ntable.\n  (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)\n  It is time for everyone to put political divisions aside.\n  I have talked to the Obama Administration and they will do nothing to \nhelp Puerto Rico.\n  The bond-holders are lining up to get paid even if the rest of Puerto \nRico collapses.\n  Wall Street is buying up Puerto Rican debt so that they can demand \nausterity measures, tax-breaks, and privatization of industries that \nwill fill their pockets with even more money.\n  Whatever plan is invented in Washington or on Wall Street will not \nput the needs of the Puerto Rican people first--we all know that.\n  So what is a unified Puerto Rico's plan to move forward?\n  Boricuas must step up right now so that Puerto Rico has a plan for \nthe economy that will create jobs and not just drive young people off \nof the island to the U.S. on Jet Blue.\n  The only place we can seek help is right here in Congress; we need to \nmake this Congress act.\n  I will talk more about this and the Island's the distraction of the \nstatus question tomorrow.\n  But right now I want Puerto Ricans to put their ideas together.\n  Go to my Facebook page--``Rep. Gutierrez on Facebook''--and let's \nbegin working on a plan to get Congress to act.\n  Ya es hora de que todos pongan a un lado divisiones politicas.\n  He hablado con la Administracion de Obama y ellos no van a ayudar a \nPuerto Rico.\n  Los duenos de bonos estan haciendo fila para recibir sus pagos aun \ncuando el resto de Puerto Rico se derrumba.\n  Wall Street esta comprando la deuda de Puerto Rico para poder exigir \nmedidas de austeridad, rebajes de impuestos, y la privatizacion de las \nindustrias que llenaran sus bolsillos con mas dinero.\n  Cualquiera que sea el plan de Washington o de Wall Street no pondra \nlas necesidades de la gente de Puerto Rico primero--todos sabemos eso.\n  Entonces, Cual es el plan de Puerto Rico unido para \nseguir adelante?\n  Los Boricuas deben involucrarse en este momento para que Puerto Rico \ntenga un plan de economia que pueda crear empleos y no seguir empujando \na los jovenes fuera de la isla para los Estados Unidos en Jet Blue.\n  El unico lugar donde podemos buscar ayuda es aqui en el Congreso, \ntenemos que hacer que este Congreso cumpla.\n  Voy a hablar mas sobre esto y de la distraccion de la cuestion del \nestatus de la Isla manana.\n  Pero por ahora quiero que los puertorriquenos pongan sus ideas en \nconjunto.\n  Vayan a mi pagina de Facebook--``Rep.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, since 1983, tens of \nthousands of students have participated in the Congress-Bundestag Youth \nExchange, or CBYX, program with Germany. This program allows young \nprofessionals from both the United States and Germany to spend a year \nabroad to intern and study a different culture while living with a host \nfamily.\n  During their experience, students from both countries develop a \nbetter understanding of foreign cultures and expand their knowledge and \nleadership potential exponentially. This fellowship provides extensive \nlanguage training, strong courses of study at foreign universities, and \nthe opportunity to be fully immersed in another culture, thereby \nculminating in a very unique experience.\n  Members of the German-Bundestag hold this program in especially high \nesteem as they hand select their nominees and build very strong \npersonal relationships with them. While Members of the United States \nCongress are not as involved in the selection process of American \nparticipants, the American equivalent would include the prestige that \ncongressional nominations for military academies carry.\n  Over the years, this program has shown tremendous success in \nfostering a stronger relationship between the United States and \nGermany, which is why I was particularly disappointed to see the \nDepartment of State cut its funding by half in 2015. These reductions \nof CBYX came despite Congress' continued bipartisan support over this \nprogram for decades.\n  To prevent the collapse of this program altogether, Germany \ngraciously closed the gap in 2015 by authorizing additional funds to \nnegate the funding cuts that the U.S. had implemented. However, they \nmaintained this was not something that they would be able to continue, \nand without the U.S. restoring funding, the continuation of this \nprogram was in jeopardy.\n  To further emphasize the significance of CBYX, German Chancellor \nAngela Merkel highlighted her disappointment in the funding cuts to \nPresident Obama during her visit to the United States in 2015. During \nthose deliberations, she said:\n\n       We were not pleased . . . because we very much value this \n     partnership program. And I believe that all of those who \n     participated as young people have also had unforgettable \n     experiences. Especially now, 25 years after German \n     unification, we want to continue this program. Given the fact \n     that there are no longer as many American soldiers \n     experiencing Germany as in the past, it is even more \n     important that young people learn as much as possible from \n     one another.\n\n  In fact, the State Department's own U.S. Advisory Commission on \nPublic Diplomacy countered the cutbacks during its 2014 annual report. \nIn it, the Commission is quoted as saying:\n\n       We believe that it is against our interest to invest less \n     in our relations with the German public at a critical time \n     when facing dual threats from Russia and countering violent \n     extremism in Europe, while also trying to secure the \n     Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement with \n     the European Union . . . the cutback of U.S. investment in \n     the Congress-Bundestag exchange also sends a strong message \n     to the German public and\n\n[[Page H8530]]\n\n     government that the U.S. does not value the relationship with \n     a critical ally whose public is increasingly skeptical of the \n     United States.\n\n  In response, the House German-American Caucus and those concerned \nabout the prospect of the CBYX program being placed at a disadvantage, \nvoiced our frustrations with both Secretary Kerry and our House \ncolleagues to raise awareness and demand the restoration of full \nfunding for CBYX. I was pleased that this effort amassed bipartisan \nsupport throughout the House.\n  Further, the House Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and \nRelated Agencies conveyed their concern in June 2015 by adding the \nfollowing language:\n\n       This program is integral for the continuation of a strong \n     relationship between the United States and Germany . . . the \n     committee does not support the proposed program reduction.\n\n  Ultimately, the committee included language to restore funding for \nfiscal year 2016. While this was good news, the root of the problem \nstill fell within the State Department's lack of support.\n  On July 17, 2015, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, John Emerson, \ncontacted the German Bundestag to emphasize the vital importance of \nthis program and relayed the State Department's reversal on this issue \nand their decision to restore full funding for CBYX.\n  As co-chairman of the Congressional German-American Caucus, I was \necstatic to hear this news, and I am pleased that the United States is \nholding up our end in strengthening ties with our great European ally. \nMany thanks to the nonprofit exchange organizations here in the U.S. \nwho administer CBYX, such as Cultural Vistas, AFS, Youth for \nUnderstanding, CIEE, ASSE, FLAG, and Nacel Open Door. They are \nimportant partners in the success of the CBYX program.\n  I would also like to thank my co-chair from across the aisle, \nCongressman Keating, for the great efforts he showed throughout this \nprocess as well. This is a great step forward towards continuing our \nparticipation in this program and educating our future leaders through \nsuch an important fellowship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8530-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUMMER FOOD ROCKS TOUR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on July 17, I hosted my second annual \nSummer Food Rocks Tour in my district to bring attention to the \nimportance of summer meals and USDA's Summer Food Service Program, \nwhich ensures that low-income children continue to receive nutritious \nmeals when school is not in session.\n  I was honored to be joined on the tour by USDA Under Secretary for \nFood, Nutrition, and Consumer Services Kevin Concannon, as well as many \nlocal, State, Federal, and nonprofit partners.\n  Mr. Speaker, for millions of low-income students, summer break isn't \nas carefree as it should be. For these children, summer is a time of \ngreat uncertainty. During the school year, they have access to \nreliable, healthy school breakfasts and school lunches, but when school \nis out, these children and their families are often left scrambling to \nfind enough to eat.\n  According to Share Our Strength, a leading national partner on summer \nmeals, 43 percent of low-income families say it is harder to make ends \nmeet during the summer, and they must budget an extra $300 a month for \ngroceries when kids are home from school in the summer. For families \nalready struggling to put food on the table, these can be daunting \nchallenges.\n  Summer should not be a time of increased hunger among our children. \nThat is where USDA's Summer Food Service Program comes in. It is a \nfederally funded, State-administered program that reimburses providers \nwho serve healthy meals to children and teens in low-income areas at no \ncharge during the summer. Local sponsors serve meals at community sites \non set days and times. Sites may be located in a variety of settings, \nsuch as schools, recreation centers, parks, community centers, day \ncamps, housing projects, and Indian reservations.\n  My Summer Food Rocks Tour began at Koziol Elementary School in Ware, \nMassachusetts. We had the opportunity to serve breakfast and speak with \nkids and their families about the importance of summer meals, and Share \nOur Strength was there to distribute sunglasses to the children, which \nthey all loved.\n  Our next stop was Fisher Hill Elementary School in Orange, \nMassachusetts. There, we met with children attending day camp at a \nschool who receive breakfast through the summer meals program. We got a \nchance to play basketball with the kids. The kids were definitely \nbetter than us.\n  Then we were off to the Spanish American Center in Leominster, \nMassachusetts, where we were hosted by the center's executive director, \nNeddy Latimer. We participated in a roundtable discussion on the \nsuccesses and challenges of the summer meals program. We then had the \nopportunity to tour the center's newly constructed kitchen and serve \nlunch to an enthusiastic group of children.\n  Our day ended at the Goddard School in my hometown of Worcester. \nUnder Secretary Concannon led a roundtable discussion on national \nstandards for the school lunch program. During the discussion, we were \ntreated to a delicious lunch prepared by the Worcester Public Schools \nNutrition Department.\n  We wrapped up our visit by touring two Worcester Public Schools food \ntrucks and learning more about this innovative mobile meals program \nthat runs throughout the city.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone who joined me and my Summer \nFood Rocks Tour, especially Under Secretary Concannon, the site \nsponsors and volunteers, and the children and families who reminded me \nof why summer meals are so really important.\n  A child's need for healthy, nutritious food doesn't just end when the \nschool year does. We know that providing children access to healthy \nmeals in the summer months has clear health, education, and economic \nbenefits; and since summer meals must be served in a community setting, \nchildren have another incentive to participate in summer enrichment and \nrecreation programs that, in turn, help them return to school ready to \nlearn in the fall.\n  This summer, USDA plans to serve more than 200 million free meals to \nchildren 18 years and under at approved summer meals sites. I have no \ndoubt that they will achieve this ambitious goal.\n  But there is still a lot of work to be done. USDA estimates that only \none out of six students that gets a free or reduced price school meal \nduring the school year receives a summer meal. As we consider the next \nChild Nutrition Reauthorization bill, we need to make sure that all \nstudents who are eligible for school meals have access to free summer \nmeals and that States and local communities have the funding and \nresources they need to reach all eligible children.\n  An easy way to find a summer meals site near you is to text FOOD to \n877-877, or visit USDA's Summer Food Rocks page online.\n  Over August recess, I encourage all of my colleagues to visit a \nsummer meals site in your district. I know that you will be just as \nimpressed as I was at the incredible work being done right in your own \ncommunity to ensure that no child goes hungry in the summer.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can and we should do more to end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8530-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8530-H8531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                        OUT-OF-CONTROL SPENDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Byrne) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to talk about one of the \nbiggest problems facing our Nation, out-of-control spending.\n  At this very moment, the national debt sits at over $18 trillion. We \nhave not arrived at this point because of the actions of one party or \nof one administration. Over the years, both parties have enacted \nprograms that have increased our debt.\n  That said, we have reached a point at which we must get serious about \nreining in our out-of-control spending, or we may fall victim to a \nsimilar fate that many nations throughout history have experienced.\n\n[[Page H8531]]\n\n  Here in the U.S., our spending problems are reaching a crisis level, \nand we are effectively leaving behind a catastrophe for the next \ngeneration. The basis of the American Dream is that, if you work hard, \nyou can leave behind a better future for your children and \ngrandchildren. That fundamentally American vision is in jeopardy due, \nin part, to our irresponsible spending.\n  I am a new and very proud grandfather. My grandson, MacGuire, is \nabout to turn 1, and already, his share of the national debt before his \nfirst birthday is over $40,000. We cannot turn a blind eye to this \nproblem and pretend that it will just get better. Let me explain why.\n  There are two basic forms of Federal spending, mandatory spending and \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Mr. Speaker, when most people think of the Federal Government, they \nare probably thinking about discretionary programs, which is money that \ngoes to things like our military, highways, national parks, \nagriculture, and medical research.\n  The good thing about discretionary spending is that, each year, \nCongress has the ability to control these spending levels through the \nappropriations process. Since Republicans took control of the House in \n2010, we have had some success in cutting funding to various Federal \nagencies. For example, agencies like the IRS and the EPA have seen \ntheir budgets cut in response to egregious executive overreach.\n  While it may seem like it covers the majority of government \noperations, discretionary spending actually only makes up about one-\nthird of all Federal spending.\n  The other portion of spending is what we call mandatory spending. \nThis, along with the interest on the national debt, makes up almost \ntwo-thirds of all Federal spending.\n  Now, here is the really bad part about mandatory spending: it is on \nautopilot. Unlike discretionary spending, mandatory spending does not \nrequire annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, as long as \nsomeone meets the requirements, these programs dole out money without \nany action from Congress. Within these mandatory spending programs are \nwhat we call ``means-based entitlement programs,'' including things \nlike Medicaid, ObamaCare, food stamps, welfare, and the like.\n  For example, in fiscal year 2012, the Federal Government spent almost \n$800 billion on over 92 programs that were aimed at lifting Americans \nout of poverty. Despite that record spending, too many Americans simply \nstopped looking for work. The system is failing the very people it was \ndesigned to help.\n  While many of these means-based entitlement programs have good \nintentions, they aren't supposed to be permanent. These programs were \ncreated to help lift people out of poverty, not to keep them there. \nThat is why it shouldn't be a surprise that, during the recent economic \ndownturn, spending on these means-based entitlement programs ballooned.\n  What is surprising, however, is that, as the economy has improved, \nthe spending on these programs has not gone down. In fact, the spending \non some of these programs remains at alltime highs.\n  Now, Republicans and Democrats both agree that Americans shouldn't be \nstuck in poverty, and that is why we should put party politics aside \nand come together to address this dangerous cycle of government \ndependence.\n  We need to reform these means-based programs to put a real focus on \nworkforce training to help connect Americans with the skills they need \nto get good-paying jobs that meet workforce demands.\n  We could block grant, through the appropriations process, money to \nState governments and allow them to craft poverty fighting programs \nbased on each State's specific societal programs and economic needs.\n  I know that reforming these mandatory spending programs won't be \neasy, but I didn't run for Congress to come here and make easy \ndecisions. I doubt my colleagues did either.\n  Before I leave this body, I want to be able to look at my grandson, \nMacGuire, and know that I have been part of a real effort to rein in \nspending and put our Nation on a fiscally stable path for the next \ngeneration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to join me in addressing our \nNation's spending crisis. Let's come together and make the tough \nchoices. Let's get our spending under control, and let's leave behind a \nbetter America for the next generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8531-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Clark) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a \ncommon medical condition that is too often masked by silence and \nstigma. It affects more women than diabetes or stroke or breast cancer. \nIt is postpartum depression.\n  Here are some words from women who have suffered from postpartum \ndepression.\n  From Maria: I was experiencing anger and rage, and I had suicidal \nthoughts. ``I don't know what's wrong, but I can't take care of the \nbaby, and I'm miserable all of the time.''\n  From Jodi: My son was sick again, and I was crying so hard I could \nbarely text my mom to have her come over immediately. I waited \nanxiously at the door, with a screaming, ill child, and greeted her by \nhanding over my son, saying, ``I can't do this anymore.''\n  From Heather: Soon after the birth of my son, I knew something was \nwrong with me. I couldn't fall asleep, or if I did, I couldn't sleep \nfor long. I also couldn't eat. I forced down every bite of food, and I \nspent most of my time crying.\n  These women are not alone. In 2013, there were more than 3.9 million \nlive births in the United States, and of these births, one out of every \nseven mothers was affected by postpartum depression.\n  Women suffering from maternal depression often report overwhelming \nand isolating feelings of sadness, anxiety, fear, and guilt. This can \ninclude strong feelings of anger, thoughts of death or suicide, and \neven negative feelings towards their babies.\n  The children of mothers with postpartum depression can become \nwithdrawn, have behavioral problems, and have a higher risk of anxiety \ndisorders, depression, and toxic stress.\n  Even though this condition affects hundreds of thousands a year, many \ndo not seek medical help. Many moms report that they are too \nembarrassed to admit their feelings or are worried they might be seen \nas failing or as being bad moms. It doesn't have to be this way. The \ngood news is that treatment works. Ninety percent of women who are \ngoing through postpartum depression can be treated effectively.\n  That is why I am introducing a bill with Representative Costello to \nmake sure new moms are not on their own when it comes to dealing with \npostpartum depression. The Bringing Postpartum Depression Out of the \nShadows Act will offer grants to States to screen and treat new and \nexpecting moms for maternal depression.\n  States and professional groups have made great progress, and we need \nto support them as they move to increase awareness and consolidate \nresources. We need to help doctors recognize the signs of postpartum \ndepression and provide access to appropriate treatment.\n  This is commonsense legislation to help the over 400,000 women \nannually who suffer from maternal depression. We need to stand up and \ntell moms they are not alone. Needing help does not make them bad \nmothers, and help is out there, but we need to make sure those who need \nit can get it.\n  I ask my colleagues to cosponsor our legislation and take this \nconcrete step towards supporting healthy moms and healthy babies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8531-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8531-H8532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FAILING VA MEDICAL CENTER RECOVERY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Mrs. Roby) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, it has been almost a year since the director \nof the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System was fired after \nnumerous reports of mismanagement and malfeasance surfaced--the missing \npatient x rays, the falsified records, the employee who took a veteran \nto a crackhouse, and the utter lack of discipline and order.\n\n[[Page H8532]]\n\n  The removal was possible under new authority granted under the VA \nreform law that we passed last year, and I was hopeful that this action \nwas indicative of a new VA leadership that finally got it, that was \nwilling to cut through the bureaucracy and make the decisions necessary \nto turn around failing medical centers.\n  I did hear a lot of nice promises--commitments to work through the \nsystem to make sure that the problems were fixed--but, Mr. Speaker, the \nproblems were not fixed.\n  Communication and coordination between various levels of management \nare still badly out of sync at a time when we can least afford it. It \nseems like, every time I think we are in a position to make real \nprogress in central Alabama, something falls through the cracks, the \nball gets dropped, an opportunity is missed. Every time, the VA \nleadership can point to the various layers of bureaucracy for why these \nproblems exist--promises, excuses--but not action.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe the problem is that we have been depending on \na broken bureaucracy to fix itself. I believe the problem is that we \nhave been asking the VA leaders to intervene in this troubled system \nrather than requiring them to. I believe it is time to change that by \nbreaking through the bureaucracy to get results on behalf of our \nprecious veterans.\n  What happens when a public school continues to fail to meet basic \nstandards? The State Department of Education steps in to take over, and \nit takes charge of turning the place around.\n  It is a process that isn't pleasant, but everyone from principals and \nteachers to students and parents understand the consequences of the \nfailure to improve. I believe we need a similar mechanism at the VA \nwhen medical centers continuously fail our veterans.\n  Today, I am filing legislation to compel the Department of Veterans \nAffairs officials to intervene and take over failing VA medical \ncenters. It is called the Failing VA Medical Center Recovery Act.\n  It offers the VA new tools to turn around the worst of our healthcare \ncenters, and it puts the responsibility for doing so squarely on the \nSecretary of the VA. The VA needs a team of leaders who is equipped \nwith the expertise to identify solutions and the authority to execute \nthem.\n  Under my bill, the VA will recruit teams of the best managers and \nmedical professionals who can rapidly deploy to failing medical centers \nto take over and take charge. These takeover teams would be managed \nthrough the newly authorized office of failing medical centers and \nwould have the new legal tools needed to make a difference at each \nlocation.\n  This is an antibureaucracy bill. This is the team that no complacent \nVA employees want to see coming because they know that the status quo \nis about to get shaken up.\n  Just like a failing school, this can serve as a motivation to keep \nperformance from dropping off. Also very important is that the \ndetermination of a failing medical center will be based on data, not on \nthe Secretary's whim or what media attention it is garnering. My bill \nsets up an automatic trigger that compels the VA to act under the law.\n  I am glad the Secretary used his authority to take control of the \nsituation in Phoenix--but why not Montgomery?

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Coffman) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I stand in recognition of the late \nMajor General Andrew Cooley, a dear friend and a tremendous patriot who \ndedicated his life to serving our great Nation.\n  A true leader and a combat veteran, he faithfully served for 38 \nyears, leading from the front and accomplishing much along the way. His \ncareer was marked by several tours of duty at home and abroad, \nincluding the command of an Army division, and he participated in \ncombat operations in Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, \nand Angola.\n  In 1951, General Cooley enlisted in the United States Army at the age \nof 17, and he went on to receive his commission after having \nsuccessfully completed Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, \nGeorgia, in 1955, as a second lieutenant.\n  Over the course of his career, he served in various staff and command \npositions, including as the principal representative of the Department \nof Defense to the Lebanese-Israeli negotiations and as commanding \ngeneral of the 24th Infantry Division.\n  Upon retirement from the Army, General Cooley was instrumental in \ninstituting a forward-focused, logistical infrastructure that remains \ninstrumental to our Nation's defense.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Without a doubt, General Cooley's many accomplishments deserve to be \nhonored. However, his accomplishments could only be realized with the \nsupport and commitment of his wife of 57 years, Joan, and their two \nchildren, Cathleen and Caroline.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today humbled by the many accomplishments \nof a true patriot. It is my great honor to recognize the late Major \nGeneral Andrew Cooley for his friendship and his service to our great \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8532-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8532-H8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNRESTRICTED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, just this past week a Federal district \ncourt in California found that facilities built to hold illegal \nimmigrants while immigration officials determine whether their asylum \nclaims are valid or not were not properly operated and ordered the \nrelease of thousands of illegal immigrants within 90 days.\n  The lawsuit alleged that, despite the fact that detention centers \nprovide schooling for underage detainees, they still believe the \nfacilities are insufficiently hospitable.\n  Despite brand-new facilities built to address the present surge in \nillegal immigration last year, advocates of illegal immigration will \nuse any avenue to expand and promote policies that entice immigrants to \nmake dangerous journeys and put themselves under the influence of \nsmugglers and human traffickers.\n  The ruling gave the government until August 3 to submit a plan for \nreleasing the illegal immigrants within 90 days.\n  Of course, the Department of Justice's own data tells us that what \nwill happen when these illegal immigrants are released is fully 85 \npercent will never show up for their immigration court hearings.\n  The end result of this lawsuit will simply be the release of \nthousands of illegal immigrants who have not been vetted for criminal \nbackgrounds, outstanding warrants, or any other characteristics that \nshould prevent the release into our society.\n  The situation raises a number of questions: Why did illegal \nimmigration advocates file a lawsuit in California rather than in \nTexas, where these detention facilities are located? We know why.\n  California is the lawsuit capital of the world and the home of courts \nlike the Ninth Circuit, which most times is overturned, many times \noverturned at higher levels of court. They figure they could get a \nloose deal in California on immigration.\n\n[[Page H8533]]\n\n  Why did these illegal immigration advocates file a lawsuit knowing \nfull well that the administration intends to release any detainees who \nprovide a credible asylum request?\n  Is even the most cursory review of illegal immigrants to determine \nwhether they are dangerous to Americans too much for these attorneys?\n  Will this administration appeal or does this ruling simply support \ntheir goal of unrestricted immigration and policies which ensure that \nthe vast majority of illegal immigrants who are detained are released \ninto our country almost immediately?\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe we already know the answer to these questions. \nBoth the Obama administration and the lawyers who file these frivolous \nsuits have but one interest: continued unrestricted illegal immigration \nthat places both Americans and immigrants in danger and makes a farce \nof our rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8533-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDY WATERS RETIREMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Woodall) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I come often to this floor to talk about \ncommunity and service and the notion that, if we work to put a little \nless emphasis on figuring out how to control people from Washington, \nD.C., and a little more emphasis on trying to serve one another back \nhome in our communities, that America will be moved in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come today to have that same discussion and to put a \nface on that conversation. For me, in north Georgia, Mr. Speaker, that \nface is Judy Waters.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 1979, Judy Waters was known as the best hairdresser \nin all of Snellville. By the end of 1979, she was known as the first \nfemale ever elected to the Snellville City Council, and her path of \nservice continued from there.\n  Mr. Speaker, for more than a decade, as Snellville grew into the \nfirst suburban-from-rural community in Gwinnett County, Judy helped to \nnavigate those challenges. Her fingerprints are on absolutely \neverything that you see in the foundation that has allowed Snellville \nto become what it is today.\n  Mr. Speaker, after serving the City of Snellville, seeing that our \ncounty was going through some of those same challenges, in 1992, Judy \nanswered the call to serve Gwinnett County.\n  She ran for the District 3 county commissioner seat and was sworn in \nin 1993 to that post. Over the 8 years that she served, Gwinnett \nCounty's population almost doubled to 600,000 people and her hand \nhelped to guide that development.\n  Mr. Speaker, our motto in Gwinnett County is ``Gwinnett is great,'' \nand Judy's emphasis on ensuring that that was true absolutely every \nsingle day earned her the love and devotion of an entire community.\n  But her service does not either begin or end with these kinds of \npublic roles, Mr. Speaker.\n  In 1992, she ran for that post. But, in 2004, she answered the call \nto serve the Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia. Mr. Speaker, \nthe motto of the Community Foundation of Northeast Georgia is \n``Connecting people who care with causes that matter.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this foundation, under Judy's leadership, grew its \nassets by more than $20 million. It has plowed back into service \nprojects in our community more than $52 million since 1985.\n  Thousands upon thousands of lives in Gwinnett County have been \nimpacted in no small part due to the love, devotion, and commitment of \nJudy Waters.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my belief that all of the individual deeds we see \nin our lives are woven together to make us more than who we are.\n  Judy set out early in her life to make sure that no one would be \ngiving back more than she did, and she exemplifies exactly the kind of \nperson that I am surrounded by in my community absolutely every single \nday.\n  People ask, Mr. Speaker: How can you give away Washington's power and \ninfluence and return that to the community? My answer is Judy Waters.\n  Mr. Speaker, no matter how well-intentioned the folks in this \nbuilding are, they will never care more about my community than folks \nlike Judy Waters do, and Judy lived that commitment every single day.\n  Mr. Speaker, Judy retires from her service at the Community \nFoundation. Her official retirement is August 22. I want to add my \nheartfelt thanks to her for her decade upon decade upon decade of \nservice.\n  Judy, we are all better off and grateful for all that you have done \nfor our community.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, we are all better off and grateful just for the \nopportunity to have known her.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no measurement of how many Judy Waters there \nare out there across the country, but there is a measure of what Judy \nWaters has done for our community.\n  You see it in the faces of the elderly and you see it in young \nfamilies and you see it in the children in our community systems.\n  Thank you to Judy Waters for all that she has done for Gwinnett \nCounty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8533-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PRATT & WHITNEY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, next week marks the 90th birthday of a \ngreat American business, Pratt & Whitney.\n  It all started with just 26 employees and 12 machines in an old car \nplant in Hartford, Connecticut. Nine decades later, Pratt & Whitney \nemploys more than 9,000 people in Connecticut and ranks among my \nState's biggest employers.\n  Planes with Pratt & Whitney engines carried Charles Lindbergh across \nAmerica, Amelia Earhart over the Atlantic, and Wiley Post around the \nworld.\n  During World War II, the company powered half the U.S. aerial fleet. \nLater, Pratt & Whitney led the world in developing jet engines for \niconic aircraft like the B-52, the Blackbird, and the Boeing 747. Its \ntechnology even helped power the Apollo 11 Moon lander.\n  This tradition of excellence continues today. Pratt & Whitney engines \nbuilt in my district provide the beating heart of the F-35 Lightning \nII. The company remains a key player in an industry that helps to \nsafeguard our national security.\n  It is my honor to congratulate Pratt & Whitney on 90 years of \nachievement. We thank you. To the men and women who work at Pratt & \nWhitney, we say again thank you for your service to our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8533-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

That is totally fine. \nJournalists exercising their First Amendment rights to expose illegal \nand gruesome activities? The government must intervene.\n  Under Federal law and California State law, the sale or purchase of \nhuman fetal tissue is a Federal felony that carries a fine of up to \n$500,000, a number still less than the annual salary of Planned \nParenthood's president.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are unborn babies we are talking about. At the \nvery least, we need to put a stop to this organization until we can \ninvestigate fully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8534-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING PRATT & WHITNEY\n\n  (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. PINGREE.

Mr. Speaker, last week, I joined 64 of my House colleagues \nin cosponsoring legislation that would permanently cut off taxpayer \nfunding for abortion providers.\n  H.R. 3197, the Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act, would prohibit \nFederal funding to any entity unless it certifies that it will not \nperform abortions during the period for which funding is provided, and \nit will not provide any funds to entities that do perform abortions.\n  There are currently restrictions that prohibit the use of taxpayer \ndollars to fund elective abortion directly, but we all understand that \nmoney is fungible. It is clear that Federal funds are supporting \norganizations' entire operations and that those operations include \nperforming elective abortions.\n  This legislation reflects the will of the American people and would \nprevent taxpayers from being forced to finance thousands of elective \nabortions.\n  Few things demean the sanctity of human life more than elective \nabortion, and we, as a Nation and as a Congress, must continue to \nconfront the systematic extermination of an entire generation of the \nmost vulnerable among us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will enter into the Record a recent article by Charles \nKrauthammer: ``The Price of Fetal Parts.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8534-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE.

Since then, despite \nsome commitments right at that moment, since then, Republican \nleadership has refused to allow a strengthened Voting Rights Act to \ncome to the floor.\n  Instead of working to ensure that every American has the right to \nvote, we have seen more efforts to suppress votes, disenfranchising \nhard-working Americans; yet on the floor, we have had, at the same \ntime, our entire appropriations process held up because of the fear of \nthe Republicans that they may have to cast a vote on whether or not we \nshould display the Confederate battle flag in the year 2015.\n  We can't get a Voting Rights Act bill to the floor, but our entire \nappropriations process is held up over the Confederate battle flag--\nseriously?

That is nonsense.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can't imagine telling Latinos who rely on Medicare--\nhalf of them have incomes below $14,000--that we need to phase out \ntheir health care.\n  I am extremely proud to have fought for the Medicaid expansion in my \nhome State of Arizona, and I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues here in Congress to protect and improve Medicaid and \nMedicare for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8535-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRATT & WHITNEY 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. WOMACK.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am outraged that \ngovernment agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have \ndenied public participation to allow consumers and businessowners to \ncomment on regulations that directly impact them.\n  In 2013, the CFPB implemented guidance that would prevent families \nand individuals from obtaining auto financing discounts. This guidance \nnot only affects the American auto industry and the hundreds of hard \nworking auto dealers in the Granite State, but it also affects Granite \nState families and individuals--for example, the young couple in \nManchester who is struggling to afford a new minivan to accommodate a \ngrowing family or, for example, the startup logistics company in Conway \nthat is wishing to add another truck to its fleet to grow its business.\n  Congress created the CFPB to protect consumers, not to hurt them. If \nthe CFPB really cares about developing policies that are truly in the \nbest interests of consumers, it should amend its guidance and be more \ntransparent.\n  That is why I introduced H.R. 1737, a bipartisan bill to rein in the \nCFPB's overreach and to merely bring more transparency, accountability, \nand clarity to the formal rulemaking process. H.R. 1737 will reverse \nthis misguided CFPB indirect auto financing guidance and will allow the \npublic's voice to be heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8536-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE EX-IM SAGA CONTINUES\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

They are helping their \nsmall businesses while ours are disadvantaged.\n  This body has also failed to act to increase the lending limits for \nthe Small Business Administration. Without an increase, the 7(a) Loan \nProgram will be suspended until the beginning of the next fiscal year, \nOctober 1; and the highway trust fund is set to expire, bringing vital \nconstruction work and jobs to a halt.\n  Mr. Speaker, if this body doesn't get to work, then we are going to \nneedlessly hurt hundreds of thousands of American jobs.

Mr. Speaker, in 2004, Raechel and Jacqueline Houck were \ntragically killed in California when their rented Chrysler PT Cruiser \ncrashed and caught fire due to a safety defect that was under recall.\n  A glaring safety gap in current law allows recalled cars to be rented \nwithout being repaired, which is why I have introduced H.R. 2198, the \nRaechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act, so as to close this \ngap and prohibit the renting of vehicles that are subject to safety \nrecalls.\n  The bill is supported by all major car rental companies and consumer \nsafety groups as well as by General Motors and Honda, yet Chrysler and \nFord continue to oppose this bill for unclear reasons. Chrysler's \nopposition is particularly troubling considering this week's \nannouncement that NHTSA is imposing a record $105 million fine and \nvehicle buyback requirement on Chrysler for its failure to adequately \nfix recalled vehicles or to notify vehicle owners in a timely manner.\n  While H.R. 2198 wouldn't solve all of Chrysler's recall problems, it \nwould at least ensure that American families who rent Chryslers this \nsummer will know they are safe. This is a commonsense idea.

Yesterday we had a moment \nof silence to convey our respect and our prayers.\n  But, as a House, we must break the silence because once again we have \nfailed the American people with our broken mental health system.

We cannot be silent anymore.\n  The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646, provides \ntreatment before tragedy through comprehensive reforms.\n  Let not our offer of comfort be mere silence, but let it move us to \ncomprehensive action. Otherwise, our passivity makes us partners to \nthese tragedies.\n  I urge our Nation to not be silent, but to speak up.

Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to \ndirect the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to \nfund the purchase, installation, and activation of an early warning \nsystem on the Cascadia subduction zone off the Pacific Northwest.\n  The Cascadia fault has the prospect of unleashing a quake at any \npoint that actually could exceed that off of Japan. As we know, in \nJapan, 15,000 people died, $300 billion in damages. In Oregon, our \nState expects thousands of deaths, $32 billion in infrastructure.\n  If the United States of America would deploy, like Japan and other \ncountries are doing, an early warning system, thousands of lives could \nbe saved.\n  Inland we could evacuate schools that are going to collapse. Up in \nPortland they could suspend the MAX service and get people off the \nbridges that are going to collapse. Manufacturing operations that are \ncritical could be suspended.\n  We have the potential to save thousands of lives, tens of millions, \nbillions, of dollars in excess damages, and it would just require the \nUnited States of America to do what other countries are doing: deploy \nan early warning system off the Pacific coast.\n  The technology is known. We just lack the will to fund it. So I am \ndirecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy such a \nsystem in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8538-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8538-H8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PRATT & WHITNEY\n\n  (Mr. WESTMORELAND asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND.

Even today the power behind \nLockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II aircraft comes from a Pratt & \nWhitney engine.\n  I am proud that Pratt & Whitney's engine center calls Columbus, \nGeorgia, home, but more proud of the investment they have made in the \ncommunity. The Columbus plant employs 1,026 highly skilled employees to \nrefurbish jet engines and brings in over $750 million a year.\n  I have no doubt that Pratt & Whitney's impressive accomplishments and \nmilestones will continue on for another 90 years. Their commitment to \nproducing high-quality and dependable engines help keep our servicemen \nand -women in the air safe.\n  We are fortunate to have their support for our local economy and look \nforward to many more years of their business in our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H8539-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THREE WORTHWHILE OBJECTIVES\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER.

Sixty-five Members of the United States Senate voted to \nkeep the Ex-Im Bank in business for America and for American jobs.\n  There are, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, at least 240 votes on this \nfloor to pass the Fincher amendment, which is the Kirk-Heitkamp \namendment in the Senate.\n  Let's do it. Let this House work its will. Let's keep America \ncompetitive with the rest of the world.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule \nforward on behalf of the Committee on Rules. This rule provides for a \nrobust amendment debate on an issue of critical national importance. \nThis rule provides for the consideration of H.R.\n\n[[Page H8540]]\n\n427, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of \n2015.\n  The Committee on Rules met on this measure yesterday evening and \nheard testimony from both the chairman and the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, in addition to receiving amendment \ntestimony.\n  This rule brought forward by the committee is a structured rule. \nThere were 18 amendments total submitted to the Committee on Rules. Of \nthose submitted, I am pleased to say that the full House will debate \nand vote on 10 of those amendments.\n  This legislation also went through regular order in the committee. \nDuring the committee markup, eight amendments were debated and voted \non, including one I offered and that the committee had actually agreed \nto.\n  This rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary. I appreciate the hard work of the Committee on the Judiciary \nChairman, Bob Goodlatte, and his full committee and subcommittee staff \nin bringing forward H.R. 427.\n  I strongly support this rule and the underlying legislation because, \nwhen we reform our Nation's regulatory system, we will jump-start the \nengine of our economy; and when our economy gets up and going, our \nfamilies flourish.\n  What does this administration produce more than 60 of every day? Here \nis a hint: It is not jobs. The answer lies in the heart of many woes \nfacing small businesses and established industries.\n  What they produce every day is regulations. The goal of any \nregulation should be to achieve a benefit that would not be possible \nwithout it, designed in such a fashion that the achieved benefit far \noutweighs the cost, but our administration has lost sight of this goal, \nand America's economic engine is paying the price.\n  Our current Federal Government designs regulations that are often \nunnecessary and achieve little to no benefit, but at very high cost. \nThe rules have become so skewed that this administration's regulators \nare at war with American businesses.\n  Industries such as manufacturing and technology are fighting to \ncompete in a global market, but first, they must survive the regulatory \nbeast that is strangling innovation and growth.\n  This administration is legislating through regulation yet decries the \nREINS Act and calls it an unprecedented requirement. When you \ncircumvent Congress and exploit the rulemaking process in order to, \none, make law and, two, make law in contradiction to the wishes and \nneeds of the American people, you should expect unprecedented \nresponses.\n  In just the first 7 days of 2015--just the first 7 days of 2015--the \nadministration unveiled 300 new rules. Over the Memorial Day weekend, \nthe administration quietly published the spring 2015 Unified Agenda of \nFederal Regulations. What it contained was so disheartening to the \nAmerican people and so destructive to small business that it didn't go \nunnoticed.\n  The agenda showed that the Federal departments and agencies have \n3,260 rules in the midst right now of the rulemaking process. \nUnfortunately, it is not just the sheer number of regulations that is \nastounding; it is also the oppressive cost.\n  One of these 3,260 rules I mentioned is predicted to be one of the \ncostliest regulations ever put forward, the EPA's national ozone \nstandard. A recent analysis found the cost of this one regulation to be \nupwards of $140 billion. It will cost my home State of Georgia over \n11,000 jobs.\n  To add insult to injury, the first line of H.R. 427 Statement of \nAdministration Policy states:\n\n       The administration is committed to ensuring that \n     regulations are smart and effective and tailored to further \n     the statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient \n     manner.\n\n  This is the statement from the administration on why they oppose H.R. \n427.\n  I cannot believe that a single regulation promulgated by this \nadministration with $140 billion of cost was put forward in the most \ncost-effective manner, and a regulation costing 11,000 jobs in Georgia \nalone is hardly smart. The Statement of Administration Policy also \nclaims that the underlying legislation would create business \nuncertainty.\n  I encourage this administration to use the infamous pen and phone to \nactually ask businesses what creates uncertainty for them because, when \nsmall businesses across the country came to Congress last week as part \nof National Federation of Independent Business lobbying day, their top \nlegislative priority was regulatory relief. These are small-business \nowners who sat with us and said: Here is what we are facing in trying \nto get people jobs.\n  The 3,000-plus regulations in the works by this administration create \nthe uncertainty, not this body's effort to require agencies to submit \nthe most costly regulations to Congress for approval. The underlying \nbill applies only to regulations with a $100 million impact or greater.\n  The American people do not elect this administration's regulators--or \nany administration's regulators for that matter. They elect us in this \nbody to represent them. This bill allows us to do so properly.\n  The system is broken. The system has failed the American people. The \nREINS Act is the first step toward restoring proper order and even \nsanity toward our regulatory framework.\n  The administration states that Executive Order No. 13563 requires \ncareful cost-benefit analysis, but they don't explain why only 7 rules \nout of the thousands had cost-benefit analysis in 2013 and only 14 \nrules had that in 2012.\n  This administration's regulators have stated publicly that they are \nnot going to sit around and wait for Congress--so much for respecting \nthe powers enshrined in our Constitution and, thus, the reason that we \nneed this legislation and why this rule should be approved.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nyielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate, and I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, 2 legislative days--really a day-and-a-half now--remain \nbefore Congress recesses for 5 weeks. Here we are, yet again, \nconsidering a piece of partisan legislation designed to fill up floor \ntime, which has little to no chance at all of becoming law.\n  It is unconscionable that the majority continues to waste \nlegislators' and the American people's time with bills such as the \nRegulation from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act--they really do \nname things nice around here, the REINS Act--when critically important \nwork is left to be done.\n  Just a few moments ago, the minority whip spoke to three issues; I \ninclude them in my commentary, but largely, one that all of us ought be \ninterested in is the highway trust fund, which will become insolvent on \nAugust 1 if those of us sent here to Washington to govern do not come \nup with a solution.\n  Instead of focusing on priorities like eliminating corporate tax \nloopholes to ensure that we have the money to fund projects to repair \nour Nation's deteriorating roads and bridges, House Republicans passed \nyet another short-term patch that the Senate has refused to take up. \nThe majority's dysfunction and inability to govern is having a real \nimpact on hard-working Americans.\n  Today marks the 204th day of the Republican-led 114th Congress. In \nthe nearly 6 months that have passed, the majority has compromised the \nfinancial security of American companies by failing to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank's charter; avoided passing a long-term \ntransportation and infrastructure bill; passed pointless legislation \ndesigned to cut critical funding from local police departments and \ncommunities in lieu of taking up comprehensive immigration reform; \nrefused, they did, to bring up the student loan refinancing bill; and \nperhaps most abhorrent to some of us, voted four times in support of \nthe Confederate battle flag, a symbol of hate and intolerance that has \nno place on any of our public lands.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The days leading up to a month-long congressional recess should be \nspent debating and voting on the important issues that our constituents \nsent us here to address--as an example, restoring the Voting Rights \nAct, bolstering our economy through a long-term highway bill, and \nguaranteeing that jobs are created and sustained.\n\n[[Page H8541]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 427 is yet another partisan measure that Republican \nleadership has selected for consideration, despite its clear \nconstitutional violations and with the knowledge that it stands an \nalmost certain Presidential veto.\n  It is, therefore, unclear to me why we are spending precious time on \nthis bill. We already have the power to disapprove proposed rules; we \nhave the power to limit delegations of authorities to agencies; we have \nthe power to control the appropriations; and we have the power to stay \nthe effect of specific rules and hold oversight hearings. It seems to \nme that, in addition to these tools being quite powerful, they also \ncomply with the doctrine of separation of powers and, therefore, have \nthe added benefit of being constitutional.\n  The REINS Act would require both Houses of Congress to approve every \nmajor rule, many of which are highly technical ones authored by experts \nsuch as scientists, physicians, engineers, and economists.\n  There simply isn't enough time for Congress to hold the hearings and \nconduct the research necessary to weigh in on these complicated \nmatters. The individuals tasked with making these difficult regulatory \ndecisions are certainly more qualified than most, if not all of us here \nin this room, and it is for this precise reason that Congress wisely \ndelegated this regulatory authority to such experts.\n  Politicizing this process will not only permit industry \nrepresentatives with deep pockets to have an overwhelming influence on \nwhether major rules go into effect, it will make it nearly impossible \nfor agencies to implement rules regulating consumer health and product \nsafety, environmental protections, workplace safety, and financial \nservices industry misconduct. The enactment of this legislation would, \nin my opinion, do immeasurable disservice to the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time \nas he may consume to the good gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, my friend from Florida asked a rhetorical question. He \nsaid: Why spend precious time on this? And here is the reply: Because \nour constituents' time is precious. Our constituents' time in trying to \ncomply with regulations is precious.\n  Before I get there, let me just give you a little bit of a history, \nMr. Speaker, about my understanding of the genesis of the REINS Act. It \nis interesting from a process point of view and a substance point of \nview.\n  From a process point of view, my understanding is that this came out \nof a townhall meeting that was hosted and sponsored by our former \ncolleague, Congressman Geoff Davis from Kentucky. He gathered a group \nof people together and, as I understand the story, one of the \nconstituents raised his hand and he posed this question. He said: \nCongressman, how is it possible that the Environmental Protection \nAgency is contemplating a rule that is so controversial it couldn't \npass Congress? How is that even conceivable under our governance \nstructure that unelected bureaucrats are able to accomplish something \nthat the elected Representatives of the people have said ``no'' to?\n  Congressman Davis in a very thoughtful way began to take that in. Out \nof it, he began to work with other people and put together the REINS \nAct, Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, that says \nthis. It says that over the years, one of the weaknesses of Congress is \nthat this institution has delegated too much responsibility to \nexecutive agencies. That is at the base of what we are talking about. \nThis is an issue of delegated authority. And since it was Congress' \nmistake in terms of atrophying its authority over a period of time, the \nremedy then falls on Congress to reclaim that authority.\n  So the gentleman from Georgia is proposing that we support this rule \naround H.R. 427, and it says this: If there is a regulation that has \nmore than a $100 million impact on the economy, then that regulation \nought not be foisted on the economy without discussion and approval by \nelected Representatives in Congress.\n  Now, there is a straw man argument that is out there as it relates to \nthis. I haven't heard it on the floor today, but I might hear it if we \ncontinue to listen to the debate, particularly during the amendment \nprocess and so forth.\n  Here is the straw man argument. The straw man argument is: If you are \nin favor of the REINS Act, then you don't want any regulations \nwhatsoever. You want the Wild West, where only the strong survive. That \nis a straw man. That is ridiculous.\n  What the REINS Act says is, if you are going to have a regulation, it \nought to be thoughtful, it ought to be well structured, it ought to be \nwell debated, and it ought not be a bureaucrat sitting on the seventh \nfloor of a gray building on Independence Avenue that is pursuing an \nagenda--and haven't we seen plenty of that, by the way--pursuing an \nagenda, an agenda that couldn't pass this place, an agenda that 218 \nMembers of the House of Representatives and a majority of the Senate \nare not going to support, but an agenda that a bureaucrat with a \npolitical agenda and so forth is trying to move forward.\n  Now, these numbers are staggering. According to the Competitive \nEnterprise Institute, the annual cost of complying with government \nregulations is $1.8 trillion. Think about the downward pressure of \nthat.\n  What the gentleman from Georgia is saying--and other supporters of \nthis--is let's take President Obama's admonition to the Congress and \nhis admonition to the public, and let's take those words at face value.\n  This is what the President said in an op-ed in The Wall Street \nJournal. He said that overregulation ``stifles innovation'' and has a \n``chilling effect on growth and jobs.'' Absolutely, that is true. That \nstatement is true.\n  President Obama said in his State of the Union address that same week \nthat the op-ed was published in The Wall Street Journal, January 2011, \n``To reduce barriers to growth and investment . . . when we find rules \nthat put an unnecessary burden on business, we will fix them.''\n  Okay. Great news. We have got the remedy. We have got the way to fix \nthat.\n  I will tell you, I represent a constituency, Mr. Speaker, in suburban \nChicago, as you know, and so, with frequency, I am out talking to \nbusinesses, getting in there. I represent a lot of manufacturers. I \nrepresent a lot of financial services companies. I represent a lot of \nfood production, transportation, insurance, and other things.\n  When you talk to folks and ask them what the nature of the challenge \nis, they will tell you. But what is interesting is the consistency of \nthe feeling of pressure that they feel as it relates to a regulatory \nburden.\n  So the good news is we can do something about that, and the good news \nis we can vote ``aye'' on the rule and we can vote ``aye'' on H.R. 427, \nthe REINS Act.\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased at this time to yield 3 \nminutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), a very good \nfriend of mine and the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule on H.R. \n427, and I thank my friend for yielding.\n  This bill is the very definition of political legislation and serves \nabsolutely no purpose in ensuring better rules. This legislation \naccomplishes nothing, aside from slowing down the administrative \nrulemaking process and giving Congress the power to shoot down any \naction that this majority doesn't like.\n  By requiring a joint resolution of congressional approval prior to \nenactment, the only surefire achievement of this legislation is a \nlonger rulemaking process, not a better one.\n  Let me humor my Republican colleagues and try to give them the \nbenefit of the doubt. They claim that this bill is about requiring \nFederal agencies to be more transparent in their actions. They want \nreports on how rules impact the Federal budget. But why should \ntransparency only be limited to the budget? If transparency is the gold \nstandard, why aren't we demanding reports on how these rules impact our \nmost vulnerable and at-risk citizens? If we are striving for \ntransparency, let's be transparent about all things.\n\n[[Page H8542]]\n\n  Yesterday, I submitted an amendment to address this point. But \nunsurprisingly, this rule does not allow my amendment to be considered. \nThis proves yet again that this Republican majority cares more about \nprotecting industry than protecting our people or our planet.\n  My amendment was simple. It would have required the administration to \nreport to Congress on the greenhouse gas emission impacts associated \nwith any proposed rule and what any proposed rule's impacts are on low-\nincome communities in this country.\n  The overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is real. \nNo matter how often industry and many of my Republican colleagues try \nconvince us that we have nothing to worry about, no matter how much \nmanufactured science they gin up to create doubt, climate change is \nreal.\n  If the administration is going to be forced to justify their \nrulemaking to Congress, let's make sure they include climate impacts in \ntheir justifications. The same goes for how the rules impact our poor \ncommunities. Why are people less important than Big Business?\n  My amendment aimed to remedy the negative impacts felt by these \npopulations by changing the definition of what constitutes a major rule \nto include any rule that increases the health risks among low-income \ncommunities, period. But apparently those concerns don't warrant a vote \non the House floor.\n  The majority's decision to block my amendment on climate change and \nenvironmental justice says more about the underlying legislation than \nany speech you will hear today.\n  This is not about good government. This is about House Republicans \nwanting to put their finger on the scale to benefit corporations at the \nexpense of the health and safety of the American people and, yes, our \nplanet.\n  This is a bad rule and it is protecting a bad bill, and both should \nbe defeated.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3064, a comprehensive, 6-year \nsurface transportation bill that is partially paid for by restricting \nU.S. companies from using so-called inversion to shrink their tax \nobligations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Denham). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I won't belabor things by talking about \nthat, but I have to say the previous question makes an awful lot of \nsense for us to do a 6-year plan. People in our States and in our \nlocalities are looking to us to give them some certainty. I hear this \nall the time from colleagues on both sides of the aisle. For us not to \ndo that, to me, is extremely troubling; and, I believe, in the long \nhaul, it is harmful to the economy of this country.\n  We need to pass a long-term surface transportation bill, and I \ngenuinely believe most Members in the House of Representatives, \nRepublican and Democrat, feel the same way.\n  The name of this bill at least flirts with being clever, I will give \nthe majority that. But let me tell you that we really need to rein in \naround here. We need to rein in a Republican-led Congress that will no \nlonger bring the remaining appropriations bills to the floor because it \nis more dedicated to seeing the Confederate flag fly high. I really \ndon't understand that.\n  What happened here a few days ago, we had the Interior measure going \nforward. Someone complained, rightly, about the Confederate flag in \npublic places.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  All of a sudden, the Interior Appropriations and any other \nappropriations went away. I predict that we will probably wind up with \na continuing resolution, rather than doing the work that the American \npeople sent us here to do, and that is to complete the appropriations \nor remaining bills.\n  We need to be about the business of reining in a Republican-led \nCongress that says it wants to help small businesses and then makes \nsure to let the Export-Import Bank charter expire.\n  In the congressional district that I am privileged to serve, alone, \n$964,000 in lost business and lost jobs will occur with three companies \nthat depend on the Export-Import Bank.\n  We need to rein in a Republican Congress that constantly attempts to \nundermine a healthcare law. I have forgotten now; most of us can't even \nremember how many times we have voted to repeal portions of or all of \nthe Affordable Care provision which is in effect now--5 years--and we \nare still having these sideline votes that are going nowhere.\n  We undermine it, and it has provided millions of American citizens \nthe opportunity to access affordable health care--and somebody please \ntell me what is wrong with that.\n  We are 50 years now into Medicare, and I remember, as if it were \nyesterday, that then President Ronald Reagan said that it would have a \nsevere impact on the American economy--in other words, to paraphrase, \nthat the sky was going to fall.\n  Well, 50 years out now with Medicare, we have seen the benefits to \nliterally hundreds of millions of Americans who rely upon Medicare, and \nwe demonstrably have seen its positive.\n  Yes, we are learning, even with the Affordable Care Act, that what is \nhappening is Medicare is now having diminution of its costs, which is \nnecessary to rein in the cost of health care in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and to defeat the \nprevious question. Vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it has been said--and we have \nmoved beyond the old adage many times--if it moves, regulate it; or, if \nit exists, to regulate it.\n  It is an interesting paradigm today because it is time for Washington \nto focus on creating a regulatory system that is flexible, allowing the \nmarket to decide the optimal path to implementation.\n  Regulations should be expedient and unambiguous, seeking to minimize \nthe uncertainty facing industries and small businesses, and we must \nencourage innovation and bringing new products and processes not only \nto market, but to office places everywhere. Outdated regulations should \nbe cleared off of the books, especially those created by those \nunelected.\n  As we have been here today--and I have, listening to the arguments--\nwhat is amazingly--from our side, I have wanted to talk about \nregulation and the overreach of many of our branches; the gentleman \nfrom Illinois brought it up tremendously, and I have talked about this \nin the Ninth District of Georgia, where I am from--is that, for many \nyears, I believe Congress decided, for whatever reason, it was much \neasier to give to agencies to promulgate rules and regulations. They \nsaid it is much easier.\n  In fact, I have even heard from the floor today that we don't have \nthe expertise, and it is much better to do it offsite. I just tend to \nfind that is wrong.\n  I think it is that Congress has the ability to listen to those \nexperts, to listen to those opinions, and then provide something that \nunelected bureaucrats do not, and that is have the people who elect us, \nwhom we face every time we go home--when I go to the grocery store, \nwhen I go to the ball games, when I go to my church, when I go to the \nplaces that I go to and they ask me questions, then they are holding \ntheir elected official accountable--then we take that, and we balance \nthat to make good decisions for all, in our districts and in our \ncountry.\n  What is amazing to me today is many of the arguments made today have \nnothing to do--there are many things we could debate here today, but we \nare here to debate--by the way, I will just remind everybody--the rule \nfor the REINS Act, not the plethora of other things that would be want \nto, could have done, should have done--we are here on the issue of \nregulatory reform. We are here on the REINS Act.\n  Frankly, if I was part of this administration who wants to create \nthis sort of entrenched Federal bureaucracy, I wouldn't want to talk \nabout regulatory reform either. I would want to talk about anything \nelse. I would want to\n\n[[Page H8543]]\n\ntalk about anything else besides the burden that keeps crushing down \nfrom Washington on small-business owners.\n  Then, of course, as well, there is the argument that did come up, \nthat if you really, really, really want this, undoubtedly, you are \nreally, really, really just wanting to protect big businesses and make \ndirty--from our perspective, I have heard it before, decrease \nregulations so that people are put in harm's way or that the \nenvironment is worse off.\n  The reality is that is an old argument and really just needs to go \naway. I come from the Ninth District of Georgia, in my humble opinion, \none of the prettiest places in all the world. Our farmers, our \nresidents all enjoy the clean air. They enjoy the greatness of what we \nhave and the businesses that are a part there and the regulations that, \nwhen rightly controlled, help us achieve that American Dream.\n  There is no one who, voting for this, or even talking against it, \nwould want to actually say: I am voting for this because I want to \nactually pick up a glass of water that is tainted and drink it, or I \nwant to make it worse for somebody else.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a simple rule. It says let's bring forward some \nfiscal sanity and regulatory sanity. Let's put it back in perspective.\n  I believe the circle of government, when the Founders put it out \nthere, was based on the fact of having the Executive to carry out the \nlaws, the Congress to make those laws, and the judicial branch to \ninterpret those laws. Our country works best when that is in alignment.\n  What we are asking for is let's bring it back into alignment. Let's \ntake the REINS Act, let's take this step toward bringing some certainty \nfor our businesses because, at the end of the day, when our businesses \nhave certainty, it does affect the people.\n  It is not a nameless, faceless place on a brick wall somewhere, those \nbusiness names that we want to talk about business. It is about those \npeople who get in their cars in their neighborhoods and their \napartments and their townhomes, and they drive to a place of work, or \nthey walk to their place of work, and they make a paycheck; they earn a \nliving so that they can do the things that I believe that they have \nwanted to prosper in and to take care of their families and to move \nthat American Dream forward in their life.\n  It is up to this building to look after them. It is up to what the \nRepublican majority is putting forward to say: We care about all \nAmericans; we care about their ability to earn a living; we care about \ntheir growth, and we care about their safety.\n  Proper regulation done in the proper way is the way to do that. I \nwill always stand on that side.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n    An Amendment to H. Res. 380 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida \n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3064) to authorize highway infrastructure and safety, \n     transit, motor carrier, rail, and other surface \n     transportation programs, and for other purposes. The first \n     reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of \n     order against consideration of the bill are waived. General \n     debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one \n     hour equally divided among and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure and the chair and ranking minority member \n     of the Committee on Ways and Means. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3064.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution 380 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 427.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Marchant) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n[[Page H8546]]\n\n                              {time}  1412\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 427) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force or \neffect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, with \nMr. Marchant in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Regulatory reform plays a critical role in ensuring that our Nation \nfinally achieves a full economic recovery and retains its competitive \nedge in the global marketplace. Congress must advance progrowth \npolicies that create jobs and restore economic prosperity for families \nand businesses across the Nation, and it must make sure that the \nadministration and its regulatory apparatus are held accountable to the \nAmerican people.\n  America's small-business owners are suffering under mountains of \nendlessly growing, bureaucratic red tape; and the uncertainty about the \ncost of upcoming regulations discourages employers from hiring new \nemployees and expanding their businesses. Excessive regulation means \nhigher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, less economic growth, and a \nless competitive America.\n  Today, Americans face a burden of over $3 trillion from Federal \ntaxation and regulation. In fact, our Federal regulatory burden is \nlarger than the 2014 gross domestic product of all but the top nine \ncountries in the world. That burden adds up to $15,000 per American \nhousehold, nearly 30 percent of the average household income in 2014.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Everyone knows it has been this way for far too long. But the Obama \nadministration, instead of fixing the problem, knows only one response: \nincrease taxes, increase spending, and increase regulation.\n  The results have painfully demonstrated a simple truth: America \ncannot tax, spend, and regulate its way to economic recovery, economic \ngrowth, and durable prosperity for the American people.\n  Consider just a few facts that reveal the economic weakness the Obama \nadministration has produced. In the June 2015 jobs report, the number \nof unemployed workers, workers who can only find part-time jobs and \nworkers who are now only marginally attached to the labor force, stood \nat 10.8 percent. They number over 16 million Americans.\n  America's labor force participation rate remains at lows not seen \nsince the Carter administration, and the median household income still \nis below the level achieved before the financial crisis.\n  The contrast between America's current condition and the recovery \nRonald Reagan achieved is particularly stark.\n  Four-and-a-half years after the recession began in 1981 the Reagan \nadministration, through policies opposite to the Obama \nadministration's, had achieved a recovery that created 7.8 million more \njobs than when the recession began. Real per capita gross domestic \nproduct rose by $3,091. Real median household income rose by 7.7 \npercent.\n  To truly fix America's problems, the REINS Act is one of the \nsimplest, clearest, and most powerful measures we can adopt. The level \nof new major regulation the Obama administration has issued and plans \nto issue is without modern precedent.\n  Testimony before the Judiciary Committee during recent Congresses has \nplainly shown the connection between skyrocketing levels of regulation \nand declining levels of jobs and growth.\n  The REINS Act responds by requiring an up-or-down vote by the \npeople's representatives in Congress before any new major regulation--\ndefined in the bill generally as a rule that has an effect on the \neconomy of at least $100 million--can be imposed on our economy.\n  It does not prohibit new major regulation. It simply establishes the \nprinciple ``No major regulation without representation.''\n  By requiring Congress, which is more directly accountable to the \nAmerican people, to approve or deny major regulations proposed by the \nadministration, the REINS Act provides Congress and, ultimately, the \npeople with a much-needed tool to check the one-way cost ratchet that \nWashington's regulatory bureaucrats too often turn.\n  During the 113th and 112th Congresses, the REINS Act was passed by \nthe full House of Representatives multiple times, each time on a \nbipartisan vote.\n  I thank Mr. Young of Indiana for introducing this legislation. I urge \nall of my colleagues to vote for the REINS Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                               Committee on Rules,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 15, 2015, the Committee on the \n     Judiciary ordered H.R. 427, the ``Regulations From the \n     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015,'' reported to the \n     House. As you know, the Committee on Rules was granted an \n     additional referral upon the bill's introduction pursuant to \n     the Committee's jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of the \n     House of Representatives over the rules of the House and \n     special orders of business.\n       Because of your willingness to consult with my committee \n     regarding this matter, I will waive consideration of the bill \n     by the Rules Committee. By agreeing to waive its \n     consideration of the bill, the Rules Committee does not waive \n     its jurisdiction over H.R. 427. In addition, the Committee \n     reserves its authority to seek conferees on any provisions of \n     the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any House-\n     Senate conference that may be convened on this legislation. I \n     ask your commitment to support any request by the Rules \n     Committee for conferees on H.R. 427 or related legislation.\n       I also request that you include our exchange of letters on \n     this matter in the committee report to accompany H.R. 427 and \n     in the Congressional Record during consideration of this \n     legislation on the House floor. Thank you for your attention \n     to these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Sessions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2015.\n     Hon. Pete Sessions,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Rules, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sessions, Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 427, the ``Regulations from the Executive in Need of \n     Scrutiny Act of 2015,'' which the Judiciary Committee ordered \n     reported favorably, as amended, to the House on April 15, \n     2015.\n       As you noted, the Committee on Rules was granted an \n     additional referral of the bill. I am most appreciative of \n     your decision to forego further consideration of H.R. 427 so \n     that it may proceed to the House floor. I acknowledge that \n     although you are waiving formal consideration of the bill, \n     the Committee on the Rules is in no way waiving its \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those \n     provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X \n     jurisdiction. In addition, if a conference is necessary on \n     this legislation, I will support any request that your \n     committee be represented therein.\n       Finally, I am pleased to include this letter and your \n     letter in our committee's report as well as the Congressional \n     Record during floor consideration of H.R. 427.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Committee on the Budget,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte, I am writing concerning H.R. 427, \n     the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of \n     2015, which the Committee on the Judiciary ordered reported \n     on April 15, 2015.\n       The bill amends section 257(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by providing that \n     any rules which affect budget authority, outlays, or receipts \n     that are subject to the congressional approval procedure \n     outlined in section 802 of chapter 8 of title 5, U.S.C., are \n     effective unless it is disapproved in accordance with such \n     section. In order to expedite House consideration of H.R. \n     427, the Committee will forgo action on the bill. This is \n     being done with the understanding that it does not in any way \n     prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of \n     conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or \n     similar legislation.\n\n[[Page H8547]]\n\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 427 and would ask \n     that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be \n     included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Tom Price, M.D.,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     Committee on the Budget.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Tom Price,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Price, Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 427, the ``Regulations from the Executive in Need of \n     Scrutiny Act of 2015,'' which the Judiciary Committee ordered \n     reported favorably, as amended, to the House on April 15, \n     2015.\n       As you noted, the Committee on the Budget was granted an \n     additional referral of the bill. I am most appreciative of \n     your decision to forego further consideration of H.R. 427 so \n     that it may proceed to the House floor. I acknowledge that \n     although you are waiving formal consideration of the bill, \n     the Committee on the Budget is in no way waiving its \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those \n     provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X \n     jurisdiction. In addition, if a conference is necessary on \n     this legislation, I will support any request that your \n     committee be represented therein.\n       Finally, I am pleased to include this letter and your \n     letter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration \n     of H.R. 427.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume and rise in opposition to H.R. 427.\n  Mr. Chair, H.R. 427, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of \nScrutiny Act of 2015, otherwise known as the REINS Act, would amend the \nCongressional Review Act to require that both Houses of Congress pass \nand the President sign a joint resolution of approval within 70 \nlegislative days before any major rule issued by an agency can take \neffect.\n  Additionally, H.R. 427 imposes deadlines for the enactment of a joint \nresolution approving a major rule that could charitably be referred to \nas Byzantine.\n  Under new section 802, the House may only consider a major rule on \nthe second and fourth Thursday of each month. Last year there were only \n13 such days on the legislative calendar compared to the 80 major rules \nadopted in 2014.\n  Furthermore, under new section 801, Congress may only consider such \nresolutions within 70 legislative days of receiving a major rule. This \nprocess would constructively end rulemaking as we know it.\n  Now, Mr. Chair, the reason why my friends on the other side of the \naisle contend that we need this kind of gumming-the-works legislation, \nwhich would result in the passage of no new regulations, is because \nthese new regulations are stifling economic growth.\n  They point to the Obama administration and say that it is because of \nregulations enacted or promulgated and placed into operation under the \nObama administration that has caused our economy to be at a point where \nthey are saying we are not as economically vital as it should be.\n  What they are failing to tell the American people is that it was the \nGeorge Bush Republican economic policies of the first part of this \ncentury that led to the Great Recession, the economic meltdown, the \nfact that there were not regulations that prohibited predatory lending, \nand other economic policies which contributed to the economic meltdown. \nThey won't tell you it was because of the lack of regulation that \ncaused that.\n  But, indeed, if you go back and talk to Alan Greenspan, who chaired \nthe Federal Reserve and was a big antiregulatory capitalist, he had to \ncome back after the Great Recession and admit that he was wrong.\n  His policies were those that contributed to the economic meltdown, \nwhich, despite horrendous opposition from the opposite side of the \naisle against the policies of Democrats and President Obama, they tried \nto obstruct those changes. But they were enacted and, as a result, \nAmerica's economic recovery has been quite notable.\n  Corporate profits are up. Even though productivity is up and wages \nare steady, workers have not participated in the upswing in this \nelection, even though jobs have been created for the last 65 straight \nmonths under the Obama administration.\n  But the wage growth has been stagnant, and it is because of the \ntrickle-down Republican policies that have caused this. Now they want \nto blame the lack of monies in the pocketbooks and pockets of \nAmericans, working people, on regulations.\n  Even if agencies reduce the number of major rules in contemplation of \nthe bill's onerous requirements, Congress would still lack the \nexpertise and policy justifications for refusing to adopt a major rule.\n  As over 80 of the Nation's leading professors on environmental and \nadministrative law have noted in a letter to the Judiciary Committee \nearlier this year, without this expertise, any disapproval is, \ntherefore, more likely to reflect the political power of special \ninterests, a potential that would be magnified in light of the fast-\ntrack process.\n  Lastly, by upending the process for agency rulemaking so that \nCongress can simply void major rules through inaction, the REINS Act \nlikely violates the presentment and bicameralism requirements of \narticle I of the Constitution.\n  As Professor Ron Levin, a leading expert on administrative law, noted \nduring the hearing on the REINS Act last Congress:\n  ``The reality is that the act is intended to enable a single House of \nCongress to control the implementation of the laws through the \nrulemaking process. Such a scheme transgresses the very idea of \nseparation of powers, under which the Constitution entrusts the writing \nof the laws to the legislative branch and the implementation of the \nlaws to the executive branch.''\n  Indeed, as the Supreme Court noted in the landmark case INS v. Chada: \n``The Constitution does not contemplate an active role for Congress in \nthe supervision of officers charged with the execution of laws it \nenacts.''\n  The court also clarified that it was profound conviction of the \nFramers that the powers conferred on Congress were the powers to be \nmost carefully circumscribed. By providing that no law could take \neffect without the concurrence of the prescribed majority of both \nHouses, the Framers reemphasized their belief that legislation should \nnot be enacted unless it has been carefully and fully considered by the \nNation's elected officials.\n  It defies credulity that so many of my Republican colleagues who so \nstrongly oppose crony capitalism and hold the Framers' intent so dearly \nwould support H.R. 427, which is a bald attempt by corporations and \nspecial interests to shield themselves from any oversight and, in the \nprocess, shred article I of the Constitution.\n  Furthermore, Speaker Boehner has also said that the Republican-led, \ndo-nothing Congress, the most ineffective in modern history--and I will \nnote that we are getting ready to adjourn tomorrow, a day early, for a \n6-week adjournment with all of the work that remains for Congress to \ndo.\n  Speaker Boehner also said that the Republican-led, do-nothing \nCongress, the most ineffective in modern history, should be judged by \nthe number of laws it repeals, not the number of laws that it passes.\n  It therefore follows that this obstruct-at-any-cost approach would \ncarry over to blocking the most critical agency rulemaking, thereby \nthreatening agencies' ability to protect Americans' health, safety, \nwell-being, and economic growth.\n  Who stands to gain from Republican obstructionism? Corporate giants \nthat are holding our country hostage through a deregulatory agenda and \npolitical influence that would rival the industrial monopolies from the \npast century.\n  Unsurprisingly, it is many of the same corporations that are \ncontinuing to show record profit margins that are also pushing \nderegulation and fewer taxes because they have an ``obsession with \nshort-term profits at the expense of long-term value creation,'' \naccording to Henry Blodget, the CEO of Business Insider.\n  Unquestionably, H.R. 427 would be nothing short of a catastrophic \nevent for the everyday Americans who stand to lose the most from the \nmajority's myopic and reckless treatment of our Nation's regulatory \nsystem.\n  Mr. Chair, we need real solutions to help real people, not yet \nanother thinly\n\n[[Page H5548]]\n\nveiled handout to large corporations, not another messaging bill to \ntake back to the district over the August recess.\n  We need legislation that creates middle class security and \nopportunity, and we need sensible regulations that protect American \nfamilies from financial ruin, that encourage competition, that bring \npredatory financial practices to an end, legislation that brings the \nUnited States into conformity with the rest of the developed world's \nemployment policies by guaranteeing paid sick and parental leave, \nlegislation that increases our global competitiveness by creating an \naffordable higher education, and legislation that increases the minimum \nwage from a paltry $7.25 an hour.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose \nH.R. 427, yet another deregulatory bill in the majority's business-\nfocused, crony capitalist agenda.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I have to agree with my friend \nfrom Georgia. I agree with him on his statement that this \nadministration's recovery has been amazing. It has been amazingly bad.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the \nmajority whip.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, if you look at what is happening in our \neconomy right now, why the economy is struggling so badly through this \nObama economy, it is because of radical regulations coming out of \nWashington.\n  Every time I go home and meet with small businesses in my district in \nsoutheast Louisiana, the common thread is that it is not the local \nbusiness down the street that is the main threat to their business.\n  The main threat to small businesses throughout my district--and I \nhear it from my colleagues as well across the country--are the \nthousands and thousands of pages of these radical regulations that come \nout of these Federal agencies, unelected bureaucrats that are imposing, \nin essence, new law that is making it harder to create jobs in this \ncountry.\n  Hard-working taxpayers deserve a Federal Government that is more \nefficient, more effective, and more accountable; and that is what the \nREINS Act does, Mr. Chairman. The REINS Act forces real accountability \nin regulations that are coming out of Washington.\n  Whether it is the IRS or the EPA or the NLRB or HHS or CMS, the \nalphabet soup of Federal agencies that is crippling our economy with \nall of these regulations is what is holding our economy back.\n  Why not have a mechanism that says, if a rule is being proposed by a \nFederal agency by an unelected bureaucrat that is so important that it \nis going to have a major impact on our economy, shouldn't it at least \ngo through the transparency of coming before the elected \nrepresentatives of the people, Mr. Chairman?\n  Why not have these conversations on C-SPAN, not in the dark annals of \nsome Federal bureaucratic agency in Washington, some unelected \nbureaucrat that is going to wake up one morning and say they are going \nto create a new law that is going to devastate our economy?\n  Shouldn't that at least go through public hearings? Shouldn't it have \nto be passed by the elected people in Congress who will be held \naccountable every 2 years for the consequences of those regulations?\n  Let's stop crippling our economy. Let's stop holding our economy back \nwith these radical regulations, Mr. Chairman. Let's pass the REINS Act \nand bring real accountability into the process of creating regulations \nin Washington.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \nbill. The REINS Act would create new obstacles to the promulgation of \nregulations designed to protect American workers' health and safety and \nto protect the environment.\n  It would jeopardize the economy by impeding regulations for financial \nservices and throw sand in the gears of government efforts to address \ngrowing inequality and prevent discrimination.\n  Congress already has the right to disapprove any rule through the \nCongressional Review Act or through appropriations bills or other \nlegislation. This bill would essentially impose a procedural chokehold \nby requiring that any major rule receive affirmative House and Senate \napproval within 70 legislative days.\n  As an example of the effect of this bill, we note that the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, is in the process \nof updating a nearly 70-year-old standard to keep workers from \ncontracting a progressive and frequently fatal lung disease called \nchronic beryllium disease.\n  In the 1940s, workers at the Atomic Energy Commission plants were \ncontracting acute beryllium poisoning. To deal with the problem, two of \ntheir scientists sitting in the back of a taxicab on the way to a \nmeeting agreed to set the beryllium exposure limit at 2 micrograms per \ncubic meter of air. Established back in 1948, that standard is still in \nplace today and is often called ``the taxicab standard'' because there \nwas no data supporting that number.\n  In 1975, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \nadvised OSHA to issue a new, more stringent protective standard. That \neffort faltered. Now, one cost of inaction is an estimated loss of 100 \nlives per year each year this new standard is delayed.\n  Another is the fact that we have to pay over $300 million in Federal \ncompensation to workers and their survivors who have contracted chronic \nberyllium disease and who are employed by the Energy Department's \ncontractors and vendors.\n  Today, over 100,000 workers are exposed to beryllium, and workers in \nmy district are not alone in asking the government to be on their side. \nThere is substantial stakeholder support from beryllium producers and \nlabor representatives to cut the standard exposure limit by 90 percent.\n  Over the last 17 years, OSHA has worked to update that standard, \nbased on numerous scientific studies and expert recommendations, and \nnow, the new standard is working its way slowly through the regulatory \nprocess; and under the present laws and procedures, it still might be \nanother year or two before the final rule is promulgated.\n  Despite overwhelming scientific evidence that this nearly 70-year-old \nstandard fails to protect workers, there are still a few who object. By \nrequiring a bicameral resolution of approval prior to the rule ever \ntaking effect, this legislation will make it easier for a well-funded \nspecial interest group to block needed workplace protections.\n  The underlying bill does nothing but prioritize special interests \nabove the protection of lives and limbs of American workers. I, \ntherefore, urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Young), the author of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the leader \nand Chairman Goodlatte for bringing H.R. 427 to the floor today.\n  I introduced the REINS Act because people in my home State of Indiana \nwant to hold someone--someone--accountable for the job-killing rules \nand regulations coming out of Washington, D.C.\n  Each day, government agencies impose an average of 10 new regulations \non America's businesses, both big and small. It is no surprise to \ndiscover that the costly, confusing government regulations that come \nout of this body--ObamaCare mandates, EPA regulations, or IRS tax \npenalties--are exciting some feedback from my constituents.\n  In fact, the collateral damage wrought by Federal Government \nregulations is consistently cited as one of the biggest barriers to \nbusiness creation and expansion and growth in household income in this \ncountry.\n  One Indiana businessowner, who employs 16 family men and women in \nFloyd County, recently called my office. He wanted to know who had \nvoted in support of a peculiar new IRS rule that is going to penalize \nhim if he helps his employees pay for health insurance.\n  Now, this IRS rule can cost employers more than $36,000 per employee \nper year if they continue to offend the sensibilities of Washington's \nregulating\n\n[[Page H5549]]\n\nclass by reimbursing workers for healthcare coverage.\n  As the son of a small-business owner and someone who hears a lot from \nlocal businesses back in Indiana about their challenges, about their \nopportunities, I know how costly regulations impact the small company's \nbottom line.\n\n  While this broad, new IRS rule will undoubtedly have a major impact \non smaller enterprises across the Nation, it was written by unelected, \nunaccountable regulators here in Washington, D.C. It never came before \nCongress for an up-or-down vote.\n  That is what the REINS Act is all about. It is about holding \nofficials at Federal agencies and the Congress of the United States \naccountable for the harmful regulations drummed up each year, \nregulations which are laws in everything but name. They hurt American \njobs and wages when they are implemented, and they need an additional \nfilter of accountability here in the people's House.\n  Who should be held responsible, I would ask opponents of this \nlegislation, for these rules that have a $100 million-plus impact on \nour economy if not the people's elected representatives in Congress? \nFor too long, Congress has delegated much of its constitutional \nauthority to executive agencies here in Washington, D.C. This has \nempowered unelected Federal officials to implement sweeping rules and \nregulations that are often ineffective, redundant, counterproductive, \nand costly.\n  Consider the impact of such rules on another business in my home \ndistrict in Indiana. It is a local farming operation. When we add up \nthe impact of county, State, and Federal regulations, these Hoosier \nfarmers must meet hundreds of reporting requirements dictated by an \nalphabet soup of different government agencies--EPA, USDA, HHS, IRS, \nNLRB. It goes on and on and on. It is mind numbing, really.\n  The burden on their operation and its ability to grow and compete has \nbeen punishing. For example, one regulation alone requires them to \ntreat water left over from cracking eggs like industrial waste. It \ncosts hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for this business in \nconsulting and equipment fees just in compliance costs.\n  Now, with the EPA assuming broad new authority over bodies of water \nin the United States, these farmers are taking more time and resources \naway from their farm to track these ill-defined WOTUS regulations \ncoming down the pike.\n  Now, America's job creators will tell you the future is uncertain. \nOur rulemaking process is out of the people's control. It needs to be \nreined in. Wouldn't it make sense for small-business owners and farmers \nto have a larger voice, to be given a bigger say in the rulemaking \nprocess, especially when regulations can dictate whether their business \nsucceeds or fails?\n  That is exactly what my legislation, the REINS Act, provides. It \ngives the job creators and the American people a voice. It injects a \nmeasure of accountability back into the democratic process. The REINS \nAct requires that Congress must approve any new major rule proposed by \nthe executive branch before it can be enforced on the American people.\n  Remember, our small businesses are our Nation's economic engine. They \nrepresent 99.7 percent of all national employers, 56.1 million of our \nNation's private workforce. Small and family-owned businesses, new \nstartups, and entrepreneurs create two-thirds of all job growth in the \nUnited States.\n  Meanwhile, small businesses spend an estimated $10,500 per employee \nto comply with Federal regulations. It is no wonder that, for the first \ntime in 35 years, more American companies are being destroyed than they \nare being created each year.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Compliance with costly Federal regulations \nleads to higher consumer costs, lower take-home pay, and even reduced \nhiring.\n  A businessowner who owns a parts manufacturing company in Wabash, \nIndiana, summed it up best. From his standpoint, when it comes to the \nvast array of rules and regulations his company must follow, they are \nnot only onerous; they add zero value to his business, and they put him \nat a competitive disadvantage to foreign competition.\n  We could, frankly, spend a lot more time than today here on the floor \ngoing through each of the different challenges with our Federal \nregulation system, but in the end, Congress needs to be forced to \naccount for the regulations resulting from our sweeping legislation \nlike ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank.\n  The REINS Act accomplishes this objective. The REINS Act, like the \nHoosiers I represent, demands accountability. I commend it to the \nconsideration of all my colleagues.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I often hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeat \nfalse information, and it is unfortunate that it would be perpetrated \nthat economic growth has been hurt because of an explosion of \nregulations during the Obama administration.\n  I will be the first to admit that, with the historic passage of the \nAffordable Care Act, which has enabled 16 million Americans to now have \naccess to the healthcare system--16 million people--it could have been \nmore if the policies had not been obstructed so much; if we hadn't had \n50-plus votes to do away with the Affordable Care Act, we would have \nmore people having access to the healthcare system in this country, but \nbringing that many people into the healthcare system and actually \nchanging the healthcare system required new regulations, and so people \nhave been trying, for 75 to 100 years, to establish health care for \neveryone in this country.\n  The Affordable Care Act was the closest that we could come to that \nideal, but it was a transformational bill, and it did require new \nregulations to nurture it and to get it to this point, which has been a \ncomplete success, despite all opposition.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  And then we had the Dodd-Frank legislation that was passed as a \nresult of the Great Recession, which was caused by a lack of \nregulation.\n  So we had regulations that had to come forth as a result of the \npassage of that legislation to protect the health, safety, and \nfinancial well-being of everyday Americans. And so with that act having \npassed and controls put on excessive speculation in the financial \nservices industry, we have seen economic growth. That is the bottom \nline. We had 64 straight months of private sector job growth. That is \n12.8 million private sector jobs created amidst a regulatory system \nthat is proworker, proenvironment, prohealth and prosafety, and \nproinnovation. That is a significant accomplishment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee and a fighter for small businesses and the families that they \nrepresent.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Before I get into my prepared remarks, I have to respond to my good \nfriend from Georgia's comments about the Affordable Care Act, which \nmany have come to start referring to as the ``Unaffordable Care Act'' \nor ``ObamaCare,'' as most people refer to it.\n  There certainly was a need to help some of those folks who didn't \nhave insurance, and there were ways of doing that. By passage of this \nlegislation, we have adversely, negatively impacted, I think, far more \nAmericans than we have helped. We have seen Americans' rates go up, \ndeductibles go up, premiums go up, and they are getting less quality \nhealth care for that. So it has been a disaster for many Americans, and \na lot of it is still unfolding.\n  And then, on Dodd-Frank, which the gentleman also mentioned, what we \nhave seen as a result of that--and I happen to be the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, as was mentioned--one of small businesses' \ngreatest challenges is access to capital, getting money so that they \ncan grow or start a business or grow an existing business and create \nmore jobs.\n  Because of Dodd-Frank, we got a whole new army of bureaucrats looking \nover the shoulders of banks--and the smaller banks, too, like community \nbanks, who had nothing to do with this\n\n[[Page H5550]]\n\nso-called economic meltdown. Bureaucrats are looking over the shoulders \nof credit unions, making it tougher for them to make loans to small \nbusinesses.\n  So those two pieces of legislation, which many of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle are proud of, I think have been disastrous for \nthis country.\n  Getting to this particular piece of legislation, half of America is \nemployed by small businesses. In fact, 70 percent of the new jobs \ncreated in this economy are created by small businesses. Families rely \non small businesses to put food on the table and a roof over their \nheads. They are very critical to the American community and to our \nAmerican economy.\n  There is not a small-business owner I know who thinks that the \ngovernment creates job, but they do know that government can keep them \nfrom creating jobs. It does it with one-size-fits-all regulations. It \ndoes it by perpetuating uncertainty and increasing barriers to success.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.\n  The REINS Act forces government to think before it acts. It protects \nthe American people by ensuring that those that they elected get a say \nin major regulations--not all regulations, just regulations that would \nhave a significant impact on the economy.\n  Some may falsely claim that this bill is about deregulation. It is \nnot. It is about accountability. It is about making government think \nbefore it acts. And if it chooses to act, the American people can hold \ntheir elected representatives--us--accountable for making that \ndecision, not some nameless, faceless bureaucracy, but their elected \nrepresentatives. That is what this is all about. It is commonsense \nlegislation.\n  I commend the gentleman from Indiana for offering this. I also want \nto thank the gentleman from Georgia for handling this on the floor \ntoday.\n  The REINS Act is a good piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I would inquire as to how much time remains \non both sides.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) has 13 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Farenthold), another fighter for his district and those who are \naffected by regulation.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, the Constitution vests all legislative \npowers in Congress. Unfortunately, past Members of this institution \nhave given away a lot of that power to government agencies like the \nEPA, the Department of Health and Human Services, and an alphabet soup \nof agencies. President Obama is using his pen and telephone to talk to \nthe ideologues who work in and run these agencies to change laws, to \nmake laws without coming to Congress. Unelected, faceless Federal \nbureaucrats are making regulations that have the force of law, not \nelected representatives of the people.\n  There are reams of rules. There are so many rules out there, I bet \nthe average person can't go a couple of hours without violating a rule \nor regulation they probably don't even know about.\n  The REINS Act is a great first step in reining in these job-killing \nregulations. The legislation before us is important to America. The \nREINS Act brings accountability back to the system.\n  When a regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million \ncomes out of one of these agencies, it has got to be approved by \nCongress. That is our job; the Constitution says so, the people who \nelected us to make laws. And the people will hold us accountable for \nthose laws if they are bad laws.\n  How do you hold a faceless Federal bureaucrat accountable? We have \nseen through the VA that it is practically impossible to fire one of \nthese bureaucrats. But every 2 years you have got the opportunity to \nfire somebody in this House, and every 6 years you have the opportunity \nto fire somebody on the other side.\n  Let Congress do the job the Founding Fathers intended. Put the \npeople's representatives back in charge. Follow the Constitution.\n  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) made a great point when he \nwas reading through the Supreme Court decision talking about the \nconstitutional responsibility of this branch of government to make the \nlaws. That is what the REINS Act does. It gives us back the power.\n  Another gentleman on the other side spoke about the taxicab standard, \nhow it came up in a taxicab and how this random regulation has been law \nfor years. If the REINS Act had been in effect, that would have come \nbefore Congress, and we could have asked the question: Where is the \nscience behind that?\n\n  It would have worked then, and it will work when we pass it now.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the \nREINS Act.\n  For far too long, Congress has allowed unelected Federal bureaucrats \nto take responsibility for the policymaking in this town. Too often, \nthese unaccountable individuals in Washington make decisions that \naffect the daily lives of western Pennsylvanians with little regard for \nhow they impact one's livelihood and family.\n  For instance, we learned a month ago in a Supreme Court decision that \none agency, the EPA, failed to appropriately consider the costs and \nbenefits of its MATS proposal, which is estimated to cost $9 billion, \nwith a benefit of only $4 million to $6 million.\n  Solid, middle class jobs like those in some parts of the energy \nindustry and in my district are being regulated right out of existence. \nMore broadly, consider that in 2015, thus far, more than 150 \nregulations have been finalized, with total costs exceeding $60 billion \nand more than 10 million hours of paperwork.\n  It is this unaccountable culture that hinders the very job creation \nand economic growth we need in cities and towns across America that \nwill provide opportunities for Americans to get back in the game and to \nget this country back on track.\n  There is a bigger issue here, Mr. Chairman, and that is what is \nrepresented in this bill. It goes to the constitutional structure of \nour government, where we are supposed to have an executive branch that \nis supposed to enforce the law, a legislative branch that makes the \nlaw, and a judicial branch that adjudicates the law.\n  For close to 100 years, this body has ceded responsibility for making \nlaws to the executive branch. This bill is a start towards restoring \nthe proper structure of government and accountability.\n  When regulations are passed that people don't agree with, there is no \nway to hold those regulators accountable; but if Congress had a say, \nyou could hold Congress accountable. This is what self-government is \nall about.\n  I reflect on 34 years ago, when a certain gentleman spoke on the west \nfront of this Capitol and had these words to say: ``From time to time \nwe've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be \nmanaged by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to \ngovernment for, by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is \ncapable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to \ngovern someone else?''\n  I thank Mr. Young and the committee for its work on the REINS Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as a means to restoring the \noriginal, proper constitutional structure of who is responsible for the \nlaws that come out of this town. You would think that Members of \nCongress would want to take credit for good regulations and protect \npeople from bad regulations. Again, that is what this legislation does.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  The economic elites who are the patrons of many of my friends across \nthe aisle believe in trickle-down economics, which George Herbert \nWalker Bush termed to be ``voodoo economics.''\n\n[[Page H5551]]\n\n  My friends believe that when you put a quarter in the pocket of a \nrich man, there is a hole in that pocket and the quarter trickles down \nand falls out into nickles and dimes and is distributed to the waiting \nworking class people of the country. They believe that is how the \neconomy works: give the rich the money, let them operate in an \nunregulated environment, and then somehow, magically, the economy \ntrickles down to those waiting at the bottom of the scale waiting for \nsome kind of a handout.\n  That is not how our economy works. It works from the ground up. It \nworks with people going to work, making a decent wage, delivering \nservices for a period of time--8 hours a day, that is a regulation; 40 \nhours a week, that is a regulation. We didn't used to have those during \ntimes when people were predominantly poor, and the Nation was poor as a \nresult; but due to these regulations like the minimum wage, the 40-hour \nworkweek, the health and safety regulations on the job, we were able to \nbuild a middle class in this country that sustained us up until the \ntime when Ronald Reagan won the Presidency and established the current \nclimate of trickle-down economics.\n  We have seen during that time what has happened is the rich have \ngotten richer and the poor have gotten poorer. The working poor have \nhad less to work with and the middle class has been squeezed so that \nthere are not as many working middle class people as there were once \nbefore.\n  So the REINS Act is a gift to the economic elites who have had their \nway with the economy for the last 40 years. They want to stab the heart \nof the American economy now by passing this act, the REINS Act, which \nwould not deregulate, but it would stop all future regulations from \ncoming to the fore. That is something that America does not need.\n  So I am going to urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to oppose \nthis legislation and oppose voodoo economics, oppose trickle-down \neconomics.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to just say \nthat the fact of the matter is we are not talking about voodoo \neconomics here. We are talking about representative democracy.\n  The American people elect their Representatives from 435 \ncongressional districts; 50 States elect their Senators, and they send \nus to Washington, D.C., to write the laws of the land.\n  The laws that the gentleman referred to were all written by the \nUnited States Congress, signed into law by various Presidents. Then \nthose laws are turned into regulations, and that is where there is no \nmore representative democracy.\n  The bureaucracy that writes the regulations has no accountability. \nThey write regulations that cost too much, that strangle the job \ncreation that we both--the gentleman from Georgia and I would like to \nsee greater job creation and more jobs for the middle class in this \ncountry.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 15 seconds.\n  This bill is about restoring representative democracy to the American \npeople and fairness to the American people and protecting their economy \nand protecting their jobs by making sure that bureaucrats are held \naccountable and send those regulations back to the Congress for an up-\nor-down vote that, yes, those regulations comport with what the \nCongress intended when they wrote the law--or don't comport.\n  If they comport, they take effect; if they don't, they don't take \neffect.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia \n(Mr. Jenkins).\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I stand today in strong \nsupport of the REINS Act of 2015.\n  The gentleman from Georgia said, in opposition to this bill just a \nfew moments ago, that we should be opposed to it, because ``it would \nend rulemaking as we know it.''\n  What a great statement on why we should vote for the REINS Act \nbecause that is exactly what we are trying to do. We must end \nrulemaking as we know it.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill because I know, firsthand, how this \nadministration's overbearing regulatory policies have devastated my \nState, West Virginia; its businesses; its workers; its fundamental way \nof life. The people of West Virginia's Third District deserve better. \nAll West Virginians deserve better. All Americans deserve better.\n  The Economist recently estimated that Federal regulations cost our \nNation more than $1.8 trillion per year. In West Virginia, for example, \nthe EPA has implemented sweeping rules and regulations that have driven \nout thousands of good-paying jobs, reduced demand for West Virginia \ncoal, and raised energy prices for all Americans.\n  This administration is out of touch with our Nation's hard-working \nfamilies. This bill, the REINS Act, will protect our communities, small \nbusinesses, and workers from the administration's crushing regulatory \nonslaught.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  My colleagues have repeatedly argued to the fact that--or to the \nallegation that the rate of Federal regulations is growing, but a \nrecent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nreported that the length of the Code of Federal Regulations has no \nbearing on the scope or impact of Federal regulation.\n  In other words, just because the volume of paper is growing, they \nwant to argue that this means that there is an onslaught, an explosion \nof Federal regulations.\n  As I pointed out earlier, yes, there have been new regulations having \nto do with Dodd-Frank, which protects us from another economic meltdown \nthat we suffered under the Bush administration, and also the Affordable \nCare Act, which has enabled 16 million Americans to have access to the \nhealthcare system who did not have it prior to the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  This argument that regulations are killing us is nonfactual.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I have only one speaker remaining, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I will close and just say that this debate has been about whether or \nnot we need a law that would stop Federal rulemaking in its tracks.\n  This debate has been about whether or not, as we move forward into \nthe future, as society advances, as technology takes us to places where \nwe have never been before, as medical care and breakthroughs in the \nability to keep people alive, as that explodes, as things change, as \nthey do in the annals of human history, the question is whether or not \nwe are going to have a Federal bureaucracy that keeps up with the \nchange and keeps up with the need for an implementation regimen to \nenact or see that the laws that are enacted by Congress can, in fact, \nbe accomplished.\n  With no regulations to support the measures that Congress passes--but \nI will note that this Congress doesn't pass much, but that is what we \nare here for, to keep up with change and to legislate, so that change \nis good for Americans, their health, safety, and well-being.\n  When we do that, if we have a regulatory regime that is gummed up and \ninoperable, then it hurts America's ability to compete in this global \nmarketplace. It hurts America's economy to be an economy where all \npeople can share in the prosperity of it.\n  This is what this debate has been about. Are we going to change \nAmerica? Are we going to throw out the Administrative Procedure Act, \nwhich has been an orderly way and predictable way for regulations to be \npromulgated and placed into effect?\n  Are we going to do away with that and then subject that rulemaking \nprocess to a dysfunctional process like we have here in Congress today, \nwhere we can't even pass the Export-Import Bank legislation--which, by \nthe way, you say, government does not create jobs, but there will be \ngovernment jobs lost as a result of us going home early without having \npassed the Export-Import Bank reauthorization.\n  Government does create jobs, and we are going to lose tens of \nthousands of\n\n[[Page H5552]]\n\njobs because of our inability or our refusal to bring a measure to the \nfloor which has the votes--bipartisan votes--to pass this Chamber and \nwhich has already passed the Senate in a transportation bill.\n  We are going to go home without having done that, and I will tell you \nwe will go home without having--if this legislation passes, we will go \nhome without passing a single regulation, and government will be gummed \nup. Who will prosper? It is the economic elites who make money, \nregardless.\n  I will call on my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  During this debate, my friends on the other side of the aisle have \nraised quite a few false alarms.\n  If this bill passes, why, all important regulations will stop, they \nsay; but that is not true. All regulation that is worthy of Congress' \napproval will continue.\n  If this bill passes, why, expert decisionmaking will stop because \nCongress will have the final say on new major regulations, not \nWashington bureaucrats; but that is not true. Congress will have the \nbenefit of the best evidence and arguments expert agencies can offer in \nsupport of their new regulations.\n  Congress is capable of determining whether that evidence and those \narguments are good or not and deciding what finally will become law. \nThat is the job our Founding Fathers entrusted to us in the \nConstitution. We should not shirk from it.\n  I will tell you, though, what will stop if this bill becomes law is \nthe endless avalanche of new, major regulations that do not deserve \nCongress' approval because they impose massive, unjustified costs that \ncrush jobs, crush wages, and crush the spirits of America's families \nand small-business owners.\n  Think about what that will mean to real Americans suffering the real \nburdens of the Obama administration's overreaching regulations. Let me \ntell you about some of them who have testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Think of Rob James, a city councilman from Avon Lake, Ohio, a small \ntown that has faced devastation by ideologically driven, anti-fossil \nfuel power plant regulations.\n  These regulations were expected to destroy jobs in Avon Lake, harm \nAvon Lake's families, and make it even harder for Avon Lake to find the \nresources to provide emergency services, quality schools, and help for \nits neediest citizens--all while doing comparatively little to control \nmercury emissions that were the stated target of the regulations.\n  The Supreme Court just invalidated those regulations, but not before \nmultiple years of job-crushing compliance costs had to be borne by \nthose who challenged the rules.\n  Think of Bob Sells, from my district. He runs a Virginia-based \ndivision of a heavy construction materials producer. His company and \nits workers were harmed by EPA cement kiln emission regulations that \nwere technically unattainable and vastly changed from what the EPA \nproposed for public comment, other EPA emission regulations that were \nstricter than needed to protect health, gerrymandered to impose \nexpensive controls on other types of emissions, and that prohibited \ncommonsense uses of cheap and safe fuel that could eventually help the \nenvironment and the Department of Transportation regulations that, \nwithout increasing safety, vastly increased recordkeeping for ready-mix \nconcrete drivers, unnecessarily limited their hours, and suppressed \ntheir wages.\n  This is what the REINS Act will stop: overreaching, unjustified, \nimmensely costly regulation that, unless Congress stands up to protect \nthe American people, this administration will continue to load on to \nthe backs of struggling American families and small-business owners.\n  Support the American people. Support the REINS Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, as a cosponsor of H.R. 427 I rise in strong \nsupport of the REINS Act.\n  Our bill is imperative to ensuring that federal agencies, and those \nin the White House, are held accountable for the expensive and \nintrusive regulations they are imposing on the American people.\n  The REINS Act simply requires an up or down vote by Congress on any \ncostly regulation proposed by a federal agency before it is allowed to \ntake effect.\n  This is a common sense check on regulators who too often ignore the \nimpact of their job-killing regulations.\n  The United States was founded on the principle of separation of \npowers, a system that exists to protect the people from the unchecked, \nunilateral actions of a faceless bureaucracy.\n  Unfortunately, the current Administration has issued regulations at \nrecord levels and ventured into new regulatory areas that go far beyond \nthe originally authorized regulatory authority.\n  The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the \nlast five years, the Obama Administration has issued 82 ``major \nrules''--or rules with more than $100 million in economic impact--each \nyear.\n  Bureaucratic red tape and costly mandates have forced small \nbusinesses to close up shop, have resulted in other businesses laying \noff workers and have made U.S. businesses less competitive.\n  America's job-creators and small businesses are the lifeblood of our \ncommunities, and our economy, and we cannot stand by and let them be \noverrun by rules and regulations. It's time to rein in the regulators \nand bring some accountability to their unchecked power.\n  The American people deserve a government that is both accountable for \ntheir actions and one that operates under a structure meant to protect \ntheir freedoms.\n  I believe it's time that we stand up and put a stop to this abuse of \npower, and the REINS Act is a critical step towards the achievement of \nthat goal.\n  I'm standing with hard-working Americans, the nation's small \nbusinesses and America's job-creators. Let's pass H.R. 427 and restore \ncommon sense in our government.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise today support of H.R. 427, the \nRegulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2015.\n  In the two terms of the Obama Administration thus far, the Executive \nBranch has issued increasingly costly regulations on a variety of \nissues, without much thought to the devastating effects on the economy.\n  The REINS Act would give Congress, and therefore the people, the \npower to determine whether all major regulations that have an estimated \neconomic impact of over $100 million, significant adverse effects on \nemployment, or a major increase in costs for consumers take effect. \nThis would return Congress to a proper role of oversight.\n  As a small businessman, I know firsthand the crippling impact of an \noverzealous federal government. The REINS Act would finally empower \nmembers of Congress to engage in the rulemaking process and return our \nregulatory scheme to a common sense one that promotes economic growth, \ncreates jobs, and increases wages for working families in the First \nDistrict of Iowa while protecting our natural resources, environment, \nand health.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to enact \nthis pro-growth legislation that assists job creators across my \ndistrict and across America.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an \noriginal bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule the \namendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on \nthe Judiciary, printed in the bill, modified by the amendment printed \nin part A of House Report 114-230. That amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as \nfollows:\n\n                                H.R. 427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the \n     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for \n     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 \n     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all \n     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has \n     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing \n     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability \n     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in \n     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted \n     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and \n     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the \n     American people for the laws imposed upon them.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 3, insert after ``shall'' the following: \n     ``publish in the Federal Register a list of information on \n     which the rule is based, including data, scientific and \n     economic studies, and cost-benefit analyses, and identify how \n     the public can access such information online, and shall''.\n\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Chairman Goodlatte, for his kindness in allowing \nme to come forward with an amendment here.\n  My amendment is quite simple, and I believe it should be bipartisan. \nMy amendment, quite simply, requires agencies to make available on the \nInternet the data, the science, studies, and analyses that a major rule \nis based on.\n  This transparency allows everyone access to the source information \nand the same information so we can all be on the same page when we talk \nabout these things. No one is left in the dark.\n  You know, Iowans ask me--and I am sure the same questions are asked \nto other Members when they are home--How do regulations come to these \nconclusions? How do these regulators get to where they get to when they \ndo these regulations? What science or data do they use? Is it sound \nscience?\n  They want to see the same data and science. They ask me: Well, can we \nsee it, too? And I don't have a good answer for them at the time. But I \nwant to make sure that they do.\n  So this amendment allows Americans to see that science that the \nregulators use. My amendment helps answer these questions by simply \nmaking this information available.\n  Federal regulations affect every aspect of a hard-working American's \nday, from the moment they wake up until they go to bed at night.\n  They affect America's job creators, big and small, with sometimes \nexorbitant costs in order to comply, but also devastating costs of lost \nopportunities to grow their businesses and create more jobs.\n  Federal regulations have an enormous, a giant, impact on the health \nof our national economy to the tune of $1.88 trillion in 2014. Federal \nregulation is a constantly growing entity.\n  The Code of Federal Regulations, as we know, is monstrous in size, \ncost and effect on our economy, and our job creators and on the bank \naccounts of hard-working Americans.\n  I have a real dedicated interest in tackling this issue of \nregulations because they affect our rights and the economy, and I am \nwilling to work with anyone on these issues.\n  I have other ideas. I think we should know who these regulators are, \nwho is writing these rules and regs, what is their background.\n  We, as Members, put our names on amendments and bills, but we don't \nknow the names of the people who are writing these regulations. Those \nare ideas that I have, also.\n  We do financial disclosure reports here in Congress. Members do as \nwell as our senior staff. I think we should consider the impact that \nthis would have on those who do these regulations, making them do a \nfinancial disclosure report. These are just some of the ideas.\n  But today my amendment is about making sure the science and data that \nthese regulators, what they come to a conclusion on, are made available \nto the public so we can all be on the same page and there is \ntransparency and we are not left in the dark.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Iowa.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, this Young amendment looks eerily familiar \nto the so-called Secret Science Reform Act, H.R. 1030, that the House \npassed in a partisan vote back in March, except the problem is that \nthis bill is actually even worse.\n  H.R. 1030 would have applied these harmful restrictions to the EPA, \nbut this amendment that we are looking at today would affect every \nsingle Federal agency.\n  Let's look. The amendment would require an agency, as part of its \nrulemaking process, to make all information used in the creation of a \nrule publicly accessible, including all of the data.\n  That would mean that any data that is considered confidential, such \nas health information or business records, would most likely become off \nlimits.\n  So, for example, an agency trying to create labeling requirements for \ntoxic chemicals wouldn't be able to use a study that uses personal \nhealth data as long as that data is deemed confidential.\n  New scientific methods and data could be restricted because the \ninformation includes data protected by intellectual property laws.\n  When we passed the Secret Science Act on a partisan vote last March, \nI mentioned in my opposition that it would force the EPA to choose \nbetween protecting our health and environment and maintaining the \nprivacy of patient medical records and the confidentiality of business \nrecords. And if that argument isn't enough, let's consider the costs.\n  When the House Science Committee was considering the bill that I \nmentioned previously, the Secret Science Act that does exactly the same \nthing that the Young amendment does, except to all Federal agencies, \nDemocrats on the committee pointed out that the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimated just for that one bill that it would cost the EPA $250 \nmillion to comply with the new regulations.\n  If that is how much it is going to cost the EPA for one regulatory \nrequirement, imagine what the cost would be if you expand this mandate \nacross every single Federal agency. The cost would be astronomical.\n  Between the cost and the harmful restrictions that this imposes on \nour Federal agencies, the amendment sets up an impossible hurdle for \nthose agencies to overcome.\n  We are asking them to decide between compromising institutional \nreview board ethics and doing their job to protect the American people.\n\n[[Page H5556]]\n\n  It is very clear that the Young amendment and provisions like it are \nnot, in fact, about transparency. It really is to block Federal \nagencies from doing their jobs, their jobs of protecting our air, \ngiving us clean water, making sure that our food supply is safe, \nchecking on medical devices so that they don't harm us, our \nprescription drugs so that they don't make us sick, our privacy \nsafeguards for our workplace information, our workplace safety \nstandards, protections against Wall Street and its predatory lending \npractices.\n  I would ask my colleagues to oppose this harmful and antiscience \namendment, oppose the final bill, and oppose this amendment because of \nthe restrictions that it would place on the American people.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, how much time is left?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maryland has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, this amendment I oppose. It would \nrequire agencies to publish in the Federal Register a list of \ninformation on which a rule is based, including data, scientific and \neconomic studies, cost-benefit analyses, and where the public can \naccess this information online.\n  While this amendment purports to make scientific information \navailable that is used in developing a rule, the amendment does not \ndefine or limit what would actually constitute the term ``data.''\n\n  As a result, the term could include sensitive health data, classified \ndata, confidential business information, and all other forms of \ninformation subject to a rulemaking by any Federal agency.\n  Especially in light of the recent disclosure that the personal and \nsensitive information of millions of Federal employees maintained by \nthe Office of Personnel Management was hacked, Congress should be \nworking to prevent Federal data breaches by reducing the accumulation \nand potential loss of sensitive data rather than requiring that the \npublication of such vast amounts of sensitive data be the rule of law.\n  We just simply cannot afford that in this day and time. In sum, this \namendment would exacerbate the risk of identity theft and data \nbreaches.\n  For those reasons, I must oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto do so as well.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Goodlatte).\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I support his \namendment.\n  Mr. Chair, the REINS Act restores to Congress the accountability for \nregulatory decisions that impose major burdens on our economy. By doing \nthat, it ultimately strengthens the ability of the people to hold \nWashington accountable.\n  There could hardly be a better way to ensure that Congress will \nexercise its authority under the bill soundly and that the people can \nhold Congress and Washington accountable than through the gentleman's \namendment.\n  This amendment guarantees that, when agencies publish new \nregulations, they will let Congress and the people know immediately how \nto access online the key scientific, economic, and cost-benefit \ninformation on which the agencies base the regulations.\n  With this real-time access to information in hand, Congress will be \nbetter positioned to scrutinize the agencies' decisions, and the public \nwill be better positioned to hold Congress accountable if Congress \napproves regulations that it shouldn't.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, Americans deserve to know how they \nare being regulated and the science that is being used to affect our \ndaily lives.\n  Right now we are left in the dark, Mr. Chairman. We need sunlight. \nSunlight is the best disinfectant here. We are unable right now to \nchallenge what we can't see, and that is a hard fight for the American \npeople to put up against.\n  I am urging favorability for this amendment. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Iowa (Mr. Young).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be postponed.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-230.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, beginning on line 12, strike ``sections 804(2)(A), \n     804(2)(B), and 804(2)(C)'' and insert ``clauses (i) through \n     (iii) of section 804(2)(A) or within section 804(2)(B)''.\n       Page 18, beginning on line 11, strike ``the \n     Administrator'', and insert ``--''\n       ``(A) the Administrator''.\n       Page 18, line 15, by redesignating subparagraph (A) as \n     clause (i).\n       Page 18, line 17, by redesignating subparagraph (B) as \n     clause (ii).\n       Page 18, line 21, by redesignating subparagraph (C) as \n     clause (iii).\n       Page 18, line 25, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; or''.\n       Page 18, insert after line 25 the following:\n       ``(B) is made under the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (Pub. Law 111-148).''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, as I have traveled across the \nEighth District of Missouri, one of the largest concerns I hear from my \nconstituents is the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act.\n  Individuals are concerned about how the relationship with their \ndoctor will change and how their healthcare costs are rising. \nBusinesses are left with uncertainty as well.\n  They are afraid to hire folks because of the healthcare costs, which \nleaves them understaffed. Hospitals are consolidating, and insurers are \nmerging as a result of the law.\n  The simple truth is that my constituents have fewer options. The \nAffordable Care Act is hurting health care and hurting jobs in Missouri \nand across the country.\n  That is why I am offering an amendment to protect families and job \ncreators from the mounting uncertainty of the Affordable Care Act.\n  My amendment revises the definition of a major regulation to \nspecifically include any regulation made under the Affordable Care Act. \nWith over 3,000 pages of Federal regulations already issued and many \nmore to follow, Congress must protect folks from this troublesome law \nand keep it from causing further damage to our healthcare system.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is a broad bipartisan concern to the Affordable \nCare Act. This administration has demonstrated its own uncertainty \nthrough the delays to several key provisions of the bill.\n  Congress must stand up for the folks back home and give the American \npeople a voice. My amendment does just that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment because \nit would make the REINS Act thoroughly problematic insofar as the \nAffordable Care Act is concerned.\n  One of my principal concerns about the REINS Act is it would \njeopardize the health and safety of Americans by substantially delaying \nand possibly derailing critical regulations from ever going into \neffect.\n  As currently drafted, the REINS Act only applies to major \nregulations, that is, regulations having an annual effect of $100 \nmillion or more on the economy; regulations causing a major increase in \nprices or costs for consumers,\n\n[[Page H5557]]\n\nindividual industries, governmental agencies, or geographic regions; \nand regulations having a significant adverse impact on competition, \nemployment, investment, and productivity.\n  This amendment, however, would subject all regulations, not just \nmajor regulations issued under the Affordable Care Act, to the REINS \nAct's burdensome requirements.\n  It is obvious that this amendment has a different purpose. It is yet \nanother attempt by the majority to undermine the implementation of the \ncomprehensive healthcare reform legislation that was enacted in 2010, \nthe Affordable Care Act, which, I might remind my colleagues, has been \nupheld not once, but twice, by the United States Supreme Court.\n  We cannot allow the majority to do through this antiregulatory bill \nwhat it has repeatedly failed to do during the last 4 years, namely, to \ndefeat healthcare reform. The REINS Act is a hopelessly flawed bill, \nand this amendment would only make it worse.\n  Accordingly, I must strenuously object to the amendment and oppose \nthe amendment. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against it.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and \nI support his amendment.\n  The REINS Act restores to Congress the accountability for regulatory \ndecisions that impose major burdens on our economy. This amendment \nstrengthens congressional accountability for regulations under the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as \nObamaCare.\n  The PPACA was imposed over the will of the American people. \nImplementation of ObamaCare has demonstrated that the act imposes a \ndetrimental and unworkable reform of the Nation's healthcare system; \nand one after the other, promises made to the American people by the \nact's supporters when the law was passed have been broken.\n  Moreover, the Obama administration's own actions to waive or suspend \nObamaCare requirements have made clear that regulatory actions to \nimplement the act form a ``seamless web.'' Too often, actions to avoid \none adverse effect of the act's implementation send ripple effects of \nunfairness or other harmful consequences throughout the ObamaCare web, \nrequiring adjustments of other aspects of implementation. This, too, \njustifies the amendment's requirement that Congress approve any new \nregulations promulgated under the act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, this amendment protects the \nfolks back home. It stops the Obama administration and unelected \nbureaucrats from issuing major new healthcare regulations, and it \nimproves the role of congressional oversight.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Smith).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri will be postponed.\n\n\n        Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-230.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 24, insert before the semicolon the following: \n     ``, including an analysis of any jobs added or lost, \n     differentiating between public and private sector jobs''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Excessive government regulations are a significant barrier to private \nsector job creation. This Congress has made job creation a priority \nand, therefore, we believe it is important to have a role in reviewing \nthese regulations to ensure that their proposed benefits outweigh any \npotential economic harm.\n  The Sessions-Davis-Wenstrup-Barr amendment would require an agency's \nreport to Congress to include an assessment of estimated jobs gained or \nlost as a result of the implementation of a rule. These agencies would \nalso be required to specify whether those jobs will come from the \npublic or private sector. This assessment will be part of the cost-\nbenefit analysis required to be submitted to the Comptroller General \nand made available to each House of Congress prior to consideration of \na rule.\n  Over the past 6 years, our Nation's cumulative regulatory burden has \nincreased exponentially; and, unfortunately, this out-of-control \nadministration has shown no signs of slowing down. The addition of 27 \nmajor new rules last year brought the administration's 6-year total to \nan astounding 184 new regulations. This has cost the country thousands \nof jobs and an estimated $80 billion annually.\n  When regulations are considered for approval under the REINS Act, it \nis imperative that Congress have a clear picture of their effect on \njobs. This amendment will help us guard against job-killing regulations \nand will give Congress important oversight over the executive branch's \nregulatory agenda.\n  At this time, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Yoder). The gentleman from Georgia is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would mandate \nthat the cost-benefit analysis for a proposed rule required by the \nREINS Act that is submitted to Congress include an analysis of any jobs \nadded or lost as a result of the proposed rule, differentiating between \npublic and private sector jobs.\n  I should be clear that there is absolutely no credible evidence \nproving that regulations depress job creation. In fact, one of the \nmajority's own witnesses at a hearing held in a prior Congress before \nthe House Judiciary Committee clearly debunked the myth that \nregulations stymie job growth and job creation. Christopher DeMuth of \nthe American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, stated in \nhis prepared testimony that the ``focus on jobs . . . can lead to \nconfusion in regulatory debates'' and that ``the employment effects of \nregulation, while important, are indeterminate.''\n  Even Bruce Bartlett, a senior policy analyst in the Reagan and George \nHerbert Walker Bush administrations, has refuted the claim that \nregulations undermine the economy or job growth. He explains that ``no \nhard evidence is offered for this claim; it is simply asserted as self-\nevident and repeated endlessly throughout the conservative echo \nchamber.''\n  While I appreciate the sensitivity that the author of this amendment \nhas for employment and job development, I would encourage him to \nsupport my amendment, which would except from the REINS Act's onerous \nrequirements all regulations that the Office of Management and Budget \ndetermines would result in net job development.\n  My amendment would ensure that job creating rules are not delayed or \nderailed as a result of the REINS Act's nearly impossible procedural \nhurdles.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment could add even more analytical burdens \non agencies by forcing them to make a speculative assessment of whether \na regulation will facilitate job creation or have a depressive effect.\n  Instead of trying to turn Congress into a superadministrative agency, \nwhich is what the REINS Act would do, we should be considering \nlegislation that would actually create jobs, stimulate our Nation's \neconomy, and help\n\n[[Page H5558]]\n\nmillions of struggling Americans regain their financial footing with \nmeaningful ways to encourage full employment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how \nmuch time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, at this point, I yield \nsuch time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nGoodlatte), my friend, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and \nI support his amendment.\n  The bill restores to Congress the accountability for regulatory \ndecisions that impose major burdens on our economy. As Congress makes \nthose decisions, one of the most important factors to consider is \nwhether new regulations produce jobs or destroy them.\n  The bill requires that when agencies submit new regulations to \nCongress, they will also submit their cost-benefit analyses of the \nregulations. The amendment guarantees that each of those analyses will \ninclude a specific assessment of the jobs the regulations create and \nthe jobs the regulations destroy, distinguishing between private sector \nand public sector jobs.\n  With that information, Congress will be in a better position to \ndetermine whether to approve the rules, and the American people will be \nin a better position to hold Congress accountable for its decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote for this commonsense amendment. I think it is only \nright to require very costly and burdensome regulations being created \nby this administration's regulatory environment to actually show the \ntaxpayers the cost benefit of what the executive branch's decision is \ngoing to be on the taxpayers of this country.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-230.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 10, insert after ``means any rule'' the \n     following: ``(other than a special rule)''.\n       Page 19, line 2, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and includes any special rule''.\n       Page 20, after line 8, insert the following:\n       ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule that the \n     Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget determines \n     would result in net job growth.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would except from \nH.R. 427 all rules that the Office of Management and Budget determines \nwould result in net job creation.\n  As with many other deregulatory bills we have considered this \nCongress, the proponents of H.R. 427 argue that it will grow the \neconomy, create jobs, and increase America's competitiveness \ninternationally.\n  But we cannot pretend that this politicized legislation is about \neconomic growth or American prosperity.\n  As I have noted during the consideration of each of the \nantiregulatory bills that we have considered in the 114th Congress, \nthere is simply no credible evidence in support of the majority's \nreiteration of ``job-killing'' regulations undermining economic \ngrowth--zero.\n  The tired rhetoric that my Republican colleagues have repeated again \nand again since the passage of the REINS Act in 2011 has not changed in \nlight of the changing facts on the ground.\n  The latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that \nunemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent. While there is more work to do \nto grow the economy and help our Nation's middle class, there have been \n64 straight months of private sector job growth. That is 12.8 million \nprivate sector jobs created amidst a regulatory environment that is \nproworker, proenvironment, propublic health and prosafety, and \nproinnovation.\n  And to those who would brush aside these strong employment figures, \nthe Department of Labor also reported last week that claims for \nunemployment benefits have dropped to the lowest levels in over 40 \nyears, the lowest level since November of 1973.\n  Do these numbers mean that the major rules adopted during the Obama \nadministration have decreased employment, grown the economy, or \ncontributed to the drop in unemployment benefit claims?\n  While I would submit that regulations have a positive effect on \nsustainable economic growth, the reality is that there is little \ncorrelation between regulations and the economy.\n  Don't just take my word for it; take the word of the San Francisco \nand New York Federal Reserve Banks, which found zero correlation \nbetween employment and regulation.\n  Take the word of Bruce Bartlett, a senior policy analyst in the \nReagan and George Herbert Walker Bush administrations, who strongly \nrefuted the claim that regulations undermine the economy or job growth, \nexplaining that Republicans ``assert that Barack Obama has unleashed a \ntidal wave of new regulations, which has created uncertainty among \nbusinesses and prevents them from investing and hiring. No hard \nevidence is offered for this claim; it is simply asserted as self-\nevident and repeated endlessly throughout the conservative echo \nchamber.''\n  Take the word of the Washington Post, which gave ``two Pinnochios'' \nto industry estimates of the costs of regulations earlier this year.\n  Take the word of the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \nwhich debunked claims that regulations have a trillion dollar cost to \nthe economy.\n  Mr. Chairman, we need real solutions to help real people, not yet \nanother thinly veiled handout to large corporations and the economic \nelite.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and to oppose H.R. 427.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the amendment carves out of the REINS \nAct's congressional approval procedures regulations that the Office of \nManagement and Budget determines will lead to net job creation.\n  The danger in the amendment is the strong incentive it gives the OMB \nto manipulate its analysis of a major regulation's jobs impacts. Far \ntoo often, the OMB will be tempted to shade the analysis to skirt the \nbill's congressional approval requirement.\n  In addition, regulations alleged to create net new jobs often do so \nby destroying real, existing jobs and creating new, hoped-for jobs \nassociated with regulatory compliance.\n  For example, some Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Act rules \nwill shut down existing power plants. The EPA and the OMB may attempt \nto justify that with claims that more new ``green'' jobs will be \ncreated as a result.\n  In the end, that is just another way in which government picks the \njobs winners and the jobs losers, and there is no guarantee that all of \nthe new ``green'' jobs will ever actually exist.\n  The REINS Act is not intended to force any particular outcome. It \ndoes not choose between clean air and dirty air. It does not choose \nbetween new jobs and old jobs. Instead, the REINS Act chooses between \ntwo ways of making laws. It chooses the way the Framers intended, in \nwhich accountability for laws with major economic impacts rests with \nthe Congress--the elected Representatives of the people.\n\n[[Page H5559]]\n\n  It rejects the way Washington has operated for too long, where there \nis no accountability because decisions are made by unelected agency \nofficials.\n  The amendment would undermine that fundamental accountability, so I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, to the extent that a regulation \nwould or would not present a choice between clean air and dirty air, I \nthink we can all, in unison, conclude that we would come down in favor \nof clean air.\n  If the choice became whether or not a regulation would promote clean \nwater or dirty water, then I am sure that most Americans would agree \nwith me that we would want a regulation that would ensure clean \ndrinking water.\n  Unfortunately, if the REINS Act passes, the jobs that will be created \nby the regulations which would enforce the requirement that air and \nwater be clean will not come to pass. We would do without the jobs, and \nwe would have dirty water and dirty air.\n  I would submit that my colleagues on the other side run to the \nsupport of my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the \nunderlying bill, which would be badly undermined by this amendment, \nwhich would remove from Congress the ability to determine which \nregulations make sense and which don't, which regulations comport with \nthe underlying law that the Congress passed and which do not.\n  That is the key to this legislation, and it is the key to why Members \nshould oppose this amendment. I urge them to do so.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mrs. Capps\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-230.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 10, insert after ``any rule'' the following: \n     ``(other than a special rule)''.\n       Page 19, line 2, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and includes a special rule''.\n       Page 20, insert after line 8 the following:\n       ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule intended to \n     ensure the safety of natural gas or hazardous material \n     pipelines or prevent, mitigate, or reduce the impact of \n     spills from such pipelines.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Mrs. Capps) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple and straightforward. \nIt would ensure that oil and gas pipeline safety rules and pipeline \nspill prevention or mitigation rules are not considered ``major rules'' \nunder this bill.\n  By design, the REINS Act would likely delay or stop virtually all \nfuture Federal rulemaking. We could spend hours listening to some of \nthe countless health and safety problems that this bill would cause. I \ncommend my colleagues for raising some of these issues in the other \namendments that are being offered today and debated.\n  My amendment focuses on protecting oil and gas pipeline safety and \nspill mitigation rules from the needless and costly delays imposed by \nthis bill. These rules are particularly important to me and to my \nconstituents in the wake of the recent oil spill in my district.\n  On May 19, line 901 of the Plains All American pipeline ruptured just \nnorth of Santa Barbara, California; and it spewed over 100,000 gallons \nof crude oil onto Refugio State Beach and the surrounding areas. At \nleast 20,000 gallons of the oil spilled into the Pacific Ocean and \nspread along nearly 100 miles of pristine California coastline, \ndevastating local wildlife, covering our beaches in thick tar, and \nclosing valuable fisheries.\n  One of the other tragedies of this spill is that it likely could have \nbeen prevented--or at least minimized--if the pipeline had been using \nstate-of-the-art automatic shutoff and leak detection technologies.\n  These systems are available and are already in use in other pipelines \nin the area, but this pipeline does not have these technologies because \nits Federal regulator--the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \nAdministration, or PHMSA--currently does not require the use of these \nsafety systems.\n  Like many communities across the country, the central coast of \nCalifornia, which I represent, has called for action. The good news is \nthat Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has listened and has demanded \naction to improve pipeline safety rules.\n  In 2011, we came together and unanimously passed the Pipeline Safety, \nRegulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act, which required PHMSA to \nissue 42 new pipeline safety standards; yet, 4 years later, PHMSA has \nyet to complete 16 of these requirements, including the rules to \nstrengthen standards on automatic shutoff and leak detection systems.\n  This unacceptable delay has not been lost on this Congress. Just 2 \nweeks ago, we held a bipartisan hearing in the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee on the long overdue implementation of these pipeline safety \nstandards.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats chided PHMSA for dragging its feet \nbecause we all agree that these rules are long overdue and must be \ncompleted as soon as possible. It is baffling now that, just 2 weeks \nafter this bipartisan hearing, we find ourselves considering a bill \nthat would delay these pipeline rules even further.\n  Let's be clear. That is exactly what the REINS Act would do. My \namendment would protect these important safety standards from the added \nlayers of bureaucracy that the REINS Act would impose.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me again today, as they did 2 \nweeks ago, in working to ensure that PHMSA is not further delayed in \nfulfilling its obligations. They can do this by voting for this \namendment, which would simply ensure oil and gas pipeline safety rules \nare not considered ``major rules'' under the REINS Act. It would not \nexempt these rules from the main reporting requirements, but it would \nminimize the additional delays created by the bill.\n  If this bill were to become law as written, PHMSA's pipeline safety \nrules would not take effect until both the House and the Senate \naffirmatively voted to approve them, but both the House and the Senate \nalready voted unanimously in 2011 to require PHMSA to write these \nrules. Going around and around in circles makes no sense.\n  Mr. Chairman, supporters of this bill claim that the REINS Act is all \nabout more efficient and effective government. How is it more efficient \nor effective to require Congress to reconsider and reapprove rules that \nit has already voted unanimously to establish?\n  The simple truth is that the REINS Act is not about efficient or \neffective government. It is a partisan gimmick that will do nothing but \ngum up the works and needlessly delay important health and safety rules \nthat our constituents depend on.\n  My amendment won't make this a good bill--and I intend to oppose its \nfinal passage--but my amendment would at least help to ensure that the \nREINS Act does not delay oil and gas pipeline safety standards any more \nthan they already have been. This is something which, I hope, we can \nall agree on; so I urge my colleagues to stop the delays and support my \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to carve out from \nthe REINS Act's reforms regulations that concern natural gas or \nhazardous materials pipeline safety or the prevention of oil spills and \ntheir adverse impacts.\n\n[[Page H5560]]\n\n  We all support pipeline safety and the prevention of harm from \npipeline spills, but there is no assurance that the amendment would \nguarantee the achievement of those goals.\n  On the contrary, the amendment would shield from congressional \naccountability procedures regulations that actually threaten to \ndecrease safety. They also would shield from the bill's congressional \napproval requirements new, ideologically driven regulations intended to \nimpede Americans' access to new sources of inexpensive, clean, and \nplentiful natural gas.\n  This amendment clearly says that the Congress can and has voted to \nhave pipeline accountability and safety measures regulated but that the \nCongress doesn't care what those regulations are.\n  The Congress does care what the regulations are, and that is why they \nshould come back here so that the Congress can confirm that the \nregulations written comport with the legislation already passed. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, as I stated earlier, this amendment is \nstraightforward and common sense.\n  There is broad, bipartisan agreement that stronger oil and gas \npipeline safety standards are long overdue. I hope there is similar \nagreement that further delaying these safety rules puts communities \nlike mine in California and hundreds of communities across the country \nat risk.\n  My amendment would simply ensure that these safety rules are not \nsubject to the needless, burdensome delays created by the REINS Act. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  The REINS Act is intended to make sure that Federal Government \nregulations get it right--solve the problem intended to be solved by \nthe Congress in the manner intended by the Congress.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 10, insert after ``means any rule'' the \n     following: ``(other than a special rule)''.\n       Page 19, line 2, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and includes any special rule''.\n       Page 20, after line 8, insert the following:\n       ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule relating to \n     protection of the public health or safety.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment to H.R. 427 would exempt \nrules concerning public health or safety from the onerous requirements \nof this legislation.\n  It is simply an acknowledgment that, when a rule is necessary to \nprotect public health and when it is beneficial and in the public \ninterest, the rule be put into effect without unnecessary delay.\n  If this legislation is enacted without this amendment, it will create \na regulatory environment that will make it nearly impossible for \nagencies to safeguard the public well-being.\n  For instance, the Department of Transportation implemented an \neconomically significant rule for the implementation of positive train \ncontrol systems on January 15, 2010. This safety feature is designed to \ncorrect operator errors and to slow or to stop a train in order to \nprevent train-to-train collisions and overspeed derailments.\n  Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board have said \nthat this technology is necessary to prevent accidents like the \nderailment of an Amtrak commuter train in Philadelphia on May 12 of \n2015, which killed 7 people and injured 200 more; yet, under the REINS \nAct, this vital technology would require a joint congressional \nresolution, with an unrealistic timeline for implementation, before \nbeing mandated, needlessly putting the lives of millions of Americans \nat risk who ride Amtrak every year.\n  Proponents of this legislation may argue that H.R. 427 contains an \nemergency exemption which allows a major rule to temporarily take \neffect following an executive order stating that there is an imminent \nthreat to public health and safety.\n  However, as the positive train control system rule illustrates, not \nevery threat to the public welfare will manifest itself overnight, and \nnot every agency's rule is implemented as a reaction to a product \nrecall or to a sudden tragedy.\n  Even when a threat is not imminent, the fundamental responsibility to \nprotect the public health and well-being remains. This legislation \nwould substantially hinder the ability of agencies to fulfill this \nobligation, placing Americans at greater risk for the benefit of \ncorporate interests.\n  In its present form, the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards--an \nalliance of more than 150 consumer, labor, faith, and other public \ninterest groups--has characterized the REINS Act as ``the most radical \nthreat in generations to our government's ability to protect the public \nfrom harm.''\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Echoing this analysis, 83 of our Nation's top administrative and \nenvironmental law professors describe this legislation as ``unnecessary \nto establish agency accountability and unwise as a matter of public \npolicy because it undercuts the implementation of laws intended to \nprotect people and the environment.''\n  While my amendment will not cure all the flaws in this legislation, \nit will address one of the most glaring problems and preserve the \nability of agencies to protect public health and safety.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment exempts from the bill any \nrule pertaining to health or public safety.\n  Health and public safety regulation, done properly, serves important \ngoals, and the bill does nothing to frustrate the effective achievement \nof those goals.\n  But Federal health and public safety regulation constitutes an \nimmense part of total Federal regulation and has been the source of \nmany of the most abusive, unnecessarily expensive, and job- and wage-\ndestroying regulations.\n  To remove these areas of regulation from the bill would be to \nseverely weaken the bill's important reforms to lower the crushing \ncumulative cost of Federal regulation and increase the accountability \nof our regulatory system to the people.\n  These include regulations such as the Environmental Protection \nAgency's multi-billion-dollar Utility MACT regulations. The Supreme \nCourt recently invalidated those regulations, but not before the \ntargets of the regulations had to spend multiple years' worth of \ncompliance costs.\n  Had the REINS Act been in place, Congress could have refused to \napprove those regulations to begin with, saving billions of dollars in \nunnecessary cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I just would say, in conclusion, that the\n\n[[Page H5561]]\n\namendment will, in fact, strengthen the ability of Federal agencies to \nprotect the public health and well-being, and there are instances, as \nthe example I just gave, where the failure to act will endanger the \nlives of Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to improve a badly \nflawed piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I urge support \nfor the legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Cicilline\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-230.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment as the \ndesignee of my colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who \nregrettably is unable to be with us today.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 10, insert after ``any rule'' the following: \n     ``(other than a special rule)''.\n       Page 19, line 2, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and includes a special rule''.\n       Page 20, insert after line 8 the following:\n       ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule that pertains \n     to the safety of any products specifically designed to be \n     used or consumed by a child under the age of 2 years \n     (including cribs, car seats, and infant formula).''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, this amendment improves H.R. 427 by \nexempting those regulations that are critical to protecting the health \nand safety of infants.\n  More specifically, the Jackson Lee amendment provides a special rule \npertaining to the safety of any product specifically designed to be \nused or consumed by a child under the age of 2 years, which includes \ncribs, car seats, and infant formula.\n  As a member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial and Antitrust Law, I am very concerned about the REINS Act \nand the complications and delays to the rulemaking process it would \ncreate regarding regulations that would protect the health and safety \nof children.\n  This legislation would amend the Congressional Review Act to prohibit \na major rule from going into effect unless Congress enacts a joint \nresolution of approval within 70 legislative days. Otherwise, the rule \ndoes not go into effect.\n  Effectively, no regulations will ever be enacted because it is \nextremely difficult, if not impossible, to move any proposed \nlegislation through Congress within 70 days.\n  Moreover, subjecting agencies to additional reporting requirements \nand congressional review, as mandated by H.R. 427, would not only be \nwasteful, it could be damaging or even deadly, especially when it comes \nto regulations designed to protect children and infants.\n  For example, much like the version of the bill that we debated in \nprevious sessions, the REINS Act would delay product safety rules \naffecting family products like toys, cribs, and children's clothing.\n  In particular, restrictions put forth in H.R. 427 could result in \nfurther delay to agencies attempting to take action to protect children \nas it relates to harmful and deadly products, such as safety caps on \nmedicine, flammable clothing, and tipping furniture, just to name a \nfew.\n  Notably, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that a \nchild dies every 2 weeks from furniture or TVs tipping over, and \ninjuries from falling furniture occur every 24 minutes.\n  We cannot afford to put the lives and safety of infants, toddlers, \nand children at risk while Congress entangles any real possibility for \nimmediate and preventive action.\n  The REINS Act is strongly opposed by many individuals and \norganizations all across the country, including opposition by more than \n450,000 members and supporters of the Center for Science and Democracy \nat the Union of Concerned Scientist, as well as 83 academics in the \nfield of administrative and environmental law, and an alliance of more \nthan 150 consumer, labor, research, faith, and other public interest \ngroups representing the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards.\n  We should not hinder the democratic process and stymie regulatory \nagencies' ability to protect the safety and security of the American \npeople, especially infants.\n  At a minimum, regulations promulgated to protect the safety of \ninfants and children should not be subjected to the strictures of H.R. \n47.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment protects children and infants. I urge all \nMembers to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to carve out from \nthe REINS Act's reforms regulations intended to protect young children \nand infants from harm.\n  Child safety is a goal all Members share, but to shield bureaucrats \nwho write child safety regulations from accountability to Congress is \nno way to guarantee child safety.\n  The only thing that that would guarantee is less careful \ndecisionmaking and more insulation of faceless bureaucrats from the \npublic.\n  Congress needs a better mechanism to make sure that Washington \nbureaucrats make the right decision to protect child safety when we \ndelegate legislative authority to regulatory agencies.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bad amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, no one is attempting to shield bureaucrats \nfrom anything. This amendment is designed to shield infants, to protect \nchildren.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the elected Representatives of the \npeople are the best ones to be held accountable for the laws and \nregulations passed and adopted in this country, including those that \nprotect children.\n  This would turn back to a situation where unelected bureaucrats can \ntake whatever time they want to, write whatever regulation they want \nto, and then that would take effect without the Congress having to have \nthe ability to say, yes, that truly will protect children or, no, that \nwill not protect children.\n  We should have that responsibility. That is something that the \nAmerican people expect from their elected representatives. For that \nreason, I oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island \nwill be postponed.\n  The Chair understands that amendment No. 8 will not be offered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Nadler\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-230.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made in \norder under the rule.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 10, insert after ``any rule'' the following: \n     ``(other than a special rule)''.\n\n[[Page H5562]]\n\n       Page 19, line 2, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and includes a special rule''.\n       Page 20, insert after line 8 the following:\n       ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule pertaining to \n     nuclear reactor safety standards.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Nadler) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This amendment would exempt any rule pertaining to nuclear reactor \nsafety standards from the new onerous approval process created by the \nbill.\n  In other words, my amendment would allow the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, the NRC, to continue to issue rules under the current \nsystem, thereby making it easier to protect Americans from nuclear \ndisaster.\n  Today's bill, in the name of so-called reform, adds new procedural \nhoops that agencies and departments must go through before regulation \ncan be issued, including requiring a joint resolution of approval for \nevery major rule.\n  The result is simply to impede, obstruct, and delay the attempt of \ngovernment to accomplish one of its most basic functions: to protect \nthe health and welfare of its citizens.\n  Not surprisingly, groups who care about protecting public health, \nsafety, and environment, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, \nPublic Citizen, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, oppose this \nbill.\n  According to the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which represents \na coalition of many such groups, this bill ``is nothing more than a \nback-door way to gut enforcement of existing legislation and future \nsafeguards that big-money interests do not want. It would force \nCongress to refight its previous debates, wasting time and money, and \nparalyzing vital agency work.''\n  Americans should rightfully be scared that this bill will put their \nhealth and safety at risk. One example that highlights this fact is the \nsubject of this amendment: nuclear power.\n  The risks and dangers of nuclear power were made all the more real by \nthe nuclear disaster in Japan at Fukushima 4 years ago. We all watched \nin horror when that country was devastated by the earthquake and \nresulting tsunami.\n  That disaster then caused its own disaster: the meltdown of three \nreactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.\n  That led to the release of radioactive isotopes, the creation of a \n20-kilometer exclusion zone around the power plant, and the \ndisplacement of 156,000 people. Inside the evacuation zone all farming \nhas been abandoned.\n  In 2011, Virginia was struck by a relatively rare, but strong, \nearthquake, felt up and down the eastern seaboard. It caused a nuclear \npower plant near the epicenter to have to go offline.\n  For me, this concern hits close to home. A nuclear power plant, \nIndian Point, about which many people have had concerns for years, lies \njust less than 40 miles away from my New York City district.\n  There are 20 million people living within a 50-mile radius around the \nplant, the same radius used by the NRC as the basis for the evacuation \nzone recommended after the Fukushima disaster.\n  Indian Point also sits near two earthquake fault lines and, according \nto the NRC, is the most likely nuclear power plant in the country to \nexperience core damage because of an earthquake.\n  To keep my constituents and, indeed, all Americans safe, I am \noffering this amendment today.\n  Because of the catastrophes that can result from disasters, be they \nnatural or manmade, at nuclear power plants, prevention of meltdowns is \nthe key.\n  Since Fukushima, the NRC has issued new rules designed to upgrade \npower plants to withstand severe events like earthquakes and to have \nenough backup power so as to avoid a meltdown for a significant length \nof time.\n  The NRC must have the ability and flexibility to issue new \nregulations to safeguard the health and well-being of all Americans.\n  However, H.R. 427 is intentionally designed so new and vital \nregulations will likely never be put in place. We cannot permit the NRC \nto never be able to create new regulations.\n  Therefore, I urge you to support the Nadler amendment to exempt the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission from the onerous new requirements for \nrulemaking imposed by this bill. In that way, the NRC would have the \nability to safeguard public health and safety, as it should.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the amendment carves out of the REINS \nAct congressional approval procedures all regulations that pertain to \nnuclear reactor safety standards.\n  REINS Act supporters believe in nuclear safety. We want to guarantee \nthat regulatory decisions that pertain to nuclear reactor safety are \nthe best decisions that can be made, but that is precisely why I oppose \nthe amendment.\n  By its terms, the amendment shields from the REINS Act congressional \napproval procedures not only major regulations that would raise nuclear \nreactor safety standards, but, also, regulations that would lower them.\n  All major regulations pertaining to nuclear reactor safety standards, \nwhether they raise or lower standards, should fall within the REINS \nAct.\n  That way, agencies with authority over nuclear reactor safety will \nknow that Congress must approve their major regulations before they go \ninto effect.\n  That provides a powerful incentive for the agencies to write the best \npossible regulations, ones that Congress can easily approve.\n  It is a solution that everyone should support because it makes \nCongress more accountable and ensures agencies will write better rules. \nAll Americans will be safer for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Virginia has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, this bill prohibits any major regulation \nfrom going into effect unless both the House and Senate pass and the \nPresident signs a joint resolution of approval within 70 legislative \ndays.\n  If the President and the Congress fail to approve the regulation \nwithin the timeframe, it cannot take effect and a subsequent joint \nresolution for the same regulation cannot be considered for the \nremainder of the Congress.\n  Because of the unrealistic approval deadlines and the requirement \nthat both Houses approve each and every major rule, as well as the \nPresident, this bill would effectively prevent the promulgation of many \ncritical protections that ensure Americans' health, safety, and \neconomic well-being.\n  The proponents say they support regulation when it makes sense. But \nthis is a vast government. It is a vast economy. It is a vast \nsocioeconomic system.\n  To demand that Congress pass in both Houses within 70 days and the \nPresident sign a resolution of approval for every one of the thousands \nof regulations means most will never be considered.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  That is why this amendment, to say that at least where people's lives \nare at stake in large numbers, where safety regulations to prevent \nnuclear disasters or to mitigate their effects are in question, that it \nnot be subject to the same restrictive requirements that this rule \nwould put into place, which would say that most regulations would never \nget adequately considered.\n  In closing, I want to say that this amendment is absolutely necessary \nif we want to make sure that the next time there is an earthquake, God \nforbid, or some other disaster, or even just a power failure, that a \nnuclear reactor doesn't have a terrible situation, that we don't get a \nnuclear meltdown, and that if we do, regulations are in place to \nsafeguard people's lives and health.\n  I think if we are going to pass this terrible bill, the least we can \ndo is exempt nuclear safety from it. I urge all Members to support the \namendment.\n\n[[Page H5563]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, in closing, the facts speak for \nthemselves. During the course of the Obama administration, which I \nthink most people would agree has been very aggressive at imposing new \nregulations upon our economy and on our society--it has averaged 81 a \nyear, not thousands, but 81 per year.\n  I think many of us would agree that some of those regulations impose \nburdens that were not intended by the underlying legislation upon which \nthose regulations are based, and therefore this is a very manageable \nway to make sure that regulations don't kill jobs and crush our \neconomy. For that reason, I oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Pocan\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-230.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 10, insert after ``any rule'' the following: \n     ``(other than a special rule)''.\n       Page 19, line 2, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and includes a special rule''.\n       Page 20, insert after line 8 the following:\n       ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule that ensures \n     the availability of affordable medication and effective \n     healthcare management for veterans.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 380, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of myself and the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore), my colleague, I rise today to offer an amendment \nto prevent a spike in the copays that veterans pay for prescription \ndrugs as a result of this misguided bill.\n  Every year, the Department of Veterans Affairs publishes a rule to \nensure that veterans enrolled in the VA health program don't see as \nmuch as a 37.5 percent increase in their prescription drug copays. In \nthis bill, the REINS Act, if it were signed into law, it would be very \ndifficult, and perhaps impossible, for the VA to publish this \nrulemaking before January 1, 2016.\n  Let's face it, Congress doesn't exactly have a great track record on \nacting fast. I used to say, when I was in the Wisconsin Legislature, \nsometimes things move like a tortoise. In Congress, I explain they move \nmore like an upside-down tortoise.\n  Under this bill, copayments for approximately 2.4 million veterans \nwould increase significantly, causing economic hardship and health \nrisks for many veterans struggling to make ends meet.\n  If this bill were to become law, veterans with a service-connected \ndisability rating greater than 50 percent would see their prescription \ndrug copays increase more than 11 times what they were paying last \nyear. Veterans who are former prisoners of war or awarded a Purple \nHeart would see their copays go up nearly 38 percent. Veterans, who \nhave been hit hardest economically after serving their country, would \nsee their rates spike 22 percent.\n  We must ensure that those who bravely have served our country don't \nsee Congress take money out of their pockets just to score political \npoints. At this time, when we still have many veterans struggling to \nfind a job, it is irresponsible for Congress to make it more difficult \nfor the men and women who have served our country to pay more for the \nhealth care they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment carves out of the REINS \nAct's congressional approval procedures all regulations from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs that concern the availability of \naffordable medication and effective healthcare management for veterans.\n  Affordable medication and effective healthcare management for \nveterans are goals every Member of Congress can support, but every \nMember of Congress also knows the Department of Veterans Affairs' \nappalling recent incompetence and negligence in administering its \nprograms. Rather than diminish the Department's accountability to \nCongress for regulatory decisions concerning veterans' health care, we \nshould increase the Department's accountability. That is precisely what \nthe REINS Act does.\n  Under the legislation, the Department will know that Congress must \napprove its major regulations concerning affordable medication and \neffective healthcare management before they go into effect. That \nprovides a powerful incentive for the Department to write the best \npossible regulations, ones that Congress can easily approve.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 3 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, I agree with much of what the gentleman has \nsaid. The only problem is, as much as we have had some problems in the \nVA--and we need to take actions, and we are, including in Wisconsin \nwhere we have had an action that, in a bipartisan way, we have been \nworking together on--the only thing worse could be the performance of \nCongress.\n  There is a reason why the public currently rates cockroaches, head \nlice, traffic jams, zombies, and even the band Nickelback higher than \nCongress. Clearly, we do not have a performance record that shows if we \npass this bill we can absolutely guarantee that a veteran won't be \npaying more, a spike as much as 38 percent, or 11 times what they are \ncurrently paying.\n  I am not going to bet on Congress, and I am guessing the American \npublic won't bet on Congress, but we have the ability with this \namendment to at least say we are going to make sure those who have \nserved our country won't pay more for their prescription drugs if we \ndon't get our work done, because they have seen that all too often.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment says is, because the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is doing a remarkably bad job of \nproviding timely health care to citizens, we should carve out that \nDepartment's responsibility for providing medications and timely health \ncare and exempt it from the accountability that Congress, the elected \nrepresentatives of the people, who are very responsive to the needs of \nveterans, would impose.\n  With the REINS Act, Congress could instruct, with the passage of \nlegislation to help veterans, and say, ``You must report back \nregulations within a certain time period,'' which the Congress could \nthen act upon in a timely fashion, assuring themselves that not only \nhave the regulations been done quickly, but also that they are going to \naddress the problems in an effective way that we have all identified \nwith what is going on in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment which will simply \npreserve the bad system we have now for helping our veterans through a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs that is unaccountable. We should, \ninstead, make them more accountable by passing the REINS Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n\n[[Page H5564]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, because of the number of Members \nwishing to participate this evening, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, as the House begins to consider and \ndebate important energy legislation this week, I want to take just a \nmoment to reflect on the opportunities America has in energy \ndevelopment.\n  Our energy landscape has tremendously changed in recent years. Thanks \nto new innovative technologies, we have gone from a Nation of scarcity \nto one of energy abundance. Our new and existing natural resources have \ncreated jobs, lowered energy costs, and spurred new investments in \nmanufacturing and chemical industries.\n  Today the United States has an opportunity to take advantage of this \nera of energy abundance. Congress must first ensure our laws reflect \nthis new energy-abundant era so that we can fully harness our potential \nas the world's dominant energy superpower. The legislation we are \nconsidering this week will allow our country to do just that.\n  Unfortunately, the rules and regulations coming out of this \nadministration conflict with this type of energy-independent and secure \nvision. Most concerning is the Office of Surface Mining's proposed rule \nto further regulate the coal mining industry, which has already lost \nmore than 40,000 jobs since 2011. If the administration allows this \nrule to go into effect, an additional 40,000 to 78,000 coal mining jobs \nwill be at risk.\n  Dubbed the stream protection rule, this regulation will amend or \nmodify 475 existing rules and add new rules on top of that. Make no \nmistake about it. This is not an effort to protect streams. It is an \neffort to regulate the coal mining industry out of business. In fact, \nbetween 95 and 100 percent of coal operations occurring in the States \nthat account for almost 75 percent of the Nation's coal production have \nno offsite impacts.\n  So what does this rule accomplish? This rule means increased energy \ncosts for families and small businesses. At least 22 States, including \nmine, Ohio, rely on coal for their primary fuel source. Not \nsurprisingly, these States' electricity prices are well below the \nnational average. I fear, however, that will no longer be the case if \nwe allow this rule to go into effect.\n  Consequently, companies will be forced to pay more for their energy \nbills instead of hiring additional employees. Families will be forced \nto make tougher decisions as well, like paying the increasing electric \nbill or putting food on the table, clothes on the kids, and providing \nfor their education.\n  Furthermore, U.S. household income is stagnant and the economy \nremains mired by sluggish economic growth. We need to be enacting \npolicies that encourage an economic recovery, not promoting further \nstagnation by shutting down access to America's most abundant and \nlowest cost energy resource. What is worse, this is not the only \nregulation currently threatening our energy security, reliability, and \nlow electricity costs.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan will also \nchange how we generate, distribute, and consume electricity by forcing \nStates to comply with CO2 targets through a Federal takeover \nof electric power generation.\n  It is for this reason I will be voting in favor of S.J. Res. 23 and \n24 this week. These resolutions of disapproval send a clear message to \nthe President that a majority of the Senate, the House, and America do \nnot approve of higher electricity prices and an unreliable electric \ngrid.\n  Mr. Speaker, America was built on ingenuity and resourcefulness. \nUnlike the stream protection rule and the Clean Power Plan, H.R. 8, the \nNorth American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act, will encourage \nthat entrepreneurial spirit, not hinder it.\n  It will pave the way for a resurgence of manufacturing where new \ninnovative products are designed and built right here in America, and \nit will keep America in our rightful place as a leader in the global \neconomy.\n  I am proud to support this legislation, which the House will be \nconsidering this week. H.R. 8 will modernize our energy infrastructure, \nprotect the electricity grid and the delivery system, improve energy \nefficiency, and strengthen our energy diplomacy.\n  Based on language that I have introduced and that previously passed \nthe House with bipartisan support, this legislation includes a \nstreamlined process for natural gas export projects currently pending \nbefore the Department of Energy.\n  This language will help strengthen America's standing as a world-\nclass exporter of natural gas, create tens of thousands of new jobs, \nadd billions to our economy, and help our allies abroad by providing a \nreliable source of energy.\n  I am honored to lead this Special Order that will highlight the \nHouse's approach to a truly all-of-the-above domestic energy strategy, \na strategy that focuses on a secure and reliable energy sector with \naffordable electricity rates for hardworking taxpayers as well as small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of \nColorado (Mr. Tipton).\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio for the \nopportunity to be able to provide some remarks this evening.\n  It is no secret that American coal production and coal-fired electric \ngeneration is experiencing regulatory and legal obstacles at every \nturn. In 2008, the President famously outlined an energy vision in \nwhich he stated, ``So if someone wants to build a coal-fired power \nplant, they can. It is just that it will bankrupt them.'' There is no \nambiguity in that statement. The administration is certainly not \nseeking to encourage coal production. Indeed, it is just the opposite.\n\n  The Environmental Protection Agency just finalized its so-called \nClean Power Plan, a carbon emissions rule that will force States to \nsubmit complex plans to meet federally mandated emission goals. The EPA \nestimates the annual cost of this rule to be anywhere from $5.5 billion \nto $8.8 billion annually, but other credible estimates are much higher, \nranging from $366 billion to $479 billion from 2017 to 2031.\n  Now, why is this important? Oftentimes, when we are talking about \nfees about taxes that are going to be applied, we assume that someone \nelse gets to pay them. Here is the real reality: These costs are being \nshouldered by hardworking Americans who will see their energy bills \nincrease.\n  They impact the most vulnerable people in our society, including \nsenior citizens on fixed incomes and low-income families who will have \nto make tough decisions in their already tight household budgets just \nto be able to heat their homes.\n  In my own district in rural western Colorado, upwards of 500 coal \nmining jobs in Delta County, with wages and benefits exceeding 66 \nmillion, have already been lost and more are threatened due to anticoal \nlawsuits. Another 220 are threatened in Moffat and Rio Blanco Counties \nfor the same reason. There is no shortage of examples such as these in \nthe coal-producing States.\n  Now, I think we need to be very clear. As Americans, people in \nColorado, we want to be able to see blue skies and clear streams. Here \nis the opportunity for us to be able to demonstrate that we can create \na win-win with the technologies in place.\n  If you want to be able to see blue skies and a coal-fired power \nplant, come with me to Moffat County, visit Craig, Colorado, to be able \nto see hardworking people in the coal mining industry and a coal-fired \npower plant being able to do it the right way and being able to provide \naffordable electricity for the citizens at home.\n\n[[Page H8635]]\n\n  The Department of the Interior has also laughably announced it will \nbe reviewing whether the public is receiving a fair return on coal \nproduction when it is in the Federal Government's own policies and the \nactions of its lawsuit-happy allies that are actively suppressing the \nproduction of coal and its associated revenues.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Proposing to raise the royalty rate, which cuts into the \nprofitability of coal production and makes it less attractive to mine, \nwhile simultaneously pushing other policies like the Clean Power Plan \nthat make coal less attractive as a power source will mean the death of \nthe industry.\n  These are the same industries that are providing tax revenues that \nhelp support our children's schools, help support the public library in \nrural areas like mine to be able to help provide the revenues that are \nneeded for the volunteer fire departments to be able to provide that \npublic assistance.\n  Let us not forget that those royalties are only a portion of the \nrevenues and benefits that are generated by responsible coal mining. \nThere are bonus payments as well, received at the time of the lease, as \ncompanies seek to outbid one another for the development rights. Again, \nhigher demand will result in higher bonus payments. There are annual \nrental fees as well.\n  State and local governments also accrue revenues through their own \nassessed taxes and fees on equipment and production, and the high wages \nof employees are definitely a boon to local economies.\n  All told, coal production contributes some $2.8 billion to Colorado's \neconomy and provides 64 percent of its electricity. While it is true \nthat our energy portfolio is made stronger through diversity, coal can, \ndoes, and must continue to fill a vital role in that equation.\n  Responsible coal production provides a reliable fuel for baseload \nelectrical generation. Its low cost equates to savings for average \nAmericans on their monthly energy bills, an especially critical \nconsideration, as I mentioned, for lower income families, for seniors \nand others on fixed incomes, and its abundance domestically contributes \ntoward American energy security.\n  It is well worth the meetings that I have had, and I know my \ncolleague from Ohio has as well, looking into the eyes of families that \nrely on the coal industry to be able to provide for their families. \nThey will do it right. They will provide low-cost energy to be able to \nsupport this country and that all-of-the-above strategy.\n  Over the course of the next few days, I look forward to a robust \ndebate on the floor this week as we continue to push for policies that \nwill secure all of the above when it comes to establishing American \nenergy independence.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank my colleague from Ohio for \nthis opportunity to be able to address an important American issue: \njobs and affordability.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded that even this week \nour President is in Europe trying to advance his climate change agenda. \nI, too, was in Europe back in May, talking to some of our key friends \nand allies within the European Union.\n  Surprisingly to some, we learned that some of our friends in Europe, \nin those countries, are actually going back to a higher mix of coal in \ntheir overall energy profile because their ratepayers, their \nmanufacturers, their consumers, their small businesses, their \nresidential customers have finally reached the tipping point where they \nare no longer willing to pay the exorbitant high prices for alternative \nsources of energy.\n  Coal remains the most low-cost, affordable, reliable form of energy \non the planet. It is essential that coal continue to be a part of our \nenergy profile, along with oil and gas and nuclear and all of the \nenergy capabilities that America has.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), my friend and my neighbor.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would like to pursue an \nenergy agenda that maybe makes sense for America, a AAA strategy of \nenergy, to reach self-sustainability and secure America's economic \nfuture.\n  While we all agree on an all-of-the-above strategy, let's not turn \naway from an all-below strategy that makes sense for America, is truly \nunique, and makes us totally energy self-sufficient--energy below that \nis abundant, accessible, and affordable; centuries' worth of coal, oil, \nand natural gas that lie just below our surface; energy that makes \nAmerica the energy envy of the world.\n  It creates thousands of jobs, not just Republican jobs or Democrat \njobs, but red, white, and blue jobs--jobs that truly make us energy \nself-sufficient, jobs that let us rebuild our families, our towns, our \nchurches, our schools, and make us strong again in the world, rebuild \nour national security.\n  As we speak here tonight and as the gentleman just referenced, our \nPresident is in Paris kicking off the Paris Protocol. Again, he \npromises to reshape America's future through upsidedown policies, the \ncost of which will be beyond astronomical, according to Bill Gates.\n  This is another example of an out-of-control Executive who has placed \nhis legacy above the wants and needs and the safety and security of the \nAmerican people, the people he serves. It is not the other way around. \nThe Paris Protocol must be a treaty; it cannot be another executive \nagreement.\n  Let all those who participate in the Paris Protocol know that, \nwithout the advice and consent of America's Senate, the hardworking \nAmerican taxpayers' moneys will not be squandered on an ill-fated \nagenda that the President lays forward.\n  He sets timetables and targets--targets that are in direct defiance \nof America's future, that are in direct defiance of America's \nwellbeing, that are in direct defiance of America's economic recovery.\n  This is another example of a President who is not only out of touch, \nhe is out of control. He has lost his vision of what made America great \nand what would keep America strong as the future goes on, about \nAmerican jobs and about American self-sufficiency when it comes to \nenergy.\n  These are truly renewable sources of energy. What do I mean by \n``renewable''? They renew our economy. They renew our towns, our \ncommunities, our families, and our future. This is the renewable energy \nthat America needs. This is the energy that America has, and this is \nthe energy that America needs to make the most of.\n\n  That is why myself and Senator Mike Lee have introduced a concurrent \nresolution, one that says no moneys that come out of the pockets of \nhardworking American taxpayers will be squandered on this agenda. \nUnless it comes with the advice and consent of the Senate, there is no \nagreement, there are no moneys, there is no way this President can \npromise other countries that these dollars will be coming.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order on \na very timely issue and an issue that we must win if we are to maintain \nour national security.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague very much for \nhis passion on this issue. He understands it. As a current \nbusinessowner, he understands how important this is.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. You and I don't just talk this; we walk \nit. We have actually gone into the mines with these people. You and I \nhave seen communities that have been shut down, not just mines that \nhave been shut down--communities that have been shut down, families \nthat have been shattered now and scattered across the country, people \nthat have lost jobs that were generational jobs.\n  This President has turned his back on coal, America's workhorse. We \nmust reclaim it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n  You hear some of those in opposition to using fossil fuels talking \nabout how they would allocate taxpayer funds to retrain people in those \ncommunities like coal production communities. Well, my question is, \nwhere are the jobs going to come from to retrain them into?\n  These are communities that have had coal miners for generations, as \nRepresentative Kelly just talked about. I thank him for his comments.\n\n[[Page H8636]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from the great State of \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), another friend and neighbor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is a real honor to join \nmy good friend and colleague from Ohio here this evening. I thank him \nfor hosting this Special Order on such an important topic: energy.\n  I rise this evening in strong support of jobs, consumers, and \nhomegrown American energy.\n  With the construction of the world's first commercial oil well in \nTitusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859, energy production and natural \nresources have long been key pieces to our economy in the Fifth \nCongressional District of Pennsylvania, which I have the honor of \nrepresenting.\n  Since Drake's well, we have been fortunate to produce oil, natural \ngas, coal, and various forms of renewable energy. We are also home to \nthe world's first nondefense nuclear reactor.\n  In recent years, development of the Marcellus shale formation has \nbeen a game changer for Pennsylvania. The Marcellus formation contains \nupward of 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This amount is more \nthan enough to meet the current demand for nearly 100 years, if not \nlonger.\n  It also means significant economic opportunities for the State and \nfor local governments, as well as the creation of tens of thousands of \nfamily-sustaining jobs throughout the region. According to the \nPennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, as of the fall of 2014, \nroughly 250,000 Pennsylvanians were employed by Marcellus shale-related \nindustries.\n  The average wage in core Marcellus industries remains constant at \n$94,000 a year, which is more than $43,000 greater than the average \nsalary for all industries throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  In short, developing this resource means good jobs, both direct and \nindirect; lower energy prices for American consumers; and increased \nrevenue for State and local governments.\n  One of the greatest challenges we have right now in Pennsylvania is \nunnecessary processes and arduous Federal roles--regulations that are \nboth ineffective and inefficient.\n  Another key challenge is moving this natural gas to market. \nSpecifically, we do not have the adequate infrastructure and pipelines \nto move this gas. A basic way we can address this challenge is by \nstreamlining processes and reducing unnecessary red tape.\n  This week, the House will consider H.R. 8, the North American Energy \nSecurity and Infrastructure Act of 2015. This legislation will address \nthese issues by accelerating the approval process for pipelines and \nhydropower projects.\n  The bill requires the administration to designate at least 10 new \nenergy corridors in the eastern United States to help prioritize \nconstruction. The bill also requires the Energy Department to make \ndecisions on applications that have been submitted for the export of \nnatural gas.\n  In addition, we will also be voting this week on legislation \ndisapproving the Environmental Protection Agency's regulations on both \nexisting and new power plants.\n  My district has been hit hard over the past several years by \nregulations by the Environmental Protection Agency regarding coal power \nplants. I have opposed these unrealistic regulations.\n  When a coal power plant is forced to shut down, it has a devastating \neffect which extends far beyond the men and women who are left jobless, \nto the trucking and mining jobs that are connected to it. Many of these \nare family-supporting positions which communities have depended on for \ndecades.\n  I wholeheartedly support these resolutions disapproving of the \nemissions rules on existing and new power plants. The protection of our \nenvironment is an important goal, yet these regulations are not a \nsolution.\n  I thank my colleagues for being here tonight. I am certainly going to \nurge a ``yes'' vote on all three of the bills that will be before this \nbody in the days to come.\n  I thank my good friend from Ohio once again for hosting this \nimportant topic this evening.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I, too, thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for \nthose eloquent remarks on a very, very important subject. I know he has \na lot of other things he could be doing tonight, but this is important \nto him, and I appreciate him being here to sound off.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Whether we are talking families or \nbusinesses or schools, hospitals, you know, personnel, people obviously \nare first, but, after that, the second most important thing that people \nthink about is energy and energy costs and having access to affordable \nand reliable energy.\n  God has been good to the United States of America with what we have \nbeen blessed with. We have been blessed with these energy sources, but \nwe have also been blessed with the technology now in 2015 to be able to \naccess those energy sources and to utilize them consistently as good \nstewards of this Earth and this environment.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. You and I took a trip not too long ago from here \nin our Nation's Capital to a conference meeting in Pennsylvania. We \nstopped at a little service station, a gas station owned by a veteran \nout in the middle of nowhere. In rural America, those communities are \npowered by small businesses. Small businesses can only thrive when they \nhave affordable electricity.\n  The area of the country where you and I live and much of Appalachia \nis a manufacturing belt, but a lot of that manufacturing has left \nbecause of the downward pressure from Washington, D.C., in regulations \nof all shapes and sizes, and now with a threat to shut down the very \nsource of energy.\n  I know I have had manufacturers that have come to me saying they have \nbeen approached by utility companies saying: Can you idle your plant \nfor a day because we don't have enough energy on the grid to be able to \nmeet the peak demand in the dead of winter, in another polar vortex, or \nin the stifling heat of summer, when seniors and the elderly and the \nhomebound are sitting in their homes either freezing or burning up \nbecause they can't get their HVAC systems to work because of the \nutility prices or the energy on the grid.\n  It is appalling that it has come to this in America. Our allies get \nit in Europe. China is not necessarily an ally, but it is building a \nnew coal-fired power plant every 9 days. Germany is building coal-fired \npower plants. Belgium is returning to a higher mix of coal in their \nenergy profile. We are going to be going over there again very soon to \ntalk to more of our friends and allies across Europe about this very, \nvery same subject.\n  So, again, I appreciate your passion on this issue as well.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I now yield to the gentleman from West Virginia \n(Mr. Jenkins), my friend and colleague, who is another neighbor from \nacross the river.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. I thank the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Our natural resources power this Nation and our economy. We have \nabundant, affordable resources that provide low-cost energy and give \nthousands of people good-paying jobs.\n  In my district of southern West Virginia, coal is struggling because \nof this administration's anticoal regulations. The people who mine coal \nand the families who depend on coal's paychecks are suffering.\n  We are at a critical point in the war on coal. I know times are \ntough. I see it every time I talk to a coal miner or their family.\n  Our Nation is at a turning point. We will fight for coal each and \nevery day. But the question is: Will we support jobs in domestic \nenergy, or will we favor an environmental agenda at the expense of our \neconomy and our communities?\n  Coal must play a critical role in an all-of-the-above domestic energy \nstrategy. We can use our resources to create jobs here at home, provide \nsafe and affordable energy for businesses and families alike, and \nreduce our dependence on energy from unfriendly nations.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the EPA and the Office of Surface \nMining\n\n[[Page H8637]]\n\nare dead set on bankrupting coal. They have issued rule after rule that \nwill decimate our industry--and the livelihoods of our coal miners.\n  The proposed stream buffer zone rule will lead to the loss of tens of \nthousands of direct mining jobs and hundreds of thousands of jobs \nlinked to mining. Likewise, the EPA's finalized regulations on coal-\nfired power plants will hurt our economy and drive up electricity rates \nfor our families, seniors, and small businesses. It sets unachievable \nemissions limits for our coal-fired power plants and forces States to \nadopt different energy policies or else become subject to additional \nFederal regulations and a cap-and-trade program.\n  Not only will the EPA's plan destroy jobs, but it will increase \nutility costs for consumers and lead to higher household electricity \nbills for all American families. Our seniors, the middle class, and \nAmericans on fixed incomes should not have to bear the burden of \nincreased costs. Our economy is still struggling to recover. People are \nstruggling to survive.\n  Each of us here tonight has led the fight against the EPA's \noverregulation and overreach. On the House Appropriations Committee, I \nhelped to secure a provision in the Interior-EPA funding bill that \nwould prohibit funding for the rulemaking on power plants to proceed. I \nwas an early cosponsor of Chairman Whitfield's resolutions to block \nimplementation of the EPA's coal-fired power plant rule.\n  This week, we will join together with the House to send President \nObama and the EPA a strong message: No more attacks on coal. No more \nattacks on domestic energy. No more attacks on the people who produce \nenergy.\n  We will take up resolutions to disapprove of the EPA's new \nregulations on new and existing coal-fired power plants. We will also \nvote on a broad energy bill that will update our policies to allow \nAmerica to take advantage of all of our domestic energy while \nstrengthening our energy security and independence.\n  Congress is standing up to this administration's regulatory \noverreach. We must send a message to President Obama and his runaway \nEPA and end the war on coal.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his leadership.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for his passion--as others \nhave shared--on this very, very important issue.\n  You and I live in a region of the country where we have to look into \nthe eyes of those coal miners every single day. Oftentimes, the media \ntalks about the coal industry as this abstract industry, that it \ndoesn't really have an identity. But it does. It is the heartbeat of \nour country.\n  Look at where we were even 10 years ago, with the majority of the \nenergy across America provided by the coal industry. In Ohio, at that \ntime, in excess of 70 percent of our energy came from coal. Coal has \nprovided the innovative engine for America's prosperity for \ngenerations--and for us to turn our backs on it.\n  One of the things that is so shocking that I think the American \npeople would like to know more about right now, today, almost $2 \ntrillion--$1.8 trillion, to be exact--comes out of our economy every \nyear in the form of government regulations. I heard a report not too \nlong ago that new Federal regulations are coming out on the average of \nabout 10 per day. It is a cancer that is growing, and the EPA is one of \nthe worst, with no rhyme, no reason, little consideration, and total \ndisregard for the lives that their rulemaking impacts.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Absolutely.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. You and I share the Ohio River. We both \nhave actually been in the districts together. We both have seen on the \nfaces of the people that we have the honor of representing the real \nimpacts of this war on coal.\n\n  I know each of us can come with a multitude of stories, but your \nremarks reminded me of attending one of these wonderful county fairs \nlast summer. It was a year ago this summer, in Nicholas County, in my \ndistrict. A middle school teacher came up to me and kind of put a face, \nagain, on the war on coal, and said: ``I remember earlier this year in \nour public school in Nicholas County when the principal came on to the \nintercom and said, 'If there are any kids whose parent lost their job \nthis morning in the announced coal layoffs, come on down to the office \nand sign up for the free lunch program.'''\n  What a stunning indictment of Obama's war on coal, to think that we \nhave principals in our public school systems come and ask kids to come \ndown because those rules and regulations just put them into the free \nlunch program. It is a stunningly tragic example of the impacts of this \nwar on coal.\n  Again, thank you for your leadership and your fight on this.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the gentleman.\n  I now yield to another colleague and neighbor from the great State of \nWest Virginia, Representative Alex Mooney.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. I thank Congressman Bill Johnson for \ninviting me to speak this evening.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it. This is one of the last chances to \nsave the coal industry in my State of West Virginia. There is no time \nto hesitate. We have to act now. That is why I am proud to have \nintroduced my bill, H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act.\n  In the 8 years since President Obama took office, our unemployment \nrate in West Virginia went from the fifth lowest to the highest \nunemployment rate in the country. This is a direct result of the Obama \nadministration's continued war on coal, which is a war on West \nVirginia's economy.\n  Three months ago, the Office of Surface Mining, under the Department \nof the Interior, released its latest set of regulations that will \ncripple the coal industry not only across the country, but especially \nin West Virginia.\n  Understand that the EPA, or the Environmental Protection Agency, \nalready overregulates the coal industry. And now the Department of \nInterior, under this President, is doubling down and doubly \noverregulating the coal industry.\n  Even more ridiculous is the heart of this rulemaking, which is to \nfundamentally change the definition of a stream to include temporary \npuddles of water. Temporary ``streams'' are essentially ditches that \nfill with water after it rains.\n  A recent study from the National Mining Association estimates that \nthese new proposed rules will kill as many as 77,000 coal jobs across \nthe country.\n  I have a chart here showing where many of these jobs are going to \ncome from. Between 5,000 and over 10,000 jobs in Western mining States \nwill be lost here in this pink region. In the interior of America, the \ninterior States, between 5,000 and 14,000 jobs will be lost.\n  My colleague from West Virginia was just mentioning how that affects \nfamilies and how you have to make announcements at schools to come and \nsupport the children because of these totally unnecessary losses of \njobs through these regulations.\n  And certainly last but not least, in the area that I represent, West \nVirginia and the Appalachian region, we have between 30,000 and a \nlittle over 50,000 coal mining jobs that will be lost due to this new \nstream protection rule that the President is trying to impose.\n  These new regulations would be catastrophic to the coal industry and \nall of the hardworking American families that depend on coal to keep \ntheir energy costs low. In my State, 90 percent of the power is \ngenerated by coal-fired plants. If these rules come into effect, it \nwill make it even more expensive just to keep the lights on.\n  According to a recent study, if the Obama administration successfully \nimplements its radical environmental policies, the average American \nfamily will experience an increase in their home energy costs per year \nof $1,707 by the year 2025.\n  So, if you are listening to this: $1,707. This affects you and your \nhome energy cost. Not only does it kill jobs in the coal industry, it \nwill affect your home energy costs to the tune of $1,707 a year.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  This is what we are trying to fight here.\n  The average American family earned $53,657 last year. The average \nfamily in West Virginia earned $41,059 last year,\n\n[[Page H8638]]\n\nwhich is $12,598 under the national average. So this home energy cost \nincrease will be detrimental for all Americans, but especially for West \nVirginians.\n  Going into these long winter months, increased energy costs will be \ndevastating to those on fixed incomes, like the elderly and the \nimpoverished.\n  According to the Applied Public Policy Research Institute for Study \nand Evaluation, energy costs are adversely impacting lower income \nseniors afflicted by health conditions. This leads them to forgo food \nfor a day, leads them to reduce medical or dental care, fail to pay \nutility bills or become ill because their home was too cold.\n  This does not have to be the case. If we utilized the energy that our \ncountry is so blessed with, people would not have to make these tough \nchoices. Instead, we see these hard choices become commonplace under \nthe over-regulation of this administration.\n  When I traveled the State of West Virginia asking to represent the \npeople of the Second Congressional District in Congress, I promised \nthat I would defend the coal industry. West Virginia and our country \nneeds the STREAM Act to pass the House and Senate and be signed into \nlaw.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for his comments and for \nhis passion.\n  We have been fighting this Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation \nStream Protection Rule for almost 5 years now--actually, longer than \nthat--because we know what happened when the Obama administration came \nin.\n  That was one of the first things that they set their targets on and, \nthrough a series of exposing their flaws and inconsistencies in their \nrulemaking, we were able to stop it. But they have been persistent.\n  Now we need the American people to sound off, and we need the \nAmerican people to understand how this is going to affect them.\n  I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  One thing, Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure we assert is, you know, \nwe have heard a lot of passionate talk about the coal industry, and you \nmay hear even more before this Special Order is over this evening.\n  But I want to make sure we understand we are talking about \nmodernizing America's energy infrastructure. H.R. 8 is called the \nArchitecture of Abundance. Yes, it is about coal, but it is about much \nmore than just coal. It is about modernizing our energy infrastructure, \nprotecting the electricity system, strengthening energy security and \ndiplomacy across the globe, and improving energy efficiency and, \nimportantly, holding the Federal Government accountable for a real all-\nof-the-above energy policy that guarantees America's energy, security, \nand independence.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip, my Boudin-loving colleague.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Ohio, who \nalso loves Boudin, for yielding and for bringing up this important \nissue of energy.\n  Mr. Speaker, American energy means jobs. When we come here on this \nHouse floor and talk about ways to get our economy moving again, ways \nto help Americans who want to get back to work, there is a very clear-\ncut, commonsense answer to get our economy moving again, and that is \njust to open up more of the resources of this great Nation.\n  Just on the placard right there above us, Mr. Speaker, inscribed on \nthe walls of this House Chamber is a plaque that starts off, that says, \n``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' It is on the House \nChamber.\n  And, yet, President Obama, through his policies, through his radical \nregulations--every single day his unelected bureaucrats wake up \nfiguring out more ways to close off those resources, to kill those \nAmerican jobs.\n  When my colleagues come here on the House floor and tell story after \nstory about things like the war on coal, these are real wars that this \nObama administration is waging upon American workers.\n  The war on coal is real. I have seen it in the eyes of coal workers \nwhen I went to my colleague's district in Ohio. We sat out before a \nwhole room full of coal workers, many of them multi-generational. These \naren't people who have their first job in the industry. For many of \nthem, their father, their grandfather, worked in the coal industry.\n  When you look out at coal workers today, as I saw in Eastern Ohio, \nyou see the look of fear, not because they face global competition. \nThey can beat global competition. What they can't beat right now is the \nbarrage of radical regulations coming from the Obama administration \nkilling American jobs.\n  It has got a real direct impact on workers across this country, \npeople who are part of the middle class today that the President loves \ntalking about. Yet, that middle class dream is under attack by these \npolicies.\n  They have real impacts, Mr. Speaker. In fact, one of the other things \nI went out and saw when I was out in Eastern Ohio, was the Utica shale \nplay, another example of great American ingenuity.\n  These aren't just American jobs. This is American ingenuity that is \nfiguring out how to explore new areas of energy, to allow us not only \nto create good jobs in America, but to be completely energy \nindependent, to export our energy to other countries, including some of \nour friends in the world, our allies around the world right now that \nhave to get energy from countries like Russia, who use energy as a \nweapon against those very countries who would love to get energy from \nAmerica.\n  What is the President's answer to them? The President's answer is to \nmake it more difficult to create that energy here through rules, \nthrough regulations.\n  What are some real examples? Just this week, Mr. Speaker, the \nPresident is in Paris not to talk about ways to combat ISIS and the \nglobal threat of terrorism.\n  The President is over in Paris talking about global warming. As \npeople are walking around this town in parkas right now because it is \nso cold, the President is trying to focus on ways to make our economy \nin America less competitive globally.\n  So this week we are bringing up more legislation to push back on \nthose kind of regulations. One example is later this week, under the \nCongressional Review Act, we are going to be bringing up legislation to \nreverse President Obama's new source performance standard.\n  This was one of the many radical rules coming out of the EPA. One of \nthe biggest threats to jobs in America is the unelected bureaucrats \nover the EPA who have another brilliant idea, again, dreamed up by \npeople that are unelected, that now have a plan to actually make it \nmore difficult to create electricity in America, not only more \ndifficult, Mr. Speaker, but dramatically more expensive for hardworking \ntaxpayers in this country to buy electricity. So we are going to bring \nup a bill on the House floor this week to reverse that radical \nregulation.\n  As we bring that up, we are going to have this debate about something \nvery specific in terms of a policy brought up by the President that is \ngoing to make it much harder for our country to be competitive, much \nharder for middle class families to achieve that American Dream, \nbecause it is going to make things more expensive for them, things that \nthey buy, not just their electricity, but it cascades into all the \nother things that people buy when they go to grocery stores, when they \ngo do their Christmas shopping. These are having real impacts on real \npeople.\n\n  Something else we are going to be taking on is the Department of the \nInterior right now, one of the other agencies of President Obama, \ncoming out with a well control rule that is going to make it very \ndifficult to drill for oil in the Gulf of Mexico, a place where we, \nthrough American ingenuity, have figured out ways to generate more \nenergy in America that we can use not only to help our economy, but to \nhelp our friends all around the world.\n  So what is the President's answer? Using unelected bureaucrats, once \nagain, to propose a rule that is going to make it more difficult to \ncreate those American jobs.\n  Then, of course, as my colleague from Ohio was talking about, this \nweek we are also going to bring up a bill called the Architecture of \nAbundance, a bill to create more American jobs, to create real American \nenergy security, again, to open up those natural resources that are \nbeing shut down by this President.\n\n[[Page H8639]]\n\n  So when you talk about getting the economy back on track, you don't \nneed a team of economists to come in and figure out some new way to \ninvent the wheel.\n  Mr. Speaker, the answer is sitting right underneath our feet. In many \ncases, it is the energy that is trapped, not trapped by the lack of \ningenuity, because Americans, more than anybody in the world, have \nfigured out great ways to go and use technology, to go and get those \nresources, attract those resources, explore and then produce those \nresources.\n  But, unfortunately, their biggest challenge every day is not the \ncompetition from other States, not the competition from other \ncompanies. It is the challenge of the threatening regulations from this \nObama administration that are trying to shut those opportunities down. \nIt has real impacts on real people, the coal industry, the oil \nindustry, the natural gas industry, all across the board.\n  When our allies around the world are looking to us and saying, ``We \nwant to trade with the United States,'' we want to be able to buy the \noil that America is generating, that we have now a surplus of and, yet, \nthe President wants to issue a veto threat when we say let's allow for \nexporting of oil, for goodness sake.\n  We have an abundance of it. People are getting laid off in the United \nStates, those middle class workers that the President loves talking \nabout at photo-ops, who are being laid off because of his policies.\n  We have got the technology. We have got the expertise. We are the \nworld leader, Mr. Speaker. All we need is for the right policies to \nunleash that potential, to unleash that opportunity, to create those \nAmerican jobs.\n  So as we have been talking about tonight, the House will actually be \ntaking action--not sitting on the sidelines, not just criticizing, but \ntaking action--bringing bills on the House floor this week to open up \nthose opportunities for hardworking taxpayers, to create more middle \nclass opportunities for people who want to be a part of this industry, \nbut also to lower costs for these middle class families who are \nstruggling under these tough economic times to be able to have more \nopportunities for themselves and their families.\n  Hopefully, we will continue this debate throughout this week and \nthroughout the rest of this Congress as we bring these good pieces of \nlegislation to open up those resources again, as the placard says at \nthe top of the House Chamber here, to develop the resources of this \nland so that America can be the world leader in energy.\n  So we don't have to get our energy from countries who don't like us, \nbut we can actually export and create more job opportunities and help \nour allies around the world by undermining countries like Iran and \nRussia and others who want to do them harm.\n  I look forward to continuing this debate. I am so proud to be a part \nof this effort in the House to create more energy opportunities in \nAmerica.\n  I thank my colleague from Ohio for leading in this effort.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the gentleman.\n  Our whip comes from a State that has a very rich heritage, a rich \nlegacy of energy production, both onshore and offshore. And so you have \nlived it. The people that you represent live it every day. I thank you \nfor your passion on this issue as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, seeing as there are no further \nMembers to speak this evening, I will summarize.\n  I mentioned earlier that coal-fired power had provided the energy for \nAmerica's innovative engine for generations. We have now got new energy \nresources that have become available to us.\n  I can remember--and I am sure many Members can--where they were the \nday that Neil Armstrong stepped foot out on the Moon. I am reminded of \nthe excitement and the energy that we felt, the enthusiasm, the pride \nthat we felt, when President John F. Kennedy announced that we were \ngoing to put a man on the Moon within the next decade.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  That was in 1960, I believe, when he made that statement. It didn't \ntake us until the end of the decade. We did it in 1969.\n  Mr. Speaker, look what happened as a result of that. Every \ninstitution in America--academia, the medical industry, and the \nscientific community--everyone got behind the Moon race.\n  We have got a stagnant economy struggling to get its feet underneath \nus in light of the staggering pressure from Federal regulations from \nthe likes of the EPA, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \nEnforcement, the Interior, and so forth. Imagine what would happen if \nwe had an all-of-the-above energy policy that sounded something like \nthis: starting today, we are going to set a goal to become energy \nindependent and secure by the year 2020. That is only 5 short years \nfrom now.\n  But we have made tremendous progress. We are going to continue to use \nthe vast coal resources that we have at our disposal. We are going to \nharvest and use the natural gas and oil resources that we possess. We \nare going to expand on our nuclear energy capability. And, yes, we are \ngoing to let a private sector free market pursue alternative forms of \nenergy--not at taxpayer expense, but at entrepreneur expense where \nbrilliant minds will try and break the code of being able to store up \nand harness, for future use, energy from the wind and the Sun. They \ncan't meet our heavy-lifting energy needs today, but who knows what \ngreat discoveries that we will find in the future?\n  I believe if we had an energy vision, a true, all-of-the-above energy \nvision that sounded like that, you would, once again, see our young \npeople lining up to get into institutions to prepare themselves for \ncareers in energy production, storage, distribution, and usage. You \nwould find companies with the certainty to be able to grow and expand. \nYou would see a resurgence of manufacturing as America, once again, \nbegan to innovate and put its research and development ingenuity to \nwork to find new products and new discoveries.\n  The Pope stood right here on this House floor just a few short weeks \nago. He said: Why do so many people around the world want to come to \nAmerica? I am paraphrasing, but he said that they want to come here \nbecause America is the land of dreamers.\n  We are the problem solvers. From the discovery of electricity, the \ninvention of the light bulb, the invention of the combustion engine, \nmass production of automobiles, flight, space travel, computing and \ntelecommunications innovation, and medical marvels beyond belief, so \nmuch of what the world enjoys today came from the ingenuity and the \ninnovation of the American Dream--a dream powered by the coal industry, \na dream powered now by a combination of oil, gas, coal, and nuclear \nenergy.\n  Mr. Speaker, we now know that our policies in the energy sector have \nbeen based on fears of scarcity, but we no longer have to yield to \nthose fears. We have the resources, the know-how, and the wherewithal \nto be energy independent and secure. With H.R. 8, the Architecture of \nAbundance, we are going to be giving the Senate and the President an \nopportunity to launch America into this next great vision of energy \nindependence and security by the end of the decade. I hope they will \ntake that opportunity seriously.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8639-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8639-H8640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Ruppersberger (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through \nDecember 3 on account of medical issues.\n  Mr. Farr (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nillness.\n  Mr. DeFazio (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nmedical leave.\n\n[[Page H8640]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/house-section/article/H8640-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8640-H8642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     PUBLICATION OF COMMITTEE RULES\n\n\nAMENDMENT TO THE RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS FOR THE 114TH \n                                CONGRESS\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2015.\n     Hon.

General\n\n                   Rule 1. Application of House Rules\n\n       The rules of the House are the rules of the Committee on \n     Ways and Means and its subcommittees so far as applicable, \n     except that a motion to recess from day to day, and a motion \n     to dispense with the first reading (in full) of a bill or \n     resolution, if printed copies are available, is a non-\n     debatable motion of high privilege in the Committee.\n       Each subcommittee of the Committee is part of the Committee \n     and is subject to the authority and direction of the \n     Committee and to its rules so far as applicable. Written \n     rules adopted by the Committee, not inconsistent with the \n     Rules of the House, shall be binding on each subcommittee of \n     the Committee.\n       The provisions of rule XI of the Rules of the House are \n     incorporated by reference as the rules of the Committee to \n     the extent applicable.\n\n\n                    Rule 2. Meeting Date and Quorums\n\n       The regular meeting day of the Committee on Ways and Means \n     shall be on the second Wednesday of each month while the \n     House is in session. However, the Committee shall not meet on \n     the regularly scheduled meeting day if there is no business \n     to be considered.\n       A majority of the Committee constitutes a quorum for \n     business; provided however, that two Members shall constitute \n     a quorum at any regularly scheduled hearing called for the \n     purpose of taking testimony and receiving evidence. In \n     establishing a quorum for purposes of a public hearing, every \n     effort shall be made to secure the presence of at least one \n     Member each from the majority and the minority.\n       The Chairman of the Committee may call and convene, as he \n     considers necessary, additional meetings of the Committee for \n     the consideration of any bill or resolution pending before \n     the Committee or for the conduct of other Committee business. \n     The Committee shall meet pursuant to the call of the Chair.\n\n\n                        Rule 3. Committee Budget\n\n       For each Congress, the Chairman, in consultation with the \n     Majority Members of the Committee, shall prepare a \n     preliminary budget. Such budget shall include necessary \n     amounts for staff personnel, travel, investigation, and other \n     expenses of the Committee. After consultation with the \n     Minority Members, the Chairman shall include an amount \n     budgeted by Minority Members for staff under their direction \n     and supervision.\n\n\n               Rule 4. Publication of Committee Documents\n\n       Any Committee or Subcommittee print, document, or similar \n     material prepared for public distribution shall either be \n     approved by the Committee or Subcommittee prior to \n     distribution and opportunity afforded for the inclusion of \n     supplemental, minority or additional views, or such document \n     shall prominently display near the top of its cover the \n     following: ``Majority [or Minority] Staff Report,'' as \n     appropriate.\n       The requirements of this rule shall apply only to the \n     publication of policy-oriented, analytical documents, and not \n     to the publication of public hearings, legislative documents, \n     documents which are administrative in nature or reports which \n     are required to be submitted to the Committee under public \n     law. The appropriate characterization of a document subject \n     to this rule shall be determined after consultation with the \n     Minority.\n\n\n                        Rule 5. Official Travel\n\n       Consistent with the primary expense resolution and such \n     additional expense resolution as may have been approved, the \n     provisions of this rule shall govern official travel of \n     Committee Members and Committee staff. Official travel to be \n     reimbursed from funds set aside for the full Committee for \n     any Member or any Committee staff member shall be paid only \n     upon the prior authorization of the Chairman. Official travel \n     may be authorized by the Chairman for any Member and any \n     Committee staff member in connection with the attendance of \n     hearings conducted by the Committee, its Subcommittees, or \n     any other Committee or Subcommittee of the Congress on \n     matters relevant to the general jurisdiction of the \n     Committee, and meetings, conferences, facility inspections, \n     and investigations which involve activities or subject matter \n     relevant to the general jurisdiction of the Committee. Before \n     such authorization is given, there shall be submitted to the \n     Chairman in writing the following:\n       (1) The purpose of the official travel;\n       (2) The dates during which the official travel is to be \n     made and the date or dates of the event for which the \n     official travel is being made;\n       (3) The location of the event for which the official travel \n     is to be made; and\n       (4) The names of the Members and Committee staff seeking \n     authorization.\n       In the case of official travel of Members and staff of a \n     Subcommittee to hearings, meetings, conferences, facility \n     inspections and investigations involving activities or \n     subject matter under the jurisdiction of such Subcommittee, \n     prior authorization must be obtained from the Subcommittee \n     Chairman and the full Committee Chairman. Such prior \n     authorization shall be given by the full Committee Chairman \n     only upon the representation by the applicable Subcommittee \n     Chairman in writing setting forth those items enumerated \n     above.\n       Within 60 days of the conclusion of any official travel \n     authorized under this rule, there shall be submitted to the \n     full Committee Chairman a written report covering the \n     information gained as a result of the hearing, meeting, \n     conference, facility inspection or investigation attended \n     pursuant to such official travel.\n\n\n       Rule 6. Availability of Committee Records and Publications\n\n       The records of the Committee at the National Archives and \n     Records Administration shall be made available for public use \n     in accordance with Rule VII of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives. The Chairman shall notify the Ranking \n     Minority Member of any decision, pursuant to clause 3(b)(3) \n     or clause 4(b) of Rule VII, to withhold a record otherwise \n     available, and the matter shall be presented to the Committee \n     for a determination on the written request of any Member of \n     the Committee.

Committee Website\n\n       The Chairman shall maintain an official Committee website \n     for the purpose of furthering the Committee's legislative and \n     oversight responsibilities, including communicating \n     information about the Committee's activities to Committee \n     members and other members of the House. The ranking minority \n     member may maintain a similar website for the same purpose, \n     including communicating information about the activities of \n     the minority to Committee members and other members of the \n     House.\n\n\n                            B. SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n              Rule 8. Subcommittee Ratios and Jurisdiction\n\n       All matters referred to the Committee on Ways and Means \n     involving revenue measures, except those revenue measures \n     referred to Subcommittees under paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 \n     shall be considered by the full Committee and not in \n     Subcommittee.

Subcommittee Meetings\n\n       Insofar as practicable, meetings of the full Committee and \n     its Subcommittees shall not conflict. Subcommittee Chairmen \n     shall set meeting dates after consultation with the Chairman \n     of the full Committee and other Subcommittee Chairmen with a \n     view towards avoiding, wherever possible, simultaneous \n     scheduling of full Committee and Subcommittee meetings or \n     hearings.\n\n\n       Rule 11. Reference of Legislation and Subcommittee Reports\n\n       Except for bills or measures retained by the Chairman of \n     the full Committee for full Committee consideration, every \n     bill or other measure referred to the Committee shall be \n     referred by the Chairman of the full Committee to the \n     appropriate Subcommittee in a timely manner. A Subcommittee \n     shall, within three legislative days of the referral, \n     acknowledge same to the full Committee.\n       After a measure has been pending in a Subcommittee for a \n     reasonable period of time, the Chairman of the full Committee \n     may make a request in writing to the Subcommittee that the \n     Subcommittee forthwith report the measure to the full \n     Committee with its recommendations. If within seven \n     legislative days after the Chairman's written request, the \n     Subcommittee has not so reported the measure, then there \n     shall be in order in the full Committee a motion to discharge \n     the Subcommittee from further consideration of the measure. \n     If such motion is approved by a majority vote of the full \n     Committee, the measure may thereafter be considered only by \n     the full Committee.\n       No measure reported by a Subcommittee shall be considered \n     by the full Committee unless it has been presented to all \n     Members of the full Committee at least two legislative days \n     prior to the full Committee's meeting, together with a \n     comparison with present law, a section-by-section analysis of \n     the proposed change, a section-by-section justification, and \n     a draft statement of the budget effects of the measure that \n     is consistent with the requirements for reported measures \n     under clause 3(d)(1) of Rule XIII of the Rules of the House \n     of Representatives.\n\n\n          Rule 12. Recommendation for Appointment of Conferees\n\n       Whenever in the legislative process it becomes necessary to \n     appoint conferees, the Chairman of the full Committee shall \n     recommend to the Speaker as conferees the names of those \n     Committee Members as the Chairman may designate. In making \n     recommendations of Minority Members as conferees, the \n     Chairman shall consult with the Ranking Minority Member of \n     the Committee.\n\n\n                              C. HEARINGS\n\n                           Rule 13. Witnesses\n\n       In order to assure the most productive use of the limited \n     time available to question hearing witnesses, a witness who \n     is scheduled to appear before the full Committee or a \n     Subcommittee shall file with the Clerk of the Committee at \n     least 48 hours in advance of his or her appearance a written \n     statement of their proposed testimony. In addition, all \n     witnesses shall comply with formatting requirements as \n     specified by the Committee and the Rules of the House. \n     Failure to comply with the 48-hour rule may result in a \n     witness being denied the opportunity to testify in person. \n     Failure to comply with the formatting requirements may result \n     in a witness' statement being rejected for inclusion in the \n     published hearing record. In addition to the requirements of \n     clause 2(g)(5) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House regarding \n     information required of public witnesses, a witness shall \n     limit his or her oral presentation to a summary of their \n     position and shall provide sufficient copies of their written \n     statement to the Clerk for distribution to Members, staff and \n     news media.\n       A witness appearing at a public hearing, or submitting a \n     statement for the record of a public hearing, or submitting \n     written comments in response to a published request for \n     comments by the Committee must include in their statement or \n     submission, a list of all clients, persons or organizations \n     on whose behalf the witness appears. Oral testimony and \n     statements for the record, or written comments in response to \n     a request for comments by the Committee, will be accepted \n     only from citizens of the United States or corporations or \n     associations organized under the laws of one of the 50 States \n     of the United States or the District of Columbia, unless \n     otherwise directed by the Chairman of the full Committee or \n     Subcommittee involved. Written statements from non-citizens \n     may be considered for acceptance in the record if transmitted \n     to the Committee in writing by Members of Congress.\n\n\n                   Rule 14. Questioning of Witnesses\n\n       Committee Members may question witnesses only when \n     recognized by the Chairman for that purpose. All Members \n     shall be limited to five minutes on the initial round of \n     questioning. In questioning witnesses under the five minute \n     rule, the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member shall be \n     recognized first, after which Members who are in attendance \n     at the beginning of a hearing will be recognized in the order \n     of their seniority on the Committee. Other Members shall be \n     recognized in the order of their appearance at the hearing. \n     In recognizing Members to question witnesses, the Chairman \n     may take into consideration the ratio of Majority Members to \n     Minority Members and the number of Majority and Minority \n     Members present and shall apportion the recognition for \n     questioning in such a manner as not to disadvantage Members \n     of the majority.\n\n\n                        Rule 15. Subpoena Power\n\n       The power to authorize and issue subpoenas is delegated to \n     the Chairman of the full Committee, as provided for under \n     clause 2(m)(3)(A)(i) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n\n                      Rule 16. Records of Hearings\n\n       An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of all \n     testimony taken at a public hearing. The staff shall transmit \n     to a witness the transcript of his or her testimony for \n     correction and immediate return to the Committee offices. \n     Only changes in the interest of clarity, accuracy and \n     corrections in transcribing errors will be permitted. Changes \n     that substantially alter the actual testimony will not be \n     permitted. Members shall have the opportunity to correct \n     their own remarks before publication. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee may order the printing of a hearing without \n     the corrections of a witness or Member if he determines that \n     a reasonable\n\n[[Page H8642]]\n\n     time has been afforded to make corrections and that further \n     delay would impede the consideration of the legislation or \n     other measure that is the subject of the hearing.\n\n\n                   Rule 17. Broadcasting of Hearings\n\n       The provisions of clause 4(f) of Rule XI of the Rules of \n     the House of Representatives are specifically made a part of \n     these rules by reference. In addition, the following policy \n     shall apply to media coverage of any meeting of the full \n     Committee or a Subcommittee:\n       (1) An appropriate area of the Committee's hearing room \n     will be designated for members of the media and their \n     equipment.\n       (2) No interviews will be allowed in the Committee room \n     while the Committee is in session. Individual interviews must \n     take place before the gavel falls for the convening of a \n     meeting or after the gavel falls for adjournment.\n       (3) Day-to-day notification of the next day's electronic \n     coverage shall be provided by the media to the Chairman of \n     the full Committee through an appropriate designee.\n       (4) Still photography during a Committee meeting will not \n     be permitted to disrupt the proceedings or block the vision \n     of Committee Members or witnesses.\n       (5) Further conditions may be specified by the Chairman.\n\n\n                               D. MARKUPS\n\n                       Rule 18. Previous Question\n\n       The Chairman shall not recognize a Member for the purpose \n     of moving the previous question unless the Member has first \n     advised the Chair and the Committee that this is the purpose \n     for which recognition is being sought.\n\n\n                  Rule 19. Postponement of Proceedings\n\n       The Chairman may postpone further proceedings when a record \n     vote is ordered on the question of approving any measure or \n     matter or adopting an amendment.\n       The Chairman may resume proceedings on a postponed request \n     at any time. In exercising postponement authority the \n     Chairman shall take reasonable steps to notify Members on the \n     resumption of proceedings on any postponed record vote.\n       When proceedings resume on a postponed question, \n     notwithstanding any intervening order for the previous \n     question, an underlying proposition shall remain subject to \n     further debate or amendment to the same extent as when the \n     question was postponed.\n\n\n                  Rule 20. Motion to go to Conference\n\n       The Chairman is authorized to offer a motion under clause 1 \n     of rule XXII of the Rules of the House of Representatives \n     whenever the Chairman considers it appropriate.\n\n\n Rule 21. Official Transcripts of Markups and Other Committee Meetings\n\n       An official stenographic transcript shall be kept \n     accurately reflecting all markups and other official meetings \n     of the full Committee and the Subcommittees, whether they be \n     open or closed to the public. This official transcript, \n     marked as ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection \n     by the public (except for meetings closed pursuant to \n     clause 2(g)(1) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House), by \n     Members of the House, or by Members of the Committee \n     together with their staffs, during normal business hours \n     in the full Committee or Subcommittee office under such \n     controls as the Chairman of the full Committee deems \n     necessary. Official transcripts shall not be removed from \n     the Committee or Subcommittee office.\n       If, however, (1) in the drafting of a Committee or \n     Subcommittee decision, the Office of the House Legislative \n     Counsel or (2) in the preparation of a Committee report, the \n     Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation determines \n     (in consultation with appropriate majority and minority \n     committee staff) that it is necessary to review the official \n     transcript of a markup, such transcript may be released upon \n     the signature and to the custody of an appropriate committee \n     staff person. Such transcript shall be returned immediately \n     after its review in the drafting session.\n       The official transcript of a markup or Committee meeting \n     other than a public hearing shall not be published or \n     distributed to the public in any way except by a majority \n     vote of the Committee. Before any public release of the \n     uncorrected transcript, Members must be given a reasonable \n     opportunity to correct their remarks. In instances in which a \n     stenographic transcript is kept of a conference committee \n     proceeding, all of the requirements of this rule shall \n     likewise be observed.\n\n\n       Rule 22. Publication of Decisions and Legislative Language\n\n       A press release describing any tentative or final decision \n     made by the full Committee or a Subcommittee on legislation \n     under consideration shall be made available to each Member of \n     the Committee as soon as possible, but no later than the next \n     day. However, the legislative draft of any tentative or final \n     decision of the full Committee or a Subcommittee shall not be \n     publicly released until such draft is made available to each \n     Member of the Committee.\n\n\n                                E. STAFF\n\n                Rule 23.
