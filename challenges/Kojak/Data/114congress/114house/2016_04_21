Mr. Speaker, I represent a rural district in northern \nCalifornia where many of my constituents can only access the Internet \nthrough dial-up or low-speed DSL. Lack of access to broadband in rural \nareas is a drag on economic growth and impacts our small businesses, \nschools, hospitals, and much more.\n  Recently, the House took action to ensure the FCC cannot regulate the \nrates charged for broadband Internet access by passing H.R. 2666.\n  There is no regulatory scheme the FCC can create that will magically \nsolve the challenge of expanding broadband access in high-cost areas. \nInstead, likely, it will be a hindrance as it creates more barriers to \nthat access.\n  Expanding broadband in rural areas requires an understanding of the \neconomic realities, recognizing the need for greater access, and \nremoving the regulatory uncertainty.\n  Adoption of H.R. 2666 will encourage investment by letting Internet \nservice providers know they will not have to face the threat of Federal \nregulations on the rates they charge and continue the push for \nbroadband access and investment in rural areas, which will be very \nhelpful for people who have to drive a long distance for education and \nthe telemedicine that is so critical in rural areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/house-section/article/H1899-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD VISIT HIROSHIMA, JAPAN\n\n  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TAKANO.

Only then did I develop a personal and \nlasting connection to the incredible destruction caused by nuclear \nweapons. Every leader who has the capacity to use these weapons should \nhave that same experience and feel that same connection.\n  One of America's greatest strengths is the power to lead by example. \nThe President should use that power to lead the world to Hiroshima and \naway from nuclear weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/house-section/article/H1899-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1899-H1900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GOD BLESS A TRUE TEXAN, BOB SCHULTZ\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. OLSON.

Mr. Speaker, whether you are a mayor, a city council \nmember, or a Member of Congress, it is the job of all elected officials \nto be problem solvers for the families we serve.\n  For almost 25 years, the city of Galesburg has had a problem. The \nmajority of water tests there have had lead content exceeding the \nFederal action level, and the most recent health report shows that more \nthan 14 percent of children tested in Knox County had high lead levels \nin their small bodies.\n  When there is a problem, especially a serious problem like this, \nleaders come together to solve it. They don't point fingers, and they \ncertainly do not deny facts. Government officials at all levels have \nthe responsibility to work constructively to solve the problem and \nprotect our children.\n  That is why I have assigned a watchdog task force within my office to \ninvestigate lead contamination throughout my congressional district and \ndevelop comprehensive solutions to overcome this challenge.\n  We need to work together to solve this problem because that is what \nleaders do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/house-section/article/H1900-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION\n\n  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize heroes in our \ncommunities who ask for no recognition, too often receive none, and \nevery day are deserving of it: our law enforcement officers.\n  Their mission is simple: keep our communities safe.\n  They are often overlooked, yet they are the first ones we call when \nwe need help.\n  It is a dangerous job. Each day these selfless servants put on a \nbadge symbolic of their unique position to ensure the safety of the \nfamilies and individuals of their communities, and they go do their \nduty.\n  We enjoy the fruits of their labor without knowing of the tireless \ndedication that makes it happen. Whether they are encouraging a child \nto make wise decisions, patrolling a neighborhood, or stopping a crime, \ntheir tireless dedication is often taken for granted. They sacrifice so \nwe don't have to.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, to our law enforcement officers around the country \nand to their families whose sacrifices are not forgotten, I rise to say \nthank you. Thank you for protecting us. Thank you for defending us, for \nbeing ever vigilant, ever ready, and ever courageous.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days within which to\n\n[[Page H1901]]\n\nrevise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on \nH.R. 3724, currently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from North Dakota?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R. \n3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act.\n  With tax day just behind us, most Americans have finished their tax \nreturns. They filled out form after form, giving the IRS some of the \nmost sensitive information possible, including their Social Security \nnumbers, their birth dates, wage data, and more.\n  In 2014, the inspector general for the IRS released a report that \nraised serious questions about whose hands this information falls into \nonce it arrives at the IRS. More specifically, an audit of the agency's \nhiring practices found that the IRS rehired hundreds of former \nemployees whom the IRS had previously fired because of conduct \nproblems.\n  And we are not talking about small infractions. The IRS rehired \nemployees who had falsified documents. They failed to pay their own \ntaxes. They accessed sensitive taxpayer information without permission.\n  To think that someone could inappropriately access tax information, \nget fired for doing so, and then be rehired just a few months later is \ncompletely unacceptable. But it has happened, and it has happened more \nthan once.\n  These stories border on the absurd. One employee had been absent \nwithout leave for a total of 8 weeks worth of work. As a result, that \nemployee was fired, and the words ``do not rehire'' were stamped on \nthat personnel file. Still, the IRS rehired that person.\n  IRS leadership has failed to acknowledge its mistakes or change its \nprocesses. Instead, they stuck their heads in the sand. According to \nthe inspector general, the IRS' response to the report was that it \nbelieved its current process was good enough. Well, I don't buy it, and \nif the IRS leadership thinks its current processes are protecting \ntaxpayers, they need a reality check.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  The Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act is a simple, \nbipartisan fix to a serious problem. The bill does what the IRS \nbureaucracy in Washington won't: it stops the IRS from rehiring former \nemployees who had been fired for cause.\n  Now, my staff and I met with numerous frontline IRS employees from \nSouth Dakota who are sincere and hardworking individuals. My bill is \nnot aimed at them.\n  This legislation is aimed at the IRS bureaucracy in Washington and is \nintended to address a very real problem that they have refused to fix.\n  There is no reason that IRS leadership in Washington shouldn't be \nheld to the same standard to which it holds you, the taxpayers. With \nthis legislation, we can hold the IRS accountable to us for its hiring \npractices and ensure a high-quality workforce for the agency.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We all agree that the IRS faces serious consumer service challenges \nand needs to be more responsive to the American taxpayer, but this bill \nis not a serious attempt at oversight of the IRS.\n  In fact, with respect to making the IRS more responsive to taxpayers, \nthis bill is a move in the wrong direction.\n  But the fact that Republicans are moving in the wrong direction on \ntax policy really shouldn't be a surprise to any of us.\n  They are not only starving our entire government of the resources \nthat it needs to operate efficiently for the American public, but they \nare deliberately standing in the way of actual productive policies.\n  Forget real tax reform that would bring positive benefits. They \naren't even doing anything to fix what is broken in the system today.\n  For example, the Republicans refuse to crack down on large \ncorporations that seek to avoid paying their fair share of taxes simply \nby changing their mailing address from the United States to a low-tax \nforeign country.\n  We see these stories on TV all the time, corporations renouncing \ntheir American citizenship to not have to pay any--any--U.S. taxes.\n  But congressional Republicans have refused to take any action to stop \nthese corporate tax dodgers and the resulting offshoring of American \njobs.\n  In fact, the Republicans who run Congress have protected these \ncompanies not only through their refusal to act to stop these tax \ninversions, but by also refusing to repeal the tax break that \nincentivizes U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas.\n  Yes, American companies can claim a tax break for firing American \nworkers and moving their jobs overseas, and my Republican colleagues \nare doing nothing about that.\n  The real-world effect of the Republicans' refusal to go after these \ncorporations that invert themselves to avoid paying their share of \ntaxes is a heavier tax burden on the rest of our honest constituents \nwho are playing by the rules.\n  To address this problem, the Treasury Department recently issued new \nrules to stop large corporations from simply changing their post office \nbox to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  Could my constituents imagine simply changing their post office box \naddress to eliminate their Federal taxes? Of course not. Because they \ncan't. But somehow multinational companies, which seem to have more \nrights than American citizens, can.\n  Now, you would think the American Congress would support the efforts \nof the American President to stop American companies from not paying \nthe taxes here in America. But, Mr. Speaker, you would be wrong.\n  The majority is threatening to stop the Treasury from advancing these \ntypes of commonsense rules to make multinational corporations pay their \nfair share of U.S. taxes just like everyone else.\n  Wouldn't our time be better spent and served if my Republican \ncolleagues held hearings--and passed bills--to stop companies from \nmoving their jobs and profits overseas?\n  Democrats stand ready to work with them to enact commonsense policies \nto close the loopholes in our Tax Code that encourage companies to send \ntheir profits and their jobs overseas.\n  Unfortunately, we will have to wait for another day before the \nmajority is serious about working together to make our tax system \nfairer for working people.\n  But let me be clear. Americans will not wait any longer. They demand \nthat we act to close these loopholes to ensure that American \ncorporations don't cheat the system to try to avoid paying their fair \nshare of taxes here in the United States, letting the little guy have a \ngreater burden in their absence.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have a gentlemen here to speak \non behalf of my bill who has been a strong leader in bringing integrity \nto the IRS.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, we are at a crossroads with our \ntax system. Our Tax Code is outdated, overly complicated, and the IRS \nhas proven that it, in and of itself, is in need of serious reform.\n  Here is an opportunity for us to work together. From the opening \nremarks of my colleague across the aisle, I am not sure if that is an \nattitude of cooperation, but certainly this is a bill we can work \ntogether on, I would hope.\n  Our Tax Code was last updated in 1986, a generation ago. It is \nincreasingly burdensome in this global 21st century economy. American \ntaxpayers need a simpler code that they can easily comply with.\n  Finally, they deserve an accountable and consistent IRS which \nprovides exceptional taxpayer customer service. It is long past time \nfor the status quo to change on these problems. We need tax reform.\n  This is why I stand in support of my colleague's bill, the Ensuring \nIntegrity in the IRS Workforce Act. The legislation would prohibit the \nIRS from rehiring any individual who was previously employed by the \nIRS, but fired for cause. This is inconsistent and unacceptable \nbehavior from an agency which requires the highest standard of tax \ncompliance from taxpayers. The IRS should apply the same rigorous \nstandard inside the agency itself.\n\n[[Page H1902]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish we didn't need an act of Congress such as this, \nbut, apparently, we do. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have a friend and colleague here today who \nhas fought daily for years for hardworking taxpayers across America and \nfor his home district.\n  I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions).\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from \nHamlin County, South Dakota, a very dear friend not only of every \nMember of Congress, but, in particular, a great Representative \nrepresenting South Dakota at a time when South Dakota needs not only \nstrong representation, but a strong voice.\n  I want to thank the young Congresswoman for bringing this legislation \nto the floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, today is quite simple. The United States Congress has a \nsay in the matter about how our government is run and the conduct of \nthe government.\n  The Internal Revenue Service has, for quite some time, been at odds, \nI believe, not only with their mission statement, but also at odds with \ntheir duty to publicly serve, provide information, and to do the things \nthat enable taxpayers, who want to follow the law and need to follow \nthe law, to comply respectfully.\n  The Internal Revenue Service, over the last few years, has run afoul, \nI believe, of the American people because the commonsense obligations \nthat they have have not been met.\n  Today we are here on the floor with Congresswoman Noem to talk about \nH.R. 3724 that prohibits the Commissioner of the IRS from rehiring any \nemployee who was involuntarily--that means forced--out or involuntarily \nseparated from service for misconduct at the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in \nFebruary 2015 that the IRS had rehired those employees who had been \nfired from the Service for misconduct, hundreds of former employees who \nwere terminated for well-documented conduct or performance issues.\n  In fact, the IRS rehired 141 former employees who had substantial tax \nissues. That means they were not paying their own tax bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we were going to hire a person in our office, we \nwould attempt to gain information about that employee.\n  Yesterday, as we were talking about this on the rule, a fellow \ncolleague said: What about your own employees? Do you make sure they \npay their taxes?\n  I said: That would be a good question.\n  No, I don't ask that question. But I would not have any idea what the \nreal answer was--the truth--if an employee did not tell me the truth.\n  The IRS does have the answer. They know who is paying their taxes, \nand they know why they fired an employee, Mr. Speaker.\n  We are here saying that the Internal Revenue Service should not \nrehire these employees who were unfaithful, unfaithful to their job and \nunfaithful to the American taxpayer.\n  One hundred forty-one employees who substantially did not pay their \ntaxes represent 60 percent of all terminated for misconduct.\n  I think I know why: because the Internal Revenue Service at the \nhighest levels allows this to go on, and then they rehire the employees \nwho didn't even follow the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is not just misconduct. That is another level \ngiving them an opportunity that a normal taxpayer would not have to get \naway with not paying their own taxes.\n  Other misconduct issues of rehiring employees include accessing \ntaxpayer information improperly without authorization, falsification of \nofficial forms, unacceptable behavior and performance, and abuse of IRS \nleave and property policies while on public time.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Noem is doing the right thing and so is \nthe House of Representatives. I would like to see this be a bipartisan \nissue, not a partisan issue.\n  We need the IRS. We need them to do a good job. But if this were at \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, would we allow that to happen? If \nthis were at the CIA, would we allow that to happen?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If this were at the Department of Justice, would we \nallow that to happen? Why is this not a bipartisan issue?\n  Why can't we get together and say: Mr. Koskinen, you are the \nCommissioner of the IRS. We respectfully would like to see you correct \nwhat you are doing.\n  We are not on a witch hunt. We have the facts of the case, and we \nbelieve the right thing to do is to offer some remedy.\n  That is why Republicans are on the floor today, and that is why our \nyoung Congresswoman is leading this charge.\n  I stand behind her. I voted for the rule, and I am going to vote for \nthis. It does the right thing.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for the time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just add to that list of the gentleman from \nTexas: If it were Congress, would we allow this to happen?\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, we have another colleague here on the floor \ntoday who serves on the Ways and Means Committee and has diligently \nworked on IRS issues and has been a leader on bringing some clarity to \nthe situations that we deal with in trying to bring integrity to the \nIRS.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci).\n  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015, a bill \nsponsored by my good friend and colleague, Representative Kristi Noem \nof South Dakota. As the previous colleague said, this should be a \nbipartisan issue. This is an American issue.\n  I spent most of my life in the business world. I have owned and \noperated over 60 different businesses, employed over 3,000 people, and \ncreated thousands of new jobs. Throughout my 30-year business career, I \nhave had the privilege of hiring many new, talented individuals.\n  When it comes to hiring at the IRS, the Treasury inspector general \nstated, ``Selecting the best candidates for employment is essential to \nproviding the best service to America's taxpayers, maintaining public \ntrust in tax administration, and safeguarding taxpayer's rights and \nprivacy.''\n  However, the inspector general report from December 2014 found that \nthe IRS fell short of that standard. Last year the IRS hired hundreds \nof employees who were terminated for misconduct. Those serious offenses \nincluded willful failure to file tax returns, unauthorized access to \ntaxpayer information, falsification of official forms, and abuse of IRS \nleave and property policies.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  As a businessman, but more importantly as a representative of the \nAmerican taxpayer, I find this IG report inexcusable. It seems obvious \nto me, but not once did I rehire someone in the real world--in the real \nworld--who I had previously fired for misconduct.\n  The IRS needs to earn the trust of hardworking American taxpayers. \nRehiring employees who were fired for these serious offenses further \nerodes that trust.\n  H.R. 3724 directly addresses this issue. It prohibits the IRS from \nrehiring employees that were fired for misconduct. This is common \nsense.\n  As a former businessowner, I know it is a very difficult decision to \nlet someone go, but rehiring an individual who was asked to leave due \nto gross misconduct would be insulting to other employees who have \nfaithfully served the business, and would present a significant risk to \nthe health of the organization and its customers.\n  The IG report found the IRS doesn't take those risks seriously. In \nfact, ``IRS officials stated that prior conduct and performance issues \ndo not play a significant role in deciding the candidates who are best \nqualified for hiring.'' Because the IRS hasn't taken\n\n[[Page H1903]]\n\nthose risks seriously, this straightforward, commonsense legislation is \nneeded to restore accountability and trust in the IRS.\n  I would like to commend Mrs. Noem for her leadership on this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in \nsupport.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, it appears that America will have to continue to wait \nfor action to stop companies from shifting American jobs overseas and \nstopping corporate tax dodgers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of \nH.R. 3724.\n  I would think as we look around the country right now, the integrity \nof what our government is and how our voters are represented and our \ncitizens are represented, is really the case here.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for bringing such a commonsense piece of \nlegislation forward because we know in this town there is nothing less \ncommon than common sense.\n  The faith and trust of the American people is based on their belief \nthat the people who work for them are acting in their best interest, \nalways acting in their best interest--the interest of the American \npeople. Not in their personal interest, but in the interest of the \nAmerican people. We find out that there are folks who are working on \nbehalf of the American people, but they have somehow betrayed that \nfaith and that trust. And folks have lost confidence in their \ngovernment. They have lost confidence because of things that happened, \nnot things that were imagined, not some whimsical idea that somehow we \ncan get at somebody for doing this.\n  There is no agency that is feared more in this country than the IRS. \nThe question is: Why would they be so feared? Because they can \ncompletely shut you down, they can freeze your bank account, they can \nmake you stay up late at night worrying about what is going to happen.\n  When you get that letter from the IRS, the next thing you do is \ncontact an attorney to represent you because you don't want to make a \nmistake, you just don't want to do it. But then you find out that \nwithin the IRS, people working for that agency, but, more importantly, \nworking for the people of the United States, have violated that trust.\n  These are substantiated results. This is not somebody's idea or way \nof getting back at somebody. This is removing bad apples and saying: \nyou have violated, you have betrayed the trust of the American people, \nyou are going to leave the agency, but, more importantly, you are never \ncoming back in.\n  This isn't any way to somehow get back at a political party or get \nback at anybody. This is a fact that if we cannot restore the \nconfidence the American people have in us--their faith and their \ntrust--why are we here? Why do we go through elections?\n  I don't come here to represent my ideas and my beliefs. I come here \nto represent the values and beliefs of Pennsylvania's Third \nCongressional District. That is 705,687 Americans, not Republicans, not \nDemocrats, not Libertarians, not Independents, but Americans.\n  This piece of legislation takes into account that these are \nwrongdoers. These are not people who we want to associate ourselves \nwith. These are people who have used the power of their office or of \ntheir position to somehow work against the very people who employ them.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I would just say, at this moment in our \nhistory, I thank the gentlewoman for standing up for every hardworking \nAmerican taxpayer and doing the best we can to restore the faith and \nconfidence of the American people that they can trust who it is that \nthey elect to represent them and they can trust us to make sure that \nwrongdoers are punished and, once are asked to leave, are not allowed \nto come back in.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining \non both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 24\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from South Dakota has 15\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Chaffetz).\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. Noem and her drive to \naddress this very important issue.\n  I believe that the overwhelming majority of the people who work at \nthe IRS are good, hardworking, patriotic people who want to do the \nright thing. I have a serious problem with management and I have a \nserious problem with the head of the IRS, but on this issue, this is \njust unbelievable that we can't come to a conclusive and absolute 100 \npercent agreement.\n  All we are asking for is that the bad apples, the people who will \ndisturb what is going on in the workplace, who aren't going to act in \nthe best interest of the United States of America, that they be \nexcluded from participation.\n  One of the things that is fascinating, Mr. Speaker, as we look at \nthis, is in response to the independent review that was done of the IRS \nand their hiring practices. And the question here is: Should we go back \nand review the personnel employment file prior to rehiring somebody?\n  This is what they said: ``Additionally, while it did find that a \nreview of performance and conduct issues could be accomplished earlier \nin the process, the Department of Treasury, the Office of Personnel \nManagement, and the Internal Revenue Service believed that it was not \nfeasible to move the review of these issues earlier in the hiring \nprocess. This action would greatly increase the cost of hiring, likely \nincrease cycle time beyond the Presidential mandate of 80 days, require \nadditional resources, and not likely yield a reasonable return on \ninvestment.''\n\n  Come on. Come on. Are you kidding me? How long could it possibly take \nto actually go back and review somebody's performance reviews, look \nback at their employment history, and see if they have been acting in \nthe best interest of the United States of America?\n  Clearly, in the examples that are there, there are people that \nwillfully don't even file their own tax returns, there are people that \nare doing some bad, stupid stuff.\n  They don't think they have the time and resources to look at it in \nadvance; we have to actually pass a piece of legislation requiring \nthis?\n  That seems entirely reasonable. It is not overly burdensome. Here you \nhave an organization, the IRS, that can actually destroy somebody's \nlife by a mere letter showing up in your mailbox, and they can't even \ntake the time to look at somebody's employment history, somebody who \nhas already worked at the IRS?\n  That is how absurd this organization is, and that is why this piece \nof legislation is so easy to understand, it is so easy to vote for. It \nis not a partisan issue. This is just saying: Do you know what? For all \nthe good people who work at the IRS, let's make sure that the new \npeople who come on, or the rehires who come on, in this case, are \nactually addressed and we look at their information prior to hiring.\n  It is that simple. That is why I am in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.\n  I am still waiting for a bill to keep American jobs in America and \nnot export them overseas through the Tax Code. I will continue to wait \nfor that bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, today, we are talking about a bill that will \nbring integrity to the IRS, which will better serve our taxpayers into \nthe future.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank the gentlewoman from \nSouth Dakota for her leadership in bringing this bill forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is about restoring trust. This bill is about \nholding the IRS accountable. Here we are, in a week where Americans had \nto file their tax returns. And so often, just the letters I-R-S send a \nchilling effect through people when they hear those\n\n[[Page H1904]]\n\nletters. Yet, you look at the arrogance over at the IRS, just the \nattitude that they have and the disdain it seems that they have towards \nthe very people who pay their bills--the taxpayers.\n  Here you have a case where people who have been fired by the IRS for \nabusing their positions are actually being rehired back to the IRS. \nAgain, this is the kind of disdain that disgusts people as they fear \nthe IRS. The IRS ought to have the same fear towards the people who pay \ntheir salaries as people get when they get that letter from the IRS.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have had inspector general reports in the Treasury \nDepartment. The inspector general found over 140 IRS agents aren't even \naccurate in their taxes. The very people who are responsible for \nauditing American citizens aren't even paying their own taxes.\n  This is the kind of disregard for the American people that we are \nseeing over at the IRS, and it is time to rein it in. It is time to \nbring some accountability and transparency back to the IRS.\n  Who is afraid of that? What is so wrong with saying: If somebody has \nbeen fired for cause over at the IRS, with the access they have to such \nsensitive personal information of taxpayers, why should they be rehired \nback?\n  It is just basic common sense that if somebody has abused their \nposition at the IRS, enough is enough, and they shouldn't be able to \nreturn and have access to that sensitive information anymore.\n  I want to applaud, again, the gentlewoman from South Dakota for \nbringing this commonsense bill forward. I would urge adoption later on \nwhen we have this vote on the House floor.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my \nfriend from South Dakota for her leadership in holding the IRS \naccountable for what we are seeing today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3724, the \nEnsuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act, to join in the outrage \nwith my colleagues today on what we are seeing at the IRS. With tax day \nhitting earlier this week, I think this is an ideal time to highlight \nthe need for continued oversight and, perhaps, ramped-up oversight of \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  Last February, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration \nreported that the IRS had a tendency to rehire former employees with \nserious misconduct and performance issues. In their review, they found \nmore than 100 former employees were rehired by the IRS despite having \nsignificant performance and misconduct problems, like willfully failing \nto file tax returns: a rather important thing for most of us, but \napparently not for IRS employees.\n  Mr. Speaker, the families in my district and I are 100 percent fed up \nwith adhering to a standard that the IRS doesn't even hold their own \nemployees to. We simply will not tolerate the rehiring of incompetent \nindividuals who fail to do their job in the first place. It is time to \nput a leash on the IRS and prevent taxpayers from further double \nstandards and further abuse.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3724.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from South Dakota for her excellent \nleadership on this. I look forward to open debate and voting on this \nmatter as soon as possible.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  No disrespect to the sponsor of this bill whatsoever. I have great \nadmiration for her, as she knows, but I believe that this bill could \nhave been taken up on the consent calendar, quite frankly, with all of \nthis discussion about the support on both sides.\n  The reality is, though, that we are using precious time here on the \nfloor on an issue that, as I say, could have been on the consent \ncalendar. We are not addressing the real issue of concern to the \nAmerican people, which is of the continuing loss of jobs here in \nAmerica because of our Tax Code, which we refuse to fix, that is \nshifting jobs and American corporations overseas to inversion and also \nshifting American jobs overseas because of those inversions.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. I yield myself an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are not having a hearing on this. We are not doing \nanything here on the floor to address this issue. Instead, we are \ntaking up issues that, quite frankly, could have been on the consent \ncalendar.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am \nready to close.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I believe this should be the beginning and not the end of a \ndiscussion on how to best plug the giant corporate loopholes that are \nallowing companies to skip out on paying the same taxes that all of our \nconstituents have to pay. This is one of the many major issues this \nCongress should undertake; but, instead, we are all too busy governing \nby press releases.\n  This Congress has done nothing to address the Zika virus, which could \nbe a threat to all women who are pregnant or who are looking to become \npregnant; but we have this consent bill here on the floor for debate.\n  This Congress has done nothing to address the crisis of lead in our \ndrinking water--a crisis vividly on display in Flint but one that lurks \nin the pipes of hundreds of cities and towns across our great land; yet \nwe have this consent bill here on the calendar for debate.\n  This Congress hasn't even attempted to pass a budget for our \ncountry--the majority has not proposed a budget for our country--which \nis one of the most basic functions we can do as an institution to make \nsure we make the necessary investments possible while also getting our \neconomic house in order; yet we have what I would consider to be a \nconsent calendar bill here on the floor today, taking up an hour's \ndebate.\n  But we will always have time for message bills. Sure, they don't \ncreate a job for an unemployed person in New York or in Flint or in \nHouston or in L.A., and they don't increase the take-home pay of any \nunderpaid worker or make college more affordable for middle class kids \nor strengthen Social Security for our seniors of today and tomorrow, \nbut they will sound great on talk radio tonight and over the weekend--\nwe are going after the IRS again. They don't even deal with the Tax \nCode even though this bill is advertised as the Republicans' idea of \ntax reform. It does not reform the Tax Code in any way, shape, or form, \nbut that is what they portray it as.\n  Let me explain something about the Tax Code to my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Our Tax Code is inefficient. You see that when large corporations are \npaying less tax than the employees who work for them. It is overly \ncomplicated. You see that when multinational corporations avoid paying \nthe same taxes as our constituents back home have to pay simply by \ntheir hiring expensive lawyers that our constituents, quite frankly, \ncannot afford. It is unfair. You see that when corporations can dodge \npaying their fair share of taxes by simply switching their post office \nboxes to foreign countries--something our neighbors back home, if they \nattempted to do, would be arrested for, for tax evasion, but not \ncorporations. Individuals, if you do that, you are arrested for tax \nevasion, but not an American corporation; yet my Republican colleagues \ncontinue to refuse to address this issue.\n  Maybe more importantly than anything else, it does not promote job \ngrowth here in the United States. You see this when Congress refuses to \nrepeal the tax breaks for companies to fire their workers here and move \ntheir jobs overseas.\n  This Congress must tackle these serious issues, but we are not doing \nthat today. We continue to wait for legislation--for a hearing--on \nthese important issues.\n  Democrats stand ready to work with you all, my Republican colleagues, \non commonsense legislation that plugs the corporate tax loopholes that \nare literally draining the funds our country needs in order to function \nproperly. Democrats stand ready to work with you to fix the Tax Code \nthat is not only inefficient, not only complicated, not\n\n[[Page H1905]]\n\nonly unfair, but that does not promote job growth here in the United \nStates. That is something we want to work with you on in a bipartisan \nway. Unfortunately, we have to continue to wait for another day before \nthe majority is serious about working together, in a bipartisan way, to \nmake our tax system fairer for all working men and women in the United \nStates. Let me be clear, once again, that the American people will not \nwait any longer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  We have heard repeatedly from my colleague on the other side of the \naisle about why we should not be spending time on this topic today, \nabout why we shouldn't have dedicated an hour's worth of debate to \nmaking sure that we talk about H.R. 3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS \nWorkforce Act.\n  I think he has forgotten about what kind of information the people of \nthis country turn over to the IRS. They turn over their Social Security \nnumbers, their financial information; a lot of the security that they \nhave for their families, their homes, and their businesses they \ncompletely trust the IRS to take care of, to protect, and to make sure \nthat they use in the correct manner so that they might abide by the law \nand pay their taxes like honest, hardworking Americans do. To say that \nwe shouldn't spend time in making sure that criminals and people who \nare fired for misconduct don't have access to that information, to me, \nis silly. That is exactly what our job is. The IRS needs integrity, and \nwe are here to bring it today.\n  Mr. Speaker, the White House has issued a veto threat against this \nbill. They said that the IRS would be forced to fire people, because of \nthis bill, if it were signed into law. I read the White House's \nStatement of Administration Policy on my bill, and the statement reads \nthat it is unnecessary because current IRS processes already ensure \nthat the agency does not rehire former employees who have significant \nconduct issues.\n  I guess the White House didn't read the report, for the inspector \ngeneral expressed concerns that the IRS continues to hire individuals \nwho have significant prior conduct and performance issues even after \nthe agency supposedly made upgrades to its hiring practices.\n  I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the inspector general's review of \nformer employees who were fired for serious misconduct and who were \nthen rehired included employees with histories of fraud, a \nfalsification of documents, workplace disruption, absence, and an \nunauthorized accessing of taxpayer information. The inspector general \nidentified approximately 140 individuals who are currently, today, with \nthe IRS who had been previously fired for cause. We are talking about \nan agency that employs 80,000 people. Surely, it can find 140 people \nwho haven't committed fraud or falsified documents.\n  Mr. Speaker, the inspector general recommended that the IRS reassess \nits hiring practices to determine in what part of the process it should \nfully vet candidates in terms of their prior performance. In fact, the \nIRS was given an opportunity to fully respond to the inspector \ngeneral's report. In its response, the agency insisted its processes \nwere sufficient. Yet, Mr. Speaker, the agency still only begins to vet \nthe candidates for employment only after the entire hiring process is \ncompleted and after a formal offer of employment has been extended. So, \nregardless of any changes the IRS has made to its hiring practices, the \ninspector general said he remains very concerned because IRS documents \nindicate it is hiring individuals who have significant prior conduct \nand performance issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, because the IRS hasn't taken action is why we are here \ntoday. This bill is simple. It just says that the IRS cannot rehire \nemployees who have been fired for misconduct. It is something the IRS \nshould have taken action on; and because they didn't, that is why we \nare here today. It is our job to protect the taxpayers and to make sure \ntheir information is safe with the agency that they, by law, need to \nturn over to the IRS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mrs. NOEM.

While we have a mission to simplify that \nCode, the fact of the matter is they have to deal with the challenges \nthat they face today.\n  One of the agencies that they interact with or hope to interact with \nwhen they have questions is something called the Internal Revenue \nService. I want to focus on that third word--``service''--because the \nidea here is we don't have some oversight agency, and we don't have \nsome agency whose obligation and purpose in life is to make it harder \non the average hardworking taxpayers, who are supporting the government \nwith the money that they earn; it is to be a service--to use their \nresources to help the hardworking Americans who must pay taxes--and to \nsimplify the process, particularly when they have questions of a very, \nvery complex Code and its requirements that are being put on each and \nevery one of them. When we talk about service, what we need to see is a \npattern; and what we see is a pattern by which, unfortunately, the \nservice of the IRS is deteriorating rapidly.\n  Let me give you the facts, and I am talking about what they call the \nanswer time.\n  When an individual gets on the telephone because he is frustrated and \nhe calls the IRS and says, ``I have a question,'' this year, the IRS \nestimates it will receive 48.4 million calls with people asking for \nassistance. Do you know how many they will answer? Sixteen million. \nThat means that 32 million\n\n[[Page H1906]]\n\ntaxpayers will call the service, and their calls will go unanswered.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  What kind of private entity could survive in this day and age if that \nwas the kind of service that they were providing? What we are seeing is \nthat this is going in a backwards fashion.\n  If you are able to get through and finally talk to somebody, the wait \ntimes a few years ago were 18.7 minutes. Well, how many people who are \nworking at home, have other jobs, are doing things have 18.7 minutes \njust to wait for a phone call to be answered on an issue that they \nalready have anxiety about? Well, those were the good old days, Mr. \nChairman, 18.7 minutes, because today it is 34.4 minutes. If you are \none of the lucky 30 percent who even gets their call answered, you wait \n34.4 minutes.\n  It even gets better because what the IRS has implemented is a program \nnow called a courtesy disconnect. Well, if that isn't the most \noxymoronic thing that I have heard--a courtesy disconnect. In other \nwords, we are going to tell you ahead of time, when you call, we are \ngoing to disconnect your call right away because we are going to tell \nyou you are not going to be able to get through in time, so don't waste \nyour time trying to contact the IRS. Now, that just exacerbates the \nlevel of frustration.\n  So what do we do about it? What is a solution? Let me tell you, Mr. \nChairman, this isn't something that the Republicans on this side of the \naisle have sat and said: Oh, let's go get the IRS.\n  Mr. Chairman, the GAO, which has overlooked this agency for, now, 3 \nstraight years has been calling on the IRS to do something very simple. \nWhat they say is create a strategy and a plan to do a better job of \nanswering those calls, of being responsive to those very taxpayers that \nyour service requires you to do so. Just create a plan. It is that \nsimple.\n  The GAO issued recommendations to the IRS that they first outline a \nstrategy that defines appropriate levels of telephone and \ncorrespondence service and wait time lists and get specific steps to \nmanage service based on an assessment of timeframes, demand \ncapabilities, and resources. Just tell us how you can do it better.\n  Number two was direct the appropriate officials to systematically and \nempirically compare its telephone service to the best in business to \nidentify gaps between actual and desired performance; in other words, \nsee how it is being done in other places and aspire to do it as well. \nWell, as I said again, go back to the private sector. I imagine the \npeople aren't making 60 percent of the people that call, they don't \neven answer it.\n  Lastly, just improve taxpayer service by requiring the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy. That \nis what the GAO asked them to do. This recommendation has been repeated \nyear after year. Unfortunately, the response of the IRS to the GAO was \nthat their existing efforts were sufficient. They have yet to devise \nthis plan.\n  Mr. Chairman, you tell me, when 60 percent of the calls are \nunanswered and those that are calling have wait times of over 35 \nminutes, tell me where that is sufficient. And therein lies the heart \nof the problem, the complete unwillingness to do a simple issue and to \nbe responsive.\n  Now, there are other reasons, perhaps, that the IRS is diverting the \nvery resources that have been put in by this Congress to support \ntaxpayer services. In fact, the commitment to those taxpayer services \nhas gone down dramatically each and every year:\n  In 2013, they put $190 million into ensuring that there were \nappropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2014, they decreased it to \n$183 million to ensure that there were appropriate taxpayer services; \nand then, in 2015, they put $45 million into it.\n  So at a time when the GAO is telling them to do better, they are \nspeaking with their own specific acts to say: We think it is \nsufficient. And not only do we think it is sufficient, we are actually \npulling resources away from relations to the very taxpayers that we \nhave an obligation to service.\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill is really quite simple, and it is in response \nto that continuing unresponsiveness of those who manage the IRS. It is \nsimply saying to do what you have been requested to do.\n  Now, despite three GAO reports and continuing oversight by Congress, \nthe refusal to be responsive to that, we looked and said a very simple \nthing. It says do not pay bonuses to the employees until you have \nfulfilled the very simple requirement of coming up with this plan.\n  Now, somebody might say to me: Well, that is outrageous. Put new \nobligations on the IRS. They have not done it in 3 years.\n  But guess who has? The Department of Labor does it. The Department of \nAgriculture does it. The Department of Education does it. The Office of \nManagement and Budget does it. Each and every one of them, I would \nsuggest to you, Mr. Chairman, probably have a lot less interaction with \neveryday Americans, but they have taken the time to put together that \nplan.\n  So there is a template. We are not asking a whole lot. It has been \nspecific, laid out in the GAO report, simply to do that.\n  So we are asking very simply in the bill, do your job; and until you \nhave done that job, which other agencies are very capable of doing, no \nbonuses get paid.\n  It doesn't say no bonuses get paid at all. In fact, this is not \nantiworker. In fact, hardworking people at the IRS--and there are \nmany--they can get rewarded for appropriate work that they do. But \ndon't pay those bonuses until you, management, answer to them why you \nwon't do the service agreement or service plan. You tell your employees \nwhy you won't do it. Don't go blaming it on somebody else. That is the \nvery simple request that we have, which is to make the plan before you \nwrite the bonuses.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is not asking for much. It is certainly not asking \nfor much on behalf of the frustrated taxpayers of the United States who \nare seeing a demonstrated inability to communicate with the very agency \nthat is responsible for helping them solve the questions that they have \nwith respect to the complexities of the Tax Code.\n  Mr. Chairman, I look forward to continuing to debate this issue.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  What we are facing today is the worst kind of demagoguery, and really \nit descends to propaganda.\n  Look, the reason the phones aren't being answered is because the \nRepublican majority has failed to answer to its responsibilities. The \nappropriations have been going down. The last 5 years, the budget cut \nfor IRS has been close to $1 billion.\n  So you try to hide from your failure and you point your finger \neveryplace except where it belongs--yourselves. You want to say no \nbonuses to the 80,000 people because this House majority has failed to \nmeet its basic responsibility, and that is to fund so that there can be \nadequate resources to answer the phones. You are the ones who have shut \nit off.\n  So the problem is not a lack of strategy; it is a lack of resources. \nThe House Republicans are trying to pass the buck because they are not \nproviding the bucks necessary for adequate taxpayer services.\n  We had this chart yesterday, and here it is again. This shows, in the \nyellow, the amount of resources. In the blue, it shows the average time \nto answer the phone. As the resources have gone down, the time it takes \nhas gone up. That is a simple fact. The only time that changed was when \nthis institution provided some adequate resources, and so the time to \nanswer the phones went down.\n  Now you are back at it again, diminishing the resources, and you are \nessentially blaming the 80,000 people who don't get the adequate \nresources to do their jobs.\n  Now you say let's have a plan. There is already a system, but you \ndon't provide the resources to carry it out. You are saying come up \nwith a plan that will be looked at and approved by the inspector \ngeneral that doesn't have that responsibility. So that is why the White \nHouse stands in opposition, and I read:\n  ``Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit \nhighly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive \nto the Service's mission.''\n\n[[Page H1907]]\n\n  So I am going to point out other things you haven't done. Mr. Crowley \nlaid them out very, very well.\n  This place, under your leadership, has been bankrupt in terms of \naddressing the critical needs of the budget, the problems in Flint, the \nproblems faced by Puerto Rico, the problems faced by thousands of \npeople because of Zika. So you come here and you say, well, the IRS \nisn't doing its job. You are not doing your job. Don't go after an \nagency for not being able to answer the telephone when you essentially \nare cutting the lines of resources. It is outrageous. It is outrageous, \nand I think the people will know.\n  I say this to my constituents. When you call up and it takes hours, \ncall up your local Member of Congress, especially if he or she a member \nof the majority here. Call them up. If they don't answer the phone, try \nemail. And if there is no response, call one of us who are working to \nprovide the adequate resources for the IRS to answer the phones, and we \nwill try to find a way for you to communicate with your Member, if that \nperson has failed to meet his responsibilities. The blame is on your \ndoorstep. Don't try to shift it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). Members of the House are \nreminded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to each other in \nthe second person.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) control the remainder of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey will be recognized.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy).\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and \nhis work.\n  Mr. Chairman, every year the American people pay their taxes; and \nevery year to do that, they have to deal with an agency that is inept \nand increasingly unethical.\n  You can't make this stuff up. The IRS failed to answer 8 million \ncalls during tax season last year. Yet, over a short 5-year period, \nthey handed out nearly $6 million in bonuses to themselves.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Just to make this clear, that means the IRS can't take the taxpayers' \nphone calls, but they sure as heck can take the taxpayers' money for \ntheir bonuses.\n  Or how about this? The inspector general found that nearly 1,600 IRS \nemployees willfully avoided paying their own taxes over a 10-year \nperiod; yet, we trust these same people to collect taxes from their \nfellow citizens.\n  How is it that the agency charged with collecting taxes employs \npeople who don't pay their own taxes and that agency does nothing about \nit?\n  Now, it doesn't stop there. The IRS has a slush fund of money it \ncollects from fees that it uses however it wants. No accountability. No \ntransparency.\n  Meanwhile, about 500 IRS employees have been fired for misconduct, \nsuch as snooping on private taxpayers' information; yet, they have been \nhired back again.\n  The IRS selectively targeted for sanctions taxpayers who donated to \nRomney, intimidated nonprofit citizen groups, and sent out millions in \npotentially fraudulent tax refunds all in the past few years alone. You \nwonder why American people don't trust their government.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to look at these bills on the \nfloor. We are not trying to make some partisan statement here. We just \nwant our government to work for the people and work well. But, to do \nthat, we can't leave the IRS the way it has been.\n  We had bills yesterday on the floor by Congressmen Jason Smith and \nDavid Rouzer that put an end to the slush funds and to make sure the \npeople working at the IRS actually paid their taxes, and today we are \ngoing to pass more bills by Kristi Noem and Pat Meehan to stop the IRS \nfrom hiring people who can't be trusted and to fix the agency's \nabsolutely terrible customer service.\n  These are good bills. They are smart bills. Frankly, they are bills \nthat make you wonder how any reasonable person could ever vote against \nthem.\n  But I forgot how irrational some people could be. Just a few days ago \nthe Obama administration said they were against all four of these \nbills. Really?\n  They are against accountability? They are against IRS agency \nemployees paying their taxes? They want the IRS to fail to answer the \nvast majority of customer service calls? They want to rehire bad \nemployees?\n  I couldn't understand it. Frankly, the administration's statement \ndidn't clear things up either. The Office of Management and Budget \nactually said this: ``These bills would impose unnecessary constraints \non the Internal Revenue Service's . . . operations . . .''.\n  Now, let me get one thing out of the way. The administration is \nworried about imposing constraints on the IRS, but it has no problem \nimposing constraints and regulations on small businesses, energy \nproducers, manufacturers, to the point that it is driving them out of \nbusiness.\n  That shows you how backwards this administration's priorities are. \nThe IRS targets conservative groups, fails at basic tasks, and employs \npeople who don't pay their own taxes.\n  But the people who are trying to earn an honest living and power \ntheir homes and produce products right here in America? The \nadministration thinks they are the problem. They think they need to be \nregulated.\n  That is wrong. That is not what our country stands for, and it is not \nwhat this majority is going to stand for either.\n  But there is another principle here. The House is not trying to write \nsome laws and impose some rules on the IRS just because.\n  We are trying to restrain government because unaccountable and \nunelected bureaucrats have shown that they can't be trusted with the \npower they have been given.\n  When you say ``IRS,'' I can assure you that the last words people \nthink of are honest, fair, transparent, or even trustworthy.\n  That is not how our government should be, especially the arm of \ngovernment entrusted with collecting our taxes.\n  Because when people can't trust that their government is treating \nthem fairly, they lose faith in politics. They become cynical, and it \nincreases the divisions within our country.\n  Now, good government shouldn't be a one-party issue. I love the \ndebates about how small or how large government should be or how high \nor how low taxes should be.\n  But we can and we should agree that government should do its job well \nwithout abusing the trust of the American people. That should never be \na one-party argument.\n  That is what these bills are about. That is what this debate is \nabout. The American people are watching, Mr. Chairman, and they want us \nto make our choice, good government or bad.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have to respond to the previous speaker, whose \nsimplistic analysis has been exposed during this Presidential election.\n  We have selective memories. That is our problem, because how can you \ncome before the American people, Mr. Chairman, and explain how X amount \nof IRS workers have not paid their taxes?\n  We all want everybody to pay their taxes because when insufficient \nrevenue is in the coffers, we can't pay our bills.\n  But if the truth be known and we didn't have selective memory, when \nyou point out how many people in the IRS of the 80,000 employees--\n1,500--haven't paid their taxes or are in default of their taxes, the \ngentleman fails to mention that one of the biggest culprits in not \npaying their taxes is the very House of Representatives. My Lord. Five \npercent of the Members default on their taxes.\n  Now, what about us and our responsibilities? We are the guardians. We \nare the guardians. We are the protectors of the taxpayers. Beware, \ntaxpayers. Beware.\n  I have a great deal of respect--and I hope I have proven it in the \npast--for the gentleman who has introduced this legislation, the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). I just think we are off on \nthe wrong foot on this one.\n  In your support for the bill, H.R. 4890, you claim to be concerned \nabout IRS customer service. This bill would prohibit any bonuses being \npaid to IRS\n\n[[Page H1908]]\n\nemployees until the agency comes up with a customer service strategy \napproved by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\n  Customer service is critical. But how can you come here and complain \nabout customer service when you have cut the IRS budget $1 billion in \nthe last 5 years? That is 13,000 fewer full-time employees.\n  At the same time--listen to this, Mr. Chairman--there have been 9 \nmillion more tax returns being filed. Think about that just for a \nsecond: 9 million more tax returns, 13,000 fewer employees, $1 billion \nless in appropriations. I mean, that is not rocket science. It is \nsimply arithmetic.\n  Your budgets have consistently starved the IRS of the resources it \nneeds to do its job, and, true to form, this bill expressly forbids any \nadditional appropriations to carry out this mandate.\n  Here is the reality. The IRS customer service didn't decline because \nof lazy employees. It declined because of significant budget cuts. This \nyear, thanks to an extra $290 million in funding, it has rebounded to \nabout mediocre, still a disservice to many Americans who need help.\n\n  So I agree with the ranking member when he says to look in the mirror \nand you will see who is responsible.\n  Instead of helping the struggling people of Puerto Rico or Flint, \nMichigan, or passing a budget--tax day passed a few days ago--this \nCongress is fiddling with weakening the IRS. You can't deny that all \nthese attempts to harm the IRS are really harming taxpayers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, let me take a moment just to be responsive \nto a couple of things.\n  In point of fact, I don't think that I could have had a better setup \nfor the real issues here than the very arguments that have been made by \nmy colleagues because, in fact, when you look behind what is actually \ngoing on, you see the scheme that is taking place here, which has put \nthe IRS and the service that it gives to taxpayers right in the middle \nof the conflict.\n  What they have done is created a circumstance in which, if you \npurposely starve the very thing that will relate to the taxpayers, you \ncan get the taxpayers worked up to come back to scream for more money \nfor the Service: Let's blame this on Congress.\n  But let's talk about what is actually going on here, Mr. Chairman. \nThere may have been budget cuts, as there have been budget cuts all \nacross the government.\n  One of the budget cuts related to the $50 million that the IRS has \nused for conferences. And so, just like every other agency in \ngovernment, just like the 14 percent cut we have taken in our own \noffices, there have been cuts at a time in which our government doesn't \nhave money.\n  But that is not the issue. Because what has happened here has been \nthe diverting of funding. What nobody is saying is that this same \nagency has been hit with $1.7 billion of diverted expenditure to \nservice the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law that was pushed on \nus and pushed on all America; $1.7 billion has been diverted, will be \ndedicated this year, but never accounted for when that program was \ncreated.\n  They put this responsibility, another unfunded mandate put on the \nagency by this law. What they have done is divert the attention. Take \nthe resources away and then use it as a way to compel to see if we can \nforce Congress to get pulled into this debate.\n  Our thing is very, very simple. Again, it is not a funding issue. It \nis a service issue. We are not getting into that with this particular \nbill. It is a very simple thing that says: Create a plan for how you do \nit.\n  I am glad that the gentleman from New Jersey, who I respect \nenormously, has been able, Mr. Chair, to touch on the very point that \nwas also made, this idea that somehow we have been unresponsive and \nstarved this agency. Mr. Chairman, $290 million just sent purposely for \nthis issue, $290 million.\n  So in addition to saying to give us a plan, we are saying: Here is \n$290 million of focused funding to say this is behind the plan. Tell us \nhow you are going to use it.\n  This whole thing is a smokescreen on the part of the other side to \ncreate the tension when, in fact, we are asking for a very simple thing \nthat we have already funded.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers at this time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). The Committee will rise \ninformally.\n  The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Holding) assumed the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/house-section/article/H1908-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed bills of the following titles in which the \nconcurrence of the House is requested:\n\n       S. 1252.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, just in response to my friend from the Keystone State, \nthe implementation of the Affordable Care Act is not an IRS slush fund. \nThere are mandates within the Affordable Care Act which necessitate, \nobviously, the involvement of the IRS agency. So any attempts to make \nit or create a slush fund in people's minds is totally, totally \ninaccurate.\n  That is not the issue. The issue is we have cut $5 billion. This year \nwe restored $290 million. Again, do the math. We have 13,000 less \nemployees. So that means a lot of those 13,000 less employees came to \nthe end, perhaps, of their career, but were never replaced. It had \nnothing to do with the budget. It was beyond the budget, even, or \nwithin the budget.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers at this time, and \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Seven former IRS Commissioners wrote, and we need to take a look at \nit because obviously they weren't all Democrats and they weren't all \nRepublicans, but seven former IRS Commissioners have said: ``Over the \nlast 50 years, none of us has ever witnessed anything like what has \nhappened to the IRS appropriations over the last 5 years and impact \nthese appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.''\n  The percentage of callers able to reach a live person at the IRS in \nthe 2015 filing season was just 43 percent. The average wait time was \n28 minutes. At one point during the filing season, the Taxpayer \nProtection Program line, which answers calls for victims of identity \ntheft--a growing issue day by day--was not answering 90 percent of the \ncalls.\n  That is not acceptable to your side. It is certainly not acceptable \nto our side, but your solution is, by no means, the solution. If you \nwere truly concerned about improving customer service at the IRS, you \nwould fully fund the agency. And we would support that. Penalizing the \nIRS is misguided and, in the long run, the consequence hurts the \ntaxpayer.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). Members are again \nreminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, I want to once again actually appreciate the comments \nthat were made by the other side in the entirety of this debate because \nthey really speak to, in essence, what they are trying to do.\n\n[[Page H1909]]\n\n  And I start again with this effectively unfunded mandate that was put \non the IRS by the other side. They talk about funding. They gave them \n$1.7 billion of responsibility under the Affordable Care Act, but never \na penny to pay for it. As my parents used to say when I was a kid: You \nshould have thought about that when you did it.\n  Where was the recognition that these responsibilities that you are \nputting on them, you have got to pay for them?\n  We have seen costs rise exponentially in so many different factors, \nbut that is the essence of what is being done here. So we are not going \nto pay for it, but let's create tension and anxiety at the one place \nwhere the taxpayers will uprise, because we will stop talking to them. \nThat is the essence of what is being done here.\n  Mr. Chairman, once again, we are not asking for anything radical in \nresponse. In fact, we have already responded quite appropriately by \nputting $290 million more into the very issue that is at stake here.\n  All we are saying is: Come up with a plan. Show us how you are going \nto do it. Show us how, when 48 million people call you and ask for help \nwith their taxes at a time when they don't have 34 minutes to wait on a \nphone, to be one of the lucky 30 percent that even get their phone call \nanswered. Do what a number of other agencies already do, give us a plan \non how you are going to improve that.\n  It is that simple. Our purpose isn't to punish diligent IRS \nemployees, but rather to compel management to finally put the taxpayers \nfirst and take the need to improve the customer service experience \nseriously.\n  Upon learning that this legislation was in development, the IRS \nreported to the GAO that they have established a team to consider its \ncustomer service recommendations. How about that? After 3 years, no \nresponse.\n  The IRS Commissioner himself says service is abysmal. And they say it \nhas been satisfactory up to this point in time. But as soon as this \nlegislation is introduced, we have customer service recommendations and \na team being established. I don't think that is a coincidence. Passing \nthe bill into law will ensure that the process continues in good faith.\n  Mr. Chairman, Congress has a duty to oversee the IRS and ensure that \nit is meeting the needs of American taxpayers. When the IRS fails to \nmeet those needs, it is up to Congress to act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

BAN ON IRS BONUSES UNTIL IRS DEVELOPS \n                   COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury, and the \n     Secretary's delegate, may not pay a bonus, award, or similar \n     cash payment to any employee of the Internal Revenue Service \n     until the Secretary, or the Secretary's delegate, develops \n     and submits to Congress a comprehensive customer service \n     strategy that has been reviewed and approved by the Treasury \n     Inspector General for Tax Administration. Such strategy shall \n     include--\n       (1) appropriate telephone and correspondence levels of \n     service, which shall be based on service provided by the best \n     in business and customer expectations;\n       (2) a thorough assessment of which services the Internal \n     Revenue Service can shift to self-service options; and\n       (3) proposals to improve customer service in the short term \n     (the current and following fiscal year), medium term \n     (approximately three to five fiscal years), and long term \n     (approximately ten fiscal years).\n       (b) Progress Reports.--The Secretary of the Treasury, or \n     the Secretary's delegate, shall submit reports to the \n     Congress on the status of its customer service strategy and \n     actions taken to improve customer service. Such reports shall \n     be submitted on a semiannual basis until the comprehensive \n     customer service strategy under subsection (a) is fully \n     implemented.\n\n     SEC. 2. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated or \n     otherwise made available to carry out the requirements of \n     this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using \n     amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated or made \n     available.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 114-\n503. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in \nthe report, by a member designated in the report, shall be considered \nread, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally \ndivided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall be not \nbe subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for \ndivision of the question.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Meehan\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in House Report 114-503.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Brady), I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 23, strike ``or made available''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a technical amendment to \nclarify section 2 of the bill. This section states that no additional \nfunds are authorized or otherwise made available to carry out the \nrequirement of this bill. The language in the amendment makes it \nabundantly clear that we are not authorizing a new appropriation here.\n  The IRS needs to create a customer service agency. If they want to \nclaim that they don't have enough money in the budget to be serving the \ntaxpayers with an appropriate topnotch customer service strategy, then \nwe are saying: Give us a plan to do so, and withhold the bonuses until \nyou do so. It is very, very simple.\n  This amendment makes a technical correction to make our intentions \nhere crystal clear. The IRS doesn't need additional funding to make \ncustomer service the top priority when, in fact, it has already been \ngiven $290 million to do just this.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, once again, my friends on the other side \nof the aisle are cutting off their nose to spite their face: more \nmandates on the IRS with fewer resources and somehow expecting them to \nimprove services.\n  As I have said, the IRS is servicing 9 million more people with $1 \nbillion less. This amendment would only exacerbate that problem. The \nwords of the seven former IRS Commissioners ring out here.\n  Why don't we just cut congressional office budgets by 17 percent, as \nwe did with the IRS, and then mandate that we improve constituent \nservices or increase our workloads?\n  That doesn't make any sense either.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Sanford\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-503.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, after line 17, insert the following:\n\n[[Page H1910]]\n\n       (c) Consultation With Taxpayer Advocate.--In developing the \n     comprehensive customer service strategy pursuant to this \n     section, the Secretary, or the Secretary's delegate, shall \n     consult with the National Taxpayer Advocate.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Sanford) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have a small but, I think, perfecting \namendment that I think, whether Republican or Democrat, we can agree \non. Because I think as Republicans and Democrats, we may have different \nperspectives on this equation, but we would agree that money is power \nand that the IRS has an immense amount of power, given the amount of \nmoney that it is, in essence, steward to and controls as money is moved \nfrom individuals across this country to the Federal Government.\n  I think that we would agree that money without a plan is chaos. That \nis why in the military they have a five-paragraph order. That is why if \nyou think about the business rule, you have a business plan. If you \nthink about sports, you have got a game plan. You need to go through a \nplanning process to effectively use money.\n  I think we would agree that the government's role is to serve. I \nthink it disturbed a lot of us that the Lincoln Memorial was closed \nback during the government shutdown. Some people saw that as a way of \nmaximizing inconvenience for folks, as a way of highlighting some rule \nwe agreed or disagreed on as opposed to, again, staying focused on this \nlarger notion of service.\n  So I applaud the overall work of this bill and what it is about. I \nthink that there is a problem when wait times move up threefold over \nthe last 5 years. I think that there is a problem with dropped calls \nand infinity holds and all the other things that people have seen come \ntheir way as a result of dysfunction at the IRS. We might see different \nremedies as to how we get there, but I think we would agree on those \nthings.\n  And so I applaud what is being done with this notion of saying: Let's \nhold on bonuses. Let's actually come up with a plan as we deal with how \nthis additional $20 million is dispensed and used within the IRS.\n  This amendment simply says that as you go in consultation with the \nTreasury, as you go in consultation with the IG, let's also include the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate there at the IRS. Because I think it is \nimportant. You may deal with technology experts, you may deal with \nphone call experts, you may deal with taxation specialists, but to keep \nthe bull's-eye the ultimate customer out there--and that is the \ntaxpayer.\n  Too often the taxpayer is indeed the forgotten man or forgotten women \nin this equation. The idea of consulting with the National Taxpayers \nUnion as you formulate those plans, again, I think make this a simply \nperfecting amendment, as you listen to the different constituencies \nthat will be dealt with in coming up with this plan.\n  I think that perspective is key in holding the taxpayers' viewpoint \nto be vital in the creation of this plan. That is all the amendment \ndoes.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, let me just take a moment to say that the National \nTaxpayer Advocate has a long history of not only working on behalf of \ntaxpayers, but working with the IRS to improve customer service. I \nthink having the National Taxpayer Advocate involved in this process of \ncreating comprehensive service strategy will actually improve the final \noutcome.\n  I thank the gentleman for taking his time not only to look at the \ntotality of this bill, but to find a way to improve its implementation \nwith that support.\n  I support the addition, and I urge others to vote ``yes'' on the \namendment.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, so let's get this amendment straight. \nThis bill would have the IRS work with the National Taxpayer Advocate, \nin addition to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, \nas I read it correctly, in coming up with a customer service plan. \nSounds good.\n  However, you forget to mention one thing, Mr. Chairman, because the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate and the Treasury Inspector General Tax \nAdministrator have publicly stated, for the record, that the severe \nbudget cuts enacted by the other side, Mr. Chairman, in Congress have \nforced the IRS to reduce its workforce, reduce training, reduce \ntechnology, and that these steps have weakened the ability to enforce \nthe Nation's tax laws--is that what you are looking for?--and serve \ntaxpayers effectively.\n  They said it, I didn't. You can't make this stuff up.\n  So, instead of forcing the IRS to work with the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate, why don't we, in Congress, listen to them, and fund the IRS \nso it can do its job?\n  This is the height of misdirection. I am only going by the words you \nhave in this amendment. And I will tell you, they have made a statement \nvery loud and clear to all of us.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nWomack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Kelly of Mississippi, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 4890) to impose a ban on the payment of bonuses to employees of \nthe Internal Revenue Service until the Secretary of the Treasury \ndevelops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy, and, \npursuant to House Resolution 688, he reported the bill back to the \nHouse with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on passage of H.R. 4890 will be followed by a 5-minute vote \non passage of H.R. 3724.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy) for the purposes of inquiring of the majority leader the \nschedule for the week to come.\n  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On \nTuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for \nlegislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On \nWednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour \nand noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at \n9:00 a.m. for legislative business.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 4498, the Helping \nAngels Lead Our Startups Act, sponsored by Representative Steve Chabot. \nThis bill extends the role of angel investing in assisting start-up \nbusinesses to acquire the financing needed to grow, innovate, and \ncreate jobs.\n  The House will also consider H.R. 4901, the Scholarship for \nOpportunity and Results Reauthorization Act, sponsored by \nRepresentative Jason Chaffetz. This bill is essential to improving \neducation outcomes for low-income students in the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.J. Res. 88, sponsored by \nRepresentative Phil Roe, which disapproves of the rules submitted by \nthe Department of Labor relating to the definition of the term \n``fiduciary.'' This ill-advised rule will result in thousands of \nindividuals being dropped by their financial advisers and unable to \nreceive sound financial advice.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information as \nto the schedule. As I am sure he knows, I will want to ask him some \nquestions about things that are not yet scheduled and, of course, the \nnext week we will take a recess.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  As the gentleman knows, the budget was passed out of the Budget \nCommittee last month. We understand, of course, obviously, the \nAppropriations Committee is proceeding to mark up bills notwithstanding \nthe fact that the budget has not been passed.\n  We are not sure exactly what the allocations for each subcommittee \nare going to be because, apparently, there has been no 302(b) \nallocation, which is the allocation to the 12 subcommittees.\n  It is going to be hard for us to tell exactly how much money is left \nif, in fact, appropriations bills are brought to the floor without \nknowing fully the distribution of funds for both defense and domestic \npriorities.\n  First, let me ask the gentleman: Does the gentleman expect the budget \nto be brought to the floor prior to the bringing of appropriations \nbills to the floor?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  We will continue to work through the budget process, and I will \nupdate the Members once there is more information.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for the depth of that information.\n  We do have a serious problem. And I want to tell my friend, the \nmajority leader, as someone who had served on the Appropriations \nCommittee for 23 years, obviously, one of the important facts to know \nis how much will be allocated for each one of the 12 subcommittees so \nyou can make judgments, as bills come to the floor or as they come to \nfull committee, about whether the funding levels for those are \nappropriate or whether there ought to be other priorities that ought to \nbe brought to the floor.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's response. I know that the Speaker has \nindicated that doing a budget is absolutely the responsible thing to \ndo, that that is the regular order to do, and I know the budget has \npassed out of the committee. So I am wondering: What is holding the \nbudget up, Mr. Leader? Why aren't we considering it?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and asking again.\n  As for the schedule, we are not scheduled for next week. We continue \nto work through. We think the budget is very important. When we have it \nscheduled, I will notify.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman, I suppose, for that additional \ninformation.\n  Of course, it goes without saying that it is not scheduled next week, \nand we still don't have the knowledge that I think is necessary for us \nto have before you bring the appropriations bills to the floor. In \nhaving said that, I understand the gentleman's answer.\n  There are three items that I have brought up before, Mr. Leader, that \nwe think are critical items to be brought sooner rather than later that \nwe need to deal with.\n  First, I want to reiterate what I said last week. I appreciate the \nmajority leader's and I appreciate the Speaker's action and the \nchairman of the committee, Mr. Bishop, in working with Treasury and \nwith our side of the aisle to try to get a bill that we can agree on--\nthat can enjoy bipartisan support--that will address the crisis that \nconfronts the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico.\n  I also want to thank the gentleman--we had a meeting in his office--\nin that he and I shared the view that we ought to have a bill that is \nsimple and straightforward so that we can forge a bipartisan agreement \nand get this bill done.\n  The Speaker has set May 1 as the deadline. It would appear that we \nare not going to meet that deadline. And we did not meet the March 31 \ndeadline. But I know we had a meeting yesterday with our staffs. It was \na positive meeting, and I hope it will lead to a productive meeting as \nwell.\n  I would like to yield to my friend to see if the gentleman has any \ncomments about where we stand on our moving forward on a bill to \naddress the fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Yes, the gentleman is correct in that we have been working together, \nespecially with the Natural Resources Committee, on the proposal.\n\n[[Page H1913]]\n\n  I appreciate the gentleman's commitment as well in making sure that \nwe produce a bill that has solid financial footing and no financial \nbailout, which the work we are doing right now does not.\n  As the gentleman knows, the discussions are ongoing, and part of the \nchallenge of finishing it is the Treasury Department. The Treasury \nDepartment still had some concerns.\n  I know there were some meetings this week, and I know there were \nMembers on your side of the aisle who did not feel comfortable in \nmoving forward until the Treasury Department had finished some of those \nnegotiations.\n  But we look forward to getting the bill finished and moving it \nforward on a bipartisan basis, a bill that has no bailout, but that \nmeets the needs with what is going on in Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  I would reiterate what he and I both stated last week, which is that, \nclearly, this is not a bailout. There is no money contemplated that is \ngoing to Puerto Rico, and there is no extension of U.S. credit backing \nfrom the United States to Puerto Rico.\n  What it is, as the gentleman knows, is just setting up a process for \na restructuring of debt that everyone knows cannot be paid, and there \nneeds to be some sort of rational way that Puerto Rico can work itself \nto both repay that which it can repay while, at the same time, maintain \nthe absolutely essential services of education, health care, and public \nsafety for the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico. So I would \nhope that we would continue to work on that.\n  Again, the majority leader's staff and my staff, Treasury, and Mr. \nBishop's staff, the leader's staff and Mr. Ryan's staff all have been \nworking towards that end, and I appreciate that.\n  But I think we all feel a sense of urgency. Even if we could work it \nout over the weekend or before we end next week, if we could bring it \nto the floor next week, if we had an agreement, I think that would be a \ngood thing for us to do. I don't know whether it is possible--I hope it \nis possible--but I look forward to working with the majority leader \ntowards that end.\n  There are two other items, as you know, that I have mentioned in the \npast.\n  Zika. There was a very compelling editorial in The Washington Post \ntoday about Zika. The administration has asked for $1.9 billion to \naddress that crisis, which, clearly, almost every week, the CDC says is \na growing one, with more exposure, with more of the United States' \nmainland being implicated as being at risk.\n  In addition to that, of course, Ebola continues to be a continuing \nhealth challenge both in Africa and in this country, but mainly in \nAfrica. As you know, we appropriated money.\n  Mr. Rogers and the Appropriations Committee and the gentleman said: \nLook, we can take some of that money and move it over to the Zika \neffort.\n  The problem with that, Mr. Leader, as I think you have heard me say \nbefore, is that Ebola continues to be a crisis.\n\n  Is there any expectation that we could bring a supplemental \nappropriations bill for this emergency that confronts the health of our \npeople here, in Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean, and, frankly, in other \nparts of the world? Is there any chance of bringing a supplemental to \nthe floor to address both of those?\n  In addition, Flint continues to be on bottled water because they have \nnot yet been provided with a water system that works for their people.\n  So those three items, in addition to Puerto Rico, I think are \ncompelling, timely issues for us to address.\n  Will the gentleman give me any additional information as to when that \nmight occur?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I want to take the opportunity to thank the gentleman for working \nwith us on Zika.\n  As he knows, I approached him early on to make sure we dealt with \nthis in a bipartisan manner. As to any threat, we want to make sure it \nis not a partisan issue.\n  As the gentleman knows, there was somewhere around $2 billion in \nunobligated Ebola money. One of the ideas, especially when the \nadministration had requested money, was to have time to go through and \nask the question, and many of those questions have not been answered \nyet.\n  We wanted to make sure no funding problems would happen. We are proud \nof the administration for its being able to take our idea and move \nalmost $600 million into Zika as we go forward. That will take us quite \na ways into this fiscal year.\n  We are continuing to look at and to ask questions. I have a whole \nlist here of questions that have been asked from a standpoint of an \nupdated spending plan from HHS, which still hasn't been planned, of \nwhere they go, of what activities will the funds carry out, of how much \nfunding do the agencies anticipate needing in 2016.\n  I mean, as the gentleman knows, never should we write a blank check, \nbut never should we turn a blind eye to a problem. I am proud of the \nfact that we have not and that we have responsibly made sure that close \nto $600 million is used right now.\n  We have asked the questions of what we need to go forward. I know the \nAppropriations Committee is continuing to work on that. We have the \nappropriations process going through, and that will probably be the \nideal time to deal with it and anything going any further because we \nwould have the questions answered and the ability to fund it.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  Let me make a couple of observations.\n  I hear there is some discussion about the appropriations process. As \nthe gentleman well knows, the appropriations process hasn't done too \nwell lately.\n  Forgetting about who is to blame or who is not to blame, the \nappropriations process, essentially, has not worked, as the gentleman \nknows. Of course, last year, as we had done the year before, we passed \nan omnibus and didn't pass the appropriations bills.\n  My view is we have an emergency. It is doubtful that appropriations \nbills are going to get done in time. My own supposition is we are going \nto have a CR in September.\n  We have, really, 40 days left between now, I think, and the August \nbreak of legislative days. It is going to be problematic, at best, to \nget appropriations bills done by October 1, much less to respond to an \nemergency, which is why we believe that a supplemental, really, is \ncalled for.\n  We have two emergencies that are ongoing and a third in Flint, \nMichigan, and we believe that we ought to respond to those long before \nthe possibility, much less the probability, of the appropriations bills \npassing this House, the Senate, and being signed by the President.\n  Does the gentleman have any thoughts on that? Because, if you are \ncontemplating an appropriations process, Mr. Leader, with all due \nrespect, past history would tell us, over the last few years--again, \nforgetting about who is to blame for it--the appropriations process \ndoes not get done in a timely fashion.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, the Appropriations Committee has already \nmarked up three bills. The gentleman having served on Appropriations, \nhe also understands that that is where you get a lot of questions \nanswered, that that is where you get a lot of the good information from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  There is close to $600 million for Zika right now. I have the same \nconcern that you have. That is why I am telling the administration and \nthe agencies that it would be very helpful if they would answer the \nquestions needed.\n  Where would this money go? There are so many from the perspective of: \nIs Ebola no longer a public health risk? You have $2 billion, \nunobligated, sitting in there that we could use.\n  If we want to solve the Zika problem, I think we should all work \ntogether. I am looking for the administration to answer some questions. \nI think that is the most responsible way to go about solving this \nproblem.\n  I haven't given up on the appropriations process. I think it is a \nperfect opportunity, and I would think, for Members on both sides of \nthe aisle, maybe it would give them a little incentive, in knowing the \nchallenges that are out there for the American public, that this is the \nprocess that was created. And we could all have input.\n\n[[Page H1914]]\n\n  One thing that we know, since this majority has taken over, is that \nwe have an open process in appropriations as well; so, anybody can \noffer an amendment. I think that would be the best place to deal with \nthis.\n  I do have a very personal compassion in talking about water. I know \nthe situation that happened in Flint. I have lived with water problems \nin California for quite some time. For the last three Congresses, I \nhave fought very hard to solve that for California.\n  Unfortunately, the other Chamber has done nothing. I have kids in the \nCentral Valley who do not have water, people who are on bottled water \nthey bring in, people who have portable water, where they have to come \nin and bring the tanks.\n  We have lived this for quite some time; so, you will find, on this \nside of the aisle, someone who is very compassionate about it and who \nwants to deal with that water issue at the same time as well. I think \nit would be appropriate.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments and for his \nconcern, which I think is sincere, about California.\n  Let me say to him that I would certainly be open on this side of the \naisle, as, I am sure, my Members would be, to working with him to \naddress those issues.\n  It is not a question of Flint, per se, but it is a question of some \n6,000 to 9,000 children who have been exposed immediately, and it is an \nemergency now as they are not able to drink the water; they are \ndrinking bottled water.\n  My point is not that we ought not to address problems in California \nor, very frankly, in Maryland or in Ohio or in Florida or wherever else \nthey may occur in league with the States and municipalities. Obviously, \nthis is a partnership, not just our responsibility.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  I would again reiterate, Zika and Ebola are both emergencies that \nneed to be dealt with now. I think the gentleman is absolutely correct \nthat we ought to know how much is needed, how it is going to be spent, \nand what effect it will have.\n  I will tell you that one of my members in the whip meeting this \nmorning, Mr. Leader, said that her understanding from her local health \ndepartment was that their efforts with respect to Ebola and other \ninfectious diseases are being adversely affected by the fact that that \n$589 million, which didn't just come out of the air, was transferred, \nas you pointed out and as I pointed out, to the Zika response. It was \nmoney that was--not obligated--planned to be spent in communities and \nin other areas to effect a solution to the challenge that confronts us.\n  So it is not just as if that $589 million didn't have a purpose when \nwe originally appropriated it. The gentleman supported it and I support \nit, so we allocated that money. I know the Appropriations Committee \nsupported it. And I presume, as the gentleman points out, they had \nhearings to know exactly the answers to the questions. But we will work \nwith you on getting answers to those questions from the administration.\n  We would urge that, within the next few weeks, we have a supplemental \non the floor, having those questions answered and being confident that \nthe money is going to be spent, but knowing full well that people's \nhealth is at risk in this country. We have an empathy and a concern \nabout that and want to respond to it. So I would hope that we could \nmove it before the appropriations process because I think, \nunfortunately, the experience is, under all the parties that have been \nin control of this House over the years, that sometimes it happens \nslower than this emergency requires.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/house-section/article/H1914-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016, TO MONDAY, APRIL 25, 2016\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

That is about $35 billion a year on our nuclear enterprise. \nAccording to the CBO, this is about 5 to 6 percent of the total cost of \nthe administration's plans for our national defense for the next 10 \nyears.\n  Next week, the House Armed Services Committee will mark up the fiscal \nyear 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, our military bill, if you \nwill.\n  One of my main priorities in the committee has been to reduce our \nNation's nuclear weapons spending and to reduce our nuclear stockpile. \nUnfortunately, year after year, the Congress authorizes funding for \nmore weapons while capping the funding that we use to dismantle nuclear \nweapons. I think it is a far safer world without these nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. Speaker, rather than spend on the legacy of the cold war, we \nshould be investing in our most important military asset: our men and \nour women in uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/house-section/article/H1914-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1914-H1915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD.

Mr. Speaker, in the marshy plains where the San \nJacinto River meets Buffalo Bayou, now near Houston, General Sam \nHouston and his volunteer Army of Texians--men from most States and \nseveral countries, including Mexico, England, and Germany--faced the \ninvading army under dictator Santa Anna of Mexico. Texas was fighting \nfor independence from Mexico because Mexico had abolished its democracy \nand became an oppressive dictatorship.\n  It was the afternoon of April 21, 1836--180 years ago today. The \nTexian volunteers, although outnumbered 2-1, caught the enemy literally \nby surprise. On that hot afternoon, General Sam, with his Tejano \nCavalry protecting the flank, charged the invaders with the battle cry: \nRemember the Alamo. Remember Goliad.\n  In 18 minutes, the battle was over. Half of the enemy were killed, \nand the other half were captured. On that day, Texas gained freedom and \nindependence.\n  Sam Houston became President of the Republic of Texas. Texas was an \nindependent country for 9 years and then joined the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, our past has allowed us to have today's freedom.

Mr. Speaker, in Bangladesh, the horrendous, brutal \nstreet assassinations of members of minority religions, secularists, \nand atheists violate every single value that we hold dear.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, 28-year-old Nazimuddin Samad was hacked to death in \nDhaka, Bangladesh, after speaking out against the persecution of \nreligious minorities on social media.\n  Evelyn Beatrice Hall, the late British author, wrote: ``I disapprove \nof what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.''\n  In Bangladesh, discrimination and deadly violence against atheists, \nsecularists, Hindus, Buddhists, and other religious minorities have \nunfortunately become a regular occurrence.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, in October of this year, the Republic of \nGeorgia will hold elections. More than just an election to determine \nits national leadership, this election will likely determine whether \nthe Republic of Georgia remains a semi-free country that will continue \non a path to self-determination or whether it will succumb to \ncorruption, Russian oligarch influence, and Russian domination.\n  Georgia has a long history of fighting to protect its identity \nagainst evil tyrants, bullying neighbors, corrupted officials, and \noutright invasion. A small but important nation with its distinct \nlanguage and people, Georgian territory forms a vital land bridge \nbetween Eastern Europe and West Asia that is nestled on the Black Sea. \nWith the exception of her neighbor Armenia, much of her history has \nbeen fighting for survival against her neighbors wanting to force her \ninto Russian, Turkish, or Persian domination.\n  Since Georgia's reassertion of independence from her Russian masters \nin 1991, her struggle has not been easy. Balanced between a crumbling \nSoviet Union and internal unrest, Georgia emerged from several years of \ncivil strife to defend her independence. Georgia saw her first \nPresident, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, ousted by Russian-backed leaders, such \nas Eduard Shevardnadze. During attempts to restore elected government, \nPresident Gamsakhurdia later would lose his life in still mysterious \ncircumstances.\n  After a period of domination by Russian-backed forces and political \nleaders, the nascent Republic of Georgia strove for great reforms in \nthe Rose Revolution of 2003, finally breaking her chains and setting a \npath toward self-determination. The United States and the international \ncommunity embraced\n\n[[Page H1916]]\n\nthis effort, and global monitors affirmed the legitimate vote of the \npeople that exposed the corruption of the election results.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Shevardnadze's government attempted to ignore the true results, but \nthe Georgian people had a different plan and peacefully forced \nShevardnadze to succumb to the will of the people as they stormed the \nparliament with roses. It was one of the most inspirational episodes of \nfreedom in world history.\n  Since then, Georgia has enjoyed a period of self-determination, \nWestern engagement, human rights improvements, and trade. This has not \nbeen without cost. Separatists in the Georgian districts of Ossetia and \nAbkhazia, encouraged by Moscow, cast the Republic of Georgia into \nturmoil. Russia used this unrest as pretext to invade Georgia and still \noccupies these territories while denouncing earlier agreements to close \nRussian bases on Georgia's Black Sea coast.\n  Still, President Mikheil Saakashvili was able to take his rightful \nplace as the duly elected President of Georgia, and his reforms brought \nGeorgia from a backward status in the world to a much improved \nfinancial structure, with marked increases in economic growth and \nforeign investment.\n  For all of Georgia's struggles, for all of her self-determination, \noutside neighbors once again are vying to make Georgia subservient to \ntheir wishes. Russia has been stung by free peoples in independent \nstates that she once dominated in the Soviet era that now choose \ninstead to preserve their language, culture, history, and restore their \nfreedom.\n  Russia, for its part, has done everything in its power to force these \npeoples back into a serf status. Whether in Crimea, Ukraine, the Baltic \nStates, or Georgia, the pattern has been the same.\n  Russia's playbook starts with flooding opposition groups with cash \nfrom oligarchs loyal to Moscow. Separatists are courted in areas with \nsome Russian ethnicity and then encouraged to foment division against \nthese struggling republics, demanding their rights for Russian peoples \nin these territories.\n  Russia then aids militias to create violence that strains the local \npolitical and law enforcement structure, causing the people living \nthere to wish for anything--even the bad old days--to somehow restore \norder.\n  Then national political parties are infiltrated and flushed with \noligarch cash and promises of power as they convert legitimate \nparliaments into calls for pro-Moscow governance that, in essence, \nbecome nothing more than the old Soviet Socialist structure ruled by \nMoscow.\n  In Georgia, it has been no different. Despite Georgia casting off \noutside invaders and attempting to push off the chains of Russia in the \nearly 1800s or in 1918 or in 1991, Russia somehow feels it is her right \nto treat Georgians as a subclass of human beings that only exist to \nserve the interests of Moscow and her territory should only merely be a \ntransitway for Russian interests.\n  After the successful removal of Russian chains in the Rose Revolution \nin 2003, Russia has continually bullied Georgia's political system, \nfomented unrest in Abkhazia and Ossetia, invaded Georgia, and violated \nher agreement to withdraw from bases in Georgian territory. Amazingly, \nthrough all of this, Georgia has remained resolute.\n  So, in classic form, Russia has moved to infiltrate the political \nprocess in the hopes of creating its own pro-Moscow government in the \nGeorgian capital to hand them everything on a silver political platter.\n  Chief among the funding efforts and political infiltration is \noligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The aim \nis to rig votes along the same lines as was attempted in 2003 by buying \nvotes, punishing political opponents, using Georgia's own \nadministrative and political resources to influence the elections while \nusing Georgian special forces to influence the outcomes.\n  Combined with the full privatization of the election commissions, who \none source estimates is now 98 percent controlled by Ivanishvili, the \nGeorgian people face an alarming prospect in their right to free \nelections in October of this year.\n  Faced with such bullying, the Georgian people are looking to the \nworld for support. It is somehow fitting, Mr. Speaker, that this \nSaturday marks St. George's Day in world history.\n  St. George, the Christian martyr and mythical slayer of dragons, is \nthe namesake from whom the country of Georgia takes its name, according \nto some legends.\n  The Georgian people are willing to slay this political dragon and \nstand for their freedom as they have before, but they need our help.\n  We can ignore their pleas--after all, most Americans don't even know \nwhere Georgia is on the map--or we can give them a megaphone to shout \ntheir message, and the message is this: They wish to remain free.\n  Here are some simple steps that we, in our country, can take: We call \non the President of the United States to assist in monitoring of this \nfall's election processes in Georgia, as we once assisted them in the \npivotal 2003 elections.\n  We call upon the Georgian electoral commissions to be restored to \nrepresentative membership to counter the private buyout being conducted \nby Moscow and their proxy, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili.\n  We call upon the United States Department of Treasury and Western \nbanks to freeze the assets of Ivanishvili for violations as an illegal \narms trader.\n  We call upon the State Department to flag Georgian officials and \nbusiness leaders who are discovered to be complicit in tampering with \nfree elections to have their visas revoked and their assets frozen.\n  We also call upon Western journalists in our free press to give the \nGeorgian people a chance to have their story heard by investigating and \ncovering the remaining few months of what could be the last free months \nof a Republic of Georgia.\n  Finally, we call upon the self-determined, free, and resolute people \nof Georgia to stand in the spirit of St. George.\n  Hold your head high, grasp the lance, and pierce the attacking \ndragon. You have been threatened before. By your commitment, as in \n2003, you can show the world again that freedom will not succumb to \ncorruption and intimidation.\n  The people of Georgia should also know the God of the universe does \nnot slumber. We, the people of the United States, join with the people \nof Georgia in our prayers for your freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/house-section/article/H1916-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1916-H1920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE WEEK IN REVIEW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I so much appreciate my colleague and \nfriend talking about the Georgia election. We should be encouraging \nfair elections everywhere and, when they are not fair, calling those to \naccount.\n  Not that we are the policemen of the world, but it becomes so much \nmore unfortunate when you have a nation like Egypt that gets pushed \ninto elections before they are ready, the Muslim Brotherhood takes over \nthe country, as in Egypt when Morsi became President.\n  He began shredding the Constitution and taking more and more power as \nit happened in Venezuela with Chavez and other countries. He had taken \na lesson: This is the way you do it. You get elected, and then you \nstart seizing more and more power.\n  To the credit of the Egyptian people, their story in recent years is \nthe greatest peaceful uprising in the history of the world. It wasn't \nentirely peaceful because of the violence of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n  They want a world caliphate, and they want to start with something \nresembling the old Ottoman Empire, that caliphate that came around \nNorth Africa and on around the Mediterranean, and they need Egypt in \norder to make the beginning of the caliphate work.\n  And so they were quite happy when radical Islam, Muslim Brotherhood, \ntook over Egypt through Morsi. But when the Egyptian people, a third of \nthe population, basically--30 million or so of the 90 million there in \nthe nation of Egypt--rose up together, yes, you had Muslims marching \nwith Christians.\n\n[[Page H1917]]\n\n  The Coptic Christian Pope himself has told me more than once how \nmoving it was to have Muslims and Christians and Jews and secularists \nwalking together through the streets in Egypt demanding an end to \nradical Islamic control, demanding that the President, who was \nconstantly violating the Constitution, be removed.\n  The Coptic Pope told me that it was moving when Muslims, who just \nwanted peace in Egypt--they didn't want radical Islamic control--would \ncome up to him and apologize for the way that Morsi and the Muslim \nBrotherhood and radical Islamists were acting.\n  And, yes, among Muslims, they are able to recognize that there is a \npart of Islam--the radical Islamists--that they don't like, but it is a \npart of Islam.\n  When the administration in this country tells the world that there is \nno such thing as radical Islam, then they are demeaning and degrading \nthose courageous Muslims who stand up and say: We need to stop radical \nIslam within Muslims, within the Islamic movement. They actually do \ndamage to the people who want to live in peace.\n  So we are grateful to the people of Egypt for stopping the caliphate \nbefore it could be really set in concrete around North Africa and, of \ncourse, Syria, all the way around. They want to get back to the old \nOttoman Empire and spread and cover the world under the caliphate.\n  It is really most interesting. We have a President who went to \nelementary school in Muslim school and was trained in Islam in \nelementary school, and that is the main part of his training on Islam. \nBecause, as we know, he sat under Jeremiah Wright's teaching in church \nfor 20 years or so.\n  So the basic teaching on Islam was in elementary school, whereas \nthere is the ultimate world expert on what is or is not Islam that most \nof the world recognizes.\n  They don't down the street here, down Pennsylvania Avenue. They don't \nat the State Department under Secretary Kerry. But most of the world \nrecognizes that a man who got degrees, including his doctor of \nphilosophy, his Ph.D., in Islamic studies from the University of \nBaghdad, is an expert on Islam.\n  He says radical Islam is Islam. He didn't just get a little \nelementary school training on Islam. He studied Islam his whole life, \nhas a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, and has continued to pour himself into \nstudy of the Koran, and he happens to be the head of the Islamic State.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  It would seem that if somebody who spent his life studying--rather \nthan just studying Islam in elementary school--says the Islamic State \nis truly Islam, perhaps the so-called experts in our State Department \nand our White House ought to listen to that and take notice as well \nthat perhaps maybe it is not as they have been saying, that it is not \nIslam. It is Islam, but it is a part of Islam, the radical Islamists, \nand we should be standing against it.\n  So, again, the Iran treaty clearly is a treaty. It needs to be called \nfor what it is: a treaty. And we need to have people in the Senate with \ncourage to step up and say we need a vote on the Iran treaty, because \nit is a treaty. The Corker bill doesn't apply because it is a treaty. \nTake the vote. Two-thirds will not vote for it. It will not be \nconfirmed. Then we can call the Iran treaty at an end, because it never \nwas properly agreed to.\n  But in the meantime, since this administration put so much of what \ncredibility it has on the table and at risk by backing the Iran deal, \nIran--it may be the run-in leaders, their radical Islamic leaders, want \nto take over the world. They may be crazy in that regard, they may be \npower crazy in that regard, but they are very intelligent. You can be \ncrazy and still be highly intelligent. That is how you can be crazy \nenough to fly a plane into a building and kill thousands of innocent \npeople, but you are intelligent enough to have your engineers look at \nthe plans and figure out what kind of load it would take to bring down \na building like the World Trade Center.\n  An article by Joel Pollak from last year--this is last year--and he \nsays: ``In his State of the Union address'' last year, ``President \nBarack Obama claimed: `Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, \nwhere, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its \nnuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between \nnow and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive \nagreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our \nallies, including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East \nconflict.' ''\n  Mr. Pollak's article says: ``None of that is true. The chances of an \nagreement have dropped sharply, and even the most optimistic analysts \ndo not expect a deal that `prevents a nuclear-armed Iran,' but only one \nthat puts nuclear `breakout' out of reach for a while. Most important \nof all, we have not `halted the progress' of Iran's nuclear program. \nEarlier this month, the Tehran regime announced that it was building \ntwo new reactors, and is thought to be behind a suspected facility \nplanned in Syria as well.\n  ``In a lengthy essay in Commentary magazine, the invaluable Omri \nCeren summarizes the history of President Obama's appeasement of the \nIranian's, from the first failed `suckers deal,' as the French called \nit, through the new veto threats against congressional sanctions.\n  ``The scale of the Obama administration's incompetence is simply \ndaunting. Far from rallying international unity against Iran, President \nObama has destroyed it by giving away global demands decades in the \nmaking.\n  ``Suddenly, the reason for . . . invitation to Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu to Congress--without consultation from the White \nHouse--becomes clear . . . it is not the pro-Israel nature of Congress \nthat drove the Bibi''--Netanyahu--``invitation. It is the fact that \nObama''--\n  Well, it says he misrepresented things, but that is this article.\n  But it goes on to point out that ``there at least five ways in which \nIran has explicitly violated the interim agreement'' and spells those \nout.\n  This is over a year old. They have never stopped violating the \nagreement--not the interim agreement--they were violating it, the \nexecutive agreement that this President entered with Iran.\n  They so much sank their reputation into the Iran treaty that has not \nbeen ratified that these constant violations by Iran have the \nadministration defending Iran, sending them money, covering for Iran, \nmaking excuses for Iran.\n  This article was from less than a year ago by Cory Bennett from The \nHill: ``A diplomatic deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program could \ninadvertently jumpstart the country's cyber warfare efforts.\n  ``Experts say Tehran might use the economic sanctions relief from the \nnuclear pact to buttress its growing cyber program, which has already \ninfiltrated critical networks in over a dozen countries, including the \nU.S.''\n  So the article goes on to point out: ``We are in a lose-lose \nsituation.''\n  It is clear to most of us that the Iranian agreement was a huge \nmistake. They are the largest state supporters of terrorism in the \nworld, and this administration is ongoing right now in giving billions \nand billions of dollars.\n  And though the Iranian leaders have lied about so many things, when \nthey say that the money that President Obama gives to them, which they \ndon't currently have--the $100 billion to $150 billion in the first \nyear, perhaps $100 billion or so each year after that; it remains to be \nseen--their Iranian leaders say:\n\n       We are going to be able to fund more terrorist \n     organizations.\n\n  That is a statement we should take seriously. That is something that \nwe should believe when they tell us these things.\n  So the President is giving them the money. This article says this \nweek that, of the $3 billion that was recently provided to Iran, this \nadministration can't really tell if they have used it to support \nadditional terrorism or not.\n  But this article that was written in May of last year that the Iran \ndeal could help fund Iran's cyber war, I bring that up now--it is from \nMay 10 of last year from Mr. Bennett--because it was just in the last 4 \nor 5 months that John Hayward wrote the article: ``Iran Hacks State \nDepartment Social Media Accounts.''\n  We know they have hacked a New York dam Web site. They have explored \ndefenses of the United States Government's Internet.\n\n[[Page H1918]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to look back and see that, wow, in May \nof last year, there were reporters that were warning that this deal \nwith Iran may help them in their cyber warfare against us greater than \nwe even know. Then we find out that this administration put a hold on \ncharges against the Iranians that hacked into our government system \nuntil after the deal was made so that people didn't raise more of a \nfuss to try to stop the Iranian treaty.\n  Well, it is still not too late. The Senate could go ahead and take a \nvote. We know that Harry Reid had said:\n\n       Gee, there are some low-level confirmations that are so \n     important to the country, we are going to set aside the \n     cloture rule. It only takes 51 votes to do that.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I would submit that this Iranian treaty--I keep saying \nit because it is so critical to the world and to any chance at a \nsemblance of world peace--has to be stopped because it is enriching the \nlargest supporter of terrorism in the world.\n  The Iranian leaders have made clear to the Iranian people that they \nhave no intention of being bound by any agreement with President Obama, \nJohn Kerry, or the people here in the U.S. They are still going to do \nwhat they want to.\n\n  So all the Senate has to do is take a vote--51 votes; there are \nplenty of Republicans to do that--and they might just get some \nDemocrats that are too afraid to be seen as supportive of Iran and this \nnuclear deal that they may get some Democrat votes. Vote with 51 votes \nto set aside the cloture rule so you can bring treaty to the floor, \nhave a vote on confirmation--it won't get the two-thirds--and then you \nwould have all kinds of people that should have standing to go into \nFederal court and put a stop to the billions of dollars that this \nadministration is releasing illegally to Iran. That is, funding--this \nadministration says they know not what--it could be terrorism, they are \nnot sure. I would submit they would--Iran would be supporting \nterrorism.\n  But here are five things that the article pointed out that they \nwere--even a year ago--breaking the interim agreement: ``Trying to buy \nequipment for plutonium reactor at Arak, breaking commitment to suspend \nwork. The Obama administration actually complained about the purchases \nto the U.N. Security Council, even as it told the world that Iran had \n`lived up to its end of the bargain.' ''\n  They are ``feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into a plant where it had \nagreed to suspend nuclear enrichment. The Institute for Science and \nInternational Security noted that Iran had begun enrichment at the \nPilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz. It notified the Obama \nadministration, which complained to the Iranians, which then claimed to \nhave stop the enrichment activity.''\n  Three: ``Withholding camera footage of nuclear facilities, defying \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. A leading International Atomic \nEnergy Agency official recently said the agency was `not in a position \nto provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear \nmaterial and activities in Iran' . . . The interim deal was to provide \nsurveillance footage of Iranian nuclear facilities, but Iran has only \nprovided would what it wants to reveal.''\n  And that is consistent with what Steve King and I and a couple of \nother Members were told by the IAEA inspectors who were in charge of \ninspecting Iran, that they can only go by what they are given. They are \nnot given access to military facilities. They are not being given this \nfootage.\n  I am very proud to yield to my dear friend from Kentucky (Mr. \nMassie), a proud graduate of MIT on the floor.\n  Mr. MASSIE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding to me.\n  This is a very interesting topic that you are speaking on, and I have \nnever had the chance on the floor to explain my feelings on this vote \nnor the reason why I voted as I did on the Iran bill. So I appreciate \nthe opportunity to say a little bit about this.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the gentleman from Texas is \nbasically qualifying the Iran deal as a treaty, and I agree with that \nposition. In fact, I believe I was the only Congressman to vote \n``present'' on that bill. And the reason that I did vote ``present''--I \njust wanted a chance to clarify this--is that I felt that it was a \ntreaty.\n  I know a lot of us felt that way and we had different ways of dealing \nwith that vote, but I voted ``present'' to indicate it was a treaty and \nthat it really shouldn't have even been here in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  According to the Constitution, only the Senate shall agree to the \ntreaties, and not the House. We shouldn't really have a say in that. So \nI just wanted the opportunity, and I appreciate the gentleman from \nTexas giving me this opportunity, to explain the reason that I voted \n``present.'' I think it was only the second time since I have been in \nCongress, and it was for a constitutional reason. I felt strongly that \nwas a treaty.\n  I thank the gentleman from Texas for this opportunity.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. If the gentleman would hang on for a moment, I voted for \nthe bill, but I did not feel like it adequately dealt with the issue \nthat my friend from Kentucky raised, but I completely respect that \nposition.\n  Since the gentleman from Kentucky and I have had a lot of discussions \nabout Iran and the Iranian treaty and his feelings, I have always felt \nthat his vote, ``present,'' made eminent sense, was consistent with our \nposition.\n  Really, the vote on what we took didn't really matter so much as the \npoint that the gentleman has just made. This is a treaty. The Senate \nneeds to vote on it. Our vote, though nice, was not particularly \nrelevant to the fact that it is a treaty.\n  I would like to ask, if the gentleman would yield for a question, \nbecause I saw that there was a handsome young man in a blue shirt that \ncame in with him, and wondered if he might identify who has accompanied \nhim onto the floor.\n  Mr. MASSIE. As the gentleman from Texas knows, we are allowed to \nbring younger constituents and visitors, and we have a visitor from \nKentucky; that is true. His name is Joe.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I thought perhaps he might be from Kentucky.\n  Mr. MASSIE. His name is Joe.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. That is wonderful. He looks quite comfortable here on \nthe floor, looks like he would be a good fit some day.\n  I thank my friend for making that point.\n  The vote that we took last year pointed out that the Iranians had not \ncomplied; the administration had not complied, as I recall, with the \nrequirements to provide proper information.\n  But the gentleman from Kentucky is exactly right. The real issue was \na vote in the Senate on it being a treaty. The Senate has not yet voted \non the Iranian treaty as a treaty, and if they would do that, when it \ndidn't get the two-thirds votes, then we could stop the outrage of \nsending billions of dollars to a country that has a massive amount of \nAmerican, precious American blood on its hands because of the way in \nwhich they have funded terrorism.\n  They were the largest provider of IEDs when Americans were fighting \nfor Muslim freedom in Iraq, and yet Iran continued to build and furnish \nIEDs. It needs to be dealt with. People are suffering in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned Egypt, and what a great day for world \nhistory when a third of the population rose up, 30 million people that \nhad never risen up in the history of the world, in peaceful \ndemonstration, despite the Muslim Brotherhood's violence to try to make \nit appear otherwise. They had never risen up like those people did in \nEgypt. They are to be commended.\n  I would humbly submit that if this administration would help Egypt \nand be the friend to Egypt that it is being in helping Iran and \nproviding money to Iran, then the world would be a far better place \nthan it is with all the help that this administration is providing to \nIran.\n  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the ultimate result of \nthe Clinton, Wendy Sherman deal with North Korea, in which, in essence, \nthe Clinton administration says: Hey, we will give you nuclear--we will \nlet you have nuclear power. We will give you what you need to have if \nyou will just sign and say you won't ever use it to develop nukes.\n  And then, big shocker for some in the Democratic administration--it \nwasn't\n\n[[Page H1919]]\n\nto most of us that were watching from afar in different places in the \nUnited States--North Korea lied. They did use what we provided to \ncreate nuclear weapons, and now the world is a much less safe place.\n  So I have no doubt that someday, maybe, some Iranian will kill me; \nbut somebody will be here on the floor, if the Capitol still exists, \nand will point out that this deal that Obama and Kerry and Wendy \nSherman did with Iran, in allowing them to move forward with nuclear \nactivity, providing them with $100 billion or so to start off, hundreds \nof billions in the future, that they ended up lying when they said they \nagreed, initially, to the agreement--even though they have said \npublicly: We are not going to abide by it--that they ended up using \nresults from the Obama administration's treaty to develop nuclear \nweapons, and that, just like the Clinton-Albright-Sherman deal with \nNorth Korea, the Obama-Kerry-Sherman deal with Iran has resulted in \nIran having nukes sooner than they would have otherwise, despite the \npromises previously by the Obama administration to prevent Iran from \nhaving nukes. Actually, they helped them get the nukes.\n\n\n                North Carolina's Passage of House Bill 2\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I want to turn to one other subject that has been very \ncontroversial--North Carolina has gotten a bad rap--and this article \nfrom ABC News, ``North Carolina's Controversial `Anti-LGBT' Bill \nExplained.''\n  The article says: ``Several civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocates \nare organizing a rally tonight in Raleigh''--this is from March 24 of \nthis year--``North Carolina, to protest the State's controversial \npassage of its House Bill 2, which critics have called `the most anti-\nLGBT bill in the country.' ''\n  The article says: ``Here's everything you need to know about the \nbill, also known as The Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, \nwhich was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory on Wednesday.\n  ``What does it do?\n  ``House Bill 2 declares that State law overrides all local ordinances \nconcerning wages, employment, and public accommodations.''\n  ``Thus, the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own \nrules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual \norientation and gender identity. Though North Carolina does have a \nstatewide nondiscrimination law, it does not include specific \nprotections for LGBTQ people.''\n  We keep adding letters, you know. We kept adding letters until we got \nto LGBT, and now we have added Q.\n  ``The law also directs all public schools, government agencies, and \npublic college campuses to require that multiple-occupancy bathrooms \nand changing facilities, such as locker rooms, be designated for use \nonly by people based on their `biological sex' stated on their birth \ncertificate. Transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing \nfacilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get \nthe biological sex on their birth certificate changed.''\n  ``Under the law, public institutions can still offer single-occupancy \nfacilities.''\n  And nobody has a problem with that. If you have got a single bathroom \nfacility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom, that \nis fine. It can be for whoever needs to use it.\n  But they are saying, as has been consistent with the history of the \nworld for most of the world's existence, that if you, according to \ndocumentation, are a female, you use the female restroom when it is for \nmultiple people's use at the same time; and if, by documentation, you \nare a male, you use the male facilities.\n  It has really been shocking to see how many people, including singers \nand entertainers and different groups--I understand Target now wants to \nmake sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please.\n  But it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we \nhave to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there. \nIf a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom, according to the big \npopular movement now, for heaven's sake, let's let the man go in the \nlittle girls bathroom.\n  North Carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the \nworld since the world began. If you are going to have a multiple-use \nrestroom, normally, you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom, \na male go to a male multiuse restroom.\n  This article goes on. It says: ``Republican lawmakers, who make up \nthe majority of North Carolina's General Assembly, publicly unveiled \nthe language of the bill Wednesday morning.''\n  It goes on and talks about its passage: ``In less than 12 hours''--I \nam talking about after its passage--``the bill was approved by the \nhouse and senate''--or after it was brought forward, the bill was \npassed, signed by the Governor.\n\n       Lawmakers in the House voted 83-25 to pass the bill. The \n     Senate approved the bill, 32-0 after Democrats, who make up \n     the minority, walked out of the Chamber in protest.\n\n  Obviously, they want men to go to little girls restrooms, too.\n  ``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was \nnecessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' \naction by Charlotte.''\n  ``Critics of Charlotte's ordinance said it could have allowed men who \nmay be sexual offenders to enter a woman's restroom or locker room by \nclaiming a transgender identity.''\n  Well, critics of the Charlotte ordinance is what the article says, \nbut actually, that is not just a claim; that is a fact.\n  Under what North Carolina was objecting to, if someone who is a \nsexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little \ngirls restroom where he has no business, people like the entertainer \nthat doesn't want to go to North Carolina, they are saying, by golly, \nyou have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom.\n  What has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part \nof this country?\n  I mean, there was a very intelligent man on Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, \nwho actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show: So they \npassed this law. They don't want men going into the women's restroom, \nbasically, was the crux of it, or boys going in where little girls go. \nHe asked the question, actually: Who are they trying to protect?\n  I couldn't believe that we have come to the point where an \nintelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question. Whether \nyou agree or disagree with what North Carolina did, whom they were \ntrying to protect, it is almost rhetorical. Clearly, whether you agree \nor disagree, they were trying to protect the little girls.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  It is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question: Gee, \nwhom are they trying to protect by saying men can't go into girls' \nrestrooms? Incredible. The outrage aimed at North Carolina has just \nbeen incredible.\n  I see an article today by Ryan Lovelace from the Washington Examiner: \nTrump slams North Carolina bathroom law, says state should ``leave it \nthe way it is.''\n  The way, apparently, Charlotte was going to have it was that men \ncould go in little girls' restrooms. Of course, sexual predators who \nare male, all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get \nto go in the little girls' restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them \na sexual predator.\n  Whom are they trying to protect in North Carolina? They are trying to \nprotect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves. They count on \nadults to keep them from harm. It is incredible that people are \noutraged at North Carolina.\n  Anyone who has children who are female, do you really want men to \nsay: I am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going \nto the bathroom, where you can't go because you are not transgender? \nYou are the girl's father.\n  This article says ``What Do Proponents of the Bill Argue?'' It says: \n``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was \nnecessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' \naction by Charlotte.''\n  ``John Rustin, president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council, \ntestified before the Senate, saying that the Charlotte ordinance `means \nmen could enter women restrooms and locker rooms--placing the privacy, \nsafety, and\n\n[[Page H1920]]\n\ndignity of women and the elderly at great risk.' ''\n  Parenthetically, I noticed an article in recent days, last week, that \nindicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender \nrestrooms has had a problem--and it has come up a couple of times--\nwhere men would come in where women were showering, go into the \nrestroom and use their cell phone, hold it up over the stall so they \ncan film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some \nprivacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom.\n  What is wrong with saying: Do you know what? When it comes to going \nto the restroom, females will go to female, males will go to male, and, \nlook, if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to \nuse or families to use to change diapers or whatever, those are really \nhandy? Those are very helpful. My wife and I have used them ourselves \nraising girls. It is a handy thing to have.\n  But why condemn North Carolina when they are just trying to protect \nthe privacy of girls? It has already been shown that, if you give guys \na chance to say: I am transgender, and I can get to go in and film a \ngirl in a shower, there will be people that do that.\n  Why not let the transgender LGBTQRST--whatever the initials are--let \nthem have their activities where they don't impose upon the privacy of \nsomeone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from \nthe opposite sex being there with them?\n  Governor McCrory wrote this statement: ``The basic expectation of \nprivacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, \nfor each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by \nthe mayor and city council of Charlotte . . . As a result, I have \nsigned legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach \nof basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect April 1.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that I understand Target may now be changing \ntheir restrooms. I will have to double-check because, if they are going \nto be having women come to men's restrooms, I won't be going to Target \nto shop unless and until that changes.\n  Usually, Target is great. They have the restroom right there where \nyou go in the door to the store, normally. You don't have to go clear \nto the back of the store. It is a handy thing.\n  If you have to go shopping, it is handy, but not anymore. Anybody \nthat wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex \nmay need to shop elsewhere. We will have to look at what they have \nactually done.\n  Anyway, this article seems to make the point that it is not such a \ncrazy thing that North Carolina has done, and that is why for 99.999 \npercent of human history, since civilization exists since we got past \nthe caveman era, when there have been public restrooms, you recognize \nthere is a difference between males and females.\n  Some day it will be written in the ``Rise and Fall of the United \nStates'' that the greatest, freest, and most powerful country in the \nhistory of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the \npinnacle of its greatness and success--and this will be one of the \nsymptoms that was written about--that they thought they were so much \nsmarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a \ndifference was recognized between men and women for purposes of \nfacilities. It is a sad day for the country.\n  Now, I see this article from yesterday that Curt Schilling, an ESPN \nanalyst, was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media \npost. Here is what Schilling said:\n\n       The post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and women's \n     clothing with parts of the T-shirt cut out to expose his \n     chest. It says, ``Let him into the restroom with your \n     daughter or else you are a narrow-minded, judgmental, \n     unloving racist bigot who needs to die.''\n\n  Apparently, this kind of thing offends ESPN. Although at one time \ntheir job was covering sports, now their job is being social managers, \napparently, in making sure that, if men want to go to little girls' \nrestrooms, then we let the men go to little girls' restrooms.\n  This article from yesterday talking about Target stores says: \n``Target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender \nwith which they identify.''\n  How about that. Et tu, Target?\n  So here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name \nof political correctness rules the day, common sense is no longer \ncommon, and to the point that the current leader in the Republican \ncampaign for President even says that North Carolina should not have \ntaken action that, in essence, says men--which would include sexual \npredators--should not be allowed to go in women's restrooms. He wanted \nit left like it was.\n  So if Charlotte wants to say that, if you are a man and you are a \nsexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the \nrestroom where little girls are, go ahead.\n  That is the position of the leading Republican candidate? I don't \nknow. Hopefully, that will be another one of the positions he will \nchange.\n  But, in the meantime, we need to get common sense back in charge in \nAmerica while we are still the great country we have been.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse).
