Mr. Speaker, Chip Anderson has been an integral part of \nKenilworth Scouting--more specifically, Troop 13--for the last 8 years. \nHe has provided outstanding leadership and support to the young men of \nKenilworth, Illinois, as first the troop quartermaster, and then as the \ntroop Scoutmaster. He is moving to Atlanta with his family for career \nreasons and resigning his active leadership position with Troop 13, but \nwill always remain a vital part of Troop 13 and its legacy.\n  During his tenure, the troop has been very active with weekly \nmeetings, community service projects, and monthly camping and overnight \ntrips, including the annual Boundary Waters High Adventure for the \nrising seventh-grade boys.\n  Advancement is one, but not the only, measure of success, and during \nhis tenure Troop 13 has had 45 young men attain the rank of Eagle, \nScouting's highest rank. Chip has directly supported each of these \nyoung men, as well as all the young men in the troop. Most have called \nhim a mentor and friend in the notes they have written to express their \nthanks.\n  We are thankful for his outstanding contribution, and as a community \nwe feel very fortunate to have had his leadership and dedication to the \nScouting program and to the development of young men in the village.\n  It is an honor to recognize Chip today. It as an honor to call him my \nfriend.\n\n[[Page H3218]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3218-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              LONG-TERM HIGHWAY TRUST FUND REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a long-term \nreauthorization of the highway trust fund.\n  Just this week, Mayor Dumas from Attleboro, Massachusetts, came to \nWashington to tell me how another stopgap bill would negatively impact \nprojects in his city.\n  The bridges in my home State are some of the oldest in our country. \nOf the over 5,000 bridges in our Commonwealth, more than half are \nconsidered deficient.\n  Every single day, cars, trucks, and schoolbuses cross our \nstructurally compromised bridges nearly 10 million times. Those numbers \nunderscore the urgency for our government to provide the critical, \nlong-term investments in infrastructure that our constituents demand \nand deserve.\n  Each time we approve a short-term patch of the highway trust fund, we \nare continuing the uncertainty and doubt that prevents States and \nmunicipalities from moving forward on projects that not only create \njobs but keep all of us safe.\n  Our refusal to even consider a lasting transportation plan is \nhindering our ability to maintain the infrastructure we already have, \nwhen we should be instead focused on new projects that increase our \nmodern economy in communities across our country.\n  It is time to fix this problem. It is time to invest in our country. \nIt is time to pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3218-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TEACHER APPRECIATION MONTH\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Ms. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, recently, South Carolina \nGovernor Nikki Haley designated May as Teacher Appreciation Month.\n  As the husband of a retired teacher, I know firsthand the time, \nresources, support, and guidance our dedicated educators give to their \nstudents. While I regularly take the opportunity to visit schools and \nhonor educators throughout the year, I am grateful for the opportunity \nto give special recognition and thanks to our hard-working educators \nthis month.\n  I would especially like to honor my constituent, Daniel Oddo, from \nDreher High School, who was a finalist for the South Carolina Teacher \nof the Year. Staff member Drew Kennedy is a Dreher graduate.\n  I am grateful for the Palmetto State Teachers Association, led by \nexecutive director Kathy Maness, for their tireless work on behalf of \nteachers across the State. The success of our teachers is amplified by \nthe leadership of State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, who \nis dedicated to recruiting and retaining quality teachers in the \nPalmetto State.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3218-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FUNDING TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of long-term \ninvestments in our Nation's critical transportation infrastructure.\n  Across this Nation, our roads and bridges are crumbling, and \ncommunities are in need of updated transit systems. Investments in \ncritical infrastructure are necessary to ensure our roads, bridges, and \ntransit systems are in good working condition and updated with the \nnewest technologies to ensure our safety. Jobs hang in the balance. The \nsafety of our constituents hang in the balance.\n  In North Carolina alone, there are more than 5,000 bridges in need of \nrepair. More than 700 of those are in my district. We must make sure \nthat critical road and infrastructure projects are not put on hold and \nthat jobs are not placed in jeopardy.\n  My colleagues, I urge you to make the smart decision for our Nation \nand support a long-term solution to funding our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3218-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORT PASSAGE OF FY16 NDAA\n\n  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my \nfellow Republicans and other Members to support the fiscal year 2016 \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  My colleagues and I on the Armed Services Committee came together in \na bipartisan fashion to pass this legislation out of committee with a \nvote of 60-2. That seems pretty bipartisan to me. And it should be. Our \nNation's security should not be a partisan issue.\n  The committee had a goal of implementing some lasting reforms to \nensure that our military is better prepared for the challenges that we \nface.\n  Part of facing these challenges is ensuring that our military has the \nvery best training and weapons systems for the fight. This legislation \nrecognizes that need by preserving the A-10, which is the best close \nair support aircraft, and flown out of Moody Air Force Base.\n  This bill also invests in the future replacement of the JSTARS, an \nimportant ISR platform that flies out of Robins Air Force Base.\n  It is as honor to serve as a voice for Robins and Moody in Congress, \nand I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation for our Nation's \nwarfighters who bravely serve so that we may remain the land of the \nfree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3218-5", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FUTURE FARMERS, AMERICA'S FUTURE\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker: ``Learning to do, doing to learn, earning \nto live, living to serve.'' Those 12 short words comprise the motto of \nthe Future Farmers of America Organization, founded in 1928 by 33 \nstudents from 18 different States who came together with a shared \nmission to develop as the future farmers of this country.\n  Agriculture is the cornerstone of our economy, supporting more than \n23 million jobs in our country. But it is also an industry that \nrequires more than just skills and knowledge that might be learned in \nthe classroom, skills that are necessary to feed our country and to \nconnect with the changing marketplace and consumers.\n  FAA has succeeded in fulfilling this gap by expanding not only \nagricultural education in our schools but also in teaching students to \nbe confident participants and leaders, to be honest and fair, and to \nshow respect for others and our land's resources. These lifelong skills \nare vital not just for farmers but in all aspects of agriculture, \nwhether it is marketing, management, research, communications, or \nengineering.\n  I rise today to recognize this organization and the millions of \nFuture Farmers of America, both current and past, and express my \ngratitude for your dedication, leadership, and commitment to \nstrengthening our towns.\n  It is that spirit and love for this country that truly represents the \nheart of rural America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3218-6", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3218-H3219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IRAN REVIEW ACT\n\n  (Mr. STUTZMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Ms. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise with concern over the President's \nongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, and I rise in support of the \nlegislation that the House passed yesterday, the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no guarantee that any final \nagreement negotiated by Secretary Kerry and President Obama will be a \ngood deal. There is no guarantee this agreement will be good for the \nsecurity of the United States, good for the stability of the Middle \nEast, and good for the security of our close ally, Israel.\n  By passing H.R. 1191, we are empowering Congress to review the final \nagreement and block any bad deal negotiated by the President.\n  Mr. Speaker, June 30, the deadline for the negotiations, is nearing \nquickly. When, and if, the President is able\n\n[[Page H3219]]\n\nto arrive at a deal, I encourage my colleagues to take a strong, \nthorough look at all of the details.

Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nLarsen) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 17 total amendments. \nNine of them have been offered by Republicans, eight of them have been \noffered by Democrats. They cover a variety of very important topics for \nour national security, including cooperation with India, evacuation of \nU.S. persons from Yemen, the impact of U.S. troop levels on NATO, and \nviolence in Mexico.\n  I believe these are important subjects and important additions to our \nbill. I hope Members will support this en bloc package. And I hope that \nall Members who make these contributions will support the final version \nso that their contribution has a chance to become law.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. I thank the chairman for the efforts put forth by \nhimself and the committee on necessary legislation that, indeed, should \npass.\n  Mr. Chairman, America has given 14 years, nearly $1 trillion, and \nthousands of lives to help build a stable Afghanistan. While most of \nour troops have come home, Congress has still obligated billions of \ndollars to be spent on reconstruction efforts.\n  As we transfer oversight authority to Afghan officials, the Special \nInspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has identified serious \ndeficiencies in our ability to ensure the proper use of these American \ntaxpayer dollars, as the Afghan Ministries currently lack the capacity \nto effectively manage and account for U.S.-funded assistance.\n  My amendment would require SIGAR to certify it has sufficient access \nto Afghan accounts to guarantee effective audits. We must ensure that \nevery dollar is spent effectively. I appreciate that this amendment has \nbeen added en bloc, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation \nand this amendment.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would ask Members to support this en bloc package, \nand I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan) for \ncomments on en bloc No. 6.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, as Mr. Walberg just \npointed out, we have spent literally trillions of dollars in the Middle \nEast in what many would describe as wars of choice and nation building.\n  I want to applaud the committee for this underlying legislation to \nensure some accountability of how that money goes. All too often, the \nmoneys have made a mockery of our good intentions and ended up in the \nwrong hands and, in many cases, used against us.\n  The underlying legislation requires the Defense Department now to \nrequire them to give us a list of who money has been given to in Syria \nand Iraq to fight ISIL, and my legislation says that, when they find \nevidence that those funds have been misused by any one of those \nparties, they can no longer be recipients of our funding and our \nintentions in this regard.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment and the bloc as \nwell.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to my \ncolleague from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want the \nchairman to know that I support the amendment en bloc, and I support \nthe bill as well.\n  Mr. Chair, the number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq \nto join ISIS is increasing at an alarming, dramatic rate. The Director \nof the National Counterterrorism Center said that more foreign fighters \nhave joined ISIS in the last 2 years than those who went to Afghanistan \nor Iraq in the last 20 years. More than 180 of these fighters are from \nthe United States.\n  These killers are not just going to fight and die on the battlefields \nof Iraq and Syria. Many return home to their home countries as trained, \nbattle-hardened Islamic radicals.\n  Before Moner Mohammad Abusalha became the first American to carry out \na suicide bomb in Syria, he had already been to Syria and back to the \nUnited States as a trained suicide killer. The United States Government \ndidn't even know this.\n  We need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the flow of foreign \nfighters from ISIS to the United States and foreign fighters going to \ntrain with ISIS. This amendment requires such a strategy.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  Mrs. DINGELL. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen).\n  Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, I rise in support of my \namendment, No. 103, contained in this bloc, which expresses the sense \nof Congress that the President should exercise all available authority \nto evacuate U.S. citizens from Yemen as soon as possible.\n  My district is home to the highest concentration of Yemeni Americans \nin the United States. Since hostilities began in Yemen, my office hears \ndaily from Yemeni Americans who are terrified, frustrated, desperate, \nand have no idea how to exit the country. These are United States \ncitizens in Yemen, with nowhere to turn.\n  This week, NPR told the story of Rhonia Aladashi, a 16-year-old girl \nfrom my hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. She had traveled to Yemen to \nvisit her father when the hostilities began, and she tried multiple \noptions to escape.\n  She tried to cross the border at Saudi Arabia and got turned back \ninto hostile areas because she did not have a man traveling with her. \nUltimately, she ended up on a private fishing boat, going with no food \nor water on board.\n  My constituents and their families stuck in Yemen need hope, and they \nneed to know that American citizens are not being forgotten. We do not \nin any way want to put American military in danger, but we need to tell \nAmericans there is hope.\n\n[[Page H3222]]\n\n  I thank Mr. Larsen and Chairman Thornberry.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).\n  Mr. WALKER. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my gratitude for the hard work \nand dedication put forth by Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, \nand their colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in drafting the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 2016.\n  I would like to thank the Rules Committee, Chairman Sessions, and \nRanking Member Slaughter for their efforts in ensuring Members on both \nsides of the aisle had an avenue to voice their opinion.\n  We recently finished 10 townhalls in 10 counties, and the number one \nthing from our constituents is making sure that Washington is held \naccountable. These efforts help restore our constituents' faith in this \nbody and the process of lawmaking.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).\n  Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman from Washington, my good friend \nMr. Larsen, for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Chairman, the effort to expand U.S.-India relations has always \nbeen and continues to be a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank both \nsides of the aisle in acceptance of the amendment that I put forward.\n  Over the past two decades, we have seen the relationship between the \nUnited States and India flourish and blossom under both--I should say \nstarting with President Clinton's Presidency, followed by President \nGeorge Bush's Presidency, and we have seen how advanced it has become \nunder the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n  I had the opportunity to travel with the President earlier this year \nto India, and the incredible reception that the President and the \ndelegation received was like no other experience I have ever had in \nIndia, and this relationship continues to grow.\n  This is the first time we have had an opportunity to express the \nsupport of the House and of the Congress of this burgeoning \nrelationship, especially as it pertains to mil-to-mil cooperation, and \nI believe that this is the most critical relationship that we will have \nthis decade in the world.\n\n  India and the United States, we have shared values of civilian \ncontrol of the military. It is a very important aspect when you \nconsider the part of the world we are talking about. We share that same \nvalue with India.\n  India's quest for securing peace not only within her region, but \naround the world as well, is something that we share with her. India's \ncommitment to democracy and rule of law is something we also share with \nIndia and, overall, using democracy and the quest for peace, trying to \nbring stability throughout the world.\n  I also want to thank the Indian diaspora in helping with this effort. \nThis is truly, as I said earlier, I believe, the most important \nalliance the United States will have this century.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman.\n  I rise in strong support of my amendment to renew a 1-year ban on the \nObama administration from using any Department of Defense funds to \nimplement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. This amendment updates \nand strengthens the language of my amendments that were entered into \nlaw in previous NDAAs.\n  Why? Because this amendment--we must always uphold our fundamental \nindividual right to keep and to bear arms, which is enshrined in our \nConstitution. We also must uphold the sovereignty of the United States \nover our arms export control system, which is the gold standard of the \nworld.\n  Now, how do we do this?\n  First, the amendment explicitly forbids the use of DOD funds to \nfacilitate domestic prosecutions of individual Americans. This is a \nreal danger because the Obama administration has already engaged in \ndomestic prosecutions of individuals using treaties. This is totally \nunacceptable.\n  Second, my amendment specifically bans the use of DOD funds for an \nATT secretariat, created for ``effectively implementing'' the ATT, \naccording to the treaty's supporters.\n  Appallingly and equally unacceptable, ATT backers seek to put the \nU.S. on the hook to fund the activities of a treaty to which it is not \na party.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this \namendment in the en bloc amendments. I urge my colleagues to stand with \nme in support of the Second Amendment, our Nation's sovereignty, and \nvote in support of this amendment to renew the annual ban on the \nfunding of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I \nhave left?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Castor amendment, which is \nan amendment in support of military families across the country. It \nexpresses the sense of Congress that, when it comes to housing military \nmembers, the Pentagon should factor in the commuting times for base \npersonnel and the land available for on-base housing.\n  On-base housing is a critical readiness issue. Having our \nservicemembers as close to their assignments as possible is vital. DOD \nmust ensure that the decisions relating to base housing take into \naccount relevant factors, and each base is different.\n  For example, at MacDill Air Force Base in my hometown in Tampa, \nFlorida, it is home to the 6th Air Mobility Wing, United States Special \nOperations Command, and United States Central Command.\n  The recent expansion of on-base housing for military families has \nbeen a great success. Pursuant to a public-private partnership that was \nauthorized in 2007, 572 homes have been constructed on the base. This \nhas been a godsend for the families at MacDill, and here is why: the \nneighborhoods closest to the base are expensive and out of reach for \nmany military families, so servicemembers oftentimes buy homes about 30 \nmiles away and then commute to the base.\n  This recent public-private partnership at MacDill has been a win-win \nfor the military and the families who serve. In fact, one top Pentagon \nofficial who oversees installations noted that the MacDill Air Force \nBase housing initiative was one of her favorites, forcewide, and was \nexceptional.\n  Think about the difference it makes to that military family when they \ncan live close to where they work and where their children attend \nschool.\n  Now, until recently, the Air Force and the housing contractor were \ndiscussing the next phase of on-base housing. MacDill has over 330 \nfamilies on a waiting list. Unfortunately, despite the long waiting \nlist, the obvious demand, the Air Force has inexplicably terminated \ndiscussions.\n  If this is happening in my community, it could be happening in yours, \nand with scarce Federal dollars, we must continue to encourage fruitful \npublic-private partnerships and the best interests of our brave men and \nwomen in the service.\n  I thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and Mr. Larsen for \ntheir support of the amendment, and I urge adoption.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I support the en bloc. I hope all \nMembers will, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the Crowley-Engel-\nHolding-Bera-Royce amendment to the 2016 NDAA.\n  As Co-Chair of the House India Caucus, I am privileged to spend time \nhighlighting the robust and growing relationship between the United \nStates and India to my colleagues and to my constituents.\n  With the emerging challenges our two nations face in the Indo-Pacific \nregion, we must place an emphasis on increasing the collaboration \nbetween our two defense departments and defense industries.\n  In January to move this collaboration forward, the United States and \nIndia signed the\n\n[[Page H3223]]\n\n``Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean Region'' \nlaying out our shared principles and views for security in the region.\n  Our two nations also agreed to renew--and upgrade--our ten year \ndefense framework well before its expiration date which truly shows our \ncommitment to working together.\n  The United States and India are on the same page and through the \ndiligent work of the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative along with \nthe Department of Defense's India Rapid Reaction Cell, defense \ncooperation between our two nations is on the right trajectory.\n  But more can, should, and will be done to bring us closer together on \ndefense.\n  Mr. Chair, India has a vital role to play in the Indo-Pacific by \nbecoming a regional security provider and the United States should \ncontinue to work lockstep with our counterparts in New Delhi to achieve \nthis.\n  And Mr. Chair, that is precisely what our amendment supports.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 7 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

The release of \n     such terms and conditions and retained interests with respect \n     to any portion of that parcel shall not be construed to alter \n     the rights or interests retained by the United States with \n     respect to the remainder of the real property conveyed to the \n     State under such section.\n       (b) Condition of Release.--The release authorized by \n     subsection (a) of terms and conditions and retained interests \n     shall be subject to the condition that the State of \n     Louisiana--\n       (1) transfer the parcel of real property described in such \n     subsection from the Louisiana Military Department to the \n     Louisiana Agricultural Finance Authority for the purpose of \n     permitting the Louisiana Agricultural Finance Authority to \n     use the parcel for any purposes allowed by State law; and\n       (2) make available to the Louisiana Military Department \n     real property to replace the transferred parcel that is \n     suitable for use for National Guard training and operational \n     support for emergency management and homeland defense \n     activities.\n       (c) Instrument of Release and Description of Property.--The \n     Secretary of the Army may execute and file in the appropriate \n     office a deed of release, amended deed, or other appropriate \n     instrument reflecting the release of terms and conditions and \n     retained interests under subsection (a). The exact acreage \n     and legal description of the property described in such \n     subsection shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to \n     the Secretary of the Army.\n       (d) Payment of Administrative Costs.--\n       (1) Payment required.--The Secretary of the Army may \n     require the State of Louisiana to cover costs to be incurred \n     by the Secretary, or to reimburse the Secretary for costs \n     incurred by the Secretary, to carry out the release of \n     retained interests under subsection (a), including survey \n     costs, costs related to environmental documentation, and\n\n[[Page H3225]]\n\n     other administrative costs related to the conveyance.

Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nLarsen) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Chairman this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. They \ntouch such important subjects as the nuclear enterprise review, the \nlong-range standoff weapon, military manufacturing arsenals, and a \nvariety of other very important topics.\n  They are sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats. Four of these \namendments are sponsored by Democrats. I believe they deserve the \nsupport of the whole House, but I also believe the full bill deserves \nthe support of the whole House so that these important amendments have \na chance to become law.\n  I hope all Members will support not only the package, but final \npassage.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nLamborn), the distinguished vice chair of the Subcommittee on Strategic \nForces.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, No. \n108, which is included in this en bloc package. My amendment adds a \nsense of Congress provision regarding our support for the Hashemite \nKingdom of Jordan. Jordan is one of our most important allies in the \nregion, and I believe that the United States should support Jordan's \nmilitary efforts to the greatest extent possible.\n  The Jordanians are on the front lines in the fight against ISIS and \nhave suffered the consequences of the President's policy failures \nregarding Syria. Jordan is under fire from those who wish to do it \nharm, and we must stand by a country that has been a force for good in \nthe region.\n  In Colorado, we have a unique interest in this relationship, as the \nColorado National Guard is partnered with the Jordanian military \nthrough the State Partnership Program. Colorado guardsmen are helping \ntrain Jordanian servicemembers. This is just one of the ways that we \ncan help stand with our friends in Jordan.\n  I thank the chairman for including this amendment in the en bloc \npackage, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to echo the comments of the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Thornberry) about en bloc No. 7 and its bipartisan nature. I would \nencourage Members to support it.\n  With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nFoster).\n  Mr. FOSTER. I would like to thank the ranking member for yielding and \nthe chairman and his staff for working with me on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, the National Defense Authorization Act tasks the \nMissile Defense Agency with developing a concept for a space-based \nmissile defense system. There is no doubt that missile defense--if \ntechnologically feasible, militarily robust, and economically \njustifiable--would be an important priority for our national security. \nBut as a scientist, I think that we need to do our homework before we \nbegin investing hundreds of billions of dollars into developing this \nsystem, and that is why I am introducing this amendment to require a \npreliminary cost estimate for this project.\n  A 2012 report by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that even \nto provide limited coverage, hundreds of interceptors would be required \nto stop an incoming ballistic missile. Because of the cost to launch, \nmaintain, operate, and replenish the interceptors, even a limited \nsystem would cost a minimum of $200 billion.\n  We must do our due diligence before investing billions of taxpayer \ndollars into any project. So I urge my colleagues to join me and vote \n``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, at this point, I am pleased to yield 1 \nminute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate Chairman Thornberry \nand the Armed Services Committee for working collaboratively on this \nimportant amendment.\n  In speaking on behalf of this Royce-Maloney amendment, I want to \nrecognize the leadership of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New \nYork, who has been dedicated in the fight against Boko Haram and \ndedicated in terms of trying to raise awareness on this.\n  Many have seen on television the continued kidnappings of Boko Haram, \nthe pillaging of villages, the taking of women and children as \ncaptives. I just want to tell you the story that we heard last year in \nour committee from one young girl, a survivor from Chibok, that touched \nthe hearts of, I think, many people there that day.\n  She gave this brave narration of what happened when Boko Haram broke \nin and, before her very eyes, killed her father and killed her 14-year-\nold brother. She is one of the few from her village who survived.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  So I just want to say this: Nigeria and its neighbors--Chad, Niger, \nCameroon--have been making headway in the fight against Boko Haram. \nThey have cleared a number of northern Nigerian towns. Now we have an \nopportunity with the African Union force--but it lacks equipment; it \nlacks capacity--for a protracted fight there.\n  This amendment expresses support for robust security assistance, \ntraining, equipment, the capacity building they need so that the \nAfrican troops that are fighting against Boko Haram can continue to \nadvance on the field.\n  The amendment also requires the Department of Defense and the State \nDepartment to produce a report to make sure the Congress is fully aware \nof the nature of the assistance being provided.\n  We need to support Nigeria and the African Union authorized force \nwith all appropriate means. It is the best chance we have to eliminate \nBoko Haram, to eliminate this terror so that other young girls are not \nsnatched and their lives destroyed. The region's stability, by the way, \ndepends upon it.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the ranking member for \nyielding and for his strong leadership.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment I have \ncosponsored with the gentleman from California, Representative Royce, \nand I thank him for his outstanding leadership not only on this issue, \nbut on so many of them.\n  This particular amendment expresses U.S. support for the defeat of \nthe terrorist organization Boko Haram. Combating Boko Haram is in our \nnational interest and is certainly in the interest of security in the \nregion, and the United States should support the regional allies in \ntheir operations against Boko Haram, which are making significant \nprogress in combating them.\n  We just marked the 1-year anniversary of the kidnapping of 270 young \nschoolgirls from Nigeria. This horror raised the awareness of the world \nto the terror of Boko Haram and what it has unleashed on Nigerians for \nyears.\n  The amendment clearly affirms that Boko Haram represents a threat not \njust to our Nation, but to the world, and certainly to stability in the \nregion.\n\n[[Page H3226]]\n\nThe amendment calls for United States support--which may be in the form \nof equipment, training, technical support--for a coordinated military \nresponse in Africa to combat Boko Haram.\n  Since its formation, the coalition has made significant gains against \nthis terrorist threat and has started to improve stability in the \nregion. Many of the young girls have escaped and have come here to \nspeak to us in Congress.\n  The amendment also calls for reports to Congress on the progress of \nthe mission and an accounting of U.S. support.\n  Combating Boko Haram is and should remain a national security \ninterest, and we must remain vigilant in fighting this enemy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n  Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his attention, strong leadership, \nand for really saving lives in this region. He is securing stability in \nthe region and for America, too.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Chairman, I just want to show my appreciation for the work of \nChairman Royce and Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York on this issue \nwith Boko Haram.\n  I noticed in the headlines of this morning's paper, Boko Haram has a \nnew offensive against a military base in Nigeria.\n  The contribution they have made with this amendment to the bill is \nvery important so that the Nigerians and others in the region are \nbetter able to fight these terrorists. And there is no other word for \nthem.\n  There are also provisions in this bill to help the Ukrainians fight \nthe aggression that they are undergoing, there are provisions in this \nbill to help fight ISIS, which is all part of the reason I believe this \nbill deserves the support of all Members.\n  I appreciate the contributions of both Members on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, in the legislation today, there is a clause that would \ncause us to think about what to do in the High Arctic. The Arctic Ocean \nis melting. There will be a Northwest Passage. We are going to need a \nnew heavy icebreaker to provide the support for the Navy as well as for \ncommercial.\n  Yesterday during a hearing, we hit upon the notion of creating a \nspecial fund similar to what exists for the strategic missile \nsubmarines. We would like, therefore, to begin the discussion of a \nnational strategic high-latitude icebreaking fund. That discussion \ncould then merge into a way of funding about $1 billion for a new \nicebreaker, absolutely essential for the U.S. Navy, absolutely \nessential for the commerce in the Arctic Ocean as well as for providing \nus with the ability to compete with Russia. I would like to propose \nthat that be discussed and part of the process as we move the NDAA \nthrough the committees and the two Houses.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage folks to \nvote for en bloc 7, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to do the same \nthing, as well as on final passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 8 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 260, I \noffer amendments en bloc.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nSmith) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. \nGenerally, they are on the issues related to our strategic deterrence: \nour nuclear weapons, our ICBMs, missile defense against those sorts of \nweapons from other countries; in other words, they touch on very \nimportant issues that are central to our country's security.\n  They have been sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, and I \nhope Members of this House will support this en bloc package.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I, too, support this en bloc \npackage. I hope that the Members will vote for it.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers at this \npoint, so I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time to once again say that I want to, first of all, thank the \nchairman. I want to thank all of the members of the committee and the \nstaff for the hard work that they do and have done on this bill.\n  Every year, this is a very, very difficult process, starting with the \ncommittee markup, which, this year, I think--we probably didn't set a \nrecord. We set a record for my time in terms of one day going until \n4:45 in the morning.\n  But I just want to take one brief moment to recognize the staff that \ndoes just an unbelievable amount of work throughout this process. We \nsee the amendments both in committee and on the floor that survive that \nprocess. The staff has to sift through literally hundreds more to try \nto boil them down, to try to find compromises, to basically try to work \nout whatever they can work out. I don't think there are too many \nmembers of the staff on either side that have slept more than 2 or 3 \nhours a night here for the last few weeks. So I thank them for their \nhard work, and I thank the committee members for their hard work as \nwell.\n  It is the largest committee in Congress. We have excellent members on \nit. During the course of the debate and during the course of putting \ntogether this bill, every one of those members contributed greatly to \nthe product.\n  As I have said before, there are a lot of good things in this bill. \nThe reform package that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) has \nmade of particular priority I think is a very good first step towards \ntrying to get more efficiency out of the military in a variety in \ndifferent places. And of course we fund a lot of very necessary \nprograms.\n  But we have one overarching problem that we have had since 2011, \nstarting with the fact that we couldn't pass the appropriations bills \nfor 2011. And most have forgotten this, but at the end of March of \n2011, we were looking at a government shutdown. We had a marathon 4-\nday, every amendment you can imagine on the appropriations bill, and, \nactually, I think it did go past the moment when the government was \nsupposed to shut down before passing a CR, which pushed us then up \nagainst the debt ceiling in 2011, which wasn't going to be raised. We \nwere facing a situation where chunks of the government would shut downs \nin ways we couldn't even predict, and I want everyone to understand the \nimpact that this has on the Department of Defense.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  I vividly remember a dinner that I had in March of 2011 with then-\nVice Chief of Staff of the Army, Pete Chiarelli, and I was asking him \nabout how all of this budget uncertainty impacts the Department of \nDefense. He said: Well, we have got several hundred programs, and every \nday we try to figure out which ones we are allowed to fund, which ones \nwe are not allowed to fund, where we can get the money, what we can do, \nand how we can move it around. They didn't know.\n  For the last 4 years plus, that is what the Department of Defense has \nhad to do. We have gone from CR to government shutdown to occasionally \ngetting a spending bill to living with sequestration and the budget \ncaps. The one thing that this bill doesn't do is it doesn't resolve \nthat issue. It goes to the overseas contingency operation fund while \nleaving the budget caps in place.\n  As Secretary Carter has said, the overseas contingency operations \nfund is no way to fund the military and does very, very little to \nremove that uncertainty that I just described. So I want everyone to \nunderstand when I talk about the fact that I am opposing this bill \nbecause of its impact on the overall budget, that is also very much \nabout the Department of Defense.\n  The Department of Defense is left in that uncertainty and also stuck \nwith OCO funding, which is unpredictable, 1-year money that makes it \nvery difficult for them to plan. So this bill's reliance on the OCO \nfunding is a problem for the Department of Defense. Leaving those \nbudget caps in place is something that I am opposed to. So it is an \nissue directly related to the Department of Defense.\n  Now, it is also related to the rest of the budget. We have caps that \nimpact the Department of Homeland Security, that impact the Department \nof Justice, that impact those other areas that, by the way, are very \nimportant. I have had some folks mention ISIL and our fight against \nthem. Those departments are incredibly important to that fight. They \nare still under the budget caps, which are, I believe, jeopardizing our \nnational security. And then there are other issues, infrastructure \nbeing the biggest one that those budget caps continue to hamper and \ncontinue, I believe, to make our country less safe.\n  So the fact that this bill locks in place and keeps the budget caps, \nrelies on the overseas contingency operations fund, and, most \nimportantly, does not lift the budget cap for defense is the reason I \nam opposing it and urging other Democrats and Republicans as well to \noppose it. It doesn't lift the budget caps. I believe that is harmful \nto the Department of Defense. So this is a defense issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I also point out for my conservative colleagues who are \nso\n\n[[Page H3229]]\n\nconcerned about keeping those budget caps that the OCO goes right \naround them. I wouldn't think that a conservative who wants to keep \ngovernment spending under control would encourage the government \ndeciding that they can create free money. The OCO doesn't count against \nthe budget caps. So it is like the money isn't really being spent, \nonly, of course, the money is being spent. It is $38 billion that we \nare just choosing not to count. It doesn't fix the problem.\n  Lastly, the President has promised to veto all of the appropriations \nbills and the defense bill that are based on this flawed approach to \nthe budget. So what we are doing here is ultimately not going to be \nsuccessful until we come up with a better long-term solution to dealing \nwith the budget caps, and I will simply emphasize one more time that \nhas a profoundly negative effect on the Department of Defense, on our \nobligation to, I believe, properly fund and properly support the men \nand women who serve in our military. So, Mr. Chairman, while there is a \nlot of good in this bill, the ongoing budget uncertainty that it \ncontinues, I believe, is the fatal flaw in this bill. So I urge people \nto vote ``no.''\n  I do appreciate all the work and the effort that went into it. I also \nemphasize that this is but one step in the process. We have got a long \nway to go, and I am completely confident by the time we get to the end \nof it, we will have a National Defense Authorization Act. It will be \ndifficult. We have to work with the President, we have to work with the \nSenate, and people have a lot of different opinions, but this is but \nthe first step in the process.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I urge us to continue working to hopefully get a \nbetter product that can get the support of the House, the Senate, and \nthe President and fulfill our duty to pass this bill and support our \ntroops.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me start with where the gentleman from Washington \nleft off, that this is one step in the process. That is kind of what I \nhave been saying all along. Earlier the gentleman said he is opposed to \nthis bill because it locks in this OCO approach. No, it doesn't lock \nanything in. If there is a better way to deal with our budget issues in \nthe appropriation bills, then there is lots of time this year to do \nthat. But the question here for the House is: Will we vote against a \ndefense authorization bill--not an appropriation bill--but a defense \nauthorization bill and prevent it from moving a step ahead?\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. Chairman, I hope all Members had a chance to \nread the editorial in this morning's Washington Post. Let me just read \nthe last sentence of it: ``Far better for him''--by which it means the \nPresident--``and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate \ndefense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a \nfight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later \nregret.''\n  That is what we are asking here today: keep this adequate defense \nbudget moving by voting for it.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, that doesn't solve all the problems. The gentleman \nis exactly right. There are all sorts of appropriation bills and other \nthings to come in this process. But to try to use this important bill \nand the authorities it gives as political leverage to somehow make that \nhappen, I think, is not fair to the men and women who serve or to our \ncountry's security.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are lots of things that affect the military that \nthis bill does not solve. I admit it. I don't try to solve all of them. \nWhen you try to solve all the problems, you usually end up making a \nmess. But that should not take away from the good that is in this bill. \nSo I want to just emphasize the good that is in this bill has come from \nboth sides of the aisle, and I am incredibly grateful for the \ncontributions the Democratic members of the committee made. Something \nlike 110 provisions in the underlying mark were requested by Democrats. \nIn the committee 96 amendments offered by Democrats were adopted into \nthe mark. We have had 57 amendments offered by Democrats made in order \nunder the rule.\n  We don't know how they are all going to come out yet, but the point \nis, a substantial part of this measure has been written and contributed \nto by Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, as well as Members \non the Republican side of the aisle. The truth is it is a better \nproduct as a result, and the truth is that it is consistent with the \nbipartisan tradition of this committee.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I want to end, actually, where Mr. Smith started, \nand that is to express appreciation to him for being a terrific partner \nto work with in formulating this bill and dealing with very complex, \nrapidly changing subjects as the world is swirling around us. As he \npointed out, we are the largest committee in Congress--63 members. But \neach of those members on both sides of the aisle have made important \ncontributions to this bill.\n  I would, like him, also want to appreciate the staff. I think we are \nunique in the Congress. We have an integrated staff where I can grab \nsomeone on the Democratic side or a Democratic member can grab someone \nwho works on the Republican side. They are all integrated, working on \nthe same issues. I think that makes us stronger as a committee. So \nthere is an important bipartisan tradition of this committee, and it is \nbecause national security is so important.\n  Let me go back to The Washington Post editorial and read the first \nsentence: ``There isn't much bipartisan governance left in Washington, \nbut if anything still fits that description, it is probably the annual \ndefense authorization act.'' I am pleased about that. I think that is \nwhat the American people want to hear because national security is so \nimportant. So for the suggestion to come that we are going to put \nnational security on the back burner while we try to solve all the \nbudget problems of all the agencies and all the government, that is \ndiscouraging.\n  Mr. Chairman, I hope that Members will not agree with that tactic, \nthat they will listen to the better angels of their nature as far as \nsupporting this bill because it is a bipartisan bill that is so \nimportant for our troops and national security. I hope they will \nsupport this en bloc amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Carter-Rigell-\nMcCaul-Gohmert Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of \nFiscal Year 2016 and in defense of our servicemembers' Second Amendment \nrights.\n  Twice my home State of Texas has mourned the loss of our soldiers and \ncivilians after shootings at Fort Hood just north of my district. In \n2009, Nidal Hassan walked into Fort Hood's Soldier Readiness Center, \nshouted ``Allahu Akbar'', and opened fire, killing 13 and wounding 42 \nothers in the most horrific terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.\n  Five years later, another shooter opened fire on the base, killing \nfour and wounding sixteen others. This is on top of other deadly \nattacks on military installations, such as the Navy Yard shooting in \n2013, and the 2009 shooting at a recruiting center in Little Rock, \nArkansas, where another Islamist radical killed one and wounded \nanother.\n  In each case, one has to wonder if something could have been done to \nstop the shooting sooner and to prevent more lives from being lost. For \nyears, DOD has had a stringent policy which prevents well-trained \nsoldiers from carrying personal firearms on base in compliance with \nstate and local laws. The Carter-Rigell-McCaul-Gohmert Amendment will \nresponsibly adjust this policy and allow members of the Armed Forces to \ncarry a concealed personal firearm if their commander determines it to \nbe necessary as a personal or force protection measure.\n  This is especially important at a time when threats to our soldiers \nand military bases is growing. In March, ISIS published a ``kill list'' \nof the names, photos and addresses of American soldiers. Since then, \nthe threat level at U.S. military bases increased to ``Force Protection \nBravo,'' in response to the increased threat of terrorism.\n  Mr. Chair, we must give our base commanders more discretion and our \nsoldiers more protection.

Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nWomack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting Chair \nof the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. \n1735) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military \nactivities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, \nto prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for \nother purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 260, he reported the \nbill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of \nthe Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Yes, I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Gallego moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1735 to the \n     Committee on Armed Services with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VI, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 6__. GUARANTEEING A PAY INCREASE FOR MEMBERS OF THE \n                   UNIFORMED SERVICES AND NO LAPSE IN PAY CAUSED \n                   BY A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.\n\n       (a) Increase in Basic Pay.--As provided in section 1009 of \n     title 37, United States Code, and effective on January 1, \n     2016, the increase for fiscal year 2016 in the rates of \n     monthly basic pay authorized for members of the uniformed \n     services shall be 2.3 percent.\n       (b) Response to Lapse in Appropriations.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall take all steps necessary to ensure that members \n     of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps continue to \n     receive compensation for their service in defense of the \n     United States despite any lapse in appropriations after \n     September 30, 2015.\n\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It \nwill not delay the bill, kill the bill, or send it back to committee. \nIf adopted, the bill will proceed immediately to final passage, as \namended.\n  As Members of Congress, we must always honor our promises to the men \nand women who serve in our military. Unfortunately, I know firsthand \nwhat happens when Washington fails our troops on the battlefield and \nwhen we come home. I fought the Iraq war on the ground. I was shot at \nand experienced IED attacks, but because Congress didn't follow through \non its promises, our vehicles didn't have the proper armor they needed. \nThis failure cost my friends their lives. Later, when I got home, my \nfriends and I suffered needlessly.\n  When my friends and I got home, we suffered needlessly because of a \nveterans healthcare system that was shortchanged and mismanaged. These \nfailures of leadership are what encouraged me to run for office, to \nensure that my generation of leaders takes better care of our troops \nthan we were taken care of.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. It is to make good on \nCongress' promise to give our military men and women a raise. The \namendment will lock in a 2.3 percent increase for all of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines. Last year, one in four members of our \nmilitary had to rely on food pantries and other charities just to make \nends meet. That is a disgrace.\n  Mr. Speaker, our troops deserve a raise. My amendment does something \nelse that is just as important. It ensures that even if Congress shuts \ndown the Federal Government, all of our brave men and women in uniform \nwill still get paid. Why should our servicemen and -women miss their \npaychecks just because we can't do our jobs?\n\n[[Page H3234]]\n\n  Why am I offering this amendment now? Because Republicans don't \nappear to have learned the lessons of the chaos and confusion they \ncaused by shutting down the government in 2013. Today, my Republican \nfriends are risking another government shutdown by resorting to budget \ngimmicks, relying on war funding to pay for more routine operations and \nmaintenance. That is completely irresponsible.\n  My Republican friends are fond of comparing the Federal budget to a \nfamily budget. Mr. Speaker, working families, military families can't \nrely on a special slush fund to pay for their daily expenses, and \nCongress should not either. We must protect our troops from the \nconsequences of this Republican leadership's refusal to confront the \nrealities of sequestration. That is why this amendment is so critical.\n  Yesterday, Speaker Boehner said voting against this bill would be \nshameful and that we would be turning our back on our troops. As a \nmarine and a combat veteran, I can tell you that the Speaker is wrong. \nThere is no shame in voting against a bill that creates uncertainty for \nour military and risks another dangerous government shutdown.\n  Mr. Speaker, the real shame would be to vote against the amendment \nthat gives our men and women the raise and certainty they deserve.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying I very much \nappreciate the service of Mr. Gallego and all the veterans on both \nsides of the aisle who have served our Nation. I appreciate all of the \ncontributions Mr. Gallego and all the other 62 members of the committee \nhave made into producing this National Defense Authorization Act. It \nhas been a bipartisan product in the tradition of this committee.\n  You know, if you think about it, for 53 straight years Congresses of \nboth parties have passed and Presidents of both parties have signed \ninto law a Defense Authorization Act, and that has been true through \nVietnam and the cold war and 9/11. It has been true through Watergate \nand race riots, and economic recessions and bitter political feuds.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  And yet, through all those things, somehow the parties could come \ntogether to do what was needed for our troops and for our country's \nsecurity. I think that that strong tradition of bipartisanship is \nsomething that we should not walk away from lightly.\n  We have heard some discussion--complaints, really--on both sides of \nthe aisle about using OCO to get up to the President's level.\n  If you look at this chart, this is the President's budget, and this \nis the congressional budget, which this bill is compliant with. There \nis a little difference in where the light blue and the dark blue start \nand stop. But the net effect, when you add it all together, is exactly \nthe same: $612 billion. That is what the President asked for. That is \nwhat this bill provides. There is no difference between the two.\n  I agree that we ought to find a better way to have fiscal discipline \nwithout the arbitrary caps and sequestration that are in the Budget \nControl Act, but this bill can't do that. This bill is a defense \nauthorization bill. It is not a budget bill. It is not an immigration \nbill. It is not even a defense appropriation bill. So if this bill \nfails, how does that get us closer to fixing our budget problems?\n  The truth is we could all find an excuse to vote against every bill, \nevery day, for what is not in it, but that doesn't make a lot of sense. \nWhat is important is what is in it. And what is in it is really \nimportant for our troops and for our national security.\n  As much as I appreciate Congressman Gallego's service, I find it \nironic that he would offer an amendment that tries to make sure our \ntroops get paid, even in the event of a government shutdown; and yet, \nby voting against this bill, the troops don't get paid. How does that \nfit together?\n  Let me just mention two of the things that are in this bill for our \ntroops. One is a new retirement system for people who sign up for the \nmilitary. Right now, 83 percent of the people who serve come away with \nno retirement. Under this bill, they can put some money aside, the \ngovernment will match it, and they can have a nest egg. If you vote \nagainst that bill, that doesn't happen.\n  One of the complaints we have all heard so many times is that the \ntransition from Active Duty to the VA is problematic because you can't \nstay on the same drugs. One of the things this bill does is say that \nthey have got to have a joint formulary so you stay on the same drugs \nand you can take better care of the people as they transition. Doesn't \nthat make sense?\n  I hope all Members had a chance to read The Washington Post editorial \ntoday. Let me just read the last sentence:\n\n       Far better for the President and his party's leadership in \n     Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving \n     through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all \n     Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later regret.\n\n  I think that is the bottom line. This doesn't solve all the problems. \nIt doesn't try to solve all the problems. I know we have got more \ndebate, more discussion to come, but this is a step on what has been a \nvery bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, here is the bottom line. We are incredibly privileged to \nhave these jobs, to live in this country, but those privileges only \ncome because brave men and women are willing to volunteer to serve and \nsacrifice for our country.\n  Now, we can never match their courage and dedication and sacrifice, \nbut surely to goodness we can do better than use them as pawns for some \nsort of attempt to apply political pressure on issues that have nothing \nto do with this bill. Surely we can do better than that. And the way to \ndo better than that is to vote against this motion and for final \npassage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, with this being National Infrastructure \nWeek, I want to call attention to the crisis facing the Federal highway \ntrust fund.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, the highway and transportation \ndepartment has canceled several projects due to the depletion of the \ntrust fund. It is vital that we find a solution to this crisis that \nfinances the trust fund for the long term and keeps our roads and \nhighways safe for travel and commerce.\n  This is why, next week, I plan to file legislation to plug the $15 \nbillion deficit in the trust fund without raising taxes. It will be \ncommonsense legislation that Members on both sides of the aisle should \nget behind in order to prioritize funding for our critical \ninfrastructure construction and maintenance and to avoid these crisis \ndeadlines in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3236-8", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK AND INVESTMENTS\n\n  (Ms. EDWARDS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, once among the world leaders in quality \ninfrastructure, now, we rank just 16th, according to the World Economic \nForum. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the \noverall assessment of our Nation's infrastructure ranks the United \nStates at a whopping D-plus.\n  We have just 4 legislative days until the highway trust fund expires. \nAs we wait for the majority party to end their dysfunction and come to \nsome--any--kind of agreement on extending the highway trust fund, \n660,000 jobs hang in the balance.\n  I know now that in Maryland, 5,305 bridges are in complete disrepair. \nThat is nearly 27 percent of the bridges in our State. Just a few \nmonths ago, a woman was driving down the highway, minding her own \nbusiness, when a chunk of cement fell down because it is in disrepair.\n  I am not really sure how many lives the majority party is prepared to \nlose to dysfunctional and underfunded infrastructure. I am not sure how \nmuch economic insecurity we are willing to cause the American people, \nbut it is time for us to invest in our Nation's infrastructure, create \ngood-paying jobs, $1 billion, 35,000 jobs all across the economy.\n  Let's get moving. Extend the highway trust fund. Invest in our \ninfrastructure, our long-term infrastructure. Create jobs for the 21st \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3236-9", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3236-H3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEWSOME HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n  (Mr. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida.

With a 5-1 victory over Coral \nReef on Saturday, the Wolves secured their first State title in the \nhistory of Newsome High.\n  In the championship game, the Wolves were led by lockdown pitching \nand power hitting from Cassidy Davis, a clutch performance in relief \nfrom Claire Feldman, and runs from Maddy Lyn, Hannah Pridemore, and \nLivia Chandler.\n  The Wolves worked hard all year, playing a tough schedule in \nHillsborough County. That helped them prepare for the playoffs, and it \nshowed them and their opponents that they had what it takes to win it \nall.\n  I am proud to represent these great student athletes in Florida, and \nI look forward to watching them repeat again next year.\n\n[[Page H3237]]\n\n  Congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3237-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXPIRATION OF THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, we have just 4 legislative days until the \nhighway and transit trust fund expires on May 31. Once again, we have \nbeen pushed to the brink because of Republican leadership choosing to \ncontinue small, short-term patches, rather than a comprehensive and \ndecisive planning document.\n  We cannot gamble with our infrastructure and transportation network. \nOur streets, our roads, our bridges, our railways are crumbling and \naren't up to par. We can't afford to wait any longer for a long-term \nplan.\n  The highway trust fund supports critical projects in our communities. \nIn my district in San Bernardino County, it would help fund the Devore \nInterchange, one of three routes in and out of southern California, \nimproving transportation and increasing efficiency for channeling goods \nin and out of the region.\n  The American people deserve better. They deserve safe streets and \nroads, dependable transit to get to and from work, and the opportunity \nfor local businesses to grow and expand. Without a long-term plan, \nCongress is part of the problem, not part of the solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3237-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF COEUR D'ALENE POLICE SERGEANT GREG \n                                 MOORE\n\n  (Mr. LABRADOR asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today on Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day to acknowledge and honor the life and service of \nCoeur d'Alene Police Sergeant Greg Moore. Sergeant Moore was shot and \nkilled in the line of duty on May 5, 2015.\n  Sergeant Moore's 12-year-old son Dylon wrote these words to honor his \nfather:\n\n       My dad was the best. He would tell me anything and was \n     always there for me. All the times I was sad or lonely, he \n     would be right by my side to comfort me.\n       Dad would also reassure me that he was okay going to work \n     by telling me he was Batman because he worked at night, had \n     lots of gadgets, was skilled and charming.\n       Also, wherever we went, he would know someone that was \n     there. I would always wonder how and why he knew those \n     people.\n       Dad's favorite place to eat was Qdoba. It ended up being my \n     favorite place as well.\n       He was a Boston fan, and he has gone to a couple of games, \n     but I know he would have liked to see more.\n       Every day, though, almost like tradition, we would wrestle \n     on the ground and try to beat each other. I've only won once, \n     but I have learned so many things from him.\n       I love him so much because he was a good dad, always \n     helping people, and I want everyone to know that he is the \n     best.\n\n  He was the best.\n  Sergeant Moore, rest in peace.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to day on Peace Officers Memorial \nDay to acknowledge and honor the life and service of Coeur d'Alene \nPolice Sergeant Greg Moore. Sergeant Moore was shot and killed in the \nline of duty May 5, 2015.\n  Gregory King Moore was born in Walla Walla, Washington; he attended \nWalla Walla High School and Walla Walla Community College before moving \nto Idaho to attend the University of Idaho. After graduating from the \nUniversity of Idaho he joined the Asotin County Sheriff's Department \nbefore transferring to the Coeur d'Alene Police Department.\n  During his tenure at the Coeur d'Alene Police Department he served as \na Patrol Officer, Field Training Officer, and School Resource Officer.\n  I did not have the pleasure of knowing Sergeant Moore personally. But \nthe outpouring of support from his community tells me much about his \ncharacter and service. More than 4,000 people attended his funeral, \nincluding officers from across Idaho, as well as Washington, Montana \nand Canada. This outpouring of support warmed my heart and reminded me \nof the goodness of the people of Idaho. I hope this public support was \ncomforting to Sergeant Moore's family.\n  Sergeant Moore's 12-year-old son Dylon wrote these words to honor his \nfather.\n  ``My dad was the best. He would tell me anything, and was always \nthere for me. All the times I was sad or lonely, he would be right by \nmy side to comfort me. Dad would also reassure me that he was OK going \nto work by telling me he was Batman, because he worked at night, had \nlots of gadgets, was skilled and charming. Also, wherever we went, he \nwould know someone that was there. I would always wonder how and why he \nknew those people. Dad's favorite place to eat was Qdoba. It ended up \nbeing my favorite place as well. He was a Boston fan and he has gone to \na couple of games, but I know he would have liked to see more. Every \nday, though, almost like tradition, we would wrestle on the ground, and \ntry to beat each other. I've only won once, but I have learned so many \nthings from him. I love him so much because he was a good dad, always \nhelping people. And I want everyone to know that he is the best.''\n  Coeur d'Alene Police Chief Lee White said ``Greg was part of a proud \nprofession, and an even prouder police department. Greg did things \nright. He was a leader, he was a supervisor, and he was not satisfied \nsitting at a desk. In the end, and the reason we're here today, is that \nhe personified the oath that we take when we raise our right hand and \nwe're sworn in. Greg was killed protecting the life and property and \nway of life of the citizens of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. He will never be \nforgotten.''\n  Throughout Idaho hundreds of vehicles are now displaying a decal that \nreads K27 in honor of Sergeant Moore's call number. I would like to add \nmy voice to those that honored Sergeant Moore by closing with phrase \nthat had passed over the lips of those thousands who have honored \nSergeant Moore over the past week.\n  K27 rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3237-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING FALLEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on an issue that I \nhear more and more about each and every day, that is, how regulations \nare actually crushing and harming our small community banks.\n  Just a week ago, I met with a group of small independent and \ncommunity bankers who shared some pretty striking stories. A set of \nregulations issued as a result of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law \nhave now led to a more than 100 percent increase in the length of the \nquarterly financial status report that they must file each quarter.\n  One banker said that it took his CFO 4 full working days just to \nfinish the report this year, and this is a CPA with multiple advanced \ndegrees. Another said he has to pay the accountant now $25,000 just to \nreview the reports for its accuracy.\n  Mr. Speaker, these crushing Dodd-Frank regulations are having the \ndirect opposite effect of their intention. They are hurting small \ncommunity banks that are vital to providing capital to the small \nbusinesses that keep our economy healthy.\n\n[[Page H3238]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3238-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Conaway), my very good friend.\n\n\n                       Repeal the Oil Export Ban\n\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for \nyielding.\n  This may not be the topic that he is going to talk about here, but I \nappreciate the time to be able to talk to something that is important \nto the folks of west Texas and is actually important to all Americans. \nI rise today to bring attention to an important issue that is gathering \nnationwide support, that is, repealing the export ban on crude oil.\n  This week, I submitted an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act that would, in fact, repeal the ban. While the \namendment did not ultimately make it into the final bill, I would like \nto take a moment to talk about the importance of lifting that ban.\n  First, let's remember why the export ban was placed into law to begin \nwith. Because of the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, Congress enacted the \nEnergy Policy and Conservation Act, directing the President to ban \ncrude oil exports. At the time, the ban served a purpose: to keep our \noil at home in order to reduce our exposure to the wildly fluctuating \nmarkets of that time.\n  Today, though, the ban has outlived its purpose. It is an antiquated \npolicy that is now only serving to harm Americans and punish domestic \nproduction. For example, right now we allow Iran to export more oil \nfrom their country than we do from our own domestic producers. This is \nwrongheaded and is long overdue for a change. The ban should be lifted, \nwhile leaving in place the necessary authorities to allow the President \nto act in an emergency and while preserving our Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  Some claim that gasoline prices would increase if the ban is lifted, \nbut analysis shows that to be incorrect. It shows that prices will \nactually fall, reducing the cost of the product that American families \nrely on every single day, which is another reason to support lifting \nthe ban.\n  In 2013, the United States was the number one oil producing nation in \nthe world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia, a fact that many thought \nimpossible only a decade ago.\n  Taking advantage of our Nation's abundant resources by lifting the \nban will, in fact, lower gasoline prices, create dependable, long-\nlasting jobs, and help expand our energy supply, making our Nation more \nenergy independent.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the growing voice of the American \npeople. It is time to lift the export ban on crude oil.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to warn my colleagues and\n\n[[Page H3239]]\n\nthe American people of several threats to their safety and their \nprosperity. These threats are observable from Washington, D.C., but may \nnot be observable to the American people. So I ask my colleagues to pay \nattention, number one, to what we are doing here, but I also would ask \nthe American people to pay attention to what we are doing here.\n  There are changes being maneuvered through our legislative branch and \nbeing mandated by executive orders from President Obama that will \nundermine the economic well-being of hard-working Americans and put us \nin jeopardy as a nation, both economically and in terms of our national \nsecurity.\n  Those pursuing these egregious policy initiatives are fulfilling \nPresident Obama's pledge to change America. And what most Americans \nbelieved was a commitment to make our country better, to change \nAmerica, was, in reality, an elitist and, I believe, an arrogant pledge \nto dramatically alter the basic and fundamental institutions and values \nthat have been thought of by our patriots to be the essential elements \ndefining our country and, of course, ensuring our freedom, security, \nand prosperity.\n\n  What are these threats that I talk about? What are these threats that \nwe need to pay attention to?\n  They are not coming from one political party. They are not coming \nfrom the Republicans or the Democrats, as a party. You can see support \nacross the board on both sides of the aisle on various sides of these \nissues. It is also not a threat just stemming from one person or one \npolitical leader, but it is, of course, what we are talking about.\n  This threat is coming from a very powerful coalition seeking profit \nfor themselves, even if it impoverishes the people or diminishes, at \nleast, the economic well-being of the people of the United States.\n  Ironically, people who are enjoying their freedom and people who are \nenjoying their relative prosperity don't pay attention to some of the \nvery intricate matters that have come before us in Congress. But I can \nassure all of my fellow Americans, there are powerful interests who are \npaying attention, and they are doing what they best can do to \nmanipulate the law in a way that will enhance their profits, even if it \nis being done at the expense of the well-being of the American people.\n  We can see this in dramatic changes that are being suggested in \nsomething that probably is very boring and tame to most Americans when \nthey even hear that someone is going to even talk about patent law--\npatent law, which is the legal structure that enforces an inventor's \nright to own and control the product of his or her genius, labor, and \ninvestment for a given period of time.\n  So I say, of course, that sounds pretty mundane, patent law. Is it \nsome detailed, intricate regulation and control of this area of \neconomic life, of jobs, and things that we do in America?\n  Well, it is more than that. It may sound mundane; but, in reality, \npatent law and the patent rights of our people--the right of our people \nto own the technology they have created for a specific period of time--\nhas been a significant determinant in our country's way of life, our \ncountry's quality of life, and the security of our Nation.\n  This intellectual property right, the right through a patent \nownership of 17 years' control and--not only of 17 years of control, \nbut also of profit from one's own inventions, has been vital to our \nwell-being as a nation and an essential part of the American Dream.\n  Let's note that this was a right that was written into the \nConstitution by our Founding Fathers. People know about the Bill of \nRights. But the word ``right'' was only used in the body of the \nConstitution once, and that was a section that guaranteed that \nAmericans--that what Congress should do is to make sure that Americans \nwere guaranteed the right to control their own creations, if they are \ninventors or writers, for a given period of time, to profit from it so \nthat they would have incentives to come up and be the most creative \npeople in the world.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Our Founding Fathers believed that technology and freedom would \nuplift ordinary Americans and give all Americans a chance at a decent \nlife. And they were right. They wrote that into the Constitution. It is \nright there. I believe it probably was under the influence of my \nfavorite Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin. What we have to recognize \nis that over the years of our country, what has made us a great nation \nis our freedom and technology.\n  This is especially true for minority Americans and especially of \nBlack Americans. Let me note that Black Americans, if you take a look \nat the history of our patent system, are disproportionately inventive. \nIn the history of this country, actually, as a proportion of their \npopulation, our Black Americans have been more inventive than any other \ngroup in our country. Why is that? Because patent law and property law \nwere considered a constitutional right, and this was in the one area in \nwhich Black Americans were not discriminated against once they were \nfreed in 1860 to 1865, when our Black citizens were freed. After that \nwe found that more patents proportionately went to that community \nbecause they needed an opportunity to uplift themselves free from \noutside forces beating down on them and denying their rights.\n  Mr. Speaker, our patent system and the patents granted by Washington \nthus respected the rights of all of our citizens, including our \nminority citizens. Thus, making sure that we have patent protection has \nbeen one of the great boons to our minority populations, who otherwise \nsuffered great discrimination and suffered from a lack of rights, \nexcept for the property rights that come from inventions.\n  We see this has been good not just for minority Americans however. \nLet me note that we have, with technology, enhanced the ability of our \npeople to work hard and get the job done and thus create wealth that \nwas then owned by a large number of people rather than an elite. Of \ncourse, when people understand the importance of technology--and \nbusiness has more and more come to the understanding that it is new \ntechnology that will give them leverage and control over wealth.\n  There has been an ongoing attempt in these last 20 years to \ndramatically diminish the patent protection enjoyed by Americans, the \npatent protection written right into our Constitution. The fact is \nthat, for the last 20 years, I have been personally engaged along with \na small group of people who believe that technology and freedom are \nessential to the well-being of our country. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and \nothers have beat back many of these attempts to diminish the patent \nprotection of our citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, America does have a patent system now. It is the \nstrongest in the world. It is the strongest patent system in the world. \nWe have always been proud of that. We have been proud that it has \nresulted in the fact that ordinary people have high standards of living \nhere and they earn a good living from work because their work is \nenhanced by technological superiority over their competitors.\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, people work hard all over the world. \nEverybody works hard. In all of these countries they work hard like our \npeople work hard, but they don't have the technology that enhances \ntheir work and amplifies their energy and hard work so that more wealth \nis created. We have encouraged that since the day our Constitution was \nratified. That is why our people, when they work hard, end up living \nbetter because it gives us a competitive edge over the slave and \noppressed labor in other countries.\n  We, in fact, of course, know that the prosperity of average Americans \nto us and to our Founding Fathers was an important goal. It wasn't just \nwe were going to have a country that worked, but it was going to be a \nsystem with respect for rights that would lead to a good and decent \nliving for all of us, for all the people, and not just a small elite of \nbusinessmen.\n  Well, we have done this over the years, and it has worked well. We \nhave not had to have our own people who do work hard having to compete \nin terms of muscular and use of their physiques in order to produce \ngoods, services, and wealth. They had the technology that permitted \nthem to outcompete those other countries.\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, it ensures we have a more secure country. Having a \nstrong patent system where people are encouraged to invent new things \nand to be innovative has given us the edge over people who would do \nharm to our country. It has been important to our national security \nbecause we can't take\n\n[[Page H3240]]\n\non adversaries that don't respect human rights. If America was trying \nto secure itself from threats from groups of people around the world, \nleaders and gangsters who have no respect for human rights whatsoever, \nwe lose because they are willing to lose all of their people, and they \nare willing for any amount of bloodshed to maintain control and power \nand, yes, to beat the United States and democratic countries.\n  Instead, Mr. Speaker, we have had technology at work helping defend \nour country, technology that would not have existed had we not had the \npatent protection that has been traditional to our country. Even look \ntoday what is happening. Without drones, where would we be? Without \ndrones fighting the good fight against ISIL, we would have to have \nthousands of Americans there to fight that threat to mankind and the \nfreedom of the world. Instead, we have joined with the forces in Erbil, \nwhich is the Kurds, in standing tough directly against this onslaught \nof radical Islam, and they are holding firm. But without our drones \nthere to help them, they would be overrun.\n  So this idea of property ownership of technology, of your \ntechnological developments, has been heart and soul to a prosperous and \nsecure America. So when I say there are changes being proposed here in \nCongress, they are trying to manipulate through the system that will \naffect the prosperity of the average American and the security of our \nNation. The public and my fellow colleagues need to pay attention \nbecause we are again facing a major onslaught, an attack on this \nfundamental right of technology ownership by those who create that \ntechnology.\n  We are facing an onslaught that is being what? Being masterminded, \nbeing masterminded and being pushed by megamultinational corporations \nwho are not operating in the interests of the people of the United \nStates. They could care less about all of that. But they are operating \nafter what they can do to enrich themselves, even if it is not in the \ninterests of the people of the United States and the interests of our \nsecurity. These megamultinational corporations have pumped millions \nupon millions of dollars into lobbying for changes in our patent system \nthat diminish the rights of the inventor and enables these \nmultinational corporations to steal the intellectual property of our \ninventors and use it without giving compensation to the owners. This is \nin direct contradiction to what the Constitution meant to guarantee and \nwhy it was written directly into the body of the Constitution that this \nwas a right that Americans should be concerned about.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the last 20 years there has been a stealth attack on \nAmerica's strong and effective patent system. Let us note that we have \nhad the strongest and the most effective and recognized fair patent \nsystem in the world. All other patent systems have been judged against \nus, and now we have had these last 20 years an insidious undermining, \nand we are on the edge of a huge attack and perhaps successful \ndestruction of fundamental patent rights that have been part of our \npeople for many years.\n  For example, 20 years ago, shortly after I came here, I found that in \nthe GATT--that is a trade treaty that we have--there were provisions \nthat were snuck into the GATT implementation legislation. That is \nlegislation we passed here in Congress in order to implement a trade \nagreement. These big corporate interests had put into the GATT \nimplementation legislation without telling anybody two provisions that \nwould have dramatically hurt the small inventors in this country.\n  Up until now, the Constitution actually says that the inventors and \nthe writers are guaranteed a specific time where they will control. \nThey will be granted a specific time where they will control their \npatent, the rights to their patent, and the rights of their creative \ngenius. Well, it has traditionally been that once you file, as soon as \nthe patent is actually granted to the inventor, then the clock starts \nticking, and you get 17 years of protection. In different parts of the \nworld, that is not what the law has been. In Japan and in Europe, it \nhas been, oh, no, once you apply, after 20 years, even if it takes you \n10 or 15 years to get your patent or 19 years, no, the clock is ticking \nthen. You may not be granted your patent for 19 years, and then you \nhave 1 year left, and that is no patent protection at all.\n  So now they are trying to foist that on us. By the way, that would \ngive people, knowing the clock is ticking--those small inventors in \nother countries are faced by people who are trying to pressure them to \naccept lesser claims to the legitimacy of their patent in order to \nbasically prevent these guys, men and women, from being compensated the \nway they would be if they had a guaranteed term, which is part of our \nConstitution.\n  Mr. Speaker, the other provision that was there 20 years ago was the \n18-month publication demand. That is, after 18 months, when someone \napplies for a patent--now, it is that once someone applies for a \npatent, that patent application is absolutely secret until that patent \nis granted. Unless you have a patent in your hand--then it is published \nfor the world because their ownership has been established. Well, that \nhas been traditionally what our Patent Office and our patent protection \nhas been. Basically, you have a secret and you developed it, you give \nit to the Patent Office. In fact, if anybody leaked that information, \nup until this point it has been a felony for anybody to tell anyone \nelse until that patent is actually granted to the inventor.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, they want to change this and say, if you haven't \nbeen granted your patent within 18 months, it will be published for the \nwhole world. Think about that. Think about what I am saying. Before, \nfor our entire country's history, we have made sure that an application \nis secret so that nobody can get ahead of the inventor himself and the \ninventor won't be put in a bad spot. We made sure that until the patent \nis granted it is secret. They want to change that so that after 18 \nmonths it is published. What if that patent takes 10 years to issue? \nThat means the man or woman who invented this piece of technology, our \ncompetitors overseas will be able to use it for all of that time \nbecause they will know all about it, but the patent hasn't been granted \nto the inventor yet.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  I called that the ``Steal American Technologies Act.'' That is what \nthey were trying to do. That is what it would result in, and keep that \nin mind.\n  The large multinationals sought to weaken the ability of our \ninventors to enforce patent rights. Why? Why do they want these big \ncompanies here in the United States? Well, mostly, they are \nmultinational companies now--they are big guys--and what they want to \ndo is steal from the little guy--surprise, surprise.\n  The big guys would try to manipulate the creation of law here that \nwill enable them to take something from some person who has less \neconomic power than themselves. Our constitutional rights are supposed \nto protect the little guy's rights. We believe the newspaper should be \nable to be published, but little guys should be able to print a \nmimeographed piece of information themselves and distribute it or to \ngather.\n  Actually, what is hard for me to imagine is that, if these big guys \nwere actually trying to diminish the rights of religion or speech in \nthis country, or assembly, there would be an outcry; but, because it is \nthe rights to own technology that you have created for a given period \nof time--it sounds too confusing, and they have let this feeling that \nmaybe the people can't understand it, so they don't pay attention--they \nhave let that lack of attention give them an opening to destroy and \nundermine the rights of Americans, and I think this right is every bit \nas important as those other rights of religion and speech, et cetera.\n  What they have set up in these last 20 years, it is an ongoing David \nversus Goliath because some of the biggest corporations in the world \nare behind the effort to change the patent law.\n  Well, we beat them back. As I say, there was a coalition of us--\nDemocrat and Republican, Marcy Kaptur. We had some very good support \nfrom the Black Caucus. I might add that, again, they recognized how \nimportant inventions have been to the Black community; but we beat them \nback.\n  It was a bipartisan coalition. We have had to, over the years, \ncompromise and negotiate certain things, but they have not gotten their \nway; but every time they have tried--they\n\n[[Page H3241]]\n\nhave tried to overwhelm those of us who are preventing the diminishing \nof patent rights--they have had to use scare tactics, always claiming \nthat there is a boogeyman, there is a boogeyman out there, and that is \nthe reason why we have to attack the inventor, because there is \nsomething out there that is really threatening and it is sinister and \nit is a sinister force that has to be defeated, that is why we have to \ntake away all of the rights of the inventors over here, because they \nhave now tried to tell the story in a way.\n  It is the equivalent of saying we are going to take away the rights \nof every American to sue someone--or a company or anyone else who has \ncaused them damage--because there are frivolous lawsuits. Yes, there \nare frivolous lawsuits. There are some people who misuse our legal \nsystem.\n  The last thing we want to do is eliminate the rights of all Americans \nto use the court system to protect their rights. That is basically what \nis going on here. Our own cherished patent rights to own what you have \ncreated--and this constitutional right that was given to Americans--is \non the verge of being dramatically altered and diminished and \ndestroyed.\n  By the way, the first boogeyman that was used in order to try to gain \nsupport for these very same two items that they snuck in the GATT, the \nboogeyman was called the submarine patentors.\n  Submarine patents--that is all you heard about before--as if a person \nwho was filing for a patent was a submarine patentor. Everybody has got \nto lose their patent rights in order to get the submarine patentor.\n  What was the submarine patentor? A submarine patentor was--their \ndefinition--someone who files for a patent and then does everything \nthey can to delay the patent from being issued; and then, after years \nand years, the patent is finally granted, and they have got all this \nleverage on all the people who have used the technology in the \nmeantime.\n  Well, I am sorry; there were very few submarine patentors--there were \nsome--but the fact is most inventors were struggling to get their \npatents issued to them as soon as possible because they needed the \nmoney, especially the little guys needed the money, and they were \nstruggling, ``Please, give us the patent so we can move forward on \nthis,'' but, no, they were being presented as if they were trying to \nslow down the process.\n  Well, we finally, after really fighting for 10 years on this, reached \nthe compromise, which my chief of staff, Rick Dykema, and myself \nnegotiated, along with Marcy Kaptur, who negotiated this agreement with \nus, that if, indeed, there is a patent applicant who uses his abilities \nor uses various powers that he has in the bureaucratic process to delay \nthe issue of the patent, well, if that happens, then, indeed, that \npatent, the time, the clock, has to start ticking against that guy, so \nhe is using his own time when it has not been issued.\n  Well, that solved the problem--there it was--without diminishing the \nrights of those people who were struggling to get their patents out, \nbut took 10 years or 15 years to get the patent issued.\n  That wasn't a hard thing to negotiate, a hard thing to do, but it was \na hard thing to accomplish because the people who were pushing \nsubmarine patents were really trying to diminish the patent rights of \nall Americans so that they could steal from little guys and could take \naway their patent rights basically as soon as possible.\n  Well, now, the current boogeyman is the patent troll. Now, there are \nsome people who misuse and have frivolous lawsuits who use the patent \nsystem. There is no doubt about it. I might add this idea that people \nwill be sent a thing--you are violating my patent, you either give my \n$5,000, or I am going to sue you, and then small businesses go along \nwith it--there have been court cases now that have taken care of that.\n  Obviously, that is a swindle and something we can't put up with; that \nwas happening to a degree, but there is no excuse, as I say, to \neliminate the rights of all Americans because somebody abuses a right. \nThat is not what is acceptable.\n\n  The patent troll is being used as a straw man. We are going to have \nlegislation that will get this guy who has these frivolous lawsuits and \nis creating such havoc among small-business men and ripping them off. \nJust like the submarine patents, that can be taken care of without \neliminating the patent rights of our people.\n  What we have now is the straw man, the patent troll. When you hear a \ndebate on this issue, all you will hear is patent troll, patent troll, \npatent troll, not recognizing that every provision in this bill \ndiminishes--it is H.R. 9 that is before our Judiciary Committee now--\nevery provision makes it more difficult for the small inventor to \nenforce his patent against infringement by future megacorporations.\n  Guess who is pushing this legislation? Huge megacorporations who want \nthat little guy not to be able to sue a corporation that has stolen his \nintellectual property rights--this is basically--but they are going to \nsay: Oh, no, it is the troll we are after, the troll.\n  Well, as I say, there have been frivolous lawsuits, and there have \nbeen changes made in the judicial system itself of how to handle that, \nbut there is no excuse for a troll--for this word ``troll,'' a straw \nman--get him to be used to damage and destroy the rights of the 95 \npercent of the technology creators in our country, take away their \nrights to get this straw man.\n  Well, let me tell you how the word ``troll'' came about, the word \n``patent troll.'' That is the reason you are hearing it. Every time you \nhear somebody say it, remember this. A group of corporate elitists got \nin a circle in a room--I know because one of the people who was in that \nmeeting switched sides and came over and disclosed that these corporate \nexecutives said: What can we do to make it sound so sinister that we \ncan get this passed? What words can we come up with that will just \nbasically create such a bad feeling that the American people will not \nrecognize that what we are really doing is trying to get the small \ninventor and make sure that the small inventor cannot sue us for things \nthat we are using?\n  Okay. They went around the room. This friend, the fellow who told me \nabout this meeting, said: I came up with the words ``patent pirate,'' \nand then, by the time it got around the circle, somebody came up with \nthe words ``patent troll.''\n  They said: That is it. That sounds so horrible, we can distract \neverybody's attention using that, and that is good enough. That sounds \nso evil that we can make sure that we go into battle using that in \nfront of us, instead of we want to diminish the patent rights of \nhonest, hard-working inventors who deserve to have a profit from their \ncreation of their technology.\n  That is just how cynical this debate has been. Every provision of \nH.R. 9--a bill now sitting in the Judiciary Committee--prevents--makes \nit more difficult for an inventor to actually enforce his rights and \nsue a company that is trying to steal, use his property rights, \nintellectual property rights, without compensating him.\n  Let me give you an example of something in the bill and the changes \nthey are proposing. Now, they are changing to loser pays legal fees. If \nyou have a small inventor and if he sues that company and it is a huge \ncompany, that is usually what he has created and making profit from it, \nif he sues them and he loses, he will have to pay the legal fees for \nthat huge company.\n  Now, for the huge company, that is almost nothing. Taking on a case \nof one guy is nothing in their expense account because they have got \n100 lawyers in a stable, waiting to help and being paid for. Well, if \nthe inventor loses, that is it for him. That alone is wrong.\n  In this legislation, H.R. 9, they have added another little proviso \nto destroy the small inventor; and that is, if someone invests in his \ninvention, if someone invests in the invention and he manages to be \nsuccessful and comes up with a new piece of technology and he is \ngranted the patent and some megacorporation comes along and \nincorporates it and uses it and refuses to give this guy even a small \npayment for using the technology that he created, his intellectual \nproperty rights, if someone has invested in that inventor to help him \nmake the invention, let's say that, when that inventor goes up to \nbattle Goliath in his megacorporation, and let's say, even though he is \nright, he loses--because that happens sometimes in our country many \ntimes, where some people with a great number\n\n[[Page H3242]]\n\nof very sophisticated lawyers against the little guy, the little guy \nsometimes loses--well, what is going to happen now, according to this \nbill, is anyone who has invested in the inventor is going to have to be \nliable for the legal fees that come out of that suit.\n  Who is ever going to give an investment to an inventor if that may \nopen them up to liability? It is a liability, I might add, to some \nmegacorporation, megamultinational corporation.\n  Well, this provision just demonstrates what is the purpose of that \nprovision. The provision is to beat down the little guy so that the big \nguys can steal, and that is evident, very evident; yet this bill is \nstill moving forward.\n  It is H.R. 9. It is in the Judiciary Committee now. As I say, H.R. 9 \nis the equivalent of saying: Because there are frivolous lawsuits, we \nare going to do everything we can to diminish the power of ordinary \ncitizens to use the law and legal lawsuits for compensation for damages \ndone to them.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Every provision of the bill weakens the right of the inventor to \nenforce his or her own patents.\n  This bill actually passed the House last year. We struggled against \nit here in the House, but what happens is 90 percent of the people here \nin this body are just so busy that it is hard to pay attention to \nsomething that seems mundane like a patent law, and they just can't get \nthemselves to focus on it. The American people also think that issues \nlike this are so complicated that they can't get involved, but that \nleaves the whole playing field open to huge corporations that are out \nto enrich themselves by basically structuring law in a way that the \npower and the wealth will flow to them.\n  Supposedly, the system our Founding Fathers wanted was for the wealth \nto flow broadly across our country so that every American could benefit \nfrom new technologies and new wealth that was being created. Now they \nwant to corral that wealth; they want to diminish our rights in order \nto enrich themselves. These companies are not companies that are loyal \nto the United States. They are being loyal to their own profits, and \nsome of them are multinational corporations that have actually no ties, \nreal ties, to the United States.\n  Let me just suggest that this bill did pass the House last year, but \nit was stopped in the Senate because, by then, we had made so much \nnoise here. As I say, a bipartisan group, led by myself, Marcy Kaptur \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Massie from Kentucky, and other very strong activists, \ngot together, and we made so much noise that the American universities \nfinally paid attention because that bill that lets people steal patent \nrights was a huge threat to our university system. Had it been signed \ninto law, the value of patents would have gone down dramatically. Let \nme go back to how that works.\n  Remember, we were talking about a troll. What their definition of \n``troll'' is is anybody who buys the patent rights from someone who has \ninvented something and has a patent but who doesn't have the money to \nenforce it. Anybody who actually buys the patent rights but is not \naiming at commercializing it himself and is going to enforce that and \nmake a profit from it, that is going to be what they are stamping out. \nThe universities are not there to commercialize what they are doing. \nThey are there to basically have new discoveries, and they realize they \nhave got a lot of patents that they own as part of their portfolios and \nthat the actual values of those patent collections by the universities \nwould have dramatically gone down. As well, of course, the patent value \nof any American would have gone down at that point.\n  Also, other industries that are really important industries to our \nwell-being--PhRMA and others, biotech industries--which struggle hard \nto come up with one patent that they then can sell in the market, are \ntotally undermined by this effort to weaken our patent system. We \nmanaged to mobilize those people, and we stopped it the last time \naround; but the multinational corporations behind this legislation are \nso arrogant that this bill is now going to be shoved through again. \nThis time, I think, with the American people, we can actually stop it \nhere in the House, and we can certainly stop it in the Senate.\n  We need the American people to mobilize and to call their Congressmen \nand ask: How do you stand on this terrible patent bill, H.R. 9? We need \npeople who are going to stand up for the little guy in America, not for \nsome megacorporation that is trying to permit the theft of American \nintellectual property rights by multinational corporations.\n  Whether or not we succeed this time around is going to depend on, \nyes, the people here who understand the issue, fighting it out, being \nas aggressive as we can be, and the American people mobilizing to make \nsure we protect our sacred rights granted in the Constitution. One of \nthe most important, I believe to be, is the right of technology \nownership to people who create that technology.\n  As I say, there are powerful interest groups in this city and in our \ncountry and in the world that try to change policy and are manipulating \ngovernment. That is clear. That is fine. We have a democratic process. \nWe just need to make sure that we are all being held accountable--that \nall of the Members of the House and the Senate are accountable for \ntheir votes--and that we know and the public at least has the chance to \nknow what we are voting on.\n  Actually, there is something happening right now where that is not \ntrue at all, and I sure hope the American people are paying attention \nto what is going on here in Washington concerning what they call TPP, \nthe trade promotion pact, and then there is the TPA, which gives trade \npromotion authority to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a trade \ntreaty with the nations around the Pacific. The sinister nature of this \ncan be seen because this trade treaty with the Pacific nations is \nsecret. It has been declared classified.\n  Right now, if I had gone down and read what now exists of this trade \ntreaty and if I had announced it here on the floor, I would have been \nviolating secrecy restrictions that they have declared--how about \nthis?--in a policy about trade with major countries of the world, which \nwill have an enormous impact on our well-being. It is being kept \ntotally secret from the American people. How is that? Then they say \nMembers of Congress can go down and look at it if they want to. Of \ncourse, as they have said, you can only do it within a certain time. \nThey have regulated the time we can go down, and we are so busy that \nalmost no Members of Congress will have gone down and read the actual \ndocuments that explain what that trade policy is that they are trying \nto foist on us.\n  Please, I hope the American people understand that Members of \nCongress should not be voting on things that, number one, they don't \nhave access to, but we should not be voting on something if we have not \npermitted the American people to know what that is. You will remember \nthe famous statement by Ms. Pelosi about ObamaCare, which was that we \nhave to pass it in order to find out what is in it. That is totally \nunacceptable. In trade treaties, these things will now pass rules and \nregulations based on this treaty that will impact our way of life here.\n\n  Now, we have been briefed on it. I am on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, and we were briefed on this the other day. The two main \nadministration guys there--the people who had been Ambassadors and who \nare currently with the State Department--were briefing us. It is just \nlike the boogey words over here, the scare words, in terms of patents. \nNow, this is all being used in just the opposite way with every \nglorious word--higher income for our people, more competitive for \nAmerica, and all of the trade will come in our direction. Yet, when I \nasked these briefers, ``Hey, have you read this treaty?'' neither one \nof them had read it. So the people advocating for this treaty have not \neven read the treaty themselves.\n  I found a provision in the treaty, or at least I understand it is in \nthere--I have not verified it yet because we have all of this trouble \nto go through to verify what we are being asked to support--that says \nthat patents in the United States will basically have to be published \nafter 18 months. If a patent application is made and if after 18 months \nthe patent is not granted, the patent will be published for the whole \nworld to see. Uh-huh. Does that sound familiar? They tried to put that \nover on us 20 years ago. We managed to\n\n[[Page H3243]]\n\nthwart it then, and now they want to sneak it into a treaty, and the \nAmerican people are not permitted to know what is in the treaty.\n  Will that hurt us in some way? It will only make all of our \ntechnological discoveries available for our competitors overseas to be \nusing long before the patent is even granted to the American inventor. \nYou see what type of sinister forces we are up against. Who can sit \ndown here and say how wonderful this treaty is going to be when the \nAmerican people aren't allowed to see it and when almost all of us have \nnot read it and when our briefers who come here have not even read it?\n  I asked them yesterday, these briefers, ``Well, is this in the \ntreaty?'' They didn't know. They didn't know whether or not this \nprovision on patents was in there, which would undermine our rights to \ncontrol our own creations here and have our opponents and our \ncompetitors overseas have all of the information about our technology \neven before the patent is granted. They didn't even know that was in \nthere. They didn't know if it was or if it wasn't.\n  By the way, if I had gone down and had finally gotten through the \nmaze and had read the actual wording in the treaty, I would have been \nrequired not to have mentioned it today on the House floor as we are \nbeing restricted because it has been declared secret from the American \npeople. This is outrageous.\n  We don't need to have a trade promotion authority that will keep \nthings from the American people, and we don't need to have a trade \ntreaty with the Pacific and with all of these nations in Asia that will \nopen us up to having our technology stolen, but also we don't know the \nother parts of it either.\n  We keep hearing of the great things that are in it that are going to \nbenefit the American workers, but we know what has happened in China. \nAs for China, we were told, if we opened up our trade with China, China \nwould modernize, and they would become a liberal, democratic country \nover the years. I call it the ``hug a Nazi, make a liberal'' theory. \nBasically, we were told that China would become a benevolent force. As \nwe know now, China is becoming a malevolent force. China is becoming a \nthreat to world peace, and the American people have not benefited from \nChina trade as our good-paying jobs have gone to China.\n  We don't want that for the rest of the world. We need to know what is \nin these trade treaties because they might have a major impact on \nbringing our working people's salaries down even more. Whether it is \nimmigration or trade or patent law, our criteria should be what is in \nthe interests of the people of the United States or whether it is in \ntrade, where we have been basically having trade for the benefit of \nsome mega-multinational corporations or patent law for the same clique.\n  Guess what they also want? They want cheap labor, and that is why you \nsee today this push to give 11 million people amnesty who have come \nhere illegally. It is not 11 million. That is a 10-year-old figure. By \nthe time they get done, they are going to bring 50 million people into \nour country who wouldn't be here otherwise. What is that going to do to \nour wage base? What is that going to do to Americans who are out \nlooking for work right now? What is that going to do to our schools? to \nthe money we have for our veterans' benefits? What is that going to do? \nWe are undermining the well-being of the American people for the \nprofits of some mega-multinational corporations. That is wrong.\n  I am a Republican--I believe in free enterprise; I believe in private \nproperty; I believe in the profit motive--but we have to have a \nCongress that is working for the benefit of and protecting the rights \nof the American people, and they need to mobilize to make sure we are \ndoing that by supporting them to make sure that our communities are not \noverrun with illegal immigrants.\n  By the way, if you grant amnesty to 25 million illegals, there will \nbe a huge surge of people from around the world who will know that all \nthey have to do is outlast us, and they will get their amnesty. We need \nto make sure that these decisions, those things--immigration policy and \ntrade policy and, yes, intellectual property protection policy--are \ndone in a way that will benefit us and will not benefit our \ncompetitors.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  When I say us, United States, it is us, U-S, us, the American people. \nThat should be the basis of our criteria: what is going to be in the \ninterests of the American people; not bring down their wages, not let \npeople steal our technology and use it to compete against us.\n  I ask my colleagues, please pay attention to H.R. 9 and these issues. \nJoin with me in supporting the cause of the American people, of us \ninstead of the big corporations.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3243-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING DEREK ``CHIP'' ANDREW HANSEN\n\n  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I am on a mission of mercy; \na mission of mercy, Mr. Speaker, because a U.S. military helicopter has \ngone down in Nepal on Tuesday, May 12. They were on a mission of mercy. \nThe United States of America always responds to those who are in need, \nthose who are in harm's way. This was no exception.\n  Our very finest volunteer to serve in our military. Many of them will \ngo to distant places, and some of them will not always return home the \nsame way they left. Some will not return at all. I am honored to say \nthat we should be proud of those who serve. Regardless as to how we \nfeel about conflicts around the world, we ought to appreciate the \nservice of those who are in our military, and we ought to want every \none of them to return home safely. So today I stand in the well of the \nHouse on a mission of mercy for our military persons who have lost \ntheir lives in distant places, but more specifically in Nepal.\n  We are there for a reason, Mr. Speaker. We are there because Ruth \nSmeltzer is right:\n\n     Some measure their lives by days and years,\n     Others by heartthrobs, passions, and tears,\n     But the surest measure under God's Sun.\n     Is what for others in your lifetime have you done.\n\n  We, in the United States of America, are doing things for others in \nthe lifetime of people in this country currently, and we do it in the \nlifetime of our Nation. We want it said that we were there to help \nthose in time of need.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, there is a time of need for those in Nepal. On April \n25, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal; 7.8. Thereafter, on May 12, a \n7.3 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal. These earthquakes have devastated \nthis country. Lives have been lost, more than 8,000 lives. People have \nbeen injured,\n\n[[Page H3244]]\n\nmore than 17,000. Millions have been displaced, nearly 3 million. \nMillions have been affected, more than 8 million. Four Americans lost \ntheir lives.\n  The United States moved quickly. We committed the sum of \napproximately $10 million initially, but that has now grown to more \nthan $32 million. The relief efforts from the United States are \ngrowing. Not only are we placing dollars into the relief effort, we are \nalso placing our military equipment into these efforts. That is why the \nhelicopter was there in Nepal, to help in this time of need.\n\n  So I am proud to say that we are there to help. The need is estimated \nto be approximately $415 million. The number could go up. But if it is \nthat amount, we can do as much as we can, and we should do as much as \nwe can to help the people of Nepal. I want you to know that the people \nof Nepal and the Nepalese community in the United States of America \nacross the length and breadth of our country are pitching in.\n  In my district, the Ninth Congressional District of Houston, Texas, \non May 2, 2015, we held a meeting. That meeting was to discuss how we \ncan be of service, the congressional office, and how the community can \ncome together to provide assistance for those in need in Nepal. At that \nmeeting, I am proud to say we had a good many persons in attendance. It \nwas a community meeting. In the true spirit of community, which has the \nword ``unity'' in it, there was unity within this community meeting. I \nam proud to say that the members of the Nepalese Association of Houston \nwere present. The president, Mr. Ghimirey was there, and he gave a \nreport. The secretary, Mr. Nepal, was there. He gave a report. The \nbuilding that we were in was at the International Center owned by Mr. \nWei Li, and we are honored that he opened the doors of his facility for \nthis purpose.\n  But it is important to know that the community was in unity on the \neffort to help those in Nepal. Some of the members of the community in \nattendance: the Bhutanese community was there. The Taiwanese community \nwas there. The Latino community was in attendance. The Burmese \ncommunity was in attendance. The Pakistani community, the Vietnamese \ncommunity, all in attendance. Asian realtors were there. The Southwest \nManagement District was there. There were Venerables there, those who \nare of the Buddhist faith. The Filipino community was represented. The \ncommunity activists of all stripes, of different ethnicities were in \nattendance. The Jewish community was there, and a report was given in \nterms of how Israel has been involved. The Turkish community was there, \nthe Indian community. The Lion's Club was represented. The Chinese \ncommunity was in attendance. And the African American community was \nthere, as well as a representative of the NAACP.\n  We had a cross-section of people all there for the purpose of \nbecoming a part of the mission of mercy, for the purpose of making sure \nthat we fulfill our obligation to help those in times of need, and I am \nproud to say that a goal of $100,000 was set for the purpose of aiding \nthose in Nepal just from that meeting. There are many others who have \nother goals, some higher, some lower, but I believe this goal will be \nmet because it was indicated at the meeting that approximately $60,000 \nhad been committed. I am proud to know that the community, in the \nspirit of unity, has come together.\n  We announced at that meeting that our congressional office, working \nwith other Members of Congress, we have filed a bill, H.R. 2033, to \naccord, to provide temporary protected status for the Nepalese \ncommunity in Texas, in the United States of America, if you are a \ncitizen of Nepal. If you are a citizen of Nepal, and you find yourself \nhere on some sort of visa, if you are here lawfully in the country, \ntemporary protected status would extend the stay for those who are \nlawfully in the country. It will not change the immigration status of a \nsingle person. It will simply extend the stay. This is the American \nway. It is not the first time we have done this. This is the American \nway.\n  When people are here and their visas expire, and they are subject to \ngoing back into harm's way or going back to their country, which would \nplace them in harm's way, we have done the honorable thing, the right \nthing. We have on many occasions allowed them to stay here rather than \nsend them into harm's way.\n  That is what this bill would do, H.R. 2033. It would permit them to \nstay in this country and not return to a country that has been \ndevastated by not one, but two earthquakes, a 7.3 and a 7.8. These two \nearthquakes have left much damage across the length and breadth of the \ncountry. The country is recovering.\n  We need to make sure that we do all that we can to help the people of \nNepal. This is why the bill was introduced, and I am proud to say that \na good many persons have joined this mission of mercy. The Honorable \nMike Honda is an original cosponsor, but there are others who are \ncosponsors, and in our tradition we like to thank people. It is a \ntradition of the House to thank people who are a part of a process that \nis helping someone.\n  When you have people of goodwill who have put their names on the \nline, you ought to acknowledge that they are doing it. So I am proud to \nacknowledge people of goodwill, members of the United States House of \nRepresentatives who are a part of this mission of mercy, who have \nsigned on to H.R. 2033.\n  I want to mention each and every name. There are others who will sign \non. This is not an all-inclusive list, but as of today: The Honorable \nMike Honda, who was an original cosponsor; the Honorable Rrad Ashford--\nand by the way these are alphabetized--the Honorable Karen Bass; the \nHonorable Mike Capuano; the Honorable Tony Cardenas; the Honorable Judy \nChu; the Honorable Yvette Clarke; the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver; the \nHonorable James Clyburn; the Honorable Steve Cohen; the Honorable John \nConyers.\n  For those of you who may just have joined us, these are the people \nwho are on a mission of mercy. These are the people who are on H.R. \n2033, a bill designed to help people stay in this country and not go \nback into harm's way to Nepal. By the way, this bill would impact about \n10,000 to 25,000 people. It is very difficult to count, but this is a \nguesstimate at best, the number of people who might benefit by staying \nin this country.\n  I said the Honorable John Conyers is on this mission of mercy; the \nHonorable Joseph Crowley; the Honorable Henry Cuellar; the Honorable \nDanny Davis; the Honorable John Delaney; the Honorable Suzan DelBene; \nthe Honorable Mark DeSaulnier; the Honorable Tammy Duckworth; the \nHonorable Keith Ellison; the Honorable Marcia Fudge; the Honorable Alan \nGrayson; the Honorable Gene Green; the Honorable Raul Grijalva.\n  As I continue with this list, let me make mention of this: This is \nnot the first time, as I have indicated, that we have had temporary \nstatus granted to other countries.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  It was done under the Clinton administration, and it was granted to \nMontserrat. It was done under the Clinton administration as well for \nNicaragua, following a hurricane, as well as for the Honduras. It was \ndone with the Bush administration for El Salvador. It was done for the \nObama administration for those who suffered from an earthquake in \nHaiti.\n  So these are some of the people: the Honorable Tammy Duckworth, the \nHonorable Keith Ellison, the Honorable Marcia Fudge, the Honorable Alan \nGrayson, the Honorable Gene Green, the Honorable Raul Grijalva, the \nHonorable Luis Gutierrez, the Honorable Denny Heck, the Honorable \nSheila Jackson Lee, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, the Honorable Eddie \nBernice Johnson, the Honorable Hank Johnson, the Honorable Daniel \nKildee, the Honorable Barbara Lee, the Honorable John Lewis, the \nHonorable Zoe Lofgren, the Honorable Jim McDermott, the Honorable Grace \nMeng, the Honorable Gwen Moore, the Honorable Grace Napolitano, the \nHonorable Jared Polis, the Honorable Charles Rangel, the Honorable \nCedric Richmond, the Honorable Bobby Rush, the Honorable Linda T. \nSanchez, the Honorable Loretta Sanchez, the Honorable Bobby Scott, the \nHonorable Jose Serrano, the Honorable Brad Sherman, the Honorable Chris \nSmith, the Honorable Jackie Speier, the Honorable Bennie Thompson, the \nHonorable Chris Van Hollen, the Honorable Maxine Waters, and the \nHonorable Bonnie Watson Coleman.\n\n[[Page H3245]]\n\n  I might add that this is bipartisan. It is always a wonderful thing \nto have bipartisan legislation. This legislation is bipartisan in \nnature.\n  I want you to know that, in sponsoring this legislation, it is our \nhope that the United States House of Representatives will take it up \nand that it will come to the floor of the House for a vote, so that we \ncan do more than say we support the people of Nepal.\n  This is a way for the Congress of the United States of America to go \nbeyond endorsing aid. It is a way to provide aid because the people who \nare here will have an opportunity to continue to work. As they continue \nto work, they will be permitted to return funds to their home country.\n  This is a way for us to not only keep people out of harm's way, but \nto allow those who are here to send money to those who are in harm's \nway. They can send dollars back to Nepal to help their country in a \ntime of need.\n  When we had the circumstance in Honduras that required temporary \nprotective status, persons were allowed to stay. Since that occurred, \napproximately $31 billion has been sent back to Honduras from those who \nare in the diaspora.\n  With reference to Nicaragua, for those who are in the diaspora, I \nwant to commend you because you have sent approximately $10 billion \nhome. For those in El Salvador, I want to commend you because you have \nsent approximately $45 billion home. For those in Haiti, in the \ndiaspora, you have sent approximately $6 billion home.\n  People in the diaspora from these various countries want to do what \nthey can to be of assistance to their people at home. This is a way of \nproviding them an opportunity to be of assistance to those that they \nlove, those who find themselves in harm's way, those who are in their \nhomelands.\n  Well, we hope that this piece of legislation will pass. If this piece \nof legislation passes, it will give those persons who are here the \nopportunity to continue to be a part of the mission of mercy by sending \ndollars to those who are in harm's way. It is nothing unique, but it is \nsomething very much needed for those who are in Nepal.\n  I am proud to tell you that, as we go forward with this effort, we \nwill extend the reach to the United States Senate. We will ask that the \nSenators please become a part of this. This is an effort that we all, \nin my opinion, can embrace. We can do this, and we can do it without it \ncosting us--meaning the government--any money.\n  The Government of the United States of America is already sending \ntens of millions of dollars by way of aid and equipment, and we are \ndoing a lot, but this is another way for the government to be of \nassistance without spending additional money to be of assistance to the \npeople who are here by not putting them back in harm's way, but at the \nsame time, to allow them--those who are here--to be of benefit to their \ncountry by sending dollars back in the form of remittances.\n  I believe that the House of Representatives and the Senate of the \nUnited States of America can get this done. I am going to ask my \ncolleagues to please give consideration to H.R. 2033.\n  Let us join hands together, those in the House and Senate, and be on \nthis mission of mercy to see if we can do something to provide aid and \ncomfort for those who are in Nepal by passing legislation to allow \nthose who are in this country to stay in the United States of America.\n  We also are on this mission of mercy because Dr. King is right--I \nmentioned Ruth Smeltzer--when he reminded us that life is an \n``inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of \ndestiny.'' What impacts one directly impacts all indirectly, meaning \nwhat is happening to those in Nepal will have an impact on us.\n  It may not be a direct impact, but there will be an indirect impact. \nIt will happen in ways that we may not be able to measure, but it will. \nIt will impact because there are people who are going to try to \nmigrate, people trying to get out of harm's way and try to get to other \ncountries.\n  My hope is that we will do our share to help those who are trying to \nget out of harm's way and do our share to prevent those who are here \nfrom going back into harm's way.\n  Dr. King is right; life is an inescapable network of mutuality. We \nare bonded together. This is one island that we are all stranded on, \nthe island that we know as Earth. If we are going to live together as \nbrothers and sisters, we have to treat each other as such.\n  This is a time for us to be responsive to our brothers and sisters in \nNepal because there is another comment I hear quite regularly when we \nhear of disasters like these. People will mention that: ``But for the \ngrace of God, there go I.''\n\n  We have had our share of mishaps in the United States of America; \nand, when we have had our share of mishaps, people have always sent \ntheir best wishes and aid to us. People have been of assistance to us \nthroughout the years, the decades, the century. People have been of \nassistance to us.\n  But for the grace of God, there go I.\n  I am so proud of the response that we had in this country after we \nsuffered \n9/11. There were people who showed us a great amount of sympathy and \nempathy, people who wanted to do all that they can to let us know that \nthey cared and that they were concerned and that they did not, in fact, \nsupport--and, in fact, condemned--the dastardly deeds that were \nperpetrated.\n  It was a time for the world to come together. This is another such \noccasion, but not the same--no two unpleasant circumstances are the \nsame--but this one in Nepal is one that we can embrace. This is a time \nfor us to show the world that we understand that there are things that \nwe can do and will do.\n  We are, by the way. We have sent millions of dollars. We have our aid \nin the form of the soft side of our military. Our heavy equipment and \nhelicopters are there. As I mentioned earlier, we did lose a \nhelicopter, and we lost some lives.\n  We are stepping up to the plate. The United States of America is \ndoing its part. I want us to continue to do our part. I want us to do \nall that we can to make sure that every person knows where we stand.\n  In so doing, I want to mention that we in the United States have been \nblessed to have this melting pot of people who come from all over the \nworld to be a part of this great American Dream, the great American \nideal, and the people who have come here from the country of Nepal are \nno exception.\n  They are hard-working people. They have shown their desire to be a \npart of the fiber and fabric of the United States of America. They have \nbeen people of good will. I ask that we extend the hand of friendship \nto these people of good will, especially during this month, which is a \nmonth that we are to give honor and show respect to those of Asian \nheritage, if you will.\n  This is Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. This is a great \ntime for us, during this month, to show our concern for the Asian \npopulation that is in Nepal. We have the opportunity to pass H.R. 2033 \nand make a difference in the lives of a good many people in this \ncountry.\n  I do want to mention again, for fear that some may not have heard, \nthe community in Houston is well organized. Immediately after the first \nearthquake hit, we had a meeting, and we had scores of people in \nattendance. These were Nepalese persons. They were there to show their \nunity with each other.\n  They also had a plan of action. Their plan of action included raising \nmoney so that they could send it to their homeland to be of assistance, \nand they want to send this money directly there themselves. I admire \nthem for their lofty goals and their efforts. They want to send the \nmoney themselves to their homeland. They want to make sure that there \nis no question that they have done their part.\n  The beautiful thing about this effort is that it became infectious \nand other members of the community decided: If not but for the grace of \nGod, there go I. Here is my opportunity to be of assistance. Here is my \nopportunity to unify.\n  It was an amazing sight to see, on May 2, when we had all of these \nvarious organizations and groups coming together, all of them pledging \ntheir support, all of them pledging their desire to be of assistance to \nthe Nepalese community in Houston, Texas, across the length and breadth \nof this country, but also to those who are actually in Nepal in a time \nof need.\n\n[[Page H3246]]\n\n  I am so honored that they have lofty goals that they, I believe, will \nmeet--I plan to do my part--but I am also honored that they decided \nthat this was something that we could all embrace. They have reached \nout to the entire community, and the community has responded.\n  I beg my friends across all sides of the aisle, this is not a \nRepublican or a Democratic resolution--or bill, if you will. This is a \nbill, H.R. 2033, that already has bipartisan support. It is not about \nwhat part of the country you are from. It is not about how many people \nyou happen to represent from a certain community. It is about helping \nsomebody in a country that is in need of help.\n  I beg that my colleagues would sign on to H.R. 2033--those who have \nnot, many have indicated they will--so that we can bring this bill to \nthe floor of the United States House of Representatives. It is not \ngoing to cost us any additional money to bring it to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  It will not in any way grant any status to persons that they don't \nalready have. It will simply extend the period of time that they will \nbe allowed to stay in this country without having to return to harm's \nway.\n  I am grateful for the time today, Mr. Speaker. I do believe that this \nis time that has been well spent, and I do want to, as I close, let \nthose families who have friends and relatives who are serving in our \nmilitary or who are in Nepal, especially those who have family members \nthat were associated with the military and the loss related to that \nhelicopter crash, but also those who are with USAID and those there \nwith various other organizations that are in service and doing what \nthey do to make a difference, thank all of them for being there on the \nground.\n  I also heard someone representing our military this morning. When \nspeaking of those who are there as a part of that military effort and \nthose who lost their lives, there was a request for prayers. There was \na request that we would pray for those who are injured and those who \nhave lost their lives.\n  I believe in prayer. I do believe that it has a positive impact. I \nbelieve it can make a difference. I believe that there are times when \nthere are no answers available to people, when you cannot explain what \nhas happened, when the inexplicable is confronting you. At those times, \nmany people turn to prayer because prayer can provide what words cannot \nexplain.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Prayer can give you the hope that you need to go forward. Prayer can \ngive you the sense of I can, the belief that I will, the belief that I \nwill go on and continue to make a difference, that it is expected that \nI go on sometimes. People think that there is no more hope, and they \nshould just give up right here and right now.\n  Prayer can do marvelous things, so I am going to end with a prayer \nbecause I believe that the request should be honored from the military \nperson who made the request. Without knowing the name, I want you to \nknow that I appreciate that you indicated that we should pray for our \npeople in harm's way.\n  I will give this prayer from my heart, not from my head. I have no \npaper that I will be reading when I present this prayer. It is a prayer \nthat has been written across my heart for a time such as this, and I \npray, as I give this prayer, that it will be received with the \nintentionality that I will send it.\n  It is a prayer for all. Those who would like to can join me in your \ntradition. However you pray is okay with me. I will lower my head to \ngive this prayer, and I will close my eyes.\n  Most gracious Creator, we know You by many names, but we also know \nthat, by any name, You are the creator of all that was, is, and ever \nshall be, and we know that we are Your children, and as Your children, \nYou have given us the greatest gift that we could ever receive, the \ngift of life.\n  Regardless as to what we think of ourselves, we know, many of us in \nour hearts, that we are blessed beyond measure to simply have the gift \nof life.\n  We know that we are better than we deserve, simply because we have \nthe gift of life, because we cannot earn the gift of life. There is \nnothing that we could have done to earn it or merit the gift of life. \nIt is something that we get because of grace.\n  By Your grace, I stand here as Your servant, asking Your mercy for \nthose who are in harm's way in the nation of Nepal. I ask Your mercy, I \nask Your blessings for those who are reaching out and trying to do what \nthey can to help someone in a time of need.\n  I ask that You please strengthen those who are there who, tonight, \nmay find that they do not have shelter, but please give them some sense \nof belief that help is on the way.\n  Help them to believe that there are people in a distant place called \nthe United States of America who are people of good will who are going \nto do what they can to make sure that they get the shelter they need.\n  Please help those who may be suffering the pains associated with \nhaving been a part of a tragic circumstance and having been hurt \nphysically. Help those who are suffering to know that help is on the \nway, that we plan to make sure that they get the medical aid that they \nneed and the treatment that they need because You have given us so much \nand those who have so much, as we, should do as much as we can to help \npeople who have little.\n  I ask, gracious Creator, that You strengthen all of us in this House \nof Representatives so that we may continue to go forward to do Your \nwill to make Your world a better place.\n  We were given the precious gift of the life for a reason. There are \nmany reasons that may be cited, but I believe that we have been blessed \nwith the gift of life so that we may be a blessing to others.\n  This is our opportunity to be a blessing to others, and I beg and I \npray that we, who have received the precious gift of life, when we \nfinally, 1 day, have the opportunity to look back upon all that our \nlives stand for, perhaps we will, at some point in time, have an \nopportunity to see the omniscient, the omnipresent, and the omnipotent, \nand we will have an opportunity to tell and go over the record of our \nlives.\n  On that day, I hope that we will be able to say that we did all that \nwe could to help the people of Nepal.\n  We thank You for the gift of life, and we pray that we will use it \nwisely and well and make a difference in the lives of others.\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. God bless you, Mr. Speaker, and God bless the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3246-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3246-H3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING FALLEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Knight). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and pleasure to follow my \nfriend and fellow former judge from Texas when he talks about praying. \nI know him to be a praying man. I also know his heart to be a big \nheart.\n  We can disagree on issues, but he is a brother, as a Christian, and \nhe is a very good friend, and I appreciate his perspective very much.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the friend from the great State of \nTexas. He and I happen to share more than being Members of Congress. We \nare Members of Congress from the same State.\n  I am honored that you have not only worked hard in Congress, but you \nhave also been a part of activities outside of Congress, and I am \nhonored to work with you on at least one project, and we hope to do \nsome good for the great State of Texas on this project together.\n  I am grateful to you, and I am grateful for your kind words. Thank \nyou so much.\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I would never question the heart or motivation of my \nfriend Al Green. I know his heart to be bigger than most in Washington. \nIt is just an honor to serve with you.\n  There is so much that has gone on this week. One of the things that \nhas happened here in Washington and continues to happen today is a \ntribute, memorial to law enforcement officers who have lost their lives \nin the line of duty--doing what?--serving and protecting.\n\n[[Page H3247]]\n\n  After the horrors and evil of 9/11/2001, it was encouraging to me to \nsee so many people, once again, come to appreciate that the vast \nmajority of law enforcement, the vast majority of first responders, \nthey are serving and trying to protect for the good of others and \nwilling to lay down their lives.\n  As Jesus said:\n\n       No greater love is this than a man lay down his life for \n     his friends.\n\n  We have seen that in the hundreds of people--I think 273 lost their \nlives over this past year. Over 40 have lost their lives this year in \nthe line of duty.\n  Just like in any walk of life, there are bad apples, people who don't \nhave the best motivation; but I would humbly submit, I believe with all \nmy heart that, when it comes to law enforcement, the percentage of \nthose who are not properly motivated is far, far less than in the \ngeneral population.\n  We do owe them so much.\n  Some people say: Oh, well, we ought to just live and let live.\n  They say: I am a Christian. I believe in living and letting live.\n  If you note, if you believe the Bible, Jesus was commenting, of \ncourse, his ultimate point was that we will be judged for what is in \nour heart by our Father in heaven.\n  He said, if you say ``raca,'' which was an offense back in that day, \nthen you will answer to the courts. He understood, in an orderly \nsociety, you need a government; you need governing officials to which \npeople will be responsible if they violate the law.\n  That was also true in Romans 13, anticipating, in an orderly society, \nyou need a government with a sword to punish those who do evil. That is \nwhy 13:4 says: If you do you evil, be afraid, because God doesn't give \nthe sword in vain.\n  I know some people in the country start freaking out when I quote the \nmost quoted book in the history of the country, as quoted here in the \nHouse of Representatives and in the Senate floor. It is part of our \nhistory. The Bible is the most quoted book in congressional history--\nwas, is, and I hope will be in the future.\n  We owe so much to the police who risk their lives.\n  Right out of law school, I was an assistant DA for three counties in \neast Texas. Very early on, I went with law enforcement to execute a \nwarrant, and the individual, the subject of the warrant for arrest, had \nmade clear that, when he saw any law enforcement officers, he was going \nto start shooting; he would kill any law enforcement officer that came \nout there.\n  I don't forget the feelings that all of us had, even though some were \nvery seasoned law officers, when you are approaching a dangerous \nbuilding--in this case, a home--where somebody in there is threatening \nto kill anybody like you, you do have a little hair stand up on the \nback of your neck.\n  You do realize you are putting your life at risk in trying to \nmaintain order and civility by approaching somebody that is a threat to \nsociety. That was quite a lesson, that these law officers--whether they \nare new, whether they have been working for a long time--they are \nconstantly in a situation where they don't know if, 10 minutes later, \nthey may be dead in the service of their community, but they are \nserving anyway.\n  We do owe them so much for what they do and what they risk on our \nbehalf, so we are just grateful to all law enforcement officers willing \nto serve and protect all of us.\n  We have a report here back in February, and this is an article from \nThe Hill entitled: ``FBI investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 \nStates.'' The article is quoting FBI Director James Comey, that he \nrevealed Wednesday his agency is investigating suspected supporters of \nthe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in every State across the United \nStates.\n  Down further in the article, it said, ``Earlier this month, Comey \nsaid the FBI was investigating ISIS supporters in every State except \nAlaska.''\n  At the time of this article, at the end of February, he was saying: \nWe are investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 States.\n  Director Comey said: ``We have investigations of people in various \nstages of radicalization in all 50 States.''\n  He said: ``This isn't a New York phenomenon or a Washington \nphenomenon. This is in all 50 States and in ways that are very hard to \nsee.''\n  He said: ``ISIL in particular is putting out a siren song with their \nslick propaganda through social media.''\n  He said: ``The message `resonates with troubled souls, people seeking \nmeaning in some horribly misguided way,' '' and that ``those people \nexist in every State.''\n  His pronouncement in February should have been a siren song for \nAmericans to understand there are people who live among us who want to \ndestroy us and our way of life.\n  Then it was rather interesting--that was February 25. Less than 2 \nmonths later, there was an article put out, Judicial Watch indicated \nthat an ISIS camp was just a few miles from Texas, that Mexican \nauthorities confirmed that.\n  The article said: ``ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El \nPaso, Texas, according to Judicial Watch sources that include a Mexican \nArmy field grade officer and a Mexican Federal Police Inspector.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  ``The exact location where the terrorist group has established its \nbase is around 8 miles from the U.S. border in an area known an \n`Anapra,' situated just west of Cuidad Juarez in the Mexican State of \nChihuahua. Another ISIS cell to the west of Cuidad Juarez, in Puerto \nPalomas, targets the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming for easy \naccess to the United States.''\n  So, anyway, after this article came out in April, I quoted from that, \nbrought it up on the floor and--\n  Let's see. This article was 2 days later from FOX News: ``Islamic \nState fighters are operating training bases near the U.S. southern \nborder and are being aided by violent drug cartels to smuggle \nterrorists into States like Texas, a report published Tuesday by a \nwatchdog group claims.''\n  So, anyway, I brought that up. And this report seems to get even more \nlegs after the Federal Government, though, denying that any such thing \nlike that was occurring, apparently sent FBI officials to Mexico to \nmeet with their counterterrorism experts, seemed to give some credence \nthat there is something to be concerned about in the way of training of \nviolent radical Islamists across our United States border. So the irony \nhere is pretty profound.\n  People all across the United States of America just accepted when the \nFBI Director says, you know, there are ISIS suspects in every State in \nthe Union. People said: Wow, that is amazing. Man, they are here?\n  I saw a headline of a survey just moments ago on FOX News saying, 6 \nout of 10 Americans believe that there are terrorists in their \ncommunity. So how ironic that even the far left that turns a blind eye \nto radical Islam could be so accepting that, yes, there are radical \nIslamist terrorists in every State in the Union. And when Judicial \nWatch and Louie Gohmert quote from their material, quote other things \ngoing on to point out that there is a report that there is an ISIS camp \nacross our border, the left went nuts, saying how crazy Judicial Watch \nwas, how crazy I am for even mentioning this. There couldn't possibly \nbe an ISIS camp in Mexico.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope you see the irony here. They are saying, yes, we \nbelieve there are radical Islamist terrorists in every State in the \nUnited States, but there couldn't possibly be ISIS across the border \nwhere the drug cartels are.\n  And I haven't gotten a good explanation. Do they have so much faith \nand trust in the drug cartels' integrity that they would never \nassociate with radical Islamists? Is that what they are saying by their \ncynicism about ISIS being in Mexico? Because it is a bit intriguing.\n  But then again, some on the far left are educated way beyond their \nmeans--their mental capacity, at least--and so they have information; \nthey just can't process it effectively. Because anyone who can readily \naccept when the FBI Director says there is ISIS in every State in the \nUnion and we are investigating in every State in the Union radical \nIslamists--he doesn't use those terms because this administration \ndoesn't want to offend any radical Islamists that want to kill us. So \nwe don't use that term if you are in this administration, but I use the \nterm because it is accurate. They are radical Islamists.\n  So, anyway, it is just a great irony here.\n\n[[Page H3248]]\n\n  Then this is an AP story from this week: ``Minnesota men accused of \ntrying to join Islamic State ordered held, but may have other \noptions.''\n  And that is because U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, who wears a \ndark robe to match his intellect--he is the same guy that previously--\nthis is also a May 12 article by Patrick Poole. This is the same judge, \nMichael J. Davis, chief judge of the district of Minnesota--\n  This article from Patrick Poole says: ``A terror `deradicalization' \nprogram--established in the `Ground Zero' of terror recruitment, \nMinnesota's Twin Cities--has already failed after just a few months.\n  ``The program was established after a Federal court released 19-year-\nold terror suspect Abdullahi Yusuf to a halfway house earlier this \nyear. Federal prosecutors opposed Yusuf's release, but were overruled \nby'' this big-hearted, caring ``Federal judge''--at least big-hearted \nand caring about radical Islam, not so much about victims of radical \nIslam. But Michael J. Davis cares deeply about those who want to kill \nus.\n  So as the article says: ``Remarkably, Judge Davis said today in a \nseparate case of six men charged with trying to join the Islamic State \nthat he would be willing to consider `less restrictive options' than \ndetaining the men--just a day after Yusuf's re-arrest.''\n  That is because he decided that he was smarter and more capable than \nanybody else in America. He could deradicalize people who want to kill \nAmericans by just sending them through this program that he had helped \nwith or proved: Gee, we are going to get you reading good material that \nreally helps you see the wonder and glory of this country.\n  And then, of course, I, Judge Michael J. Davis, will be a hero to all \nof my leftist friends because I cared more for the criminal radical \nIslamists than I did for the victims. And the left loves that kind of \nthing.\n  ``Last May, Yusuf was arrested in Minneapolis airport while on his \nway of Syria by way of Turkey to join the Islamic State. One of his \naccomplices, Abdi Nur, did make it to Syria, and he now serves as an \neffective recruiter for the terror group.\n  ``Just last week, The Wall Street Journal reported on the program \nwith an article titled, `A Test Case for ``Deradicalization.' ''\n  ``The path of reform for Abdullahi Yusuf, a U.S. teenager who tried \nto become a radical Islamic soldier, passes through writings of Martin \nLuther King, Jr. readings of the U.S. Constitution, and discussions \nabout life and literature with a fellow Somali-American named Ahmed \nAmin.\n  ``Mr. Yusuf's attempt to travel to the Middle East last year helped \nlead authorities to six Minnesota men who were charged last month in \nconnection with a plan to join Islamic State abroad. The 19-year-old \nhas become a test case for whether Americans lured by Islamic extremism \ncan be deradicalized.''\n\n  Oh, I think they can, but I sure wouldn't trust them to Judge Michael \nJ. Davis, if that is what we want.\n  But see here again, this is once again pointing out the ingenuity of \nthe Founders in creating three branches. We have the executive branch \nthat is supposed to carry out the laws that the Congress, elected by \nthe people, pass. We have two Houses of Congress to make it more \ndifficult to pass laws. They wanted some obstacles and problems to \npassing legislation too quickly. And then we have the judicial branch \nthat will handle criminal cases, handle civil cases, handle review of \nactions to ensure their constitutionality.\n  And then we also have this part of the judicial branch, like five of \nthe Justices on the Supreme Court that decided that they wanted to \nmicromanage enemy combatants at Guantanamo. I thought it would have \nbeen a good idea to let them live over at the Supreme Court if they \nwant to micromanage them.\n  But then, also, this judge like Michael J. Davis in Minnesota who \ndecides, actually, he is not just judiciary; he is clairvoyant. He is a \nrehabilitative agent. He is everything to everybody, just the kind of \njudge you want. God in a robe.\n  So, anyway, he put Mr. Yusuf through these reading materials. And I \nwonder, though, if he was a bit surprised when Yusuf was arrested \nbecause he is not following the program, and he is not reformed. But \neven that does not prevent God in a robe from saying: You know what? \nBut these new terrorists that you have arrested, they are just a little \nmisguided. I hate to have them in jail because if they are in jail, \nthen the American people will be protected, but they won't be able to \ncome to see how wonderful people like I am. So I want them to develop \nwarm and loving, fuzzy feelings for people on the left, like me. So I \nwant to find some way we don't have to keep them in jail.\n  Anyway, there is another article about that.\n  But it is just amazing to me when people exceed the bounds of their \njob in government because they think they are wiser than the Founders. \nThey think they are wiser than anyone that has gone on before. We hear \npeople in recent days on the issue of marriage talking in terms of how \nmuch smarter and how much more we know today than the ignoramuses of \nthe past. And the ignorance that displays is pretty astounding.\n  Solomon, for those who believe the Bible, Solomon, considered to be--\nuntil he got sidetracked by having too many wives and concubines--was \nconsidered to be the wisest man in the world. And Solomon, credited for \nwriting some of the things in the Old Testament--the Old Testament, as \nwe call it--but in what we call Ecclesiastes, he points out, there is \nnothing new under the Sun.\n  You think socialism, communism is a new idea? It is not new. It has \nbeen around forever. And every time it has been tried, it leads to \ntotalitarianism. It leads to the loss of freedom, and then it fails \nbecause, as Margaret Thatcher once said, eventually you find out--well, \nyou run out of other people's money to spend. It doesn't work. It won't \nwork.\n  Now, that is different from socialized medicine, like ObamaCare is \ntaking us toward, government control. I have friends on the Republican \nside of the aisle who say, Louie, we won't have to worry. ObamaCare is \ngoing to fall of its own weight. The problem is government health care, \nsocialized medicine, it never falls of its own weight. Socialism does. \nIt can't survive because when you are paying people to not work the \nsame amount you are paying people to work, eventually you destroy the \nsociety. And we are in the process of doing that here in America, \npaying people to do things that are destructive to their well-being. We \nought to be incentivizing good conduct, not rewarding conduct \ndestructive to the individual and to the Nation.\n  But we continue down this path that has not been working for 50 \nyears, so hopefully people are going to eventually get the message.\n  But amidst this, this same week, I have a Wall Street Journal \narticle, ``Deadly Mexican Cartel Rises as New Threat.''\n  It should be noted--Carlos the Jackal, probably the most notorious, \nfamous assassin--had commented that he believed the only way to really \nbring down the United States would be for socialists and Islamists to \njoin forces, and that could be the successful force to bring down the \nUnited States. Interesting observation from an anarchist like Carlos \nthe Jackal. Interesting.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Anyway, Mr. Speaker, this article talks about the rise of the Mexican \ncartel and it says this in the second page of the article: ``The New \nGeneration cartel is perhaps Mexico's most audacious and vicious \ncriminal enterprise, after the government captured or killed most \nleaders of the Zetas gang based in northeastern Mexico, say officials \nand security analysts. Like the Zetas, originally formed by Army \ndeserters, the New Generation gang favors paramilitary methods and has \nreceived tactical training from Mexican and foreign mercenaries, these \npeople say, including the use of rocket-propelled grenades against the \nhelicopter.''\n  So, let's see, Mr. Speaker, this columnist said the helicopter \nincident was a declaration of war. The coming months are going to be \nvery hard in Jalisco.\n  You have got violence building on our southern border, but don't \nworry. Our Justice Department has been very\n\n[[Page H3249]]\n\nhelpful. We can't get documents because the Justice Department becomes \nan Injustice Department quite often in obfuscating--hiding documents, \nhiding the truth, preventing people from getting at the truth--and \nwon't provide the documents to me that they provided to convicted \nterrorism supporters in the Holy Land Foundation trial.\n  Oh, they sent me a couple Web sites I could visit. That was very nice \nand gracious of them. But basically they were covering up their tracks, \nbeing the most muddy--not transparent--Justice Department in my \nlifetime. That includes going back to the lack of transparency under J. \nEdgar Hoover when he became too enthralled with his power and began \nusing FBI agents to investigate people not for information to introduce \nin court but just to use, apparently, to persuade them to do what the \nFBI director wanted. Information like that is dangerous, and the \nFounders knew that.\n  Then there is another Wall Street article from May 14: ``FBI Says \nTexas Man Lied About Links to Syria.'' Imagine that, Mr. Speaker. They \ncatch somebody who they have evidence to show he has got links to \nterrorism in Syria, and, lo and behold, they found out not only does he \nhave links to terrorism but he may have actually lied to the FBI. \nImagine that. The article points out that ``Bilal Abood, 37 years old, \nof Mesquite, Texas, was arrested Thursday after a 2-year game of cat \nand mouse with Federal agents, who questioned him repeatedly before and \nafter he allegedly traveled to Syria in 2013.''\n  But anyway let's see. It says: ``A week later, agents interviewed him \nagain and he admitted he planned to go to Syria to fight with the Free \nSyrian Army, according to the complaint. Unlike terror groups, such as \nIslamic State and the Nusra Front, the moderate FSA''--Free Syrian \nArmy--``has received backing from the United States.''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, they received backing from this administration is \nwhat the bottom line is, not from all of us here because some of us \nhave been saying that this administration is providing weapons to the \nIslamic State. They were providing weapons to the so-called vetted \nmoderate Free Syrian Army. Remarkably weapons that the Obama \nadministration was providing to the vetted moderate Syrian Army kept \nending up in Islamic State hands. And they were, Oh, gee, they raided, \nthey took this stuff, they took the weapons, send us more. Well, the \nObama administration wised up about 4 months. They suspended weapons \nshipment to the vetted moderate Free Syrian Army. But then, not to \nworry, they eventually started back sending weapons to the vetted \nmoderate Free Syrian Army even after their leaders were saying, Yeah, \nwe may disagree with the Islamic State on the leader, Assad, the leader \nin Syria, but we are brothers, and we do line up on most issues.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note terrorism is alive and well \nin the world, and this administration has done very little to stop it, \nhas turned a blind eye to it, and we have got to do all we can to help \nthem wake up and smell the gunpowder coming from radical Islamists.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/15/house-section/article/H3249-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Michael F.
