The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 4 weeks \nsince President Obama visited my district in Charleston, West Virginia, \nto discuss the ongoing drug epidemic that is plaguing my State.\n  West Virginia has the highest overdose rate in the country, with 29 \nout of every 100,000 people each year dying from drug overdoses. This \nis an issue that affects all West Virginians.\n  We all know someone who has been addicted or has been directly \naffected by drug abuse. Drug addiction knows no boundaries. It affects \nthe young and the old, the rich and the poor, the Black and the White. \nThat is why we have to do everything we can to fight back.\n  We have to help coordinate efforts on the Federal, State, and local \nlevels. One of the best ways to ensure that we have a cohesive strategy \nis to work with the HIDTA program, also known as the High Intensity \nDrug Trafficking Area.\n  The HIDTA program was created by Congress to provide assistance to \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement agencies operating in areas \ndetermined to be high drug-trafficking regions of the United States.\n  The purpose of the program is to reduce drug trafficking and illegal \ndrug production in the United States by doing the following:\n  First, facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies to share information and implement coordinated \nenforcement activities;\n  Second, enhancing law enforcement intelligence sharing;\n  Third, providing reliable law enforcement intelligence to law \nenforcement agencies needed to design effective enforcement strategies \nand operations;\n  Fourth, supporting coordinated law enforcement strategies which \nmaximize use of available resources to reduce the supply of illegal \ndrugs in designated areas and in the United States as a whole.\n  One of the counties in my district, Jefferson County, has recently \napplied to the HIDTA program. It is imperative that Jefferson County \nbecome a designated area.\n  On August 6, I sent a letter along with my colleagues in West \nVirginia, Congressman David McKinley and Congressman Evan Jenkins, to \nMichael Botticelli, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, urging him to make Jefferson County a HIDTA area. It is of the \nutmost importance to include Jefferson County as a Washington-Baltimore \nHIDTA-designated county to help combat the growing drug epidemic not \nonly in our State, but also in our entire country.\n  Jefferson County is dangerously close to three major drug markets: \nWashington, D.C., which is 60 miles away, right here; Baltimore, which \nis 70 miles away, here; and Philadelphia, which is 171 miles away. Our \nInterstate Highway System directly links all three areas to Jefferson \nCounty, and a traveler can reach both D.C. and Baltimore in a little \nmore than an hour, making it incredibly easy to bring drugs into our \ncommunity.\n  There is also a large number of tourists that visit Jefferson County \neach year. It is estimated that around 4.3 million visitors come to \nJefferson County annually to visit a number of tourist attractions, \nincluding the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, eight historical \nhomes of President George Washington's family, Charles Town racetrack, \nShepherd University, and many others. While Jefferson County greatly \nbenefits from a large number of tourists, it is a growing concern that \nthe ratio of police to visitors is growing too wide.\n  The most dramatic reason for Jefferson County to become a HIDTA is \nthe high drug use statistics of the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. \nCocaine use the past year is 16 percent above the national average, and \nnonmedical use of pain relievers is 15 percent above the national \naverage. Illicit drug use other than marijuana in the past month is 27 \npercent above the national average.\n  It is time to act now before the situation in the eastern panhandle \nof West Virginia becomes grimmer. Jefferson County needs to be \ndesignated as a HIDTA county.\n\n[[Page H8246]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8246-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   THE AFTERMATH OF TERRORIST ATTACKS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we are all horrified by the barbaric \nattacks in Paris designed to slaughter innocent people and inspire \nterror. We stand with the French people and are all committed to \nredoubling our efforts to ensure we keep Americans safe and intensify \nour efforts to eradicate these evil, sinister forces that appear almost \nto be a different species.\n  It is important, however, that we think through clearly where we are, \nwhat we have done, and what makes sense going forward to protect \nAmericans and redouble our efforts against this enemy. We must not jump \nto conclusions and do something before it is carefully planned and \nanalyzed.\n  I was here in the aftermath of the horror of 9/11, the killing of \ninnocent Americans in the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, and but for the \nbravery of passengers on United Airlines flight 93, we might well have \nhad our Capitol destroyed.\n  The Federal Government acted after 9/11, but it is not clear our \nactions were thought out the way they should. We assembled a clumsy \nbehemoth, the Department of Homeland Security, the largest department \nwe have created since 1947. In retrospect, it is not clear that was the \nwisest course of action. Think about the excessive bureaucracy, charges \nof waste, fraud, and inefficiency in that department. Look at the \nclumsy response to Katrina.\n  We passed the PATRIOT Act instead of the bipartisan legislation \nproduced by the Committee on the Judiciary. Look at the vast, \nsprawling, shadowy intelligence network, so large nobody actually knows \nprecisely how big it is. Remember, the failure of 9/11 to stop the \nattack was not for lack of intelligence. It was a failure to be able to \nuse the knowledge we have. There is a danger at times of drowning in \ndata.\n  The impulse to lash out led to the disastrous war in Iraq. The \naftermath of that effort has done more to empower ISIS. It not only \ndrew people to the movement, but we created a space where they can \noperate, grow, and lash out at us.\n  Now we hear what can only be described as crazy talk in the \nRepublican Presidential primaries not just about sealing the borders, \nbut having a religious test for refugees fleeing terror.\n  Remember, the 9/11 attackers did not sneak across the borders, but \nexploited weaknesses in our visa system. Even in Europe, it appears \nthat most of the people involved with the attack did not sneak in, \nhidden with Syrian refugees. They were actually people already in \nEurope, radicalized and moving freely about.\n  It is appropriate to be concerned, angry, and determined to protect \ninnocent people, to hunt down and eliminate these horrific threats. I \njust hope that we learn from our past mistakes about impulse and \noverreach that may not produce its intended results but, instead, may \nleave us with more problems and vulnerability.\n  Remember how a college dropout was able to expose vast amounts of \nsensitive American data. Edward Snowden had been a private contractor \nwho had worked for the government just a few months.\n  Working in a highly charged political environment does not tend to \nbring out the best in Congress. We need to be careful about getting \nthis right, that we have the support of the American people, and that \nCongress in a really frustrating time in American politics takes the \ntime and energy to craft effective action. Let's try and get on the \nsame page rather than a rapid response, which history shows is not \nnecessarily the right response.\n  Decidedly, turning our back on Syrian refugees is un-American, \nunpatriotic, and morally weak. Turning our back on an entire population \ndue to broad-brush characterizations of those who practice a certain \nfaith goes against our core values as a country. I think America is \nbetter than that.\n  Seeking compassion for Syrian refugees can be done securely. The \nfacts make that clear. A failure to do so would put us on the wrong \nside of history. It would be one of those mistakes we make under \npressure and would only make us less safe rather than more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8246-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REFORMING CFPB INDIRECT AUTO FINANCING GUIDANCE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong \nsupport of H.R. 1737, the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing \nGuidance Act.\n  Businesses across West Virginia's Third District are already facing \nhardships from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rules. Those \nbusinesses that make, sell, finance, or service motor vehicles in my \nState are especially worried about the CFPB's 2013 rulemaking affecting \ntheir industry.\n  The 2013 rule could raise credit costs and push consumers out of the \nmarketplace entirely. It should be consumers, not government \nbureaucrats, deciding what works best for them.\n  This bill would rescind that flawed rule and replace it with \ncommonsense guidance for transactions related to indirect auto \nfinancing. The bill would give consumers, especially those with low and \nmoderate incomes, a chance to receive the best financing options \navailable for them to purchase a new auto vehicle.\n  I fully support passage of this bill and hope we can continue to work \nin a bipartisan fashion to reform CFPB rulemaking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8246-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8246-H8247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REACTING TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, we are shocked, horrified, and deeply \nsaddened by the news coming from Paris. As a member of the Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, I know there is much to fear, both \nfor our allies and for us.\n  But in light of the attacks on our ally France last Friday, I urge my \ncolleagues to keep a cool head and not to react exactly the way that \nISIS and other terrorists hope we do, with fear, with chaos, and with \nlashing out. But, sadly, that is what we have already seen Republican \nGovernors, elected leaders, candidates, and media figures do.\n  I have been here long enough to know a thing or two about \nopportunism. Maybe it is too much to resist when you are one of 15 \ncandidates for President of the United States. Politicians, pundits, \nand celebrities will be tempted to say whatever they can to get the \nnews cameras pointed at them.\n  The Governor of Illinois, my home State, could not resist saying our \nState was closed to Syrians fleeing the terror of ISIS and the Assad \nregime. The Governor of Louisiana, the son of immigrants, running for \nPresident of the United States, a nation of immigrants, said ``no'' to \nrefugees. The Governors of a dozen other States did so, too. A Senator \nwhose parents came as refugees from Cuba fleeing there has said ``no,'' \ntoo.\n  This is despicable and cowardly and precisely the kind of reaction \nISIS wanted. ISIS could not have written a better script. The free \npeople of the world are turning their backs on people seeking safety \nand freedom. When we sent Jews back to Germany and when we sent \nJapanese to internment camps, we regretted it, and we will regret this \nas well.\n  We have had candidates actually say that refugees seeking safety in \nthe strongest nation in the world must first pass a test to prove they \nare from an acceptable religion. In the United States of America they \nsaid this. In the 21st century. An acceptable religion in America.\n  Now, of course, the Governors of Illinois, Texas, and Louisiana, and \nmost of the other States that are scared of ISIS, are Republican. \nBecause it is a Federal matter, they are overstepping their powers with \nexecutive orders because they cannot actually stop refugees from \nresettling in their States, and they know it. How sad.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Instead, they have instructed State agencies not to assist people \nfleeing terror. We are a better country than that.\n  No matter how scared Republican leaders become, we must not abandon \nour commitment to being a nation\n\n[[Page H8247]]\n\nwithout equal in a world, a nation that does not fear or shy away from \nany challenge. It is our commitment to religious equality and the \nfreedom to worship as we please that has made us a great nation. And \nthis is no time to abandon that tradition.\n  Our bravery, the bravery of our military, and the bravery of our \ncommitment to freedom and equality have shown for almost 250 years what \nAmerican exceptionalism is truly all about.\n  It is not the time to lose sight of ourselves and say America is too \nweak, that America cannot handle 20,000 or 200,000 refugees fleeing for \ntheir lives. It is not the time for America to consider raising the \nwhite flag and say to those waving the black flag: ``Yes, ISIS, you are \nright. We dislike and fear Muslims, and we do not care if you perish or \nnot.''\n  A lot of us love this country too much to see it abandon core \nprinciples and values because religious extremists commit acts of \nterror designed precisely to terrorize us.\n  On Thursday, the Immigration Subcommittee will hold a hearing on \nrefugees from Syria and the Middle East, as well it should, but you can \nalready imagine what we will hear. Republicans will most likely raise \nfears that Muslim terrorists disguised as refugees would somehow pass \nexhaustive criminal background checks because they have been lying in \nwait in those camps overseas for years on the slim chance they could do \ndamage to America. They will raise suspicions, instill fear of Muslims, \nmaybe even fear of a President they have been saying is a Muslim, and \nit will probably be a pretty sad display.\n  Let us as legislators, leaders, and patriots rise above petty \npolitics, rise above sectarian fears, and rise above the underlying \nlayer of xenophobia that often surfaces in this country at moments like \nthis throughout our history. And let us maintain America's commitment \nto being a beacon of hope for those fleeing oppression, violence, and \nintolerance.\n  A haven for the religiously persecuted, whether they are Buddhists \nfrom Tibet, Christians from Iran, or pilgrims from Europe, is who we \nare. We are a nation that lives by the motto: ``Out of many, one.'' We \nwill not run in fear from that motto today or any day. This is America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8247-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL BOONDOGGLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as a Californian, I know full well that we \nare suffering from a record drought; but what we already know is that \nCalifornia officials pushing the State's high-speed rail proposal won't \nbe deterred by skyrocketing costs, an absence of private investment, or \nthe $55 million--and growing--funding gap. What we didn't know was the \nextent of secrecy and mismanagement taxpayers would face at the hands \nof State officials pushing this project.\n  Just this month, we learned that in 2013 the agency's main contractor \nprojected that the first phase's costs had risen 31 percent. This \ninformation was concealed by the High-Speed Rail Authority and only \nreleased 2 years later after pressure from Congress.\n  While the lack of transparency is unacceptable, especially given that \ntaxpayers are ultimately on the hook for this project, the fundamental \nissue here is that the entire project is a ruse--in literal terms, a \ntrain wreck--in that State officials knew this for some time and that \nthose same officials hid this from the public.\n  In 2008, voters were promised an 800-mile system that would link \nSacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, cost about $34 \nbillion, and would have less than one-third of the costs paid by the \nState through its taxpayers. The system was promised to travel from San \nFrancisco to Los Angeles in under 2 hours and 40 minutes.\n  Fast forward to 2011 when the price had shot up from $34 billion to \n$100 billion, the plan was reduced to only L.A. to San Francisco, and \nthe State was quick to grab billions of--unknown at the time--Federal \nstimulus that came along later, funding that could have been used for \ncritical needs like roads or water infrastructure that California needs \nso desperately, as well as now shifting cap-and-trade dollars recently \ncreated to try and prop up high-speed rail and its deficient budget \ndollars.\n  As a State senator at the time, the first bill I introduced was one \nthat would require them to come up with the ultimate full plan of the \ncost of doing high-speed rail. Having not succeeded in getting that \nthrough a majority that still liked it as it was, my next legislation \nwas to say, now that we know this is over $100 billion, let's put this \nback on the ballot and in front of the voters, since the price has \ntripled and they were deceived at what it would cost at the time. That, \ntoo, met defeat, as those in the majority still wished to continue this \nboondoggle.\n  Today, the Governor claims the price has fallen to $68 billion for \nwhat would be an illegal system, based on what the voters passed under \nProp 1A. However, the estimate ignores the costs of tunneling through \nthe Tehachapi Mountains, ignores cost spikes in the initial \nconstruction segment, and ignores the rising costs of lands acquisition \ndue to people having to fight because they are having their homes, \ntheir farms, and their small businesses paved over by this project.\n  The promises made in 2008 ranged from low ticket prices to \nquestionable job figures, including the fact that they were claiming \nthere would be a million new jobs from high-speed rail. When we pinned \nthem down in committee a little bit later, they said, well, that would \nmean a million job-years. That number has since been pared down. All \nthese have been proven false. In fact, these claims are so misleading \nthat a State court has forbidden the legislature from writing ballot \nmeasure descriptions.\n  Earlier this week, I sent out a survey to residents in my weekly e-\nnewsletter to constituents in California's First District, my own \ndistrict, asking them to share their thoughts on high-speed rail as it \nis now. I listed a number of suggested actions we could take on high-\nspeed rail, from leaving it as is to defunding it, and asked which best \nrepresents our constituents' position on the project now.\n  Of the nearly 1,600 answers we received, their views are pretty \nclear. Nearly half of them said they thought funding for high-speed \nrail should be redirected to invest in water storage and water \ninfrastructure to help our State right now in this drought.\n  About 20 percent thought the State should subpoena the cost documents \nand require High-Speed Rail Authority officials to testify why the \nfigures were concealed. Approximately 18 percent thought California's \nhigh-speed rail should undergo Federal investigation in response to \nthese allegations, given that the project involves the use of Federal \nfunds. A scant 7 percent thought we should keep going forward with \nhigh-speed rail and believed the current price tag is a worthwhile \ninvestment of public funds. Lastly, 4 percent supported investing in \nhigh-speed rail, provided the project stayed within the old \nconstraints, the old prices--the ones they saw on the ballot. So, at \nbest, you see 11 percent that might support high-speed rail and 4 \npercent that might under the old price, which is nowhere near what was \nprojected.\n  People don't like this project, don't trust those advocating for it, \nand they deserve better than to see their own tax dollars used to lie \nto them. No new Federal dollars will come from here to help this \nproject be propped up anymore.\n  It is time we start prioritizing funding for projects that actually \naddress real problems facing California, such as the current drought. \nIt is time to apply common sense to this situation. We have a State \nwhose economy depends on a sound water supply, yet in the midst of a \nhistoric drought, we are still chasing this high-speed rail boondoggle.\n  Rather than throwing billions of dollars away, let's get to what \npeople demand and will help our economy and the people of California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8247-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8247-H8248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, when the average American wants to learn \nabout a policy, where do they turn for\n\n[[Page H8248]]\n\ninformation? Often, the answer is the 24-hour news cycle, often filled \nby talking heads and sensationalism; or, to social media and message \nboards, where anyone can post anything--credible or completely \nmisinformed.\n  The American public is no longer being informed by the likes of \nWalter Cronkite and Edward Murrow, and it is making our public debate \nincreasingly partisan, polarized, and misinformed.\n  What few realize or like to admit is that there is a way Congress can \nhelp elevate the debate and educate our constituents with neutral, \nunbiased, nonpartisan information from the Congressional Research \nService, or CRS.\n  For over 100 years, CRS has served as Congress' publicly funded think \ntank. Because they serve policymakers on both sides of the aisle, CRS \nresearchers produce exemplary work that is accurate, nonpartisan, and \neasy to understand.\n  Despite the fact that CRS receives over $100 million from taxpayers \neach year, its reports are not made available to the public. Instead, \nconstituents must request individual reports through a congressional \noffice. This has led to several undesirable consequences.\n  Well-connected lobbyists have the easiest access to these reports, \nunlike the average American. Second, while nonprofits make some reports \navailable online, there is no guarantee that they will remain available \nand up-to-date. And most outrageously, a small industry has sprung up \nreselling these reports for exorbitant fees. In other words, businesses \nare making a profit by selling publicly funded work, work that \nultimately belongs to the people.\n  Keeping these reports in the hands of Congress and beltway insiders \nis selfish and indefensible. I understand that allowing the public to \naccess these reports will not answer all the questions constituents \nhave about the work that happens on Capitol Hill, but it underscores \nthe broader need for increased transparency in Congress and government.\n  Public trust in government has reached historic lows, causing too \nmany Americans to simply give up on Washington and the mission of \ngovernment. The best way to rebuild the public's trust and promote a \nmore efficient and effective government is by furthering government \naccountability through increased transparency.\n  It is time to recognize that educators, students, media, and everyday \ncitizens deserve access to CRS reports and that this access gives our \nconstituents vital information about the issues, policies, and budgets \nwe are debating here in Congress.\n  That is why Congressman Lance and I introduced H. Res. 34, which \ndirects the Clerk of the House of Representatives to maintain a \ncentralized public database for nonconfidential CRS reports. This \nresolution gives the public tools to cut through the misinformation \nthey face, gives them access to something they are already paying for, \nand empowers the American people to hold Congress accountable for the \ndecisions we make.\n  The steps toward a more open and transparent government may seem \nmodest to some, but, in reality, they have a huge impact on how \ngovernment serves the people. The mission of government matters, and if \nwe are truly here to serve the people, then we owe it to them to \noperate in an open and transparent manner.\n  Let's give the public the information we are basing our decisions on. \nI urge my colleagues to stand up for transparency and accountability by \nsupporting H. Res. 34.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of \nthe efforts of the Susquehanna Economic Development Association's \nCouncil of Governments, otherwise known as SEDA-COG, in working to \nexpand the availability of natural gas in areas across central \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. Speaker, natural gas is not only produced right here in the \nUnited States of America, but it is also economical and versatile, with \nuses that range from home heating to cooking and drying clothes.\n  While Pennsylvania sits on one of the largest natural gas reserves in \nthe Nation, many areas of the State are unserved or underserved by \nnatural gas providers. Converting to natural gas can lead to big \nsavings for consumers who currently rely on other home heating fuels \nsuch as propane and oil.\n  To help address this issue, SEDA- COG's $160,000 pilot project will \nprovide natural gas to these areas in order to attract manufacturers \nand to give homeowners the option to connect. To do that, this \norganization has joined with gas suppliers such as UGI Utilities and \nColumbia Gas of Pennsylvania, starting with at least three projects in \ncentral Pennsylvania that will expand natural gas access to hundreds of \npotential users.\n  In addition, the project will focus on the sustainability of \ndelivering natural gas through ``virtual pipelines,'' where compressed \ngas would be delivered by a truck to be used by large commercial \nbusinesses located nearby.\n  If successful, SEDA-COG officials say that they could expand this \nmodel to fuel users connected by a small pipeline network, including \nresidential areas such as housing developments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend the innovative spirit of SEDA-COG and its \npartners, and I look forward to learning more about how these projects \ncould benefit other areas of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n              130th Anniversary of DuBois Business College\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of \nthe 130th anniversary of the DuBois Business College, which has several \ncampuses located in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District.\n  The college was founded in 1885 by a local businessman who recognized \na need for skilled businessowners, operators, and employees. The \nschool's original location was once known as the largest building in \nAmerica devoted exclusively to commercial education.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  In the many years since, DuBois Business College has expanded not \njust to a new location in DuBois, but also to include branch campus \nlocations in Oil City, Philipsburg, and Huntingdon.\n  Today the college has a student body of more than 400 and offers a \nvariety of associate's degree and diploma programs, all of which can be \ncompleted in less than 2 years. This provides a quick transition for \nstudents into the workforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome administrators and students from \nDuBois Business College to Capitol Hill today. I look forward to \ncongratulating them in person, and I wish them well in their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8248-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8248-H8249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RESTORATION TUESDAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today is Restoration Tuesday. I \nrise today to support voting rights for all Americans.\n  I was proud to stand alongside Members who support the restoration of \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 recently and to launch the \n#restorethevote legislative strategy. This national effort will help \nmobilize support for H.R. 2867, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of \n2015, a bill that I sponsored with Representatives Judy Chu and Linda \nSanchez to restore critical Federal oversight to jurisdictions who have \na recent history of voter suppression.\n  Since elections are held on Tuesdays, every Tuesday that Congress is \nin session, like today, we will declare it to be Restoration Tuesday. \nSo today I am speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives on \nthe need to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Our call for restoring the VRA is urgent, Mr. Speaker. As our \ncolleague John Lewis so eloquently says, there is no other work more \nimportant in this or any Congress than protecting the full access of \nall Americans to the democratic process.\n  If we do not act, the 2016 election will be the first Presidential \nelection in 50 years without the protections offered to millions of \nvoters by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We must act now.\n  I therefore urge all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, \nmy Republican and my Democratic colleagues, to\n\n[[Page H8249]]\n\njoin me on Tuesdays and speak in support of the Voting Rights Act and \nto sign onto the Voting Rights Restoration and Advancement Act of 2015, \nwhich restores key components of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Ultimately, this bill, H.R. 2657, will restore key components of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. The bill will provide more protection to \nmore people in more States. It is about broadening, expanding, \nadvancing the Voting Rights Act.\n  Nothing is more American than voting. So every Tuesday Congress is in \nsession we will be wearing the #restorethevote pin. The red, white, and \nblue pin is a symbol of our unwavering commitment to restoring the \nvoices of the excluded, ending discriminatory practices, and providing \ntransparency in the voting process.\n  Fifty years ago, in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting \nRights Act into law. His voice and his words still resonate today. The \nvote, he said, is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for \nbreaking down injustice.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was pivotal in preventing voter \ndiscrimination and preventing it from occurring across the United \nStates. The act gave millions of African Americans a voice, a voice \nthat has been heard throughout our Nation for nearly 50 years.\n  Now the Voting Rights Advancement Act will expand that not just to \nAfrican American voters, but to all voters. That is exactly what we \nshould be about. We should be about expanding voting rights \nopportunities so that all Americans are protected.\n  As a daughter of Selma, Alabama, I am painfully aware that the \ninjustices suffered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge 50 years ago have not \nbeen fully vindicated. As States across the country are passing laws to \nrestrict access to the ballot box, we are ever mindful that old battles \nhave indeed become new again.\n  The recent decision by the State of Alabama, for example, to close 31 \nDMV offices in majority Black counties in spite of Alabama's photo ID \nlaw is just one example of a modern-day barrier to voting.\n  The Supreme Court issued Congress a challenge in the Shelby decision. \nIt didn't say that pre-clearance was unconstitutional. Rather, it said: \nCongress, come up with a modern-day formula to address modern-day \nbarriers to voting.\n  Well, this example in Alabama of 31 DMV offices closing when indeed \nthe State requires a photo ID and a driver's license is the most \npopular form of ID is one example.\n  These counties that were discriminated against by this recent law in \nAlabama were the very counties where foot soldiers and activists like \nJimmie Lee Jackson and Jonathan Daniels died for the opportunity and \nthe right for others to vote. If Federal pre-clearance provisions were \nstill in effect, these DMV closings would not have occurred.\n  To restrict the ability of any American to vote is an assault on all \nAmericans' equal participation in our electoral process. No one \nbenefits when American voices are silenced at the polls.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud certain States like the States of California \nand Oregon, two States that are now automatically registering citizens \nwho request a driver's license to actually vote.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, on this Restoration Tuesday, I am asking all of my \ncolleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2867, the Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act, and I am asking all Americans to join us in our \nefforts for #restorethevote and #restorationtuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8249-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message in writing from the President of the United States was \ncommunicated to the House by Ms. Wanda Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8249-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HANFORD LAND TRANSFER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the opening of \nthe Manhattan Project National Historical Park, a significant part of \nwhich is in my Congressional District in the State of Washington.\n  Decades of successful cleanup efforts at the Hanford nuclear site \nhave come to fruition with the dedication of the historic B Reactor as \na part of this national park. The B Reactor was the world's first full-\nscale plutonium production reactor, helping our country end World War \nII and the cold war.\n  The new park will highlight the sacrifices and the contributions of \nthousands of workers who built the facility and the scientists whose \ngroundbreaking research played a critical role in the Manhattan \nProject.\n  More than 50,000 visitors have toured the site since 2009, and the \npark will attract thousands more to learn about our region's history. \nThe park will provide future generations with a unique educational \nexperience.\n  I applaud the efforts of the community who has worked for years to \nmake this national park a reality. I will continue to support the \nopening of additional sites for public access in order to preserve and \ntell the story of Hanford.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8249-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NOHEMI GONZALEZ AND THE ATTACKS ON PARIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the people of France and the people of \nthe United States have shared a common bond of liberty and equality for \nover 200 years. In the face of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, \nthat bond brings us now even closer in unity and in solidarity.\n  We stand with the French people as they mourn. We stand with the \nfriends and families of those who were killed, like Nohemi Gonzalez, a \nyoung California State University, Long Beach, student studying abroad \nin Paris.\n  We also stand with our Cal State, Long Beach, family in their \nmourning. Nohemi's death is a very personal loss for each and every one \nof us. It tears at the very bonds of fraternity that embrace every \nmember of our Cal State, Long Beach, family and the Long Beach \ncommunity.\n  Nohemi was a daughter, a friend, and a mentor. Just 23 years of age, \nshe was a vibrant student and what those who knew her have called ``a \nshining star.''\n  Nohemi committed herself to learning. She traveled across the globe \nto express and to explore her talents, her creativity, and the world. \nNow all that seems broken.\n  Yes, we grieve for Nohemi. But we also grieve for all the victims in \nParis. We grieve for their families, their friends, and all their loved \nones. We grieve for each and every one of them.\n  Today we are all part of the human family. As a family, we mourn \nNohemi Gonzalez, our shining star. But in our mourning, let us remember \nsomething very, very important.\n  This was not an attack on Paris, though Paris was the target. This \nwas not an attack on the French people, though the French people were \nthe target. This was an attack on what unites us, our shared humanity \nand our shared values of liberty.\n  In that humanity, in those values, we will find the strength to stand \nstrong in the face of senseless violence because, in the end, humanity \nthat unites us is what frightens those who would do us harm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8249-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8249-H8250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ISLAMIC EXTREMISM ATTACK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Yoder) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, America and her allies are under attack by \nIslamic extremism. The despicable act of terrorism the world witnessed \nover the weekend in Paris, France, serves as a stark reminder that the \nthreat posed by ISIS knows no borders.\n  French officials have indicated that at least one of the Paris \nattackers linked to ISIS was admitted into Europe as a refugee from \nSyria. Nevertheless, the administration has made it clear that, in \nspite of this, it will continue to seek to bring up to 10,000 Syrian \nrefugees to America in the coming year.\n  The President's refugee proposal places the interests of other \nnations ahead of the safety and security of the American people. \nBecause we are unable to verify whether the next\n\n[[Page H8250]]\n\nattacker is within their midst, we must halt the flow of any refugees \ninto the United States from Syria.\n  Mr. Speaker, in light of these attacks, now is not the time to open \nour borders to refugees from countries who wish to do our citizens \nharm.

It had been approved recently \nby John McHugh, our Secretary of the Army.\n  Master Sergeant Harlan has 18 years of service to our Nation, \ncarrying out tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. While on deployment for \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in 2007, a vehicle carrying Master Sergeant \nHarlan and a small transition team on combat control was suddenly \nstruck by an IED.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Harlan was knocked unconscious from the blast and suffered concussive \ninjuries from the attack.\n  Mr. Speaker, Master Sergeant Jack Harlan is a son of central Illinois \nand has served our country with valor.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and honor \nthe memory of Gunnery Sergeant Henry ``Hank'' Green. Hank passed away \non November 5 at the age of 95.\n  Mr. Speaker, Hank was one of the first marines to land on Guadalcanal \nas a member of the First Marine Raider Battalion known as Edson's \nRaiders. He was recognized for his bravery during the battle known as \nBloody Ridge in September 1942 when he took over a machine gun where \nhis closest friend had lost his life. Hank then laid siege throughout \nthe night firing at, in his words, ``anything that moved.''\n  During this heroic post, Mr. Speaker, Hank was wounded three times, \nand he was eventually awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Hank would go on to see combat in three more locations near the \nSolomon Islands before being discharged as a gunnery sergeant in 1946.\n  Upon his return home from war, Hank worked with his father-in-law at \nH Auto Parts in Canton, Ohio, where he grew the business into two \nvery successful locations. In 2002, Hank retired to Florida, first \nmoving to Fort Myers and then making his final home in St. Petersburg.\n  Mr. Speaker, Hank was a well-known and well-respected man who had an \ninfectious love of baseball. He served his country with distinction, \nmade a lasting impact on his community, and will be sorely missed by \nthe lives he touched.\n  May God bless Hank, his family, and friends.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to H.R. 1694, which was debated by this House under the \nsuspension of the rules yesterday.\n  H.R. 1694 purports to be about fairness to veterans. Well, Mr. \nSpeaker, there is nothing fair about pitting veterans against women- \nand minority-owned businesses for an already meager goal of 10 percent \nof Federal highway and transit construction contracts.\n  If the sponsor of H.R. 1694 really wanted to create a new veterans \npreference system at the Department of Transportation, he would have \nworked with Mr. Cummings and Ms. Norton when offered the opportunity to \ndo so over a year ago. If my colleague really wanted to create a new \nveterans preference system, he would have cosponsored legislation to \nestablish a specific and separate contracting goal for veteran-owned \nsmall businesses through the creation of a veteran-owned business \nenterprise program.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania has done neither. Instead, he chose \nto put forth legislation that threatens to inflict irreparable harm on \nthe entire Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program by opening it up \nto additional legal challenges and undermining its core purpose. The \nDBE program was created by Congress to combat discrimination against \nminority- and women-owned small businesses. It is and must remain \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest in order \nto withstand the Supreme Court's test of strict scrutiny.\n  While I support the sponsor's stated goal of helping veterans and, \nmore specifically, helping veteran-owned businesses compete for Federal \nhighway and transit construction contracts, I reject the notion that \nthe best way to do so is by undermining the Disadvantaged Business \nEnterprise program.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a zero-sum game. We do not need to pit these \ntwo constituencies--both of whom continue to suffer through \ndisproportionately high unemployment rates--against each other. We can \nand should help both veteran and disadvantaged businesses succeed.\n  That is why I joined Representatives Cummings, Norton, Brown, and \nBustos in sponsoring H.R. 3997, legislation that would create a new \nveteran-owned business enterprise program at the Department of \nTransportation that is wholly separate and apart from the existing DBE \nprogram. It is the better and more direct way of helping veteran-owned \nbusinesses compete for Department of Transportation contracts, and it \ndoes so without harming the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1694.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8250-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, President Obama needs to stop \nimmediately any flow of Syrian refugees into America. Top law \nenforcement officials have made it clear: We don't know who these \npeople are, and we don't have the capability to vet them. With last \nFriday's ISIS attacks in Paris that did include a Syrian refugee, this \nhalt is imperative.\n  We cannot allow terrorism to slip through the cracks. That is why I \nam a cosponsor of H.R. 3314, a bill to stop the admission of refugees \ninto the United States. We must do all we can to protect our homeland. \nStopping these people from coming here is the right and commonsense \nthing to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President has a duty to protect America. If he \ndoesn't stop risking our security, then we in Congress must make him \nstop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8251-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONDOLENCES TO FRANCE\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to express my \ncondolences and support to our allies in France after last week's \nattacks on civilians in Paris, an act that is undeniably the work of \ncowards.\n  Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, but there is \ncomfort in the knowledge that France will rebound, and we will continue \nto stand by their side. They are resilient. No act of terror can shake \nthe resolve of the French people to live free, and nothing and no one \nwill intimidate France from living prosperously.\n  I want the people of France to know the American people and this \nCongress stand in solidarity with you. I say this in full faith and \nconfidence to the cowards who plot against innocent civilians and the \nprinciples of freedom. No act of terror will usurp the principles of \nliberty, equality, and brotherhood.\n  In addition to France, innocent lives were lost in Beirut and \nNigeria. We have terrorist violence and killing all over the world. As \na member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a proud American, I \nstrongly believe we need to strengthen the international coalition in \norder to create a united front to combat terrorist forces that serve to \nundermine peace and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8251-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM STRIKES PARIS\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague \nfrom Illinois. This is certainly a bipartisan issue.\n  On Friday, the world watched in horror as Paris endured multiple \nmurderous attacks by Islamist radicals. My thoughts and prayers go out \nto the citizens of France, the oldest ally of the American people.\n  I know it is certain that the French values of liberty, equality, and \nfraternity will never weaken in the face of terror. President Francois \nHollande yesterday reminded the world that France is a country of \nfreedom.\n  In the last month of the global war on terrorism, Daesh, or ISIL, has \nmurdered 244 on a Russian jetliner, 41 have been murdered in Beirut, \nLebanon, and now 129 were murdered across Paris, with a direct threat \nto attack Washington and Rome. The President should change course to \neliminate safe havens for Islamist radicals.\n  Terrorists are trying to break our will with acts of cruel cowardice, \nbut they are mistaken. We will fight together to protect our values and \nto protect American families.\n  As co-chair of the French Caucus, and of French heritage, I \nespecially appreciate our friendship with the citizens of France.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism. France is the latest direct target in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8251-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING RON BROWN\n\n  (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California.

Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy \nheart that I rise today to honor the memory of a young, bright student \nwho was taken from this world far too soon.\n  Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old design student at California State \nUniversity, Long Beach, was one of the many innocent victims who were \ntragically murdered in the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday, November \n13, while she dined at a restaurant with three friends who were all \nstudents at California State University, Long Beach. She was in Paris \nfor a semester abroad, studying at the Strate College of Design.\n  Nohemi grew up in my district, in Whittier, and graduated from \nWhittier High School. She was a first-generation Mexican American \nstudent who was passionate about design and life. Nohemi was a talented \nstudent, a star in the design department, and she inspired and touched \nthe lives of many. In her own words, she was high-spirited, orderly, \nand self-driven. She had a bright future ahead of her.\n  I know it is not enough, and it will never be enough, but I hope that \nNohemi's family and friends can find some solace in the outpouring of \nlove and support from our community. We grieve for and with you.\n  At this time, I would like to ask my colleagues to take a moment \ntoday to honor Nohemi, the 131 other victims, and those who are in \ncritical condition still fighting for their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8252-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BRUCE DAYTON\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, Minnesota lost a leader, a philanthropist, \nand a pillar in the community with the passing of Bruce Dayton this \npast week. Many will remember Bruce for his role in taking the family-\nowned Dayton's Department Store public and turning it into Target, the \nmajor brand that we know today, but there were many more sides to \nBruce.\n  For one, Bruce was a long-time patron of the arts, donating more than \n$80 million and 2,000 works of art to the Minneapolis Institute of Art. \nI had the opportunity and privilege of serving as a trustee with Bruce \nat the Institute, where I saw his legacy of generosity. He also donated \nland to conservation efforts in our State. Bruce's civic-mindedness and \nbusiness visions are reasons why the Minneapolis Star Tribune said he \nhelped ``build a modern Minnesota.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the passing of Bruce Dayton is a loss for all of \nMinnesota, and I offer my condolences to Governor Dayton and everyone \nin the Dayton family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8252-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOLAR INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, since Congress passed the solar investment \ntax credit in 2005, solar installations have grown by 1,600 percent, \nAmericans have invested $72 billion in solar, and 8,000 businesses in \nall 50 States have created 160,000 jobs in the solar industry.\n  Much of this economic success story is due to the investment tax \ncredit, which is scheduled to expire at the end of next year. If the \ninvestment tax credit expires, the solar industry could see a 71 \npercent decline, needlessly costing the American economy 100,000 jobs.\n  This uncertainty is already affecting the market. Consumers need \nconfidence in the tax policy before they decide whether to make an \ninvestment into the solar industry. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nurging the Ways and Means Committee to expeditiously prioritize a long-\nterm extension of this critical, job-creating tax incentive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8252-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS\n\n  (Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania.

This event is an opportunity for Americans to \nreinvest in our communities by supporting our local businesses. Small \nbusinesses are the lifeblood of our local economies and a key to \nunlocking the American Dream.\n  As a former small-business owner, I know the value that small \nbusinesses bring to our local communities. My family owned and operated \nthe Nebraska Clothing Company in Omaha for generations. This experience \ntaught me the importance of the entrepreneurial spirit to our economy \nand our communities.\n  Nebraska is the proud home of over 166,000 small businesses. Nearly \nhalf of all working Nebraskans are employed by local companies.\n  Beyond the facts and figures, small businesses are essential to the \nhealth of our communities. Local companies have local ties.

Mr. Speaker, on Friday the world again was \nshocked and stunned when eight gunmen wreaked havoc on Paris, the City \nof Lights. The day before a pair of suicide bombings struck Beirut, and \ntoday we learned that the Russian passenger plane carrying 224 innocent \npeople that crashed last month was blown up using a homemade explosive \ndevice.\n  Violent extremism can't be contained in far-off places. It is a \ncancer that will inevitably spread across the globe, dividing our \nsocieties, undermining our personal security, and sparing none from the \ntrue definition of terror.\n  One year ago yesterday violent extremism touched my home State of \nIndiana. Abdul-Rahman Kassig, a 26-year-old humanitarian aid worker \nfrom Indianapolis, was mercilessly killed by the ISIS coward known as \nJihadi John.\n  Abdul-Rahman is exactly the type of person that ISIS is targeting in \nhopes of expanding their caliphate, an apolitical medical aid worker \ncommitted to treating the wounded and bringing some sense of relief to \nthe 7.6 million displaced Syrians in Lebanon and Syria.\n  The Islamic State's twisted ideology will not allow it to cease until \nour entire way of life is destroyed.

On that latter committee, he was my mentor. We \nfrequently collaborated.\n  Members across the political spectrum valued Tim as a cooperative, \ncongenial colleague, easy to work with, but not afraid to engage in \nvigorous debate or to take a courageous stand when the need arose.\n  Tim was known for his wit and good humor and his gift for friendship. \nHe had a remarkable ability to defuse any tense situation with humor. \nHe made me look forward to coming to the House floor each day, where he \ninvariably would have a good story to tell or a quip to make that \nbrightened the day, a quip that often cut to the heart of the matter we \nwere dealing with.\n  Tim was a treasured friend and colleague. I am grateful for his life \nand work, personally, and also on behalf of the institution in which we \nserved and the citizens on whose behalf he labored.\n  Lisa and I attended a beautiful service in Tim's honor last Saturday. \nWe extend our love and best wishes to his wife, Barbara, and the rest \nof his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8253-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8253-H8254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WE MUST KEEP THE A-10 JETS FLYING\n\n  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, it was recently reported that over 100 ISIS \noil tanker trucks were destroyed in Syria in an attempt to finally cut \noff the terrorist group's oil revenue. And what asset did we call on to \nefficiently and effectively get the job done? None other than the A-10 \nWarthog.\n  The mission took advantage of the A-10's unique and lethal \ncapabilities. The pilots employed their powerful 30-millimeter guns and \n500-pound bombs to obliterate the trucks.\n  Time and time again, we have seen the A-10's number called up to \nprotect us. Twelve A-10s were recently deployed to Turkey to strike \nISIS targets like these fuel trucks. A-10s are also deployed in Europe \nto deter Russian aggression and along the border with North Korea.\n  Despite the administration's persistent and flawed arguments for \nseeking to mothball this irreplaceable\n\n[[Page H8254]]\n\nasset, A-10s continue to demonstrate their value on the battlefield.\n  Now, when the world turns to us to destroy this dangerous and growing \nthreat, we turn to the A-10. It proves again that, until we have a \nsuitable replacement for this one-of-a-kind attack jet, we must keep it \nflying.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8254-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRESS MUST FUND THE GOVERNMENT\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule for consideration of two important measures. First, the \nresolution provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 1737, \nthe Reforming Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Indirect Auto \nFinancing Guidance Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Financial \nServices Committee, makes in order three amendments submitted to the \nRules Committee which were germane to the legislation, and provides for \na motion to recommit.\n  In addition, the resolution provides a closed rule for consideration \nof H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015. The rule \nprovides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair \nand ranking member of the Education and Workforce Committee, and \nprovides for a motion to recommit.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, the rule facilitates a conference with the \nSenate on reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nby replacing the text of S. 1177 with the text of H.R. 5, as passed by \nthe House, and provides for a motion by the chair of the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce to request a conference with the Senate.\n  Finally, the rule directs the Clerk to strike a provision from the \nreconciliation bill which was already enacted\n\n[[Page H8255]]\n\ninto law in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, facilitating \nconsideration of the bill by the Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1737 passed out of the Financial Services Committee \nby a vote of 47-10. It nullifies a guidance put forward by the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau which the CFPB was specifically exempted \nfrom making in the first place. In addition to the CFPB's disregard for \nits statutory limitation, the CFPB's methodology is severely flawed. \nAccording to a study by Charles River Associates, the CFPB's \nmethodology overestimates minorities by up to 41 percent, leading many \nto question the reliability of these results.\n  In addition, and more importantly to me, Mr. Speaker, the rule \nprovides for consideration of H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty \nAct of 2015. When Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act in \n1935, it specifically recognized all governments were excluded. \nSubsequent regulations and case law further recognized this exemption \napplies to territories, possessions, the District of Columbia, and \nState-operated port authorities. From the 1970s until 2004, the NLRB \nrecognized that tribal governments are exempt from the NLRA as \nsovereign governments. Unfortunately, in 2004, the NLRB decided to \nreverse 69 years of prior precedent and strip tribes of their ability \nof self-government.\n  In our first terms in Congress, Chairman Kline and I both worked to \ntry and restore the sovereignty this board had stripped away. While \nunsuccessful at that time, I am happy we are now able to rectify this \ninjustice.\n  H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act would unequivocally state \nthat tribal governments are not subject to the National Labor Relations \nAct. I respect my friends who hold different opinions, but in this \ncase, they are simply wrong. In the NLRB's 2004 decision, they made an \narbitrary distinction between commercial activity and government \nactivity. If you are a tribe and it is commercial activity, they said \nthe NLRB could regulate it. But that same standard isn't applied to any \nother government exempted from the NLRA, regardless of whether it \nengages in commercial activities or not. Their nature, as a government, \nprecludes their regulation under the NLRA.\n  Practically every county and city in this country has a golf course. \nMost States have a lottery. The National Park Service operates hotels. \nVirginia and other States sell alcohol. Many cities operate convention \ncenters. All of these activities are not regulated under the NLRA. It \nshould be the same with tribes.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this rule sets up a \nprocess for us to go to conference on an ESEA reauthorization. The last \ntime we considered an ESEA reauthorization was 13 years ago. It is far \npast time to reauthorize this critical program.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, on January 5, 2011, newly elected Speaker John Boehner \nannounced: ``To my friends in the minority, I offer a commitment: \nopenness, once a tradition of this institution but increasingly scarce \nin recent decades, will be the new standard . . . You will always have \nthe right to a robust debate in an open process that allows you to \nrepresent your constituents, to make your case, offer alternatives, and \nbe heard.''\n  What we were promised was openness, but what we got was absolutely \nthe opposite.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the breaking of a record, perhaps \nthe worst kind of record: this has officially become the most closed \nsession of Congress in American history. We are living it now.\n  Today marks the 45th closed rule in this session of Congress, and \nwith each new closed rule that the majority approves, we will break the \nrecord anew. Under a closed rule, no amendments are allowed on the \nHouse floor, which limits debate and silences half of the American \npeople who are represented by the minority of the House.\n  It is true that the trend toward more closed rules has been growing \nover the past 20 years under the leadership of both political parties, \nbut my Republican colleagues have taken the trend to new heights. The \nRepublican Congress, for example, passed more closed rules in 1 week in \nOctober of 2013 than in an entire year under Democrat control.\n  It is the work of the Rules Committee to report each rule that comes \nto the floor, and according to our statistics, in this session of \nCongress, the majority has chosen a closed rule more times than any \nother kind of rule.\n  Under this regime, the majority has wasted taxpayer money on their \nobsession with taking health care away from millions of people and held \nmore than 60 votes to repeal or dismantle ObamaCare. They have spent \nover $5 million of taxpayer money on a duplicative, politicized \nBenghazi special committee even after nine other House and Senate \ncommittees and one State Department committee had found nothing \nnefarious nor illegal. Benghazi was, yes, a tragedy, but it was not \na conspiracy. To continue with their wasteful, politicized special \ncommittees, they created a special committee to investigate Planned \nParenthood, even after grilling the president of Planned Parenthood, \nCecile Richards, for 5 hours in a hearing and the chairman later \ndeclared that no law had been broken.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what you get here for your taxpayer \ndollars.\n  While Americans are riding over rutted roads, traveling over unsafe \nbridges, using crowded and outdated airports, and our schools are \ncrumbling around our children, this majority insists on wasting \nmillions of dollars and our time not on governance, but on purely \npolitical goals. These distractions keep true regular order nothing but \na mirage. This is the work that we got under Speaker Boehner's promise \nof openness.\n  As it turns out, Speaker Ryan promised the same openness for his \ntenure. On November 5, 2015, just after taking office, he said to a \ngaggle of reporters: ``I want to have a process that is more open, more \ninclusive, more deliberative, more participatory, and that's what we're \ntrying to do.'' We have heard that before.\n  He even explained the importance of an open legislative process and \nsaid: ``So that every citizen of this country, through their elected \nRepresentatives, has the opportunity to make a difference. That is the \npeople's House. This is the branch of government closest to the \npeople.''\n  Will we get that openness? Today gives us very little reason for \nhope.\n  Let me remind us that while we may have a new hand wielding the \ngavel, no amount of good intentions can overcome the dynamics in the \nradical Republican Conference because it remains the same.\n  Mr. Speaker, for this body to function as the Founding Fathers \nintended, we need debate and we need openness. For our constituents to \nbe heard and for our institutions to thrive, we need debate and we need \nopenness.\n  Democrats have always been willing to provide the votes to move the \ncountry forward on any bill that would come to the floor, and I would \nlike to extend my well wishes to our new Speaker, Paul Ryan, and \nexpress again our willingness to work together for the American people, \nbecause that is why we have been sent here.\n  Let me mention, if I may, that today, when we are concerned about \nbringing refugees and immigration, that we have been begging for 2 \nyears or more for this House to take up an immigration bill, and the \nmajority has refused to do so.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not surprising I would differ from my good friend \non whether or not we have an open process here. Frankly, I think we can \nall point to times in the past where each of us believe the other has \nbeen less than open. I recall, during the Democratic majority, we \nliterally would bring appropriations bills to the floor with absolutely \nclosed rules, something that violates the tradition of this House.\n  In terms of this legislation, I hope I am forgiven, but again, I find \nvery little relevance of discussions of Benghazi and Planned Parenthood \nto this particular debate. I don't think it has anything to do.\n\n[[Page H8256]]\n\n  The legislation in front of us really deals with two bills: H.R. \n1737, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau bill, actually seeks to \nsimply restrain an agency from exercising authority that it is \nprohibited from exercising under the legislation, and all the \namendments that were germane to that piece of legislation were indeed \nmade in order.\n  H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, frankly, is just simply: \nDoes the NLRB have this jurisdiction or not? It doesn't take a lot of \namendments. It is just a straight question. Our assertion is, \nobviously, that it does not. It has claimed authority it should not \nhave, and we are simply restoring that to tribal governments.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  So I actually think the rule in question facilitates the debate, \nallows those who have different ideas to present them if they are \nrelevant, and I think we will end up with a good result.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the \nrule to bring up H.R. 430, a bill to clean up the secret money in \npolitics and give the American people the fair and transparent \npolitical system that they deserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen), to discuss our proposal, the \nranking member of the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee, who began the discussion here by pointing out that here we \ngo again. We say there is new leadership in town on the Republican \nside, but it is the same old closed process: closed rule, limit \ndemocracy, don't allow a full debate, and don't allow the people's \nHouse to decide on important questions for the country. When you have a \nclosed rule, you are starting to close down democracy; you are limiting \nthe ability of this House to make decisions on behalf of all the \nAmerican people.\n  So we have, as part of the previous question, if you defeat the \nprevious question, a proposal to also improve transparency and openness \nin the full political process, because this is the people's House, and \nwe would hope that it would do the people's business. But we also know \nthat there are a lot of special interests out there that are spending \nmillions and millions and millions of dollars trying to get their way \nand substitute their special interests for the public interests. They \nare spending millions of dollars to try to elect candidates who will do \ntheir bidding.\n  What this proposal does is just say we need to be transparent and \nopen about who is spending all that money. People in those interests \ncan continue to spend money to try and elect candidates, but don't do \nit secretly. Do it openly.\n  So what we are asking is for this House to take up what is called the \nDisclose Act. The Disclose Act simply says that voters have a right to \nknow which special interests around the country are spending millions \nand millions of dollars to try to influence their voting decision, \nbecause we believe that sunlight and transparency helps build \naccountability and that accountability helps build a stronger \ndemocracy.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  So after the Citizens United decision, that terrible decision, what \nhappened? Special interests were able to spend millions and millions of \ndollars at a time. They weren't constrained by any limits on what kind \nof contributions they could make. So we got a lot more money, but we \nalso got something else. We got essentially a political underground in \nspending. We had this system now where people try and channel their \nmoneys in secret ways to hide themselves from the public.\n  So if we get to vote on the Disclose Act, we will see where we stand \non the simple question of whether this body supports transparency, \nbecause, honestly, if you have got nothing to hide, you have got \nnothing to fear.\n  Right now we have these commercials out there. They say, ``Paid for \nby Committee for a Better America,'' ``Paid for by mom and apple pie,'' \nbut the people who are paying for them don't want the voters to know \nwho they are. They want it to be a closed process. We are asking that \nthey disclose their identity.\n  In fact, in the Citizens United case, eight of the nine Supreme Court \nJustices said they were for more disclosure. And, in fact, recently, \nJustice Kennedy, who was one of the five in the 5-4 majority, said that \nthe disclosure that he thought would work is not working. But they said \nthe legislature can always act on this issue and improve the \ntransparency and disclosure of the political process. Even Justice \nScalia said that would be good for the political process.\n  We want to know who is spending all that money to try and influence \ndecisions of the people's House. What is wrong with a little sunshine? \nWhat is wrong with transparency? Doesn't that improve accountability, \nand doesn't that strengthen our democracy?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  I understand that we are going to continue to have these closed rules \napparently that are not going to make this an open process here, but \nfor goodness' sake, Mr. Speaker, let's at least allow the American \npeople to know who is spending all that money to try to influence \nvoting decisions and, ultimately, influence the kind of legislation \nthat comes to the floor of this House, because we need to be focused on \nthe people's business, not the business of secret special interests.\n  Let the sunshine in. Let's allow transparency. Let's defeat the \nprevious question so that we can vote on the Disclose Act and give the \nvoters the right to know that they deserve.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the debate so far because my good \nfriends on the other side said absolutely nothing about H.R. 1737 and \nH.R. 511, so I assume that they support these bipartisan pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Just to reiterate, with all due respect to my friends, we are not \nhere to talk about campaign finance reform, always a worthy subject of \ndiscussion. I remember a number of years bringing up campaign finance \nreform, trying to get rid of taxpayer subsidies for political \nconventions. We finally got that done and redirected that money to \nresearch for pediatric diseases but could never get it made in order \nwhen my friends were on the other side of the aisle, so I understand \nthe frustrations. But again, we have got two important bills to \nconsider, and I think that is where we ought to focus our attention.\n  In H.R. 1737, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has literally \ngone beyond the mandate laid out in Dodd-Frank. So I must say I am \nmystified that I am up here defending a provision of Dodd-Frank, but in \nthis case, it is actually the right thing to do. They have tried to \nextend their authority into auto lending, which is specifically \nprohibited under the statute, so we are trying to make that crystal \nclear.\n  H.R. 511 does something that, frankly, this House can be very proud \nof. It recognizes and extends and restores tribal sovereignty in a very \nimportant area. That has actually been an area of bipartisan \ncooperation.\n\n  We worked together in the Violence Against Women Act across party \nlines to extend tribal sovereignty with respect to domestic crime and \ndomestic violence committed by non-Indians on Indian land against \nIndian citizens. Now we are trying in the labor area to once again \nrestore tribal sovereignty to what it was before 2004 when the National \nLabor Relations Board, frankly,\n\n[[Page H8257]]\n\nacted outside of its authority and seized jurisdiction it simply \ndoesn't have under any statute ever passed by Congress.\n  I would invite my friends to focus on those two areas, hope they do, \nand certainly look forward to working with them in a bipartisan manner \nto pass both of those bills.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In closing, it really is a shame that the only way we can talk about \ncampaign finance is to put it in our previous question because it is \nnever a subject for debate here. That really is a shame because we have \nterrible situations going on in campaign finance unaccounted for, which \nis something that we have never had before in this country, certainly \nsince the Watergate issue, where we cleaned up campaign finance \nconsiderably and did well with it. But now all that is gone and \nanything goes.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule we are doing today strikes a provision of the \nreconciliation bill that the House passed last month in the latest \nfutile Republican attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act. This \nprovision is unprecedented, is unacceptable, and we oppose it. The \nstricken provision eliminates an auto enroll requirement that employers \nwho offer health insurance automatically enroll new employees in the \nhealth plan. The rule strikes this provision from the reconciliation \nbill because it became law as part of last month's bipartisan budget \nagreement.\n  My Republican colleagues may describe this as a simple housekeeping \nmeasure, but no matter what is done, the reconciliation bill will not \nbecome a serious piece of legislation.\n  The bill passed by the House would add 16 million people to the ranks \nof the uninsured, would increase health insurance premiums by up to 20 \npercent for millions of others, and would reduce women's access to \nimportant health services by ending Medicaid funding to Planned \nParenthood clinics.\n  The best piece of housekeeping that Congress could do on the \nreconciliation bill is to set it aside and put an end, once and for \nall, to this fantasy of repealing affordable health coverage for \nmillions of Americans. Instead, let us focus on the policies that \nactually help American families, such as improving access to education \nand to good-paying jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that people paid some attention to this debate \ntoday. There is so much going on in the House that one wonders if we \nhave.\n  Let me just reiterate that this is the most closed Congress in \nhistory. At every turn, the majority has chosen to shut out debate and \nsilence the will of Members. We have heard again this morning the \nminority party, our constituents, and the democratic process itself are \nailing, Mr. Speaker, and we must do something about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and to defeat the previous \nquestion so that we can take up Mr. Van Hollen's good measure here and \ntry to clean up, as even the members of the Supreme Court who voted to \ngive us Citizens United would like to see us make some change there \nbecause they recognize that what they did has been a complete failure. \nSomehow they had this awesome wonderland idea that everybody would just \ncontinue to put their name down on their contributions, and we have \ncertainly found that that is not the case. We don't even know what \ncountry a lot of the money is coming from.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question and also to vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat mystified by the debate that my friends on \nthe other side have offered. It has got a lot to do with campaign \nfinance reform. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the legislation \nbefore us that deals with that.\n  I beg to differ in terms of whether or not the rules here are closed \nor inappropriate. Frankly, every amendment offered to H.R. 1737 that \nwas germane was actually made in order; and, frankly, amendments on \nH.R. 511 simply aren't necessary. It is a yes or no type of question. \nEither the NLRB has jurisdiction that we think it has claimed \ninappropriately over Indian tribes and labor matters or it does not, \nand we think that clarifies things considerably.\n  So again, we also are a little bit surprised to see what we do think \nis a housekeeping matter in terms of striking something out of the \nreconciliation bill objected to. I just remind my friends they voted \noverwhelmingly for the budget deal itself that included that measure. \nThere is nothing untoward going on here. We are just trying to move \nforward legislation that we think is important and remove things that \nhave already been enacted into law. So it is, indeed, as suggested, a \nhousekeeping matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support \nthe rule. H.R. 1737 undoes a regulation that should never have been \nmade in the first place, and H.R. 511 restores a right, the right of \nself-governance, that should have never been taken away from tribal \ngovernments.\n  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:\n\n    An Amendment to H. Res. 526 Offered by Ms. Slaughter of New York\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     430) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \n     provide for additional disclosure requirements for \n     corporations, labor organizations, and other entities, and \n     for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on House Administration, the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary, and the \n     chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways \n     and Means. After general debate the bill shall be considered \n     for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order \n     against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion \n     of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee \n     shall rise and report the bill to the House with such \n     amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments \n     thereto to final passage without intervening motion except \n     one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the \n     Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to \n     no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day \n     the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of \n     business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the \n     Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 430.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the\n\n[[Page H8258]]\n\n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adopting House Resolution 526, if \nordered, suspending the rules and passing H.R. 1694 and H.R. 3114.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 245, \nnays 178, not voting 10, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No.

The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and \nthe gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 511.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Tennessee?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 511, the Tribal \nLabor Sovereignty Act of 2015. There are more than 550 federally \nrecognized Native American tribes across the United States. Each of \nthese tribes has a unique history and distinct culture that have helped \nshape who they are today. And each tribe has an inherent right to self \ngovern, just like any other sovereign government does.\n  That right is rooted in the Constitution and has been reaffirmed by \ncourts for almost 200 years. Because of it, tribal leaders are able to \nmake decisions that affect their people in a way that makes the most \nsense for their tribe and best protects the interests of their \nmembers--or, rather, they should be able to make those decisions.\n  We are here today because, for the past 10 years, the National Labor \nRelations Board has ignored longstanding labor policy and involved \nitself in tribal activities. Since its 2004 San Manuel Indian Bingo and \nCasino decision, the Board has used a subjective test to decide on a \ncase-by-case basis whether a tribal business or tribal land is for \ncommercial purposes, and if it is, the Board has asserted its \njurisdiction over that business.\n  Now, if the Board were to do the same with a school, a park, or any \nother enterprise owned and operated by a State or local government, no \nMember of Congress would stand for it. Why, then, should we stand back \nand allow the NLRB to impose its will on businesses owned and operated \nby Native American tribes? The answer is simple: we shouldn't. In fact, \nwe have a responsibility to protect tribal sovereignty, and that is \nexactly what H.R. 511 will do.\n  The bill under consideration will amend the National Labor Relations \nAct to reaffirm that the NLRB cannot assert its authority over \nenterprises or institutions owned or operated by a tribe on tribal \nland. It very simply reasserts a legal standard that was in place for \ndecades and returns to tribes the ability to manage their own labor \nrelations--as they have a sovereign right to do.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita), my \ncolleague, for his leadership on this issue and for continuing the work \nof those in Congress who have helped lead the fight to protect tribal \nsovereignty over the years. It is time for all of us to join that \nfight, stand with the Native American community, and restore to Indian \ntribes the ability to govern their own labor relations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Tribal Labor Sovereignty \nAct of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act \nof 2015, legislation that would strip employees of protections afforded \nunder the National Labor Relations Act at any enterprise owned by an \nIndian tribe and located on Indian lands.\n  At issue are two solemn and deeply-rooted principles: one, the right \nof Indian tribes to possess as distinct independent political \ncommunities retaining their original rights in matters of local self-\ngovernment; and, two, the rights of workers to organize, bargain \ncollectively, and engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid \nand protection.\n  Rather than attempting to reconcile these two competing principles, \nH.R. 4511 chooses sovereignty for some over the longstanding rights of \nothers. This bill strips hundreds of thousands of workers of their \nvoice in tribal-owned workplaces such as casinos, hotels, and mines. It \nshould be noted that some 600,000 workers are employed in tribal \ncasinos, but fully 75 percent are not members of tribes.\n  This legislation would jettison a carefully drawn balance between \ntribal sovereignty and workers' rights that was adopted in 2004 by a \nRepublican-led NLRB. That decision, known as the San Manuel Indian \nBingo and Casino, restricted the jurisdiction of the NLRB if it touches \non the exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters \nor aggregated rights guaranteed under treaties.\n  Furthermore, the NLRB stated that it would also take into account and \naccommodate the unique status of Indians in their society and legal \nculture in deciding NLRB jurisdiction.\n  The San Manuel decision has been upheld in every appeals court where \nit has been challenged, and it is based on legal precepts that have \nbeen upheld by appellate courts over 30 years. The courts have also \nnoted that the tribal casinos are commercial enterprises, not \ngovernment agencies like the Department of Education, serving \npredominantly non-tribal clients and hiring predominantly non-tribal \nmembers to operate.\n  By depriving these workers of the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively, this legislation ensures that low-paid service workers in \ntribal casinos will lose the opportunity to share in the fruits of the \nwealth that they are creating for the tribe, and depriving them of the \nopportunity to climb the ladder into the middle class.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  The bill also sets up a double standard. As a member of the \nInternational Labor Organization, the United States is obligated, as a \ngovernment, to respect and promote the rights outlined in the ILO \nDeclaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including \n``the freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to \ncollectively bargain.''\n  The Democrats and Republicans have insisted that our trading partners \nabide by and enforce these basic labor rights, and Congress has \nrepeatedly ratified these obligations in trade agreements. But today \nthe House will vote on a bill that does just the opposite when it comes \nto the freedom of association and the right to collectively bargain at \ntribal enterprises.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar).\n  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, Federal rulemaking continues to hurt the \npeople of Michigan's Fourth Congressional District.\n  As we have already seen, Federal departments and agencies have \nproposed overreaching water rules that create uncertainty for Michigan \nfarmers, energy rules that raise electric rates on hardworking \nfamilies, and healthcare rules that disrupt patients' coverage.\n  Now Federal rulemaking is interfering with the sovereignty of Native \nAmerican tribes. The National Labor Relations Board has claimed \njurisdiction over the commercial businesses on tribal lands, intruding \non the self-governance of the Saginaw Chippewa in my district.\n  Today I rise in support of H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty \nAct, to restore self-governance for the Saginaw Chippewa and all tribes \nand to stop the National Labor Relations Board from further hindering \nbusiness owners and entrepreneurs with more regulations and costs.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n\n[[Page H8262]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of my record in support of tribal \nsovereignty. I have been a member of the Native American Caucus since \n2012. I supported the legislative fix to Carcieri v. Salazar, a Supreme \nCourt decision that overturned 75 years of Federal Indian policy.\n  I cosponsored the Non-Disparagement of Native American Persons or \nPeoples in Trademark Registration Act, and I have actually stood out in \nthe street calling for the Washington football team to change its name \nbecause of the ugliness of what that represents.\n  And, of course, I was proud, proud to be a sponsor and a supporter of \nthe Violence Against Women Act, which authorized tribal governments to \nexercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over any \nindividual that commits domestic violence, dating violence or any kind \nof violence, and to protect men and women on the tribal areas.\n  In short, I am a person who is very proudly and affirmatively for \ntribal sovereignty and tribal rights.\n  However, the right to form and work in a labor organization and the \nright to have rights on your job is also a very important right, and I \ncannot see why we cannot fashion legislation which protects both tribal \nsovereignty and the right of labor.\n  This bill unfortunately takes rights away from some in order to \npurportedly give them to the other.\n  I urge my friends who are tempted to vote for this legislation to ask \nthemselves what they are giving up and what they are getting.\n  We could fashion legislation to look out for tribes. We could work \ntogether. But, instead, what we are doing is simply using a wedge issue \nto try to divide two very important principles, labor rights and tribal \nrights.\n  I am going to vote against this. I hope that all Members do. I hope \nthat people who believe in tribal rights and sovereignty know that this \nis not about not supporting sovereignty, because I support it. But I \nbelieve that this Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act is going to do something \nvery damaging to all workers, including tribal members.\n  We should be supporting all people, including tribal members' right \nto form unions, to be in a labor organization, which is their very best \nshot at getting into the middle class.\n  We know that union members earn $207 a week more than nonunion \ncounterparts. This is why some business interests, not all, hate \nunions, because they just don't want to have a fair economy. They want \nto hoard the wealth of the company for themselves.\n  Workers who are in the union are far more likely to have retirement \nbenefits, paid sick leave, and other medical benefits. Workers who have \norganized at their casinos have turned low-wage service sector jobs \ninto good-paying jobs with benefits. This legislation would take those \njobs away.\n  Therefore, I must oppose it, and I urge all my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Hunter), my friend and colleague on the Education \nand the Workforce Committee and a veteran of this great Nation.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the good doctor from Tennessee. I \nwant to thank my Republican colleagues, Mr. Rokita especially, for \nbringing this important matter to a vote today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor \nSovereignty Act.\n  In this House, we often speak about the importance of ensuring and \nprotecting tribal sovereignty. This bill does just that. The measure \ntreats tribal governments like we do any other government entity in \nthis country by excluding them from the onerous coverage under the \nNational Labor Relations Act.\n  In my district in San Diego and Riverside County, California, I \nrepresent 18 different tribes in Congress. That is more than anybody \nelse in this House. They vary in size, tradition, and economic wealth, \nbut they share one thing in common. They are all sovereign nations.\n  This sovereignty ensures that they have jurisdiction over their \nterritory. And, remember, the American people made a promise to these \ntribes that they can govern themselves on their own land. This should \nespecially apply in areas that this bill seeks to address.\n  I think it is ludicrous that the National Labor Relations Board \nthinks that they have purview over American Indian tribes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 511.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, we live in the land of opportunity, and \ncertainly many of the people who are being discussed here today \nunderstand that, for a very long time, it was not fair and not equal, \nbecause that is what we are truly discussing today, having a level \nplaying field.\n  This year is the 80th anniversary of the National Labor Relations \nAct, which, quite frankly, gave rise to the middle class as we know it \nhere in America today. But time after time, on both sides of the aisle, \nwe hear how the discrepancies between those who are on the lower end \nand the one-percenters is growing wider.\n  So why am I talking about this when we are talking about this tribal \nbill? Because that is what we are really talking about.\n\n  See, there is a mechanism in place already that addresses this issue. \nIt is a three-part test that has worked very well not only with the \nNLRB, but in the courts it has been working very well.\n  So this is a bill that is looking for a problem, because the true \ntest of what is going on here today is trying to take those rights of \nhaving a level playing field away from those who don't have a voice. \nWell, we stand here today as that voice.\n  My career was as an electrician who later had the opportunity to \nbecome a business agent. I have been to National Labor Relations Boards \nmany, many times. I have lost some. I have won some. But one thing I \ncan tell you is it was a fair fight. And that is what we want to give \nthose on tribal lands, a fair fight.\n  Just because they are tribal lands doesn't mean that none of our \nlaws, history, and traditions apply to them. In fact, just the \nopposite. That three-part test has stood the test of time and has given \na fair shot.\n  So what we are really talking about today is those who have the most \nabusing those who have the least, not giving them an opportunity to \nhave a voice in the workplace so that they can have the American Dream.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote against this very unfair, \nmisguided bill and to give those who need it most that voice. That is \nwhat we are elected to do. I urge my colleagues to vote against this.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the chairman for his good work on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that I am proud \nto cosponsor, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015.\n  It has long been a priority of this Congress to protect tribal \nsovereignty. These lands and their people should be free from \nbureaucratic intrusion, as they are sovereign nations.\n  However, the National Labor Relations Board has once again \noverstepped its authority to expand its jurisdiction over tribal lands, \ncreating a cloud of uncertainty for tribal leaders.\n  This legislation allows tribes to operate as they should, free from \nthe threat of intrusion from the National Labor Relations Board. Much \nlike states' rights, this legislation puts the power back in the hands \nof local tribal governments so they can make decisions in their best \ninterest.\n  During a time of political and partisan gridlock, empowering tribes \nand the lives of their people is a bipartisan issue that both sides \nshould be able to find common ground on. We need to protect tribal \nlands from Washington's constant overreach.\n  I will continue to work to ensure tribal sovereignty is not infringed \nupon.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 511. One of the most important \nthings\n\n[[Page H8263]]\n\nwe can do in this body is help the middle class to have every \nopportunity for their family.\n  While the economy has been rebounding, unfortunately, wages for the \nmiddle class have remained flat. Productivity is up. Profits are up. \nCEO pay is up. But wages for most workers have remained flat. Now we \nhave a bill before us that will make it harder for hundreds of \nthousands of workers by taking away National Labor Relations Act \nprotections from them.\n  Now, the promoters of this legislation say this bill is designed to \nprotect sovereignty. While I strongly support tribal sovereignty, this \nbill is not about that.\n  There are a number of Federal laws that tribes are compelled to \nfollow in addition to the National Labor Relations Act: the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act, the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the public \naccommodations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, just for \nstarters.\n  This bill isn't about meaningful sovereignty. It is about selective \nsovereignty because it only excludes labor rights, which makes this a \nlabor bill, not a sovereignty bill.\n  It would even affect workers who already have collective bargaining \nagreements, stripping away the rights they have collectively fought for \nand have agreed to.\n  Many of the advocates for this bill are hardly credible on this. The \nU.S. Chamber and other organizations have never taken strong stances on \ntribal issues in the past, issues like spearfishing and mascot names in \nmy home State of Wisconsin or funding to address the crumbling \ninfrastructure of Bureau of Indian Affairs schools.\n  But suddenly they support sovereignty. Well, history says otherwise. \nIf this bill is about sovereignty, exempt OSHA and ERISA and FMLA and \nADA, for starters--that would be a sovereignty bill--or require the \ntribes at least to have their own labor relations boards, which they \ndon't have.\n  This bill only exempts labor protections for hundreds of thousands of \nworkers, both tribal members and nonmembers. Those affected workers \nwill be denied their fundamental rights under this bill, and that is \nwhat this is really about.\n  Mr. Speaker, if this body wants to help tribes, I am here to help. If \nyou want to make it easier for Federal tribes to be recognized via the \nCarcieri fix, I am in.\n  If you want to provide more adequate funding for Indian Health \nServices and exempt them from future sequestration cuts, where do I \nsign up?\n  If you want to provide funding for the maintenance infrastructure as \nwell as the educational needs for Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, I \nam with you.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  If you want to address some of the Tax Code disparities that hinder \ntribes from encouraging economic development on their lands, especially \nrenewable energy projects, let's do that bill. But we are not \naddressing the real pressing issues that affect tribes in our country. \nInstead, we are only going after workers' rights in the veil of tribal \nsovereignty, and that is wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, in hearing testimony at our \nsubcommittee hearing, a number of Indian tribes have labor boards at \ntheir particular reservation, so I just want to have that in for the \nRecord.\n  Also, all we are asking for is to treat the Indian tribes exactly the \nsame as local or State governments are treated. If they are sovereign, \nthey are sovereign; if they are not, they are not.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no need today to catalog the litany of promises \nmade and broken by this government to the American Indian nations. The \nsum total of these broken promises amounted to the banishment of these, \nthe first Americans, to the most desolate and undesirable lands in the \nNation. We left them with one thing and one thing only. We left them \nsovereignty over their lands.\n  In the past half century, many of these tribes have created, from \nthat sovereignty, great engines of prosperity with which to provide for \nthemselves and their posterity; and suddenly, our government's \ndisinterest in their welfare, its benign neglect of their affairs, has \nchanged. Now that they are prosperous, our government has developed a \ncanine appetite to intervene in their affairs.\n  For 70 years after the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act, \nthe Federal Government recognized the internal independence of these \ntribal governments established of, by, and for their rightful members. \nIt recognized that unless Congress specified otherwise, the Indian \nnations were free to conduct their own affairs on their sovereign lands \nand to organize their enterprises according to their own traditions, \ncustoms, conditions, and necessities--that is, until 2004, when the \nNational Labor Relations Board decided to shatter these decades of \nlegal precedents and usurp the legislative powers of the Congress.\n  The NLRA was never intended to apply to governments, and the American \nIndian nations have always been recognized as governments--that is, \nuntil the NLRB decided to radically and fundamentally change the law \nthat created it in the first place.\n  The question before the House is whether Congress will reassert its \nauthority over a rogue executive agency and, for a change, honor the \npromises of tribal sovereignty made to these nations more than 100 \nyears ago.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for \nyielding and for his leadership in support of working men and women.\n  Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues, I am a strong supporter of tribal \nsovereignty and believe that we must recognize the rights of tribal \ngovernments. But I am also a strong supporter of labor rights, the \nability of hardworking men and women to join together in collective \nbargaining to improve their workplace and the lives of their families.\n  Union membership has many advantages: higher wages, better benefits, \nand safer working conditions. It is no coincidence that we have seen \nthe middle class shrink dramatically at the same time that union \nmembership has declined. That is why we need to act to expand labor \nrights and why we should be concerned about the bill before us.\n  I believe that the 2004 National Labor Relations Board decision in \nSan Manuel Indian Bingo & Casino struck the appropriate balance between \nrespecting tribal sovereignty and upholding labor rights. In its \ndecision, the NLRB stated the National Labor Relations Act does not \napply if it would undermine the ``exclusive rights of self-governance \nin purely intramural matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights.'' \nHowever, the NLRB clarified that labor law would apply if an entity is \na purely commercial enterprise and employs or caters to individuals who \nare not tribal members. That is an appropriate test, whether we are \ntalking about casinos or construction companies, hotels and resorts, or \nmines or power plants.\n  H.R. 511 would overturn the NLRB's carefully crafted decision and \ncould take away existing bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands \nof workers. We know that workers at tribally owned casinos have \nbenefited from union membership. A UNITE HERE! union study of tribal \ncasino workers in California documented higher wages, lower healthcare \ncosts, and less worker reliance on public benefits like Medicaid to \nmeet the needs of their families. Employers, too, gain when workers are \nmore productive and turnover is reduced.\n  We have real-world examples of how unions have helped workers. Gary \nNavarro, a Pomo Nation member employed at Graton Casino & Resort, \ntestified before the Education and the Workforce Committee that ``I \nbecame active in my union because of unjust treatment of casino workers \nby the managers and how nothing could be done about even sexual \nharassment because of sovereignty. Exercising our right to organize \nturned out to be the only way to protect ourselves and our coworkers.''\n  Madeline, a worker at Foxwoods, was suspended because she was forced \nto clock out when she went to see a nurse for a work-related injury, \nwhich put\n\n[[Page H8264]]\n\nher over the casino's attendance points system. Her union won her \nreinstatement and backpay. And the company provided a mandatory OSHA \ntraining program for management.\n  Jenny Langlois, at Foxwoods, benefited from a union contract that \ngave her the time she needed to receive treatment for breast cancer.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 511 would result in the loss of those gains, and, \nby eliminating NLRA rights, could deny them to many more workers in the \nfuture. By doing so, it would leave those workers without any avenue to \nbargain collectively, ensure fair compensation, or seek redress for \nworkplace injuries.\n  Three out of four of the 600,000 workers employed in tribal casinos \nare not tribal members. They do not have full access to internal, \ntribal mechanisms for filing grievances or petitioning for changes in \npolicy. And while some tribal governments have labor laws that apply to \ncommercial operations, many don't, and there is no guarantee that those \nwho have them will not change or eliminate them in the future. By \neliminating NLRA rights, workers could have no place to turn to push \nfor labor rights, to appeal unfair firings or disciplinary action, or \nto take action against sexual harassment.\n  H.R. 511 would affect more than the gaming industry, including \nconstruction workers, miners, and hotel workers. That is why the \nInternational Labour Organization has stated that it ``would appear \nlikely that an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and its \nmechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure to these workers \ntheir fundamental freedom of association rights absent any assurances \nthat there were tribal labor laws that provide the same rights to all \nworkers.''\n\n  But there is no such requirement in H.R. 511. It would preempt NLRA \ncoverage. But there are other Federal laws that apply to tribes, \nincluding the Occupational Safety and Health Act, title III of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Why should we single out \nthe NLRA, the law that gives workers bargaining rights? Or will we be \nasked to eliminate those other important protections in the future?\n  Mr. Speaker, proponents of the bill argue that it is designed to \nprovide equal treatment for tribal nations with State and local \ngovernments, but there are key distinctions.\n  First, we are talking here not about people who work directly for \ntribal governments but for workers in commercial enterprises. Most \nStates and localities don't operate huge commercial entities that hire \nthe majority of workers from outside of their jurisdictions.\n  Second, if State or local workers want to push for laws to obtain or \nprotect collective bargaining rights, they have the ability to \nparticipate in the political process and vote in elections. That is one \nreason that the vast majority of State and local public employees have \nthose rights. Non-tribal workers at tribal-operated commercial \nenterprises lack that ability. They don't vote in tribal elections, and \nthey have no direct ability to affect labor policies for tribal \ngovernments.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should fight for workplace rights and support the \nbalanced approach taken by the NLRB. I ask my colleagues to join in \nopposing this bill.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Emmer.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of \n2015.\n  Minnesota is a proud home to seven Ojibwe reservations and four \nDakota communities. We have a strong and deep Native American history \nand are proud of the work we have accomplished through centuries of \nworking together.\n  The Federal Government has long recognized that Native American \ntribes have the capacity and ability to govern themselves in an \nefficient and meaningful manner that is consistent with their heritage. \nThe legislation being discussed today is of grave importance to the \ncommunities that have contributed so much to our Nation's history.\n  The intent of the National Labor Rights Act passed in 1935 was never \nto include tribal governments within its jurisdiction. It is \nunfortunate that some are seeking to take advantage of a once well-\nintended law, but it is now up to Congress to do the right thing and \nexpressly clarify that tribal governments are exempt from the National \nLabor Relations Act.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, could you tell us how much time \nremains on both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marchant). The gentleman from Virginia \nhas 12 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Tennessee has 21\\1/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to also say to my friend from Tennessee (Mr. \nRoe), he and I are good friends and have done a lot of work together, \nbut on this we disagree.\n  I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that if the National Labor Relations Act \nwere at issue on this floor today, my belief is--I may be wrong--that \nmany of the people who will vote for this bill would be for repealing \nthe National Labor Relations Act. That is a fair place to be, I \nsuppose, but that is essentially what we are talking about here.\n  I can't think of anyone in this House who does not believe strongly \nin the principle of protecting the sovereignty of American tribes and \ntheir governments. I know surely that is where I am. I presume all 434 \nof my colleagues are there. It is the least we can do, having treated \nthe Native Americans so badly when we got here and thereafter.\n  We agree that when tribal governments are carrying out inherently \ngovernment functions--that is the key. It is the key for the courts; it \nought to be the key for us--their sovereignty is fully, and should be, \nsecure under current law. But this bill goes a lot further than \nreinforcing that understanding.\n  Instead, this bill extends the current understanding of sovereignty \nnot from what it is, but it is in an effort to undermine the rights for \nworking men and women in this country, which is why, for all Americans, \nwe cannot get a minimum wage bill on this floor, which is $7.25, which \nis now 7 years in being, and would be, if we paid the same in 1968 for \nthe minimum wage, $10.68 today. It is the same principle, we can't get \nit on the floor. For all Americans--not just Indian Americans--for all \nAmericans, Native Americans, it undermines their rights, rights that \nevery Member of this House also ought to support.\n  Democrats are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Native \nAmerican tribal communities across this country, and we are going to \ncontinue working with them to fight for more investment in education. \nHear me. We need to put our money where our mouth is: Native American \nhousing, health care, education, along with continuing to protect their \nsovereignty in governing themselves according to their cultures and \ntraditions.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from \nMaryland an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we do not support is taking away protections from \nAmerican workers, Native and non-Native alike, who work in commercial \nenterprises owned by tribes. All of our people deserve the chance to \nearn a decent living, be safe at work, and reach for a better life. \nThis bill is not a step in the right direction.\n  Courts have ruled that tribes must also comply with other laws. I \nwant to adopt the comments of the gentlewoman from Illinois.\n  Courts have ruled that tribes must also comply with the Fair Labor \nStandards Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act and many \ncriminal laws, among others. Should we repeal that and have unhealthy \nworking conditions in commercial enterprises? Perhaps that is the next \nbill you will bring forward in the name of Native sovereignty.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Why is the NLRA being singled out from among these laws of general \napplicability by the proponents of this bill? I suggested why at the \nbeginning\n\n[[Page H8265]]\n\nof my comments: because that side does not support National Labor \nRelations Act rights.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. Given that there is no logical distinction to explain why \nthese other laws should apply to tribes but the NLRA should not, the \nonly plausible explanation is that this legislation is a precursor of \nother legislation and says, once again, we do not support the rights of \nAmericans to collectively bargain for pay, benefits, safety, and \nworking conditions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to send a strong and unequivocal \nmessage--two messages: A, we support strongly the sovereignty of our \ntribes, but, secondly, we also support the decency and safety and pay \nof working Americans, tribes and non-tribes alike.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Just for clarification, Mr. Speaker, many Federal labor laws \nspecifically exclude Indian tribes from the definition of employer, \nincluding title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title I of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and the Worker Adjustment and \nRetraining Notification Act. In contrast, statutes of general \napplication, including the NLRA; Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act; Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA; \nFair Labor Standards Act; Family and Medical Leave Act; and Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act, ERISA, are silent in their application \nto Indian tribes. Federal courts have held that the statutes of general \napplication--specifically, FLSA and ERISA--do apply. Otherwise, they do \nnot.\n  At this time, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from South Dakota \n(Mrs. Noem), my good friend, which I had the privilege of visiting her \nbeautiful State about a month ago.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind everyone, in light of the \ndebate that we have had today here on the floor, that this bill is \nextremely bipartisan. It is supported by tribes all across the Nation. \nIt is something that they have been asking us for. In fact, in the last \ntwo Congresses, I carried the bill. I was the sponsor of it because it \nneeds to be done, and I was asked to do so by tribes across the \ncountry.\n  This is an issue of sovereignty. No other level of government in the \ncountry is subject to the National Labor Relations Act. It is time that \nCongress clarifies the law and reaffirms its commitment to tribal \ngovernments and self-determination.\n  The bipartisan policy of economic development through self-\ndetermination has helped create economic opportunity in Indian country. \nTribes across the country and in my home State of South Dakota work \ndaily to overcome the high rates of poverty and unemployment that they \nface. They continue to develop their businesses and lands for the \nbenefit of their people and communities. The last thing that they need \nis to have the National Labor Relations Board meddling in their \neconomic development affairs when they are trying to make life better \nfor the people who live in their communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support tribal sovereignty, support tribal \ngovernments, and vote ``yes'' on this important legislation.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the fine gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak on this bill today.\n  While this administration has been eager to recognize tribes, too \noften it fails to also recognize their sovereign rights, imposing \nonerous Federal requirements on tribes' management of their own lands \nand livelihoods, which is very important in my own First District of \nCalifornia, home of many recognized tribes.\n  This measure rectifies a clear overreach yet again of this \nadministration by rolling back National Labor Relations Board \nregulations that impose Federal labor laws on tribal businesses located \non their own tribal land never intended under the NLRA.\n  Mr. Speaker, sovereign status doesn't mean that tribes may manage \ntheir own affairs only now and then, or only when the administration \nchooses. It means tribes have a right to self-government in every \naspect of their affairs.\n  It is time that this House reaffirm its constitutional role, defined \nin article I, section 8, and lead the Federal Government in its \nrelations with Indian tribes, not this overreaching board.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) and thank him for his service to this great \nNation.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Really this whole matter and discussion is pretty simple: Article I, \nsection 8, Congress shall have the power ``to regulate commerce with \nforeign nations and among the several States and with the Indian \ntribes''--explicit language in the Constitution that we all defend and \nthat I have defended since I was 18.\n  It is the purview of this Congress, not the rulemakers of the \nNational Labor Relations Board, to regulate commerce.\n  This Nation must continue to recognize the rights of Indian tribal \nsovereignty, and this Congress must uphold the Constitution and \nsovereign treaties with those tribes.\n  Those opposed to this bill, Mr. Speaker, say that it will take away \nthe rights of workers. As a Representative from Oklahoma, whose Fifth \nDistrict has more than 13 percent Native American, our largest \nminority, our constituents know that the actions of the rulemakers will \ntake away the rights of sovereign tribes. Congress must restore these \nrights with the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, self-reliance and self-governance need to be more than \nliberal buzzwords if we are going to make a difference, if they are \ngoing to have any meaning at all. And I find some of the comments of \nthe opposition to be quite rich in contradiction. Unfortunately, they \nare similar to the comments that President Obama had this morning when \nhe announced his opposition to this legislation, stating that he could \nnot support the bill unless tribal governments adopted his view. In \nother words, they have to be identical to his views in order to have \nsovereignty. Well, this isn't sovereignty at all.\n\n  The President often likes to say that he honors and respects tribal \nsovereignty. In fact, I heard him say that he respects it as much as \nany President, right while standing in the powwow grounds in Cannon \nBall, North Dakota, last summer.\n  Yet when presented with this opportunity--and it is not the only \nopportunity we presented, by the way--the Native American Energy Act \nand gas-gathering pipeline bills have done the same thing, trying to \ngive sovereignty where sovereignty is to be given. And, actually, it is \nnot given to them; it is held by them.\n  So I call on Congress and President Obama to respect the rights of \ntribes and pass this legislation into law.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in \nsupport of the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, which would clarify \nFederal law, restore parity for tribal governments, and protect tribal \nautonomy.\n  As you have heard today, tribes have a right to govern themselves, \nmanage their own land, and regulate tribal enterprises according to \ntheir own culture, traditions, and law. They have\n\n[[Page H8266]]\n\nthe right to regulate labor relations with their employees as a result, \nand I expect tribal governments to view this legislation, in fact, as \nan opportunity to strengthen their own worker protections.\n  No worker, as you have also heard today, should be without a voice or \nan ability to petition their employer for stronger benefits or a better \nwork environment. In fact, many tribes across the country and in New \nMexico have developed labor ordinances that, in fact, protect these \nrights.\n  During negotiations of the 1999 tribal-State gaming compact, Indian \ntribes in California agreed to adopt the Model Tribal Labor Relations \nOrdinance in order to strengthen worker protections.\n  Although this bill does not prevent similar tribal efforts to protect \nworkers, I am disappointed that it doesn't do anything to promote \nstronger tribal labor practices.\n  Congress should provide tribes the resources they need to develop and \nimplement labor laws and regulations at Native American enterprises. \nEmployee protections and tribal autonomy are not opposing values.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to work for protecting \nworkers' rights.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to read portions of a Statement of Administration \nPolicy, issued by the Executive Office of the President:\n  ``The administration is deeply committed to respecting tribal \nsovereignty and maintaining government-to-government relationships with \nIndian tribes as well as to protecting American workers and enforcing \nFederal labor laws. The administration cannot support H.R. 511, the \nTribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015, as currently drafted, because it \ndoes not include the provisions as explained below.''\n  Going on:\n  ``The administration is encouraged by the efforts of some tribal \ngovernments to balance these important interests and find common ground \nwhen formulating compacts to operate casinos on tribal land under the \nFederal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. In several of these compacts, \ntribes have agreed to establish their own labor relations policies. \nThough these compacts differ on minor details, what they have in common \nis that they generally protect tribal self-governance while also \nensuring that most casino workers retain important and effective labor \nrights.\n  ``It is thus possible to protect both tribal sovereignty and workers' \nrights, and the administration can only support approaches that \naccomplish that result. Therefore, the administration can support a \nbill which recognizes tribal sovereignty in formulating labor relations \nlaw and exempts tribes from the jurisdiction of the National Labor \nRelations Board only if the tribes adopt labor standards and procedures \napplicable to tribally owned and operated commercial enterprises \nreasonably equivalent to those in the National Labor Relations Act.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration \nPolicy.\n\n                   Statement of Administrative Policy\n\n\n             H.R. 511--Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015\n\n                   (Rep. Rokita, R-IN, Nov. 17, 2015)\n\n       The Administration is deeply committed to respecting tribal \n     sovereignty and maintaining government-to-government \n     relationships with Indian tribes as well as to protecting \n     American workers and enforcing Federal labor laws. The \n     Administration cannot support H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor \n     Sovereignty Act of 2015, as currently drafted, because it \n     does not include the provisions as explained below.\n       The President's commitment to tribal sovereignty has taken \n     many forms--from establishing the White House Council on \n     Native American Affairs, to reaffirming tribal authority to \n     prosecute non-Indians under the Violence Against Women Act, \n     and to promoting tribal self-determination by signing into \n     law the Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal \n     Homeownership (HEARTH) Act so that tribes may lease their \n     lands without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n       At the same time, the President is firmly dedicated to \n     protecting American workers. The Administration vigorously \n     enforces Federal labor laws and has repeatedly emphasized the \n     importance of strengthening workers' rights to collective \n     bargaining.\n       The Administration is encouraged by the efforts of some \n     tribal governments to balance these important interests and \n     find common ground when formulating compacts to operate \n     casinos on tribal land under the Federal Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act. In several of these compacts, tribes have \n     agreed to establish their own labor relations policies. \n     Though these compacts differ on minor details, what they have \n     in common is that they generally protect tribal self-\n     governance while also ensuring that most casino workers \n     retain important and effective labor rights.\n       It is thus possible to protect both tribal sovereignty and \n     workers' rights, and the Administration can only support \n     approaches that accomplish that result. Therefore, the \n     Administration can support a bill which recognizes tribal \n     sovereignty in formulating labor relations law and exempts \n     tribes from the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations \n     Board only if the tribes adopt labor standards and procedures \n     applicable to tribally-owned and operated commercial \n     enterprises reasonably equivalent to those in the National \n     Labor Relations Act. Amended legislation would also need to \n     include an authorization for funding to support the \n     development and implementation of tribal labor laws and \n     regulations.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I guess what sovereignty means for \nan Indian reservation is you can be sovereign as long as we tell you \nwhat to do.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce). New \nMexico has been a very active voice on this issue.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, says it all. All we are \ntrying to do is to provide Native American tribes the sovereignty and \nautonomy they deserve, ensuring that they have the same rights as other \nbusinesses off the reservation, and that they have the same standards \nas States and local governments.\n  Now, we have heard on this floor from those who reject the bill, \nthose who oppose it, about where after is decency, safety, and pay. I \nam proud of New Mexico. I represent the tribes. And I will tell you we \nare falling far short of those objectives of those who oppose the bill.\n  Many of the tribes are looking to get into their own businesses now. \nThey want to compete off reservation. They want to put tribal members \nto work. But they are hamstrung by the National Labor Relations Board, \nwhich currently chooses on a case-by-case basis which tribes are \nregulated and which are not. They are dependent on the government to \ngive them permission. That is not what sovereignty sounds like in New \nMexico, and tribes across this country are rejecting the status quo, \nsaying: Let us move forward. Let us be in charge of our own destiny. We \ndo not want to be responsible--we don't want to be wards of the \ngovernment any longer. Give us our freedom to compete.\n  I see tribal companies that could compete easily if they are allowed \nto by this government. And just the phrase being ``allowed to by this \ngovernment'' is one that chafes, and should chafe, Native Americans.\n  So the resulting confusion from the current status quo, which is \ntrying to provide decency, safety, and pay, and is not doing that, the \nconfusion from some being chosen and some not being chosen is one that \nneeds to be overturned. H.R. 511 does that. I rise to support it, and \nappreciate the gentleman's time.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  Ms. MOORE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 511.\n  When Congress originally passed the National Labor Relations Act in \n1935, Congress exempted Federal, State, and local governments from the \ndefinition of employer. What we have seen since then, Mr. Speaker, is \nthat local units of government have allowed labor unions to develop, \nand we have seen the growth and the development of the middle class \nbecause labor unions have been in place.\n  Nowhere in the NLRA are Indian tribes mentioned. For nearly 60 years, \nthe NLRB treated tribes as local units of government and the Board \ndeclined to apply the NLRA over tribal activities in Indian Country. \nHowever, in\n\n[[Page H8267]]\n\n2004, the NLRB abruptly reversed course with the San Manuel ruling, \nasserting that the NLRA does apply to tribal enterprises. The ruling \nmeant that tribes would no longer be treated as local units of \ngovernment.\n  H.R. 511 is a narrow legislative fix that simply adds tribal \ngovernments to the list of other governments that are specifically \nexcluded from the definition of employer in the NLRA. This bill simply \nensures that the American Indian tribes are treated with parity, as our \nother local units of government are treated.\n  As a longtime labor advocate, I support this bill because I believe \nin tribal sovereignty. I have seen tribes afford their workers good \npay, good health care and benefits. I respect their sovereignty, and I \nrespect them to do as our cities and our States do. Sovereignty means \nrespecting the individual authority and the decisionmaking of our \ncountry's first nations. That is what H.R. 511 does.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise for a few of the things we have not \nheard on the other side of the aisle. I have heard a lot about \nsovereignty, but we have asked explicitly about other areas, one being \nOSHA. We have asked explicitly about ERISA. We have asked explicitly \nabout the ADA. Why aren't those in here if this is a sovereignty bill \nand not just an antilabor bill?\n  In fact, on the Education and the Workforce Committee, I don't think \na month goes by, Mr. Speaker, that we don't have a hearing that attacks \nthe National Labor Relations Board and their actions or some other \nlabor-related activity. It happens as often as you can imagine.\n  Yet, here we are being told this is really about sovereignty, but we \ndon't really engage in a debate about sovereignty. Where we have a \nproblem is on the labor front and what it would mean to working \npeople--to the hundreds of thousands of people, 700,000 people-plus--\nwho would lose their rights if this were to be passed.\n  One of the things that was said that is simply not correct is that a \nnumber of tribes have their own labor practices. Here is the reality. \nAccording to labor employment law in Indian Country--in a book from \n2011 that is specifically about labor law and tribes--of the 567 \nfederally recognized tribes, ``few tribes have implemented labor \nordinances, other than right-to-work provisions, to govern labor \norganizations and collective bargaining.''\n  In fact, when you look at specific tribes, what has been passed, all \ntoo often, unfortunately, are things like right to work, which takes \naway the ability to have that collective bargaining right.\n  If we are going to have this debate about sovereignty, let's talk \nabout sovereignty, let's talk about the funding for the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs' schools, let's talk about lifting some of those tax \nlaws that make it harder for them to invest in renewable energy. Let's \ntalk about those laws and not just the ones you want to.\n  This is like when I was a kid. When I had to take a pill, it came in \nthe middle of something sweet. You are trying to take something really \nbad, like taking away workers' rights, and are putting it in a tribal \nbill because we support the tribes and because we support the unions, \nand you want to split that up.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. POCAN. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is we just want to have that debate. \nLet's talk about sovereignty. But I am not hearing anything about the \nother issues that affect the tribes.\n  I have a tribe in my district, as we have many tribes in Wisconsin, \nand I have had a good, long relationship in my time in the legislature \nwith these tribes. I have fought on behalf of changing Indian mascot \nnames. I have fought on behalf of making sure that they have \nspearfishing rights in the State of Wisconsin.\n  The U.S. Chamber and all of those groups were never there. The U.S. \nChamber is only here because they want to go after workers' rights. \nThis bill is only here because you want to go after workers' rights. \nLet's just be honest about it.\n  If you want to have a debate on sovereignty, talk about the many \nissues we have brought up, because that is not what this bill is about. \nI support tribal sovereignty. I also support the many people who work \nin these facilities. We have to ensure that they still have the \nprotections. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, certainly what we are after here \ntoday are the rights of Native Americans, whose rights have been \ntrampled on by this country. We have had treaty after treaty that we \nhave ignored. Maybe we can finally, with this piece of legislation, get \none right here.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita), my very \ngood friend and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, \nElementary, and Secondary Education.\n  Mr. ROKITA. I thank the gentleman not only for the time, but for his \nleadership on the committee and in helping bring the bill to the point \nit is today.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not a new product. It has been around for \nabout 10 years. But it hasn't gone as far as it has gone today. That is \na compliment to all of the proponents of the bill, to Members like \nKristi Noem, who has talked earlier and who had this bill in the past, \nto Members like Chairman John Kline, who has carried it in the past, \nand all the way back to J.D. Hayworth. We thank them all for getting us \nhere. I, for one, am a Member who has picked up this product and has \nrun with it to help get it here.\n  I have been to 13 tribal communities this year alone, understanding \nwhat the problems are with this activist Department of Labor and \nNational Labor Relations Board. That is why this bill is so popular, \nand in my talking with nearly every Member of this body, that is why so \nmany Members have supported it. I expect and would ask for a strong \nvote today for sovereignty, for parity.\n  Mr. Speaker, the history is this: The National Labor Relations Act \nwas silent as to tribal communities in terms of being regulated as an \nemployer. State governments and local governments were specifically \nexempted from the act.\n  Then, because of an error in a court decision as well as an activist \nDepartment of Labor, we are in this position where the jurisdiction of \ntribal communities under the act has now been invented.\n  This bill corrects that and says in no uncertain terms--and very \nexplicitly in just three pages--that tribal communities are to be \nexempted from the act if they are to be sovereign. All we are asking \nfor is parity with State and local governments.\n  Let me give you an example.\n  Let's say you have a municipally owned and operated golf course in \nyour community--or if it were a State government, then it would be the \nState government, owned by the State--and that municipality didn't want \nto have union activities and it wrote its own set of rules for its \nemployees. That would be fine under the act.\n  By not allowing the very same right or luxury to a tribal government, \nwe are treating them unlike other State and local governments. That is \nwhy in this context they are not sovereign. That is why this bill is \nneeded.\n  The gentleman from Wisconsin who just spoke reminds us that there are \nagencies in this bill that aren't covered. I would say to him: What a \ngreat idea for tribal labor sovereignty, act two.\n  But the logic that just because every agency isn't covered under what \nis only meant to cover the NLRA somehow negates the good that this bill \ndoes--the right answer that comes with a ``yes'' vote--is ridiculous. \nJust because it doesn't do everything doesn't mean you can't do \nanything.\n  So I would say to the Members of this body, on that fact alone, you \nshould vote ``yes.''\n  It is also true that many tribal communities have unions, that many \ntribal communities have rules that govern their labor and employees, \nand those who want to oppose this bill, in my estimation, Mr. Speaker, \nsimply want to insert their judgments, their biases, for their \npreferred rule or for their preferred union in place of duly elected \nmembers of a tribal government.\n  So I would say to those opponents: What makes you smarter than the \npeople who elect the tribal government?\n\n[[Page H8268]]\n\nWhat makes you better and your judgment superior to those who have been \nduly elected by the members of a tribal nation?\n  The fact of the matter is the arguments that have been made by the \nopposition do not apply to what is right here. The right thing is to \nask ourselves: Are tribal communities sovereign or are they not? Should \nthey at least be in parity with State and local governments or should \nthey not?\n  I would say, Mr. Speaker, to every Member here and remind everybody--\nRepublican, Democrat--that this is a bipartisan bill. We just had two \nDemocrat Members speak in favor of this bill.\n  If you want to do what is right--if you believe in the sovereignty of \ntribal communities, if you believe they should at least have the same \nparity, judgment, and authority as State and local governments do--then \nyou should vote ``yes'' on H.R. 511. I urge all Members to do that, \nRepublican and Democrat.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to \nclose?\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Yes. I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  We have heard about the fact that the National Labor Relations Act is \nsilent. That is true. But in terms of laws of general application, they \nare applied to tribes based on the balancing test, and the courts \napplied that test. That test is a half a century old. The activist NLRB \nthat ruled in 2004 was during the George W. Bush administration. So we \ndon't know how activist they could be interpreted.\n  There are a lot of laws that we have found and have discussed that \napply to tribes, like the Fair Labor Standards Act, OSHA, ERISA. They \nhave to withhold taxes. They have to pay their employer share of Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and on and on. The criminal laws go on and on as \nwell as laws of general application.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote from a letter from the \nInternational Labour Office, which is basically talking about the \ninternational labor obligations we have. They write:\n  ``While elements of indigenous peoples' sovereignty have been invoked \nby the proponents of this Bill, the central question revolves around \nthe manner in which the United States Government can best assure \nthroughout its territory the full application of the fundamental \nprinciples of freedom of association and collective bargaining. From an \nILO perspective, while the variety of mechanisms for ensuring freedom \nof association and collective bargaining rights may differ depending on \ndistinct sectorial considerations or devolution of labor competence, it \nis critical that the State (the national authority) takes ultimate \nresponsibility for ensuring respect for freedom of association and \ncollective bargaining rights throughout its territory.\n  ``Given the concerns that you have raised, it would be critically \nimportant that, at the very least, a complete legal and comparative \nreview be undertaken to support assurances that all rights, mechanisms \nand remedies for the full protection of internationally recognized \nfreedom of association rights are available to all workers on all \ntribal lands. In the absence of such assurances, it would appear likely \nthat an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and its mechanisms \nwould give rise to a failure to ensure to these workers their \nfundamental freedom of association rights.'' Therefore, it would be in \nviolation of the ILO.\n  This isn't about labor rights. This is about whether or not we are \ngoing to fulfill our obligations under the International Labour \nOrganization as a government that subscribes to those.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the full letter from \nthe ILO and several other letters in opposition to the legislation.\n\n                                  International Labour Office,\n\n                                              Geneva, Switzerland.\n     Mr. R. L. Trumka,\n     President, AFL-CIO,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Trumka, I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated \n     22 October 2015 requesting an informal opinion and guidance \n     from the International Labour Organization in respect of a \n     Bill being considered by the United States Congress.\n       In particular, you have raised concerns about the Tribal \n     Labor Sovereignty Act (H.R. 511) which you state would deny \n     protection under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of a \n     large number of workers employed by tribal-owned and tribal-\n     operated enterprises located on tribal territory and ask for \n     the informal opinion of the Office as to whether such an \n     exclusion of workers employed on tribal lands would be in \n     conformity with the principles of freedom of Association \n     which are at the core of the ILO Constitution and the ILO's \n     Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n       In conformity with the regular procedure concerning \n     requests for an informal opinion from the International \n     Labour Office in respect of draft legislation and its \n     possible impact on international labour standards and \n     principles, the views set out below should in no way be \n     considered as prejudging any comments or observations that \n     might be made by the ILO supervisory bodies within the \n     framework of their examination of the application of ratified \n     international labour standards or principles on freedom of \n     association.\n       Your links to committee reports of the congressional \n     majority and minority and other background information have \n     enabled the Office to consider the views of the parties both \n     for and against the proposed amendment and they all appear to \n     confirm recognition of the United States' obligation to \n     uphold freedom of association and collective bargaining. \n     While the proponents of the Bill assert that this can be \n     achieved through the labour relations' regimes autonomously \n     determined by the tribal nations, the opponents--and you \n     yourself in your request--maintain that excluding tribal \n     lands from the NLRA will in effect result in a loss (or at \n     the very least inadequate protection) of their trade union \n     rights. Not only do you refer to tribal labour relations \n     ordinances which in your view provide inadequate protections \n     in this regard, but you also refer to instances where there \n     are no tribal labour relations ordinances at all.\n       While elements of indigenous peoples' sovereignty have been \n     invoked by the proponents of this Bill, the central question \n     revolves around the manner in which the United States \n     Government can best assure throughout its territory the full \n     application of the fundamental principles of freedom of \n     association and collective bargaining. From an ILO \n     perspective, while the variety of mechanisms for ensuring \n     freedom of association and collective bargaining rights may \n     differ depending on distinct sectoral considerations or \n     devolution of labour competence, it is critical that the \n     State (the national authority) takes ultimate responsibility \n     for ensuring respect for freedom of association and \n     collective bargaining rights throughout its territory.\n       As you have indicated, the 2004 San Manuel Indian Bingo and \n     Casino decision assures possible recourse to the National \n     Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an overarching mechanism aimed \n     at ensuring the protection of freedom of association, while \n     also maintaining deference to the sovereign interests of the \n     tribal nations so as to avoid touching on exclusive rights of \n     self-governance.\n       Full abdication of review via an exclusion from the scope \n     of the NLRA for all workers employed on tribal lands as \n     described might make it very difficult for the United States \n     Government to assure the fundamental trade union rights of \n     workers. In cases like those mentioned where there are no \n     tribal labour relations ordinances, undue restrictions on \n     collective bargaining, excessive limitations on freedom of \n     association rights or lack of protection from unfair labour \n     practices, workers on tribal territories would be left \n     without any remedy for violation of their fundamental freedom \n     of association rights, short of a constitutional battle. \n     Furthermore, the exclusion proposed, with no avenue for \n     federal review or overarching mechanism for appeal should \n     there be an alleged violation of freedom of association, \n     would give rise to discrimination in relation to the \n     protection of trade union rights which would affect both \n     indigenous and non-indigenous workers simply on the basis of \n     their workplace location.\n       Given the concerns that you have raised, it would be \n     critically important that, at the very least, a complete \n     legal and comparative review be undertaken to support \n     assurances that all rights, mechanisms and remedies for the \n     full protection of internationally recognized freedom of \n     association rights are available to all workers on all tribal \n     lands. In the absence of such assurances, it would appear \n     likely that an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and \n     its mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure to \n     these workers their fundamental freedom of association \n     rights.\n       In accordance with ILO procedure concerning requests for \n     informal opinions on draft legislation, this communication \n     will also be brought to the attention of the United States \n     Government and the representative employers' organization, \n     the U.S. Council for International Business.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   Corinne Vargha,\n     Director of the International Labour Standards Department.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          United Auto Workers,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million \n     active and retired members of the International Union, United \n     Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of \n     America (UAW), I urge you to vote against the Tribal Labor \n     Sovereignty Act (H.R. 511). This misguided bill would deny \n     protection under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to \n     hundreds of\n\n[[Page H8269]]\n\n     thousands of workers employed by tribal casinos alone. Tribal \n     casinos have created over 628,000 jobs. This legislation does \n     not only apply to casinos. It could impact dozens of other \n     businesses, including power plants, mining operations, and \n     hotels.\n       UAW deeply believes in tribal sovereignty and has a strong \n     record in supporting civil rights throughout our history. \n     This bill, however, is misleading. It is an attack on \n     fundamental collective bargaining rights and would strip \n     workers in commercial enterprises of their rights and \n     protections under the NLRA. Supporters of the bill argue that \n     the bill creates parity for the tribes with state and local \n     governments who are not covered under the NLRA. However, \n     there are some significant differences.\n       For starters, non-tribal members cannot petition a tribe \n     for labor legislation, while workers employed by a state or \n     local government have a voice with their elected leaders. \n     This is an important difference since 75 percent of Native \n     American gaming employees are not tribal members. In \n     addition, tribes are exempt from employment laws (Title VII \n     of the Civil Rights Act) that apply to state and local \n     governments. Finally, private sector contractors work \n     extensively on behalf of state and local governments and they \n     generally have to comply with the NLRA. In summary, the \n     parity argument does not hold up under scrutiny.\n       Tribal casinos have a significant and growing presence \n     throughout our country. In 2013, 449 tribal gaming facilities \n     made $28 billion in revenues. Seventy five percent of the \n     workforce is non-tribal members. In fact, at Foxwoods, where \n     the UAW represents the workers (and many other casinos), well \n     over 95% percent of employees and patrons are not tribal \n     members. These employees are working for a tribal enterprise \n     which is simply a commercial operation competing with non-\n     tribal businesses.\n       Having a union and a legally binding contract has made a \n     real difference in the lives of UAW members who work as \n     dealers and assistant floor supervisors. Hundreds of dealers \n     have been promoted to benefited and supervisory positions \n     because of provisions in the contract that maintain minimum \n     percentages of full-time, part-time and supervisory \n     positions. Work rules, wages, and benefits have all improved \n     because of the right to collectively bargain. H.R. 511 would \n     put all of these hard fought gains in jeopardy. Under the \n     terms of this bill, when a labor contract expires, a tribe \n     could unilaterally terminate the bargaining relationship with \n     the union without legal consequence under the NLRA, because \n     the employer's obligation to bargain could be eliminated.\n       H.R. 511 seeks to overturn a decision by the National Labor \n     Relations Board (NLRB) in San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, \n     341 NLRB No. 138 (2004). In that decision the Board concluded \n     that applying the NLRA would not interfere with the tribe's \n     autonomy and the effects of the NLRA would not ``extend \n     beyond the tribe's business enterprise and regulate \n     intramural matters.'' The ruling does not apply in instances \n     where its application would ``touch exclusive rights of self-\n     governance in purely intramural matters'' or ``abrogate \n     Indian treaty rights.'' The NLRB has taken a nuanced view on \n     this matter and has ruled on a case-by-case basis. \n     Congressional interference is not justified. Finally, it \n     would create a dangerous precedent that could be used to \n     weaken hard fought worker and civil right protections for \n     employees on tribal lands (minimum wage, OSHA, ERISA).\n       At a time of growing wealth inequality and shrinking middle \n     class, the last thing Congress should do is deprive workers \n     of their legally enforceable right to form unions and bargain \n     collectively. We urge you to oppose H.R. 511.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Josh Nassar,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Brotherhood\n\n\n                                                 of Teamsters,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2015.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: The International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters urges you to oppose H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor \n     Sovereignty Act (H.R. 511). This legislation would exempt all \n     tribally-owned and--operated commercial enterprises on Indian \n     lands broadly defined from the National Labor Relations Act \n     (NLRA).\n       If H.R. 511 were to become law, hundreds of thousands of \n     workers at these enterprises, including Teamsters, would be \n     stripped of their protections and rights under the NLRA, \n     including the right to organize and collective bargaining. It \n     would deprive both tribal members and non-member employees of \n     the right to form or join unions and to bargain collectively \n     for better wages, hours, and working conditions. We should be \n     working to expand the rights and ability of workers to earn a \n     decent living for themselves and their families and to secure \n     a safe and healthy workplace.\n       While tribal casinos have been the focus of discussion, \n     this legislation affects not just casino workers. Since the \n     1980's tribes have expanded business interests beyond \n     casinos. They now operate many different revenue producing \n     commercial enterprises--construction companies, mining \n     operations, power plants, hotels, water parks and ski \n     resorts, to name a few.\n       In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) (in San \n     Manuel) ruled that tribal casino workers should have NLRA \n     protections. Shortly after the San Manuel decision, \n     legislation, in the form of amendments, was twice offered to \n     block the NLRB from enforcing the San Manuel decision. These \n     amendments were rejected. Since then, the NLRB has proceeded \n     in a measured fashion asserting jurisdiction on a case-by-\n     case basis.\n       The NLRB will not assert jurisdiction where it would \n     interfere with internal governance rights in purely \n     intramural matters or abrogate treaty rights. Otherwise, the \n     NLRB will protect workers' rights at tribally owned \n     enterprises by asserting jurisdiction. With its case-by-case \n     approach, San Manuel takes a careful approach to balancing \n     tribal sovereignty interests with Federal labor law.\n       It should be noted that other important federal laws that \n     protect workers apply to Indian businesses, such as the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and Title \n     III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Indeed, courts \n     have denied attempts to gain exemptions on numerous occasions \n     ruling commercial tribal enterprises should not be excluded \n     from such laws. NLRA rights and protections should not be \n     treated differently.\n       Proponents assert that they are seeking the same exemption \n     as state and local governments. However, this is wrong. The \n     NLRA only exempts actual government employees and not private \n     sector employees performing contracted out government \n     functions. Also, a substantial majority of workers at these \n     enterprises are not Indian or tribe members, and thus have no \n     ability to influence tribal governance, since non-tribal \n     members are prohibited from petitioning a tribe.\n       The bill could also undermine enforcement of existing labor \n     contracts and the decision workers made to organize and \n     bargain collectively. When a collective bargaining agreement \n     expires, a tribe could unilaterally terminate the \n     relationship with the union without consequence under the \n     NLRA. The employer's obligation to bargain could be \n     eliminated.\n       Employees of tribal enterprises have no constitutional \n     rights to protect against employers. Only the NLRA gives them \n     free speech rights. Absent the NLRA they have no protection. \n     Workers cannot be left without any legally enforceable right \n     to form unions and bargain collectively just because they are \n     employed by at tribally owned enterprise.\n       Finally, the United States requires its trading partners to \n     implement and abide by internationally recognized labor \n     standards, while H.R. 511 deprives workers at these tribal \n     enterprises of these core rights: the right to organize and \n     bargain collectively.\n       To focus solely on the NLRA raises the question of the true \n     motivation for this legislation. It is regrettable that the \n     principle of tribal sovereignty is being used to cloak an \n     attack on the basic rights of workers to organize and bargain \n     collectively. The Teamsters Union respects tribal \n     sovereignty. However, we do not believe that this principle \n     should be used to deny workers their collective bargaining \n     rights and freedom of association. We urge you to oppose the \n     Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act and to Vote No on H.R. 511.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James P.

This bill is a blatant attack \n     upon hardworking families, and their right to organize and \n     earn a better life. As such, we will be scoring HR 511 in our \n     upcoming congressional scorecard. We urge you to stand with \n     millions of hard-working men and women and vote against this \n     bill.\n       Our union family is proud to represent 1,000 men and women \n     who work hard every single day to support their families at \n     casinos that operate on Indian land. If this proposed \n     legislation passes, their ability to negotiate a better life, \n     their rights, and the rights of countless others, will be \n     forever worsened.\n       Every American, and every worker, has the right to earn a \n     better life, and those rights should never be jeopardized or \n     taken away.\n       We urge, regardless of party, to do what is right for your \n     constituents, hardworking families, and this nation and vote \n     NO of HR511.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anthony M. Perrone,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose the \n     Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act (H.R. 511), which would deny \n     protection under the National Labor Relations Act to a large \n     number of workers who are employed by tribal-owned and -\n     operated enterprises located on Indian land. Among these \n     workers are over 600,000 tribal casino workers, the vast \n     majority of whom are not Native Americans. In recent years, \n     there has been a substantial expansion of enterprises that \n     would be impacted by this legislation--not only casinos, but \n     mining operations, power plants,\n\n[[Page H8270]]\n\n     smoke shops, saw mills, construction companies, ski resorts, \n     high-tech firms, hotels, and spas. These are commercial \n     businesses competing with non-Indian enterprises. The Tribal \n     Labor Sovereignty Act, as proposed, would strip all workers \n     in these many commercial enterprises of their rights and \n     protections under the NLRA.\n       The bill, introduced by Representative Rokita, seeks to \n     overturn a decision by the National Labor Relations Board \n     (NLRB) in San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, 341 NLRB No. \n     138 (2004), which applied the National Labor Relations Act \n     (NLRA) to a tribal casino enterprise.\n       In San Manuel, the NLRB looked to Supreme Court and circuit \n     court precedent to articulate a test for whether the NLRB \n     should assert jurisdiction over tribal enterprises, whether \n     located on tribal lands or outside them. (Before San Manuel, \n     NLRB jurisdiction was determined based solely on location: on \n     tribal land, no jurisdiction, off tribal land, jurisdiction. \n     Under the San Manuel test, the NLRA will not apply if its \n     application would ``touch exclusive rights of self-governance \n     in purely intramural matters.'' Nor will the NLRA apply if it \n     would ``abrogate Indian treaty rights.'' The Board in San \n     Manuel also considered other factors, including that the \n     casino in question was a typical commercial enterprise, it \n     employed non-Native Americans, and it catered to non-Native \n     American customers.\n       In San Manuel, the Board concluded that applying the NLRA \n     would not interfere with the tribe's autonomy, and the \n     effects of the NLRA would not ``extend beyond the tribe's \n     business enterprise and regulate intramural matters.'' \n     However, the test articulated in San Manuel provides for a \n     careful balancing of the tribal sovereignty interests with \n     the Federal Labor law protections provided through the NLRA. \n     In a companion case, the Board tipped the balance the other \n     way, and the NLRB didn't assert jurisdiction. Yukon Kuskokwim \n     Health Corporation, 341 NLRB No. 139 (2004).\n       The AFL-CIO does support the principle of sovereignty for \n     tribal governments, but does not believe this principle \n     should be used to deny workers their collective bargaining \n     rights and freedom of association. While the AFL-CIO \n     continues to support the concept of tribal sovereignty in \n     truly internal, self-governance matters, it is in no position \n     to repudiate fundamental human rights that belong to every \n     worker in every nation. Workers cannot be left without any \n     legally enforceable right to form unions and bargain \n     collectively in instances where they are working for a tribal \n     enterprise which is simply a commercial operation competing \n     with non-tribal businesses.\n       This view has been confirmed by the International Labor \n     Organization (ILO), an agency of the United Nations, in \n     response to a question about whether excluding workers \n     employed on tribal lands from the NLRA would be in conformity \n     with the principles of freedom of Association which are at \n     the core of the ILO Constitution and the ILO's Fundamental \n     Principles and Rights at Work. In response, the Director for \n     the International Labour Standards Division wrote that in the \n     absence of tribal ordinances offering full protection of \n     internationally recognized rights, ``it is critical that the \n     State (the national authority) takes ultimate responsibility \n     for ensuring respect for freedom of association and \n     collective bargain throughout its territory.'' In other \n     words, if the tribes themselves don't guarantee these basic \n     rights, and many do not, the U.S. government must not \n     abdicate its responsibility to protect them.\n       Notwithstanding the importance of the principle of tribal \n     sovereignty, the fundamental human rights of employees are \n     not the exclusive concern of tribal enterprises or tribal \n     governments. In fact, the vast majority of employees of these \n     commercial enterprises, such as the casinos, are not Native \n     Americans. They therefore have no voice in setting tribal \n     policy, and no recourse to tribal governments for the \n     protection of their rights.\n       The AFL-CIO must oppose any effort to exempt on an across-\n     the-board basis all tribal enterprises from the NLRA, without \n     regard to a specific review of all the circumstances, as is \n     currently provided by current NLRB standards. Where the \n     enterprise is mainly comprised of Native American employees, \n     with mainly Native American customers, and involving self-\n     governance or intramural affairs, that may be the appropriate \n     result. However, where the business employs primarily non-\n     Native American employees and caters to primarily non-Native \n     American customers, there is no basis for depriving employees \n     of their rights and protections under the National Labor \n     Relations Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Government Affairs Department.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   UNITE HERE!\n\n                                                    Las Vegas, NV.\n       Dear Representative: UNITE HERE represents over 275,000 \n     hardworking union members in the hospitality industry and \n     strongly urges you to oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act \n     (H.R. 511).\n       Quite simply, if this bill were to become law, American \n     citizens working for Native American businesses would lose \n     their U.S. rights under the NLRA, including ``full freedom of \n     association'' and ``self-organization'' without \n     ``discrimination.'' The legislation as drafted would exempt \n     all businesses owned and operated by Indian nations of the \n     National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) on broadly-defined \n     ``Indian lands''. Tribal businesses, including but not \n     limited to Indian-owned casinos, have workforces and \n     customers that are almost all non-Indian. Over the last 30 \n     years, as Indian enterprises entered the stream of interstate \n     commerce, a number of federal laws protecting the workplace \n     have been applied to Indian businesses: Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act (ERISA), Occupational Safety and Health \n     Act (OSHA), Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and National \n     Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\n       Congress should not treat the rights Americans have under \n     the NLRA any differently than these other important laws that \n     protect all other American workers.\n       In this time of growing income inequality in our country, \n     Congress should be working to expand the rights of American \n     workers and their ability to earn a decent living for \n     themselves and their families, not finding ways to take them \n     away. H.R. 511 is no different than the law signed by \n     Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin that attacked the basic \n     rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain. \n     Again, our union urges you to oppose H.R. 511.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      D.R. Taylor,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         United Steel Workers,\n\n                                                November 16, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: The United Steelworkers (USVV) \n     represents hundreds of workers in the gambling industry in \n     Nevada and Ohio, and has recently filed a Petition with the \n     National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to represent over 100 \n     workers at the Saganing Eagles Landing Resort and Casino in \n     Sandish, MI. Saganing Eagles Landing Resort and Casino is \n     owned and operated by the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe but \n     employs a majority of non-tribal workers. If HR 511, were to \n     become law it would exempt all Indian-owned commercial \n     enterprises operated on Indian lands from the protections of \n     the National Labor Relations Act depriving Indian and non-\n     Indian employees across the nation their right to form or \n     join unions, and collective bargaining for better wages, \n     hours and working conditions.\n       HR 511 would prohibit the NLRB from examining, on a case-\n     by-case basis, whether or not to assert jurisdiction on \n     workers' petitions to form unions and collectively bargain. \n     It is long standing federal policy that private sector \n     workers should be able to engage in collective bargaining \n     with their employer. In cases where Tribal enterprises are \n     involved, the NLRB, after a complete examination on a case-\n     by-case basis, determines whether the enterprise is \n     governmental or commercial. To ensure both fairness for \n     workers and sovereignty on tribal matters, the NLRB has \n     adopted a three prong test:\n       1. The enterprise is `exclusively involved in Tribal self-\n     governance and purely intramural matters';\n       2. Application of the NLRA would `abrogate rights \n     guaranteed by Indian treaties'; or\n       3. There is proof `by legislative history or some other \n     means' that Congress intended NLRA not to apply to Indians on \n     their reservations.\n       HR 511 would stop the NLRB from applying this test, and \n     deny workers the protections of the Act. Collective \n     bargaining allows workers to negotiate with their employer \n     for better wages and working conditions, and reduces \n     incidents of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. \n     Unfortunately, many workers in the gambling industry \n     experience sexual harassment and discrimination due to the \n     nature of the work environment. Woman are often required to \n     wear provocative uniforms and interact with inebriated \n     customers in a 24/7 work environment.\n       On June 16, 2015 before the House Education and Workforce \n     Committee, Gary Navarro (a member of the Pomo Nation, one of \n     the largest tribes in California, and a worker at the Native-\n     owned Graton Casino & Resort) illustrated this very point. \n     Mr. Navarro testified he witnessed fellow co-workers suffer \n     harassment by supervisors stating:\n       ``I became active in my union because of unjust treatment \n     of casino workers by their managers and how nothing could be \n     done about even sexual harassment because of sovereignty. \n     Exercising our right to organize turned out to be the only \n     way to protect ourselves and our co-workers. Don't strip us \n     of these rights.''\n       Since the 1980s Tribes have expanded their business \n     interests, operating many different revenue producing \n     commercial enterprises on Indian lands--not just casinos. \n     Tribes operate and employ both Tribal members and non-members \n     working in mines, smoke shops, power plants, saw mills, \n     construction companies, ski resorts, hotels and spas, gift \n     and farmers markets. Many of these enterprises are dangerous \n     with high incidents of worker injury and death, and jobs are \n     not typically well paid. Only through the benefit of \n     collective bargaining can workers be assured of improving \n     their wages, hours and working conditions, including their \n     safety. Because the vast majority of workers employed by \n     Tribal enterprises are NOT Tribal members, they would have no \n     ability to influence Tribal policy or governance.\n       In 2011 before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the \n     National Indian Gaming Commission testified that of 566 \n     federally-recognized tribes, 246 operate 460 gaming \n     facilities in 28 states, and that the vast majority of \n     employees (up to 75 percent) were non-Tribal members. That \n     same testimony reported in 2009 that tribal casinos generated\n\n[[Page H8271]]\n\n     gross gaming revenue of $27.2 billion, only a fraction of the \n     estimated $100 billion U.S. gambling industry revenue. As of \n     September 2014 the Federal Gaming Commission estimated there \n     were 733,930 people directly employed by the gambling \n     industry in the United States. Gambling industry jobs are \n     typically low-wage jobs, and it is only through collective \n     bargaining that workers can enjoy some of the profits from \n     their hard labor.\n       In 2004, the Bush Administration NLRB ruled for the first \n     time that Tribal casino workers should have the benefit of \n     NLRA protections, San Manuel, 341 NLRB No. 138 (2204). Yet, \n     since the San Manuel ruling, the NLRB has stepped very \n     carefully, taking jurisdiction on a case-by-case. Just this \n     spring the NLRB declined jurisdiction citing the 1830 Treaty \n     of Dancing Rabbit Creek and 1866 Treaty of Washington \n     stating:\n       ``We have no doubt that asserting jurisdiction over the \n     Casino and the Nation would effectuate the policies of the \n     Act. However, because we find that asserting jurisdiction \n     would abrogate treaty rights specific to the Nation.'' \n     Chickasaw Nation Windstar World Casino, 362 NLRB 109 92015).\n       Similarly the NLRB declined jurisdiction:\n       ``. .when an Indian tribe is fulfilling a traditionally \n     tribal or governmental function that is unique to its status, \n     fulfilling just such a unique governmental function \n     [providing free health care services solely to tribal \n     members],'' Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB 139 \n     (2004).\n       Finally, the Tribes asking for this bill assert they are \n     seeking the same NLRA exemption as state and local \n     governments. This argument is erroneous, because the NLRA \n     only exempts actual government employees and not private \n     sector employees performing contracted-out governmental \n     functions. Hundreds of thousands of private sector workers \n     employed by private sector contractors perform state, local \n     and federal governmental functions; thus, are covered under \n     the NLRA.\n       Casinos and resorts are not inherently governmental \n     operations, and casino employees are not performing \n     inherently governmental functions by serving cocktails, \n     running Keno numbers, or dealing cards. On June 16, While \n     Tribal witnesses asserted air traffic controllers and casino \n     workers should be treated similarly under the law as critical \n     governmental workers and be prohibited from striking, common \n     sense would suggest otherwise.\n       Finally, depriving Tribal casino employees of their ability \n     to gain the industry standard negotiated by their \n     counterparts working for hugely profitable commercial \n     gambling operators like Trump, MGM or Wynn Enterprises should \n     not be decided by Congress as a blanket exemption to the \n     NLRA. HR 511 would deprive thousands of workers of their \n     fundamental labor law protection under the guise of Tribal \n     Sovereignty. H.R. 511 is union busting--plain and simple, and \n     would deny Indian and non-Indian workers alike their ability \n     to collectively negotiate wages, hours and working conditions \n     and improve their lives and the livelihood of their families. \n     Please vote NO on H.R. 511.\n       Thank you for your consideration and please contact Alison \n     Reardon, USW Legislative Representative for additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Holly R.

He \nis a delight to work with, and I want to thank him for working with me \non this.\n  Policymakers on both sides of the aisle have long agreed on the \nimportance of protecting sovereignty of Native American tribes. Today, \nwe have an opportunity to prove that we are committed to that \nbipartisan goal.\n  In my packet here, I have literally page after page of tribes that \nhave supported this piece of legislation. To me, being sovereign means \nthat you are able to make your own decisions. What we are seeing the \nNLRB do is nibble away a little bit at a time at the authority that the \nlocal tribes have over local matters. Look, the political job I had \nbefore I came to Congress was being mayor of a city. I had more rights \nthan the Native Americans who occupy this land, many of them my \ndistrict, the Cherokee Nation.\n  The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015 is a simple, commonsense \nmeasure; but it means a great deal, particularly to those in the Native \nAmerican community. As tribal representatives have said, this bill will \nprevent unnecessary and unproductive overreach into tribal affairs. It \nwill empower tribal governments to make decisions that are the best for \ntheir people, and it will ensure the Federal Government honors and \nrespects the sovereignty of the tribal nations.\n  Just as importantly, it shows that we are serious about honoring the \ncommitments and making good on promises we have made to Native \nAmericans and broken many, many, many times.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 511.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support of the \nbipartisan H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act. I wish to \nrecognize the work of my colleague, Mr. Rokita, as well as the efforts \nof the Committee on Education and the Workforce on this legislation.\n  If enacted, this important legislation would amend the National Labor \nRelations Act to ensure that any enterprise or institution owned and \noperated by an Indian tribe would be treated with parity by any state \nor local government.\n  This legislation is necessary to reverse a 2004 National Labor \nRelations Board's ruling which increased the jurisdiction of the NLRA \nto cover tribal operations. H.R. 511 promotes tribal sovereignty and \nallows the tribal governments to regulate appropriate labor practices \non lands without the further overreach and infringement of the federal \ngovernment.\n  Because of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act to ensure that our Native \nAmerican citizens can achieve parity with other exempted governments.\n  Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 511.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing a \ndistrict that covers a large portion of the reservation that is home to \nthe Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians.\n  From my meetings and visits with members of the Pechanga tribe, as \nwell as with Native Americans from across the country, I know that \nthere is perhaps no greater priority than protecting tribal \nsovereignty.\n  In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling that, I \nbelieve, inappropriately applied the National Labor Relations Act to \ntribally owned businesses on tribal lands. That ruling was contrary to \nprevious court-established precedents because it clearly conflicts with \nthe Constitution's recognition of tribes as sovereign governments. \nThat's exactly why in 2011, a U.S. District Court in Oklahoma ruled in \nChickasaw Nation v. National Labor Relations Board that tribal \nbusinesses on tribal land do not fall under the jurisdiction of the \nBoard on grounds of tribal sovereignty.\n  Since that ruling, the National Labor Relations Board has filed an \nappeal and similar legal conflicts have arisen with other tribes across \nthe country.\n  Rather than allow these lawsuits and legal proceedings to carry on \nindefinitely, Congress should step in and reaffirm Native American \ntribal sovereignty by clarifying that the National Labor Relations Act \ndoes not apply to tribally owned businesses.\n  As a proud original cosponsor of the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act and \nfriend of our Native American tribes, I encourage all of my colleagues \nto support this long overdue bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). All time for debate has \nexpired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 526, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Res. 524\n\n       Whereas on Friday, November 13, 2015, three groups of \n     Islamist terrorists launched coordinated attacks against six \n     sites across\n\n[[Page H8273]]\n\n     Paris, France, resulting in the loss of at least 129 innocent \n     lives and the severe wounding of many hundreds;\n       Whereas the attacks on the Bataclan concert hall, the Stade \n     de France, Le Petit Cambodge restaurant, Le Belle Equipe bar, \n     and on the Avenue de la Republique in the 10th district, \n     represent the largest terrorist attack in Europe since the \n     Madrid, Spain, train bombings of 2004;\n       Whereas American student Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, of El Monte, \n     California, is among the innocent lives lost in these \n     terrorist attacks, with several Americans injured;\n       Whereas French first responders and law enforcement reacted \n     swiftly and heroically, in one instance blocking entrance of \n     a suicide bomber to the Stade de France, doubtlessly saving \n     dozens of lives;\n       Whereas seven terrorists were killed, most in suicide \n     bombings and one in a shoot-out with police, and French \n     intelligence and law enforcement are still pursuing those \n     possibly connected to the attacks;\n       Whereas French President Francois Hollande vowed that ``we \n     will fight, and we will be ruthless'';\n       Whereas NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that \n     the Alliance would stand with France and remain ``strong and \n     united'' against terrorism;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama stated, ``Once again we've \n     seen an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians. \n     This attack is not just on Paris . . . this is an attack on \n     all of humanity and the universal values that we share. We \n     stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance that \n     the Government and the people of France need to respond.'';\n       Whereas the so-called ``Islamic State of Iraq and Syria'' \n     (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack;\n       Whereas the precise coordination of these attacks at \n     multiple sites across Paris, along with the recent downing of \n     a Russian airline in Egypt and the double suicide bombing in \n     a shopping district in Beirut--brutal attacks also claimed by \n     ISIS--indicates the planning, operational, and logistical \n     capabilities of ISIS appear to have advanced significantly, \n     and their focus now includes large scale external attacks;\n       Whereas the continued and enhanced coordination of law \n     enforcement and intelligence efforts amongst European \n     countries is critical to inhibiting the movement and support \n     for ISIS-affiliated terrorist cells;\n       Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation, \n     law enforcement engagement, and information sharing on \n     emerging threats and identified Islamist extremists greatly \n     improves security for the people of the United States, \n     Europe, and our allies around the world;\n       Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Paris strengthens our \n     resolve to defeat ISIS and its terrorist affiliates which \n     pose a growing threat to international peace and stability;\n       Whereas France is an indispensable ally in our joint \n     coalition efforts to defeat ISIS;\n       Whereas France has long been an ally and friend to the \n     United States since the birth of our Nation, throughout the \n     major conflicts of the 20th century, and has provided \n     significant assistance to key United States strategic \n     priorities such as combating terrorism in northern Africa; \n     and\n       Whereas we stand in solidarity with our French allies in \n     their time of national mourning, ready to provide assistance \n     in bringing to justice all those involved with the planning \n     and execution of these attacks, as well as identifying and \n     thwarting any planning to undertake similar assaults in the \n     future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks \n     in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, that resulted in the \n     loss of at least 129 lives;\n       (2) expresses its condolences to the families and friends \n     of those individuals who were killed in the attacks and \n     expresses its sympathies to those individuals who have been \n     injured;\n       (3) supports the Government of France in its efforts to \n     bring to justice all those involved with the planning and \n     execution of these terrorist attacks;\n       (4) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign \n     fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North \n     Africa and the threat posed by these individuals upon their \n     return to their local communities; and\n       (5) expresses its readiness to assist the Government and \n     people of France to respond to the growing terrorist threat \n     posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its \n     terrorist affiliates.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 524, condemning the \nseries of terrorist attacks in France carried out by Islamist \nextremists last week.\n  It was just after 9 p.m. on Friday, November 13, when a night of \nterror fell over Paris, France. That is when ISIS launched three waves \nof terrorist attacks on the French capital, killing at least 129 people \nand wounding more than 350 others. At least one American, Nohemi \nGonzalez of El Monte, California, was killed in the attacks, while \nseveral more were injured.\n  The first wave involved three suicide bombers at the Stade de France, \nwhere thousands, including the French President, were watching a soccer \ngame between France and Germany.\n  The second wave involved shooting at several restaurants, bars, and \ncafes in an area known for its nightlife in Paris. A suicide bomber \nblew himself up on a nearby street.\n  And the third wave involved a mass shooting at the Bataclan music \nhall, where an American rock band was playing music. The attackers took \ntheater attendees hostage and started to systematically shoot members \nof the audience. They detonated suicide vests as the police launched an \nassault on the theater. This is where most of the killing that night \ntook place.\n  In claiming responsibility for the attacks, ISIS called them ``the \nfirst storm.'' The Paris attacks came a day after ISIS carried out a \ndouble suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, and 2 weeks after ISIS \nclaimed responsibility for downing a Russian passenger jet in Egypt's \nSinai Peninsula.\n  Indeed, U.S. officials, including the CIA Director, have warned that \nthese three attacks demonstrate a commitment by ISIS to conduct attacks \noutside of Syria and Iraq, reaching further and further from their home \nbase. And yesterday, ISIS released a video threatening attacks here on \nWashington, D.C., which U.S. counterterrorism officials are taking \nseriously.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are no words we can say today that will comfort \nthe families and friends of the 129 people murdered in these terrorist \nattacks. The victims included Parisians from every walk of life. And \nthere are no words strong enough to condemn these terrorists and their \nradical ideology. ISIS is waging war on anyone who disagrees with their \nviolent world view. And, frankly, they view everyone else as apostates \nto be killed.\n  Alarmingly, their fighting force continues to grow, thanks in part to \na steady stream of foreign recruits. More than 30,000 fighters have \nmade it to Syria and Iraq from more than 100 countries. Of those, it is \nestimated that more than 4,500 hold Western passports, with more than \n250 Americans among them. This ``terrorist diaspora'' is a plane-ride \nfrom Europe--and even from the United States.\n  This resolution puts the House on record as condemning in the \nstrongest terms possible the Paris attacks and extends the sympathy of \nevery American to those affected by this tragedy. It reaffirms our \nsupport for France, America's sister republic and oldest ally.\n  This is a time to not just express sorrow for those killed but also a \ntime to show resolve in this fight.\n  Our intelligence-sharing with allies, already strong, will need to \nget sharper; border checks will need to be improved; online recruitment \nof terrorists need to be checked; and coalition efforts to destroy ISIS \nwill need to be stepped up.\n  I urge all Members to support this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. First of all, I would \nlike to associate myself with the remarks of Chairman Royce. I think \nthat all of us share the horror of what happened in Paris just a few \nshort days ago.\n  Like so many around the world, we are heartbroken. We are outraged. \nWe are stunned. The perpetrators of these brutal and brazen attacks in \nParis are our enemies, just as they are the enemies of France. We must \nremain vigilant in the face of this challenge.\n  Terrorists, Mr. Speaker, want to make their enemies live their lives \nin fear and retreat from the freedom which underpins our society. But I\n\n[[Page H8274]]\n\nthink the fanatics responsible for this attack underestimate the French \npeople.\n  Across the centuries, Paris and France have seen far worse: a bloody \nrevolution, the darkest days of two World Wars, a Nazi occupation that \nmarched columns of German troops beneath the Arc de Triomphe and down \nthe Champs-Elysees. And all the while, the Republic emerged even \nstronger and more committed to the values of liberty, equality, and \nfraternity--values that we share and that bind the U.S. and France \ntogether.\n  The people of France will endure and the City of Light will shine \neven brighter. Last week's attacks were an atrocity, but they won't \nbreak the spirit of the French people. And as France grieves and moves \nforward, the United States will be standing shoulder to shoulder \nalongside our oldest ally in friendship and solidarity.\n  But, let's be clear: friendship and solidarity aren't all that is \nneeded in the wake of these attacks. What is needed is clarity, \nresolve, and action.\n  Clearly, ISIS is an enemy that must be defeated. So we need to ramp \nup our information sharing and intelligence efforts with our allies and \npartners to figure out how ISIS orchestrated this plot and to prevent \nfuture attacks.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  We need to keep pushing for a resolution to Syria's civil war, which \nhas created the conditions for ISIS to flourish. We need to increase \nour support for those on the ground in Syria and Iraq that are already \nfighting ISIS so that they can keep building on their recent successes. \nWe need to stem the flow of foreign fighters traveling to the Middle \nEast to join the ranks of ISIS and figure out how to counter the \nradicalization of vulnerable populations. And we need bring to justice \nthose responsible for the Paris attacks to send a clear, strong message \nthat murder and terrorism will never go unanswered.\n  These terrorists, they are not religious people. They are fascists. \nThey think they can use terror to further their political ends. They \nwon't succeed.\n  This resolution conveys our deepest condolences to the French people. \nJust as importantly, it shows that the United States stands ready to \nassist France in its time of need and to respond to the growing threat \nof ISIS.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Long live France. Long live liberty. Vive la France. Vive la liberte.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Rohrabacher), chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the \nchairman, Chairman Royce, and Ranking Member Engel for the great \nleadership they are providing at this moment in our history when we \nneed that type of leadership the most.\n  What we are witnessing is an attack on Western civilization. Radical \nIslamic terrorists are seeking to terrorize the West into a retreat.\n  We fought and defeated an evil ideology that would have implanted an \natheist dictatorship on the world not that long ago. We defeated this \nevil force, Communism, just as we defeated the Nazism and Japanese \nmilitarism before that.\n  Today, the West again is confronted with an evil force that would \nthreaten the world. Again, America must stand tall, and we must provide \nthe leadership to save mankind from this evil threat. We will defeat \nradical Islamic terrorism. We are Americans. We will lead the way.\n  We say to the people of France at this moment of suffering: \nLafayette, we are here.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff), who is the ranking member of the House \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the House's France Caucus, I rise to \nspeak today with a heavy heart. The barbaric attacks by ISIL-affiliated \nextremists in Paris on Friday evening were a savage attempt to shake \nthe foundations of the civilized world.\n  The victims, their families, and their loved ones are in our thoughts \nand our hearts, and we send them our deepest condolences in this \nenormously difficult time.\n  The indiscriminate brutality of last Friday's rampage has shocked the \nconscience of people around the world. But let us be clear, the forces \nof ISIL cannot extinguish the City of Light, and we will not reap the \npanic and fear that they are attempting to sow.\n  The United States stands with France today, as we have done for more \nthan two centuries, as a partner, a friend, and an ally. We will \nconfront this evil together and, in the names of all of those who have \nsuffered so mercilessly at the hands of ISIL, we will defeat it. \nViolence, intolerance, and repression are no match for liberty, \nequality, and fraternity--liberte, egalite, and fraternite.\n  I stand today in solidarity with the people of France and the people \nof all nations who would choose freedom over tyranny.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Latta).\n  Mr. LATTA. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, as co-chairman of the Congressional French Caucus, I too \nextend my heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of the \ntragic terrorist attack in Paris, to their families, Parisians, and the \nentire nation of France as we mourn the loss of innocent life.\n  We are unified in our dedication to the protection and preservation \nof liberty and committed to ensuring those who have perpetrated these \nattacks are brought to justice.\n  ISIS poses a clear and present danger to the United States and to our \nallies across the world. They are a threat to all those who promote \nfreedom. Our strength is in our solidarity. The United States and our \nallies, including those in NATO, must stand together with great resolve \nto defeat this threat and ensure the security of freedom-loving people \nacross the world.\n  I urge passage of the resolution.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly), a very well-respected member of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the chairman and ranking member of the \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee to condemn the November 13 attacks in \nParis.\n  This is a time of mourning for many families who have lost their \nloved ones. Let's pause for a moment to reflect on the lives that were \ncut short and honor their memory with a solemn promise to bring to \njustice those responsible for this senseless violence.\n  The violent extremists who carried out those attacks have wounded a \ngreat nation and an ally of the United States.\n  From the American Revolution to the liberation of Paris, our two \ncountries have established a special bond forged in the darkest hours \nof our shared history. The full measure of our creation is, in part, \nowed to the people of France, and we must come to their aid in this \ndifficult time.\n  In doing so, we must act not out of fear, but out of confidence: \nconfident that we have the means to maintain the safety and security of \nfree societies in which we live, and confident that those societies are \nworth preserving. It is in this manner that a liberated Paris will \nendure.\n  I support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Harper).\n  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, our prayers go out to the families whose \nloved ones were murdered or wounded in the pointless acts of violence \ncarried out in Paris on November 13.\n  These were attacks on innocent people by Islamic terrorists, \nrecruited, trained, equipped, and directed by a deranged group of \npeople known as ISIS. These are our enemies. They may be difficult to \nknow, but not impossible to defeat, and we will defeat them.\n  I commend the French President for calling this what it is: an act of \nwar. This is, indeed, a war declared on Western civilization--in fact, \nall of civilization--by Islamic terrorists who are so consumed with \npure evil that they believe that the slaughter of innocence is the path \nto paradise.\n\n[[Page H8275]]\n\n  We will never give up in this war. France is the oldest ally of the \nUnited States. In fact, a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette, whose \nassistance was integral to the birth of our Nation, hangs in this very \nChamber. If France is at war, the United States must be at war as well.\n\n  In the strongest terms, I condemn Islamic terrorism around the world, \nand I pledge solidarity and commitment to our French brothers and \nsisters.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York and \nthe gentleman from California.\n  I think many of us will come to the floor and emphasize that we stand \nwith both Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel for this very strong statement of \ncommitment by the people of the United States to stand with the people \nof France.\n  My heart cried and my soul was disturbed as the video began to unfold \nand the most heinous acts of attacking innocent persons, persons who \nhad gone to a stadium to be with friends and relatives; maybe fathers \nwith young sons; maybe families with two or three or four children, \nmaybe brothers and sisters, as was noted by one of the soccer players \nwhose sister was lost, who had come to see him play; maybe as the \nbeautiful young woman from California experiencing her dreams, a \nbeautiful designer--I pay tribute to her courage and inspiration--who \njust was enjoying the ambience and culture of France in the beautiful \noutdoor cafes that many travel to France just to experience. She lost \nher life, a beautiful flower, someone that America can be proud of, \nsomeone who was going to be a young lady who would obtain her dreams.\n  They didn't care about that. All they cared about was the vile \nviolence of killing.\n  So I am very much in solidarity, as we move forward, to not allow and \ntolerate ISIS-ISIL continuing their violent ways. I want peace, Mr. \nSpeaker. All of us want peace. But ISIL must be eliminated, and we must \ndo things differently here in this country.\n  We have been vigilant. We have changed our ways since 9/11. We do \n``see something, say something.'' But I believe as we proceed, we must \nact not out of fear, but of rational thought.\n  We must deal with the radicalization of young people; and the efforts \nof the administration, countering violent terrorism, extremism, has \nbeen an effective tool of meeting Muslim communities all over America, \nletting them know that if they see something, they can say something.\n  We must address the question of vulnerabilities in places like \nairports and large venues, not be shameful about enhancing security, \nbut recognizing that our values of democracy and freedom and access are \nvery important. I think we can do that. We did it after 9/11 with the \nUSA PATRIOT Act, and we have continued to do it.\n  It is our heritage to be free and to have a democratic process. It is \nour heritage to our friends who first established these tenets of \ndemocracy that we followed here in the United States.\n  So, to the people of France, we know that you will act, but we ask \nyou to be mindful of the wonderful leadership that you have given of \ndemocracy and freedom and the tenets of liberty. We know that liberty \nand freedom are not free, but it is important to be able to acknowledge \nthese horrible and outrageous and heinous acts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 524, and I call upon \nAmerica to be vigilant, diligent, but not to act in fear.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sorrow and outrage but in strong support \nof H. Res. 524, a bipartisan resolution that condemns ``in the \nstrongest terms the terrorist attacks in Paris, France, on November 13, \n2015, that resulted in the loss of at least 129 lives.''\n  The first two decades of the new millennium will forever be known for \nbarbaric attacks on innocent civilian populations by terrorists on a \nscale not seen since the end of World War II.\n  If the succeeding decades are to redeem the first two, then the \ncivilized world must act in concert, with one accord and one resolve, \nto defeat the terrorists who refuse to make peace with the modern world \nand instead make war on people who wish only to remain free and enjoy \nthe blessings of liberty.\n  Mr. Speaker, we stand in unyielding solidarity with the people of \nFrance, which like the United States, is one of the most welcoming \nnations in the world.\n  Right now, our prayers are with the victims and their families at \nthis terrible time.\n  Mr. Speaker, for centuries Paris has been known to the world as the \nCity of Light.\n  The title is richly deserved because Paris has been a world leader in \nthe march of human progress in the arts, culture, science, democratic \ntheory and governance, and in embrace the challenges and opportunities \nof the modern world.\n  Those who think that they can terrorize the people of France or the \nvalues that they cherish underestimate a nation that has faced and \nprevailed against far more sinister and lethal adversaries.\n  And they will again, but they will not confront these adversaries \nalone.\n  They will be joined by the United States and the other countries of \nthe civilized world.\n  The French are justly proud of their national motto, ``Liberte, \negalite, fraternite,'' (liberty, equality, fraternity) and no act of \nterrorism by cowardly perpetrators will succeed in leading them to \nrenounce their heritage of freedom and justice.\n  It is a heritage that we here in the United States share.\n  And that is why the civilized world must and will rededicate itself \nto combating and defeating radical jihadism.\n  And as has been done many times throughout the long and special \nrelationship between the United States and France, we will face and \novercome threats to our way of life together.\n  We will not bow and will never break; we will not falter or fail.\n  We will respond. We will endure. We will overcome.\n  The terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday were horrific acts on \ninnocent civilians perpetrated by depraved individuals who misuse the \npeaceful religion of Islam for their own misguided purposes.\n  Their horrible and heinous acts are their responsibility, and theirs \nalone, and for which they can be assure that they alone will be held \naccountable.\n  We will never forget what happened on Friday, November 13, 2015, \nwhich will be forever known in France and throughout the civilized \nworld as ``Black Friday.''\n  And we will always remember the many innocent lives cut short by the \noutrageous and heinous acts of terrorism that shocked and rocked the \npeople of Paris last Friday and earned the lasting enmity of peaceful \nand freedom loving people around the world.\n  I ask a moment of silence for the victims killed and injured in the \nterrorist attacks last Friday in Paris.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Wagner).\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 524.\n  Like all Americans, I was shocked and saddened by the terrorist \nattacks in Paris, France. As Americans, we must stand united with the \npeople of France.\n  The stories of innocent civilians being slaughtered on the streets of \nParis serve as stark reminders that we must do everything in our power \nto prevent this type of attack from occurring in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Investigations have revealed that one of the terrorists entered \nEurope with migrants fleeing the Syrian civil war. In light of these \nreports, it is essential that we pause the process of refugees coming \ninto the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, the attacks in Paris show the danger of open border \npolicies. The United States must not allow any refugees into our \ncountry without exhaustive security screenings.\n  My congressional district and the Greater St. Louis region have a \nlong and admirable track record of welcoming refugees fleeing war and \nturmoil. However, the safety and the security of the American people \nmust always be our number one priority.\n  We mourn with our brothers and sisters of France. I am Paris. Je suis \nParis.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nMesser).\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my prayers and \ndeepest sympathies to the people of Paris.\n  As Americans, we share in the shock, the horror, and the tremendous \nsense of loss you now feel following the ruthless, unprovoked terrorist \nattack against your great country. We stand with you against ISIS in \ndefense of our shared values of freedom, liberty, and equality under \nthe law.\n  Mr. Speaker, the world needs America to lead with clarity and resolve \nin the fight against terror. Contrary to the President's assertion that \nISIS is\n\n[[Page H8276]]\n\ncontained, the world now knows they are not. Hope is not a strategy in \ndefeating terror.\n  ISIS has openly declared war on America, France, and our very way of \nlife. We must respond. This is a war, and America needs to lead, \ndefeating ISIS before it is too late.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Yoho), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, first, I want to express my, my family's, and our \ncountry's thoughts, sympathies, and prayers with the people of France \nin their loss and in their pain. I am here to stand in solidarity with \nthe French people, France, and all the people and families from around \nthe world who lost loved ones in this tragic and cowardly act.\n  This is not just an attack on France and innocent people, but people \nin the West and all societies that love peace, liberty, freedom, and \nvalue human life, people who believe that their rights come from a \nCreator and that we are free to determine the life we choose to live in \na civil society, not forced to choose a life from the Dark Ages at the \nbarrel of a gun or live in the threat of terrorism.\n  I applaud French President Hollande in his rapid response and \nwholeheartedly agree and support his words that this will be a \nmerciless response. May the terrorists and ISIL's presence on Earth be \nshort. Long live France.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for \nthe purpose of closing.\n  Mr. Speaker, make no mistake, as we have heard from our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, the United States grieves with France after \nthese horrible attacks. The United States stands ready to assist France \nin its time of need. But we must look toward the root causes of the \natrocity and direct our resolve toward defeating the growing threat of \nISIS.\n  This includes intelligence and information collaboration with our \nallies and partners. This includes finding a diplomatic solution to the \nSyrian civil war. This includes addressing the refugee crisis and the \nseparate grievances and risks that this humanitarian crisis breeds. \nThis includes stemming ISIS's recruitment and radicalization efforts of \ndisillusioned Westerners to join their ranks.\n  We must address the complex and multifaceted layers that contribute \nto the Paris attacks all while bringing those responsible to justice. \nWe must send a clear and very loud message that international terrorism \nwill not go unanswered.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), our Democratic whip.\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for bringing this resolution to the floor. It is sad that we \nbring this resolution to the floor, and it is sad that too often we see \nthe results of terrorism around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support--as I think all Members will--\nof this resolution expressing Congress' solidarity with the people of \nParis and all of France after Friday's terror attacks.\n  Americans know that Paris is the ``City of Light.''\n  On Friday evening, 129 very bright and vibrant lights were suddenly \nextinguished, leaving a dark void in the heart of that city and in the \nhearts of millions across France, America, and the world. Our flag on \nthis Capitol stands at half-staff in memory of those 129 souls.\n  As we mourn them, pray for their families, and offer our aid to the \nwounded, we stand with a firm resolve to deny the perpetrators a chance \nto instill in us that which they seek: fear.\n  These attacks were carried out by individuals who follow a hopeless \nideology, who look with awe to a twisted image of the past because they \nare blind to a better future the rest of us can envision. Without a \nbelief in tomorrow, there is only fear and the acts of cowardice it \ninspires.\n  But the French Republic and the American Republic were neither born \nin fear nor do we live in fear. We were born in hope and in courage. We \nwere born looking forward. Both our nations were founded upon the same \nideals of liberty, democracy, and individual rights espoused by \nRousseau and Jefferson, Montesquieu and Paine.\n  The Marquis de Lafayette is the only substantial painting--other than \nthe Father of our Nation, George Washington--to be pictured in this \nhall of democracy, in this hall of free people. It was the French with \nthe liaison of Marquis de Lafayette as France stood with us for \nfreedom, for equality, and, yes, for fraternity, brotherhood between us \nand them.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, across the river from the Eiffel Tower, in \nthe middle of a major traffic circle in Paris, one can see a majestic \nstatue of his brother-in-arms, George Washington, raising his sword \nhigh in a triumphant salute.\n  Lafayette and his French officers suffered hunger and cold at Valley \nForge to help secure for the American people our freedom. Generations \nlater American Rangers scaled the craggy cliffs of Pointe-du-Hoc to \nhelp the people of France regain theirs.\n  Our history binds us together. So does our future. That is because we \nbelieve in tomorrow. Ever hopeful, we believe that the unknown which \nlies ahead can be shaped by our hands into a better world than the one \nwe know today. That is what sets us apart from our enemies. That is why \nthose who perpetrated Friday's attacks will never, never, never win.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. It is why, no matter what historians in the future call \nISIS or ISIL or Daesh, they will surely be using only the past tense. \nIt is why the people of France and America and all who cherish the \nfreedom to think, to speak, to worship, and to strive for a better \ntomorrow must stand together, as we have before, and shine the bright \nlight of our values and our principles into the darkness we confront.\n  We are all French today--nous sommes francais.\n  It will not be quick. It will not be easy. It will test our resolve. \nIt will test our will. But with Lafayette watching over us in this \nHouse, with George Washington standing guard over the City of Paris, \nand with Lady Liberty holding her torch high, surely France and America \nand all those who love liberty and justice throughout the world will \ncontinue to cast a light of hope, strength, and freedom upon our world.\n  May God bless our French brothers and sisters. We send them our \nsympathy, and we pledge them our resolve.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, let me just say in closing we have heard \nimpassioned speeches from all our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, and this is certainly something with which we agree, certainly \nsomething that Congress needs to send a very, very strong message, that \nterrorism will never triumph, that we have the resolve here in America \nto join with our friends around the world to stop the scourge of \nterrorism, and that we stand with the people of France in these very, \nvery troubling times.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, our hearts go out to the people of Paris. I want to \nthank my colleague, Mr. Engel, who worked to make sure that we brought \nthis resolution to the floor today working together so that we in this \nCongress speak with one voice--speak with one voice--about the attack \non France, the foundation, the heart of Europe, the heart of the \nEnlightenment, and the heart of the concept of freedom, liberty, and \nequality under the law which animated so much of the thinking of \ncivilization itself.\n  Indeed, it is an attack on that civilization. It is an attack on \nthose freedoms, the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the \nfreedom of assembly and democracy that are so closely held by us here \nin the United\n\n[[Page H8277]]\n\nStates and by our original ally, France, in our own effort to achieve \nthe dream of that freedom. It is that freedom that is under assault.\n  The unfortunate reality, Mr. Speaker, is that these attacks in Paris \nare indicative of a resurgent terrorism that is continuing to build.\n  I mentioned that there were some 30,000 fighters. Those fighters, my \nfriends, came from all over the world. They came from across the globe \non a virtual caliphate called the Internet in order to join Islamic \nState and in order to join what they call their caliphate. The intent \nof their caliphate is to put an end to the freedom that is enjoyed by \nthose that they consider apostates, the freedom enjoyed by civilization \nitself.\n  The great sorrow that we express here today on this floor is over the \nfact that, of those young people murdered and maimed in this attack, \nthe vast majority of them were under 30 years of age. They had their \nwhole lives ahead of them when they were targeted, civilians targeted \nfor this kind of mayhem.\n  Mr. Speaker, the resolve we show with our brothers and sisters in \nFrance is a resolve that freedom will be the rallying cry. Civilization \nwill be the test. Freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom \nof assembly under democracy are the rights of civilized people. Those \nwho bring barbarism and attack the institutions and attack civilians \nare the threat to that civilization.\n  We reaffirm our support for France, and we reaffirm our support for \nthe French Government and the words and the actions that they have \ntaken in the wake of this attack.\n  Yes, here in this Chamber we have Lafayette's portrait. At the end of \nthat War for Independence--and this is why his portrait is here--he \nsaid to us, ``Humanity has now won its battle. Liberty has a country.'' \nAnd after we achieved our freedom, France went on to achieve their \nfreedom.\n  But now liberty is under assault. That is why today we bring this \nresolution to the floor of this House, to say that America must \ncontinue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the French in their fight \nagainst tyranny, in their fight against this terror, and in the hope \nthat this will give an example to the rest of the world in standing up \nto ISIS and to make certain that our basic liberties are protected \naround this world.\n  I am going to quote David Petraeus, who recently gave us these \nremarks. He said that Syria is a geopolitical Chernobyl. He said, \n``Like a nuclear disaster, the fallout from the meltdown of Syria \nthreatens to be with us for decades, and the longer it is permitted to \ncontinue, the more severe the damage will be.''\n  We have had this relationship tested many times. France has had its \nrelationship with us tested many times. Tonight we stand together with \nFrance in our commitment to see this through and to make certain that \nISIS is not merely contained, but to make certain that ISIS is \nultimately destroyed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, we come together to honor the victims of the \nhorrific terrorist attacks in Paris and to condemn these barbaric acts.\n  These attacks claimed the lives of 129 innocent people and wounded \nmore than 350 others. Our hearts ache for the victims and their \nfamilies.\n  Today, our resolve to punish the perpetrators and destroy the Islamic \nState and other terrorists is only stronger.\n  We stand in solidarity with the French people. Together we will \ndefeat terrorism around the world and here in the U.S.\n  The Islamic State is one of the world's most violent and dangerous \nterrorist groups. To keep our country safe, we must be one step ahead \nof them, cutting off their funding and stopping their efforts.\n  As a member of the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, I \noffered an amendment, accepted as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, to direct the Secretary of Defense, in coordination \nwith the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, to shut \ndown ISIL's oil revenues and report on resources needed for these \nefforts. I also included language in the Intelligence Authorization Act \ndirecting the Intelligence Community to dedicate the necessary \nresources to defeat the Islamic State's revenue mechanisms.\n  The attacks in Paris underscore the urgency with which we must pursue \nthe defeat of ISIL. These murders foment violence, destabilize the \nMiddle East, and present a clear threat to the United States and our \nallies.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides to destroy \nISIL and strengthen the safety and security of Arizona families.\n  We stand with the people of France. We stand with all decent peoples \naround the world who respect and cherish life.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand agree to the resolution, H.

NO. 114-79)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Agriculture, \nCommittee on Armed Services, Committee on Education and the Workforce, \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce, Committee on Financial Services, \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs, Committee on Homeland Security, Committee \non the Judiciary, Committee on Natural Resources, Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform, Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, Committee on Veterans Affairs, Committee on Ways and \nMeans, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and ordered \nto be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the 2015 National Drug Control Strategy, my \nAdministration's 21st century approach to drug policy that works to \nreduce illicit drug use and its consequences in the United States. This \nevidence-based plan, which balances public health and public safety \nefforts to prevent, treat,\n\n[[Page H8278]]\n\nand provide recovery from the disease of addiction, seeks to build a \nhealthier, safer, and more prosperous country.\n  Since the release of my Administration's inaugural National Drug \nControl Strategy in 2010, we have seen significant progress in \naddressing challenges we face along the entire spectrum of drug \npolicy--including prevention, early intervention, treatment, recovery \nsupport, criminal justice reform, law enforcement, and international \ncooperation. However, we still face serious drug-related challenges. \nIllicit drug use is a public health issue that jeopardizes not only our \nwell-being, but also the progress we have made in strengthening our \neconomy--contributing to addiction, disease, lower student academic \nperformance, crime, unemployment, and lost productivity.\n  Therefore, we continue to pursue a drug policy that is effective, \ncompassionate, and just. We are working to erase the stigma of \naddiction, ensuring treatment and a path to recovery for those with \nsubstance use disorders. We continue to research the health risks of \ndrug use to encourage healthy behaviors, particularly among young \npeople. We are reforming our criminal justice system, providing \nalternatives to incarceration for non-violent, substance-involved \noffenders, improving re-entry programs, and addressing unfair \nsentencing disparities. We continue to devote significant law \nenforcement resources to reduce the supply of drugs via sea, air, and \nland interdiction, and law enforcement operations and investigations. \nWe also continue to partner with our international allies, helping them \naddress transnational organized crime, while addressing substance use \ndisorders and other public health issues.\n  I thank the Congress for its continued support of our efforts. I look \nforward to joining with them and all our local, State, tribal, national \nand international partners to advance this important undertaking.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, November 17, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/house-section/article/H8278-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
