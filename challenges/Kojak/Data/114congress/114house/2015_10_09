My district is very rural, and some of \nmy patients have to drive several hundred miles to see their doctor. \nAnd like Philip says, this could be like a trip to the Moon for some \npatients to drive that far.\n  Pilots for Patients has flown over 2,600 missions to date so far, 15 \nto 20 patients a week. They are part of a larger group of Air Core \nAlliance pilots that have flown over 20,000 missions a year. All the \npilots are volunteer, and I am proud to be one of them.\n  Pilots for Patients is a shining example of what goodness of the \nhuman spirit and working together can accomplish.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an example of the \nreal-life consequences of underinvesting in scientific research and \ndevelopment.\n  Last week, with the development of Hurricane Joaquin, we were \nreminded that U.S. weather forecasting is not what it should be. Our \nsystem, GFS, predicted that Joaquin would hit the Mid-Atlantic States, \nwhile the European model correctly predicted that it would remain at \nsea, and nobody predicted the severity of the flooding that would hit \nSouth Carolina. This wasn't the first time that our predictions have \nmissed the mark.\n  Three years ago we failed to predict the path of Hurricane Sandy, \nwhile the European model correctly identified that it would be a direct \nand devastating hit on New Jersey. After Sandy, we invested somewhat \nmore money into the computing ability of the National Weather Service, \nbut, as Joaquin has shown, it was too little, too late.\n  The economic costs of unnecessary evacuations are as real as missing \nevacuations. Scientific research requires a steady investment of time \nand talent to be successful. If we continue to underinvest in essential \ninfrastructure like weather forecasting, we do it at our own peril.\n  I urge my colleagues to heed this warning and to start taking \nseriously the long-term investments that our R infrastructure \nrequires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6940-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ENERGY FLEXIBILITY FOR OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 702. This measure \nwill amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 to repeal the \nPresident's authority to restrict the export of coal, petroleum \nproducts, natural gas, or other petrochemical feedstocks.\n  The bill specifically prohibits any Federal official from imposing or \nenforcing any restriction on the export of crude oil.\n  Why is this important? Because at a time when America's energy \ninnovation is at an all-time high, we can be a helpful strategic \npartner to our partners overseas that need energy and don't have to \nturn to unreliable partners like Russia, like the Middle East, and \nothers to have their energy needs met.\n  America can be helpful in that regard and, therefore, have stronger \nallies that don't have to be beholden to those other sources. It will \nbring jobs back home to the United States in our ever-developing energy \nsources.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the House today to support H.R. 702, to \nstrengthen U.S. options, U.S. jobs, and strengthen our allies in our \nability to be able to serve them with our energy development that we \nhave had in this country and, therefore, have a stronger bond with \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6940-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING BILL LEAVER\n\n  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I know we have very serious matters in \nfront of us today and facing our country as well. But I would like to \ntake just this 1 minute to mark the retirement of my former boss, a guy \nnamed Bill Leaver, who is now CEO of a health system called UnityPoint. \nIt is one of the largest nonprofit nondenominational health systems in \nAmerica.\n  I met him first more than 10, 15 years ago when I wrote a profile \nabout him as a newspaper reporter. I knew from the very start that this \nis a guy who understood the needs of the community, the needs of those \nwho needed to acquire health care and have access to quality health \ncare.\n  He was my mentor, my friend, and my boss. I wish Bill Leaver all the \nbest in his future. He and his wife, Jeannie, are more than deserving \nof having this next chapter of their life be one of their most \nsuccessful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6940-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MANUFACTURING MONTH\n\n  (Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate October as \nManufacturing Month, established to highlight the importance of \nmanufacturing in our Nation's economy and to draw attention to the many \nrewarding high-skilled manufacturing jobs across the Nation.\n  Each day roughly 1,600 American manufacturers open their doors and \ntake up the important work of job creation, keeping the U.S. economy \nthriving and inspiring our young people to pursue careers in \nmanufacturing and engineering.\n  Student tours like those in my home State of Florida also expose \nyoung adults to careers in the manufacturing industry like engineering, \ndesign, and robotics, tours led by the Florida Advanced Technological \nEducation Center of Excellence.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to join me in celebrating \nManufacturing Month and recognizing the many ways manufacturing is a \ncornerstone of our economy, both in my home State of Florida and also \nacross the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6940-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6940-H6941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRESS NEEDS TO RETURN TO THE REAL BUSINESS OF GOVERNING\n\n  (Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, if you look at the headlines, words like \n``dysfunction'' are being thrown around and there is a whole lot of \ndrama focused on the Capitol today. But people all around this country \nare not focused on that. They are focused on their families and their \nlives.\n  If they are focused on Congress, it probably has something to do with \nthe expiring pieces of legislation that are so important, things like \ntransportation, things like funding the government, all these critical \nquestions in front of us, yet the distraction of this leadership fight \nseems to be capturing our attention, but it is not capturing the \nattention of the American people.\n  I look forward, Mr. Speaker, to return to the real business of \ngoverning. We work for the public trust of the American people, and \nthis thing here is a useless distraction away from the real business. \nLet's pass the legislation we are sent here to pass, and let's refocus \non what the bread and butter issues are for the American people.\n\n[[Page H6941]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6941-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING PRINCIPAL GRANT HANEVOLD OF SUNRISE MOUNTAIN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  (Mr. HARDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HARDY.

He understands that \neducators must invest time and effort in their communities which they \nserve.\n  By incorporating teachers, parents, and community members into the \ndecisionmaking process, Principal Hanevold was able to get everyone to \nbuy in on his vision and take pride in what they were accomplishing \ntogether. This established a culture of success at Sunrise Mountain \nthat ultimately led to a remarkable 13 percent increase in graduation \nrates.\n  Congratulations to Nevada's principal of the year, Grant Hanevold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6941-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Harper), a member of the committee.\n  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, but, \nmore importantly, I rise today in support of American jobs.\n  The U.S. daily production of oil has increased dramatically in the \npast 14 years. That number is projected to continue to increase due to \nadvances in technology, but companies need a new market. At this point, \nthe ban is not protecting the economy. Instead, the economy is being \nrestricted, and Americans are being denied jobs.\n  My district and State rely on good-paying oil industry jobs. At a \ntime when our economy can't afford to see unemployment numbers rise, \noil companies are being forced to cut back their workforce. Lifting the \nban on crude oil exports will mean new jobs for Mississippians that \nwill allow them to support their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 702 and for \nAmerican jobs.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702, a poorly crafted bill \nthat needlessly and recklessly sweeps away 40 years of critical energy \nprotections for national security, our economy, consumers, and the \nenvironment.\n  H.R. 702 is a blunt object that doesn't just undermine current \nprotective authorities related to crude oil; it also prohibits any \nFederal official from taking any action at any time if that action \neither restricts or enforces a restriction on the export of oil. The \nterm ``restriction'' is undefined and potentially dangerous in scope.\n  The bill would also override any other law that would impose any \nrestriction by any Federal official on exports. That means that the \nbill does nothing to preserve any environment or safety statutes or \nregulations, and it doesn't even preserve the Defense Production Act, \none of the most important tools any President has to ensure our \nnational energy security in the face of a threat.\n  Let's be clear, Mr. Chairman. The President has already stated that \nhe will veto this bill. Further, any legislation of this nature is \ncompletely unnecessary since the President already has the authority to \nease or even remove restrictions on crude oil exports, and the Obama \nadministration has taken major steps to exercise that authority by \napproving crude oil swaps with Mexico and applications for the export \nof condensate.\n  The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that it is imperative for Congress \nto consider a host of factors before we lift the current restrictions \nand, certainly, if we are to completely dismantle our Nation's ability \nto restrict oil exports, as proposed by H.R. 702.\n  First, Mr. Chairman, there are consumer impacts, especially related \nto the price of crude oil and gasoline. A recent study found that \nchanges to U.S. oil export policy will have little to no impact on the \nfuture price of oil.\n  What we do know is that changes in our crude oil policy will lead to \na significant payday for oil producers, with increases in annual \nprofits approaching $30 billion by 2025.\n  Next, there are the impacts on our refinery capacity and associated \njobs, well-paying middle class jobs that have grown over the past few \nyears due to increased production. Unrestricted exports of crude oil \nput those jobs at jeopardy and could mean exporting those jobs and \nlosing out on critical investments in future refining capacity.\n  And finally, Mr. Chairman, there are, of course, the environmental \nand climate impacts of lifting the export ban. Energy policy is \nfundamentally linked to environmental policy. Each is a facet of the \nother. Increasing crude oil exports means increasing domestic \nproduction and its impacts on climate change, public health, worker \nsafety, property owners, and protection of our drinking water supplies.\n  As I have said before, this legislation eagerly embraces short-term \nprofits and benefits without understanding or even considering the cost \nof such a major action. We simply can't afford to make that mistake. We \nshould ensure we fully understand and consider the enduring \nconsequences of our actions and choose the cleanest and most \nsustainable path forward.\n  I don't believe, Mr. Chairman, that the potential impacts of H.R. 702 \non national security, on the economy, on consumers, and on the \nenvironment can be considered acceptable.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, increased crude exports certainly help oil \ncompanies. It is a bonanza for the oil companies, but without any \nguaranteed benefits for consumers. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nthe President in saying ``no'' to this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                        Parliamentary Inquiries\n\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. BARTON. My understanding, in general debate, the majority, or \nproponents, have 30 minutes, and then the opponents have 30 minutes; is \nthat correct?\n\n[[Page H6942]]\n\n  The CHAIR. On this bill, yes, the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce each control 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the original Democrat sponsor, have 6 minutes \nof the proponent's time to control as he sees fit.\n  The CHAIR. The Chair cannot entertain a unanimous consent request to \nchange the scheme for control of general debate.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an additional parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. BARTON. Could the Chair educate the illiterate Member from Texas \non how I could give Mr. Cuellar time that he may control on his side? \nIf I can't yield it unanimously, how can I do that?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas may yield from his own time to \nengage in debate, and may yield to Members on the other side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. BARTON. Continuing the parliamentary inquiry, if I do that, can \nhe reserve part of that time, or does he have to use it all in one \nslot?\n  The CHAIR. The other gentleman from Texas would not control the time.\n  Mr. BARTON. He could not reserve any of it?\n  The CHAIR. Correct.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for \nthe time to speak on this bill, which I wholeheartedly support, because \nending this oil export ban will not only boost our economy, it will \nalso improve our foreign policy.\n  I also rise with hesitation to a proposed amendment that would remove \na provision of this bill boosting payments to the 60 ships of our \nmaritime security fleet. These ships are essential in transporting \ncargo to the men and women of our Armed Forces who are serving overseas \nin harm's way. As evidence of this, 90 percent of all cargo moved to \nIraq and Afghanistan has been transported on these privately owned \nships.\n  As of right now, Mr. Chairman, the stipend provided by the government \nis too low to make this program viable to those who have stepped up to \ndefend our Nation against foreign threats. Without this increase, it is \nlikely that participants will drop out of the program. This, obviously, \nis a national security threat.\n  It is estimated that for the government to replicate this program, it \nwould cost more than $50 billion in taxpayer money. This programs saves \nmoney while enhancing our security, and I encourage my colleagues to \navoid supporting this amendment, but voting ``yes'' to lift this \noutdated oil export ban.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).\n  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong \nopposition to this bill.\n  I have been here in Congress for 21 years, and during that time, we \nalways hear talk about we want to be energy-independent in the United \nStates. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle always talk about the \ndream of energy independence, where we don't have to depend on any \nother country for our oil. It would change policy in the Middle East, \nand it would dramatically improve our national security. Well, the bad \nnews is, Mr. Chairman, we are not energy-independent. We use 17 million \nbarrels of oil a day, but we only produce 9 million, which means we are \nstill importing nearly half of all the oil we use.\n  Now, here is the good news, Mr. Chairman. Horizontal drilling and all \nthis oil we are finding in the shale formations gives us a chance to be \ntruly energy-independent. We could produce an additional 9 million \nbarrels a day, and we wouldn't have to depend on any other country in \nthe world for our oil. All we have to do is produce what we have in our \nown country and make sure that we have refinery capacity to take care \nof this light sweet crude, and we are energy-independent.\n  So the question is, Mr. Chairman, why aren't we investing in our own \ndomestic refinery capacity to keep high-paying jobs here in the United \nStates in the refinery industry, in the maritime trades, and in \nmanufacturing, like steelmaking? Why aren't we doing that for America \nwhile enhancing America's security?\n  We had the former commander of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold, testify \nbefore our committee. He highlighted ``the significant national \nsecurity risks associated with greater oil imports.'' He said that \n``too many times in recent history, the U.S. has made oil deals with \nhostile or unfriendly governments that actually threaten our foreign \npolicy and our national security objectives.\n  ``Lifting the export ban will undermine U.S. power projection \ncapabilities by undermining the competitiveness of our U.S. \nrefineries.''\n  Do we really want to undermine the U.S. military?\n  And then we hear the story that, somehow, lifting this ban is going \nto help our European allies because it will reduce their dependence on \nRussian oil. Well, that is a myth, too.\n  As Commander Lippold testified before our committee, ``the primary \nrecipient of this U.S. exported oil is going to be Asia, specifically, \nChina.''\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  So we want to export U.S. oil to China and still have to import oil \nfrom countries that aren't necessarily friendly to us. Why would we do \nthat?\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 702 is deeply flawed because it doesn't allow for \nany future oversight of oil exports under any circumstances. Even if \nthere is an oil spike or a shortage, there is no ``safety valve'' to \nensure that we have enough of this critical resource for our Armed \nForces, our industries, and our constituents.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, this bill undermines our national \nsecurity, and we are still importing an incredible amount of oil. This \njust defies common sense, and we should reject it.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Mimi Walters), a cosponsor of the bill.\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in \nsupport of H.R. 702, legislation that would lift the 40-year-old ban on \nU.S. oil exports.\n  In 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the ban into law in response to \ngasoline shortages and the Arab oil embargo.\n  While the ban served a purpose nearly 40 years ago, much has changed \nsince that time. Today we need an energy policy that aligns with our \ncurrent economic and political climate.\n  The United States is the largest petroleum and natural gas producer \nin the world. Our self-imposed export ban doesn't make sense and does \nnothing but hinder economic growth.\n  If the ban is lifted this year, over 57,000 new supply chain jobs \nwould be created in my home State of California by 2018, and nationwide \nnearly 450,000 new jobs would be created.\n  Having the option to put U.S. crude oil on the world market would \nbenefit Americans. Lifting the ban would create jobs, strengthen the \nU.S. economy, and help reduce our trade deficit. It would also provide \nthe international marketplace with more options, in turn, limiting the \nability of energy commodities to be used as political weapons.\n  It is important to note that this bill doesn't require the U.S. to \nexport crude oil. It simply provides the option needed for barrels to \nbe used in the areas where they are needed most.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time so the \nRepublicans can have another speaker.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hinojosa) at the request of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCuellar), who is my original Democrat sponsor.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support and as a \ncosponsor of H.R. 702, which lifts the ban on crude oil exports.\n  Modern advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have \nallowed the United States access to large deposits of crude oil and \nnatural gas. Last year our country produced over 350 million barrels of \ncrude oil, and that number is steadily increasing.\n  The crude oil in our deposits is lighter and sweeter than the \ntraditional heavy crude oil our refineries process. The export ban \nhinders our access to international markets that need the\n\n[[Page H6943]]\n\nsweeter type of crude and that have the refinement infrastructure for \nit.\n  I am convinced that lifting the outdated crude oil export ban will \ncreate jobs and economic opportunities for our communities as we strive \nfor greater energy independence.\n  In the great State of Texas, lifting the export ban is estimated to \nincrease the annual GDP by over $7.1 billion and create over 40,000 new \nsupply chain jobs.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds on behalf \nof the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. According to the Government Accountability Office, \nremoving export restrictions will create employment opportunities, \nexpand trade, and lower gasoline prices.\n  The economic and political landscape has evolved since the ban's \ninception in the 1970s. I am confident that now is the time to repeal \nthe ban on the export of crude oil to increase our economic and energy \ncompetitiveness.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 702.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green).\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n702.\n  In the past 10 years, the United States has undergone an energy \nrevolution. Our production of oil and gas has far exceeded all analysis \nor prediction. The success in the field has materialized into jobs in \nour district in the Houston area, both in the chemical and the refining \nindustries.\n  The price of oil dropped from $100 a barrel to $45 a barrel. Gasoline \nprices have fallen from $4 per gallon to less than $2 in Houston.\n  I have represented our refinery complexes for many years. All of \nthese benefited our economy and the consumer.\n  Unfortunately, the success has brought hardship upon the upstream \nproducers. The energy sector, which led our country out of the \nrecession, has now laid off approximately 150,000 folks. Bloomberg \nestimated that 40 percent of those layoffs were in Texas.\n  I know the oil patch is facing a tough and difficult time, and I want \nto help. That is why it is very difficult for me to oppose this bill \ntoday.\n  I support crude oil exports while protecting our domestic \nmanufacturing jobs, including refining. We have the resource. We should \nuse as much as possible here at home and sell what is left.\n  I am a legislator who would like to solve this problem, and I like \nworking across the party lines to get results. In fact, I worked with \nmy good friend from Texas, Joe Barton, on many issues during our years \nin Congress. In fact, Joe and I sat together for years at the Texas A \nfootball games until we realized A would lose when we sat next to \neach other. So last Saturday, when they beat Mississippi State, we sat \na ways apart so we didn't jinx them.\n  For months, I talked with Representative Barton about the crude \nexport issue. The crude oil export ban has been in place since 1975. In \nthe seventies, the United States was in a tough spot, and we put the \nban in place to protect our national interests.\n  That is more than 40 years of legislative history. Before we throw \nall of that away, we should make sure we have a policy that will make \nsense for the next 40 years.\n  I am hoping we can craft a bill that would create a process at the \nBureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce that \nwould establish an authorization and reporting requirements for crude \noil.\n  Crude oil is a valuable national resource, and the government should \nhave some oversight as to where and when we send it overseas.\n  We export liquefied natural gas through a process developed at the \nDepartment of Energy. I have not been a fan of that process, but we \nhave worked to improve it. We should have some basic requirements at \nthe Department of Commerce to oversee crude.\n  Unlike LNG, crude is a raw commodity. Unlike refined products, raw \ncrude oil doesn't have value added. Our refiners add value to that, and \nwe export that refined product. So those are jobs created in our \ncommunity.\n  Building LNG terminals and exporting refined product creates good-\npaying jobs and lots of capital expenditure. If exporting crude is the \nright policy, then let's do it correctly. Let's maximize the benefits \nfor the United States.\n  Let's make sure U.S. crude doesn't end up in the hands of North Korea \nor any of our other foes. We need to know where this resource is going, \nhow much of it is being sent, and how often it is being sent there.\n  We need to ensure that, if at any time, a potential bad actor enters \nthe marketplace; the Department of Commerce has the ability to enforce \nthe law.\n  The Department of Commerce is not an obstacle to exports.\n  In fact, I have struggled to find a more industry-friendly government \nagency.\n  The Department of Commerce has approved every application to export \noil in the last five years.\n  That's 138 permits.\n  What's more impressive is Commerce approves 99 percent of all export \napplications, regardless of product.\n  Now, I agree that the Department could approve permits more \nefficiently but that's something we can legislate.\n  That's a ``fix'' I can support and believe would help our upstream \nproducers.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to find that compromise.\n  I did not want to oppose this bill but without changes it is not in \nthe best interest of our country.\n  The time to address exports is now but we cannot just open the tap \nand hope for the best.\n  I do not want the United States to become a resource nation and I \ncertainly do not want to go back to the days of the 1970s.\n  I look forward to working on this issue again and hope that a \nreasonable, commonsense approach can be reached.\n  I want folks in all sectors to get back to work.\n  For these reasons, I am forced to oppose H.R. 702 and I urge all my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to \nwhat the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) just said.\n  The whole concept of this bill is to let willing buyers interact with \nwilling sellers in a free market, transparent fashion.\n  If you subject the bill to some sort of a discretionary permitting \nrequirement, as one of Mr. Gene Green's amendments would have done, you \ngut the bill. You destroy the entire purpose of the bill.\n  So as much as I respect my good friend from Houston, Texas, I \nrespectfully have to object to that amendment.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a \nmember of the committee.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman Emeritus Barton's \ntremendous leadership on this issue.\n  I rise today in strong support of the bill, bipartisan in nature, \nwhich will create thousands of American jobs, generate billions of \ndollars in revenues to States and locals, and use our Nation's natural \nresources as a counterbalance to the rogue actors currently dominating \nworld oil markets.\n  American energy brings security and independence to the world and \njobs and economic development to the United States.\n  It makes no sense that Iranian oil will soon be permitted to flow, \nbut American-made energy is left untapped.\n  It is time to end the outdated restrictions on the export of U.S. oil \nand, instead, work to create and protect tens of thousands of U.S. \njobs, enhance our national security, and help keep prices at the pump \naffordable for all consumers across the country.\n  American energy brings growth, prosperity, security, and independence \nto the United States and our allies. Our Nation should counter Iran and \ncreate thousands of U.S. jobs in the process.\n  Please vote for H.R. 702.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time there is on both \nsides.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 20\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 24 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the \ngreat State of New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), one of our original cosponsors \nand a strong proponent of this bill.\n\n[[Page H6944]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his work \non this important proposition.\n  Mr. Chairman, for almost my entire life, the Nation has worked under \nprevailing science that said we have reached peak energy, we are out, \nthat we have to plan for the future because we have no more oil.\n  Two years ago a discovery was found in New Mexico that will provide \nmore oil from that one find than has been produced in our State from \nits entire history through the entire geographic part of New Mexico.\n  The science was a lie. We are finding oil.\n  What is happening right now is that the refineries use a heavy sour \ncrude. The new finds in shale are producing light sweet, which is more \nvaluable. It is easier to refine.\n  Yet, that light sweet oil is sitting in the pipelines in New Mexico, \ntrying to get to Houston. It is selling at $17 below the market cost \nbecause there is no destination.\n  The Baltics have said they would use our oil, they would put our \nworkers back to work. But this law prevents it. The law in place, H.R. \n702, simply says: Open that door and put Americans back to work, \nAmericans driving trucks, Americans at the convenient stores. Americans \neverywhere get the jobs.\n  The idea that this somehow undercuts jobs is absolutely a frivolous \nidea to present on this House floor.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, over the past couple of months, I have worked \ntirelessly to find a reasonable compromise with the sponsor of H.R. \n702, my friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Barton), that would allow \nme and others with similarly situated constituencies to support this \nbill.\n  Although I share the concerns of many of my Democratic colleagues on \nhow this bill might impact the environment and climate change, I have \nalways stated that I believe in the all-of-the-above energy approach \nthat balances environmental concerns and economic opportunities.\n  Mr. Chairman, yesterday in the Rules Committee I advocated for an \nopen rule process that would have allowed Democrats to offer amendments \nthat would reflect priorities and concerns of the minority party.\n  In fact, Mr. Chairman, I myself submitted an amendment that would \nhave expanded access for minority- and women-owned firms to more fully \nparticipate in the energy supply chain, which we know will be greatly \nenhanced if the export ban is lifted.\n  Mr. Chairman, although my friends in the environmental community \nwouldn't agree, in my district, we say: Oil is not just a commodity. \nOil is indeed an economic opportunity.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Mr. Chairman, my most pressing concern is making sure up front and \nfrom the beginning that minority firms would be part of the pipeline \neconomy and would directly benefit from vendor and contracting \nopportunities that lifting this ban would create. Instead, Mr. \nChairman, despite positive rhetoric from members of the majority party, \na closed rule was adopted.\n  While my comprehensive amendment was not allowed, Members are asked \nto vote now on Trojan horse amendments that would do nothing to \nactually benefit minorities and women as my far-reaching amendment was \ndesigned to do. Rather than shielding the majority party from charges \nof creating a multibillion-dollar boondoggle for the energy industry, \ntoday there is not much in this bill as currently drafted that I can \npoint to as really benefiting all segments of the American population.\n  As I have said time and time and time again, cut us in or cut it out. \nCut us in or cut it out. Cut women in or cut it out. Cut the minorities \nin or cut it out.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we will put the gentleman from Illinois \ndown as undecided on the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nFlores), who is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee and a \nmember of the committee. He is from the home of the Fightin' Texas \nAggies.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 702.\n  H.R. 702 results in five key benefits:\n  Number one, it benefits the American consumer with resulting overall \nlower energy prices. This particularly benefits lower-income and lower-\nmiddle-income Americans, providing greater financial security for these \nhardworking families.\n  Number two, it benefits the American producer and allows them to \nfurther reinvest in our domestic energy infrastructure, furthering our \nenergy security and American jobs.\n  Number three, it benefits our geopolitical standing and strengthens \nties with our global friends and allies, and it hurts those countries \nlike Russia, Iran, and Venezuela who are opposed to American interests \naround the world.\n  Number four, it benefits the downstream refining community, as lower \nprices will stimulate volume demand for refined products. This volume \ngives them more financial capital to hire skilled American workers and \nto reinvest in their operation.\n  Number five, it strengthens our national defense by enhancing the \nMaritime Security Program, which supports a robust Merchant Marine for \nuse by our military during times of international crisis.\n  These are five critical reasons why everybody wins after we lift the \nban.\n  The President has threatened to veto this commonsense bill, and \nhardworking American families all over this country should ask: Mr. \nPresident, why are you putting the interests of Iranian terrorists \nahead of the interests of hardworking American families?\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject the Amash \namendment and to support H.R. 702.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Eshoo).\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this legislation for several reasons. First, \nexcept in very narrow circumstances, the bill does not allow any \nlimits--not any limits--on exports of domestic oil regardless of \npotential threats to our national security, and that is our top \nresponsibility as Members--our national security.\n  For decades there has been a bipartisan commitment in Congress and \nseveral administrations to energy independence and reducing our \nreliance on foreign oil. Given the continued dependence of our economy \nand our military on oil, energy independence remains critical to our \nnational defense. But with little consideration of any national \nsecurity implications, this bill allows unlimited exports of a critical \nstrategic resource.\n  Mr. Chairman, the United States still imports 26 percent of the oil \nwe consume and remains the world's top importer. Every barrel exported \nunder this bill would have to be replaced by a barrel imported from \nelsewhere, leaving us more reliant on foreign countries.\n  The bill allows the President to limit exports only if he declares an \nemergency under the National Emergencies Act or the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act or if he is directed by the International \nEnergy Agency to respond to an international supply crisis. Outside of \nthese narrow circumstances, the bill permits no restrictions on exports \nof crude oil. This means strategic considerations such as decreasing \nour reliance on imports from unfriendly regimes can play no part in \ndeciding whether to allow exports. I don't think that is a good deal at \nall.\n  The bill also will have drastic impacts on the U.S. shipbuilding \nindustry, tanker fleet, and refineries, all of which are critical to \nour national defense. Congress has recognized for nearly 100 years that \nit benefits our national security to maintain a robust domestic \nshipbuilding industry and commercial shipping fleet. For example, crude \nexports from Alaska which were legalized in 1995 must be carried on \nU.S.-flagged vessels crewed by Americans. This bill contains no \nrequirement that exports be carried on U.S.-flagged tankers.\n  Under current law, the President can allow exports of crude oil if he \nfinds they are in the national interest. This bill would allow \nunlimited exports regardless of whether they are in the national \nsecurity interests of the United\n\n[[Page H6945]]\n\nStates or not. I think that this is a slippery slope.\n  Commander Kirk Lippold, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole, \ntestified before Congress earlier this year.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole said the \nfollowing: ``The national security implications of changing the \nexisting policy regulating the export of crude oil are rife with \nunknown and probably unintended consequences that must be fully \nconsidered and addressed.''\n  I agree with Commander Lippold. This bill largely ignores those \nimportant national security concerns, and it is why I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe), from the energy capital of the world, Houston, Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the administration has worked very hard to make sure \nthe export ban on crude oil from Iran is lifted. But the administration \nhas threatened to veto this bill that would lift the crude oil sanction \nban on American oil. That doesn't make any sense to me--help the \nIranians sell their excess crude oil abroad, but prevent America from \nselling our excess crude oil abroad. That is nutty.\n  Why does the President prefer the Iranians over Americans? It doesn't \nmake any sense. The President should at least give us the same deal \nthat he gave the Iranians: lift sanctions on them, lift the sanctions \non American oil. We have a surplus. We need to sell it. ``Use all we \ncan and sell the rest.'' That is the motto.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I believe we are lopsided on the time a \nlittle again, so I would like to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Could we ask what the time differential is, Mr. Chairman?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 20\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARTON. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I am very honored to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton). Chairman Upton is \nthe distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from \nthe great State of Michigan and my good friend.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I really thank Chairman Emeritus Barton for \ndoing a really significant, good job on getting this bill bipartisan \nsupport and working so hard over the last 18 months or so, and both in \nthe last Congress and this Congress, to get this bill ready for the \nfloor today.\n  Mr. Chairman, much has changed since the ban on crude oil was put in \nplace in 1975. At that time, Congress and President Ford were \nresponding to the Arab oil embargo crisis in an effort to protect this \ncountry from the unwanted impacts of the unstable global crude oil \nmarket. But we got good news today. Times have changed, and one of the \nbiggest threats to the American energy boom today is not an \ninternational actor but, rather, our own ban on oil exports.\n  Lifting the crude oil export ban is a win for our economy, yes, it \nis. Study after study has shown that lifting the ban would actually \nlower prices at the pump, create thousands of jobs, generate hundreds \nof millions of dollars in economic benefits, and strengthen our \ngeopolitical influence across the globe. It will actually also reduce \nthe deficit by more than $1 billion with additional oil royalties. \nThese are real benefits that will be felt not only in southwest \nMichigan, my district, but across the country; yet, somehow, this \nadministration does not support this thoughtful solution.\n  Let's look at the benefits. According to the nonpartisan GAO, lifting \nthe ban could lower prices by 1.5 to 13 cents a gallon, real savings \nthat add up for every family's budget. Some estimates suggest that it \ncould support the creation of an average of 394,000 jobs. Additionally, \nthe bill before us would boost royalty payments, as I indicated, from \nFederal oil and gas leases. Collectively, all of these gains provide \nthe making of a success story that would greatly benefit our economy at \na time of great uncertainty.\n  This administration often likes to say that they are for an all-of-\nthe-above energy policy, but the rhetoric, indeed, falls well short of \nreality. It doesn't make much sense that the White House is gung ho to \nlift the export ban in Iran, but when it comes to this country, the \nanswer is ``no.''\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan bill would strengthen our \nhand in foreign diplomacy at a time when America has lost its standing \non the global stage. By exporting our excess crude oil, we can help our \nallies seeking a safe and secure supply of energy. Instead of being \nbeholden to OPEC and Russia for their energy needs, they can instead \nrely on their friends, the United States of America.\n  Creating jobs, keeping energy affordable, boosting energy production, \nand improving our energy security--that is what this bill does. I would \nurge my colleagues to support the Barton bill in a vote later on this \nmorning.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702. Not only does this \nbill incentivize more oil development while ignoring its impact on our \nclimate, it also essentially guarantees billions more in profits for \noil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers.\n  There are many more important issues that we should be spending our \ntime on to actually help American families, like raising the minimum \nwage and making college more affordable, but instead we are passing a \nbill to help oil companies make more money.\n  Additionally, section 3 of the bill prohibits any Federal official \nfrom taking any action that could potentially restrict the export of \noil. This broad language could seriously undermine critical health and \nsafety responsibilities of the Federal Government.\n  For example, under current law, the Secretary of Transportation has \nthe authority to shut down a crude oil pipeline if it poses a threat to \nlife, property, or the environment. But what if an oil pipeline leading \nto an export terminal were in imminent danger of rupturing? Would the \nSecretary still have the authority to shut down that line, or would \nthat action be considered a restriction on exporting crude oil under \nthis bill?\n  Mr. Chairman, these are not hypothetical questions. This authority \nwas recently used in my district to shut down line 901 of the Plains \nAll American Pipeline when it ruptured last May. Since line 901 is the \nonly way for the nearby offshore oil platforms to transport their oil \nto refineries, these platforms have had to shut down production \nentirely. Nearly 5 months after the spill, line 901 remains shut down, \nand there is no indication that it will be restarted in the near \nfuture.\n  It is not hard to imagine a similar event happening again, and the \nSecretary's authority to protect public health, property, and the \nenvironment during such an event must not be undermined.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Yet, if this bill were law, the Secretary's authority could be \npreempted entirely by section 3 of this bill. In other words, the bill \ncould create a scenario in which the perceived right of oil companies \nto export their oil supersedes our very real responsibility to protect \npublic health and safety.\n  The American people deserve better. This is a fatally flawed bill and \nsets the wrong priorities.\n  I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), from District One of the great Pelican State, \nthe distinguished Republican whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from Texas for \nyielding, but also for his leadership in bringing this bill to the \nfloor and building a strong bipartisan coalition to finally lift the \nban on oil exports.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a relic of the 1970s that doesn't fit with \ntoday's\n\n[[Page H6946]]\n\nworld economy, but it also doesn't fit with the revolution that has \nhappened in American energy because of American technology.\n  We have an abundance of natural resources now and an abundance of \noil. We literally could be the Saudi Arabia of energy. Yet, there is a \nlaw that is on the books that bans the ability of the United States to \nexport its own oil. There is no other nation in the world that has that \nlimitation on their ability to sell that natural resource.\n  Mr. Chairman, at a time when the President is actually supporting \nthis horrible deal with Iran that, among other things, allows Iran to \nexport their oil to the world markets, the President at the same time \nis saying he opposes this bill that allows America to export its oil.\n  What is at stake, Mr. Chairman? What is at stake under this bill, if \nthis bill passes, is it will create over 800,000 American jobs, good \nAmerican jobs, here at home.\n  If this bill passes, Mr. Chairman, we can actually create over $800 \nmillion to reduce the deficit, deficit reduction, just by passing this \nbill.\n  What is also at stake, Mr. Chairman, if we pass this bill? We can \nhelp our allies around the world who don't want to have to get their \noil from countries like Russia, where Vladimir Putin is using energy as \na weapon against our friends. They can now get that energy from us.\n  Creating American jobs along the way, everything about this says yes. \nIt is time to lift this relic of the 1970s. Let's finally allow \nAmerican oil to be exported on world markets when we have such an \nabundance and we have the ability to create hundreds of thousands of \nnew American jobs along the way.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Castor).\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Pallone \nfor yielding the time.\n  I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. The bill is an irresponsible \ngiveaway to Big Oil at the expense of America's national security, at \nthe expense of American consumers, and our longstanding policy of \nworking towards energy independence.\n  Now, our current policy is not a ban. You can call it a ban, but it \nis not a ban. It allows and promotes oil exports to strategically \nimportant allies, to places in the national interest. It is a smart \npolicy.\n  But now Big Oil wants free rein to ship America's natural resources \nto countries not in our national interest. This bill will eviscerate \nour thoughtful policy.\n  Despite assertions that the oil will go to allies in Europe and \nelsewhere, that is not supported by the facts. Who is most likely to \nbenefit? Experts say China. The Energy Information Administration \nprojects that China's oil consumption will double over the next 2 \ndecades.\n  China has been very aggressive all across the globe in exploiting and \nlocking down natural resources. They have gone to Africa. They have \ngone to South America. While we have been fighting battles in \nAfghanistan, they have been locking down contracts for natural \nresources in Afghanistan.\n  At the same time that America is dealing with Chinese cyber espionage \nand their geopolitical confrontations with our allies and the U.S., why \nwould we help China gain a strategic foothold on America's natural \nresources? I would think that America's national security interests \nwould compel you to defeat this bill.\n  You should also vote this bill down and side with American consumers \ninstead and American jobs. America is still heavily dependent on \nimports of crude oil. We still import 25 percent today.\n  Any claims that sending American oil overseas would help consumers in \nAmerica is entirely unsupported, no matter how many times they say it. \nInstead, what the studies show is that exporting American oil would \nfeed the uncertainty of oil markets and likely increase costs to \nAmerican consumers.\n  Back home in Tampa right now you can go to the gas station and fill \nup your tank at about $1.99 per gallon. So it defies logic to say that \nchanging this policy that is working for America right now would really \nlower the price. I don't think so.\n  American jobs are also very likely to take a hit if this bill becomes \nlaw. Why? Because of the important jobs in the refining industry, the \nshipping industry. Those are American jobs. Side with the American \njobs.\n  This bill is very poor public policy. Exports will be determined only \nby Big Oil to serve the interests of Big Oil, ceding complete control \nof this strategic national asset.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Just to close, Mr. Chairman, the cost to U.S. \nconsumers, our policy of energy independence, our national security \ninterests compel a ``no'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCincinnati, the Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Chabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I have the honor of leading the House Small \nBusiness Committee. A few months back we held a hearing on this very \ntopic. We heard from small businesses about how this ban is holding \nthem back. That is the untold story of this. This ban is hurting small \nbusinesses all across this country.\n  America is now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. \nLifting this decades-old ban is an opportunity to jump-start the \neconomy. It would help 1 million Americans find work. It would increase \nthe GDP. It would narrow the trade deficit, attract new capital to the \nU.S., and stabilize the global energy supply.\n  If America is going to lead the world in the 21st century, let's not \nkeep one hand tied behind our back. Let's replace outdated energy \npolicies with ones that are forward-thinking, ones that will create new \njobs in a new American century.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. David Scott).\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentleman, this \nbill is about two things. It is about jobs and it is about national \nsecurity. It will give us an opportunity to get Congress to join in \nwith my good friend from North Dakota, Kevin Cramer, and Brad Ashford \nfrom Nebraska, because this is about jobs and nobody needs jobs more \nthan African Americans.\n\n  The hardest hit on unemployment is African American males. This \nallows us to be a part of being able to get language in that will help \nAfrican American males get the kind of apprenticeship training with the \nTeamsters, with the AFL-CIO, with the operating engineers, all of those \nunions and contractors who are rebuilding this infrastructure for this \noil.\n  Now, on national security, make no mistake about it, ladies and \ngentlemen. What do you think Russia is doing over in the Middle East? \nThey want dominance over energy in the world, and he who controls the \nenergy in the world controls the world. That is why they want to prop \nup Syria, because that is the seaport to get it out of the Middle East.\n  Stand up for jobs for the American people and protect the world from \nRussia. Vote to lift the ban on the oil exports.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say ``amen'' to what the \ngentleman from Georgia just said.\n  Mr. Chairman, what time is remaining on each side?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 15 minutes remaining. The \ngentleman from New Jersey has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the entire delegation \nfrom the great State of North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the original \ncosponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman.\n  I have often said I don't know why it takes 36 Texans to do one \nperson's job.\n  I have to tell you, I was prepared to give a great speech and then I \nlistened to my friend from Georgia and, quite honestly, I feel \ninadequate to the task.\n  Because you stated it so eloquently and so beautifully, and I am \ncommitted to exactly what you talked about.\n  So maybe what I will try to do instead in my remaining seconds is \nremind us of the context that it was 72\n\n[[Page H6947]]\n\nyears ago this week that the Yom Kippur War broke out that led to U.S. \naid to Israel, which led to a 5 percent reduction out of OPEC of oil, \nwhich led to the very issue we are talking about today, that this \nhistorical context in a national security context is not irrelevant.\n  Let's not, I would say, let history repeat itself, but let's use the \npeaceful tools of energy development while creating jobs in America \nreplace the weapons of war in Europe and in the Middle East. Let's use \nour influence for good by selling this American-made product that is \nproduced by American workers, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion \ntoday.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Ryan), on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I am normally \non the opposite side of the gentleman on the congressional baseball \nteam and normally with Congressman Doyle. So I hope we can win this one \nagainst Congressman Mike Doyle. So I thank the gentleman for the \nopportunity.\n  Two or three points I would like to make, Mr. Chairman.\n  One, in Ohio, lifting this ban means 16,000 jobs in Ohio, almost $3 \nbillion in investment. Our friends, the operating engineers and the \nlaborers who are going to do that work, are supportive of this bill.\n  I know we have some issues with the refineries, and I think we need \nto continue to work on that and see if we can fix that issue.\n  We have a number of studies that say the savings to the American \nconsumer will be anywhere from 2 cents a gallon all the way up to 12 \ncents a gallon. Colombia University, Brookings, Aspen, Resources for \nthe Future, all are saying this is going to reduce the cost of gas, \nwhich is a direct benefit for our consumers and our constituents who \nneed it as we see this huge economic squeeze for the middle class.\n  Lastly, I have been sitting on the Defense Appropriations Committee \nnow for a number of years, and this issue here can directly benefit our \nability to deal with what is happening in the Middle East.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nOhio on the understanding that he will not play his best game against \nus next summer.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I yield back. No. I am just kidding.\n  I also would also like to say, sitting on the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee, we sit in these classified briefings and we see what is \nhappening with Russia, we see what Putin is doing, we see what is \nhappening in the Middle East, the Ukraine.\n  We need to export this oil. We need to export our natural gas. We \nneed to have a bigger footprint in the world so that we can make sure \nthat our allies have access to consistent energy flows coming here from \nthe United States and creating jobs here in the United States.\n  Michele Flournoy, CEO and Founder of the Center for New American \nSecurity, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under President \nObama says:\n\n       By lifting the ban on U.S. exports of crude oil, U.S. \n     policymakers have an extraordinary opportunity to enhance not \n     only our economic vitality, but also our national security.\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Peterson).\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.\n  I support removing restrictions on the export of crude oil from the \nUnited States. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 702.\n  Current export laws are outdated, as we have heard. Since these laws \nwere last visited nearly 40 years ago, U.S. oil production has \nincreased significantly and the United States is now the largest \nproducer of oil and gas.\n  Studies have shown that lifting the current ban on crude oil exports \nwould create jobs, many in the rural areas. We in our part of the world \nhave seen the benefits that domestic drilling can provide by looking at \nour neighboring State of North Dakota.\n  We need to do everything we can to support the use and production of \ndomestic energy. H.R. 702 is an important part of that.\n  Following this bill's approval, I hope all Members of Congress will \ncontinue to support an all-of-the-above domestic energy production \nstrategy by considering the national security and the economic \ndevelopment benefits of not just oil production, but of biofuel \nproduction and related products.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 702.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Sugar \nLand, Texas (Mr. Olson), a member of the committee and a sponsor of the \nbill.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, this picture shows why we have to end this ban \non crude exports.\n  In October 1973, OPEC cut us off. We were getting 1.2 million barrels \nper day from OPEC, and that dropped down to a scant 19,000. Gas prices \ndoubled. If you had to gas your lawn mower, you had to get in line \nbehind cars.\n  Because of American innovation, that world is gone. We are now awash \nin American crude oil. OPEC's days of dominance are over; but we can't \ndeliver a knockout blow until we end the ban on American crude exports, \nwhich we will do in a few short minutes. When that happens, American \nfamilies will have lower prices at the pump. Thug oil nations like \nVenezuela, Russia, and Iran will lose bite.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, we will create thousands and thousands and \nthousands of good-paying American jobs.\n  I ask my colleagues vote today to end the ban on crude oil exports.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the \ngreat Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Stivers), a member of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his \nextraordinary work on this bill.\n  This bill is important for our national security. It is important for \njobs. We need to end the oil export ban so that we can export oil that \nhas been generated as part of this energy revolution in this country \nthat is going to be great for jobs and help our national security \npartners around the world.\n  Let's make the world safer. Let's give America more jobs. Let's end \nthe oil export ban. Please support this bill today.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, this is ill-advised legislation.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle claim 800,000 jobs, a \nmillion jobs. They don't have any real defined ability to provide such \nan estimate. Actually, this is a number that is made up because, as \nsome of the speakers have acknowledged, there will be offsetting job \nlosses as a result of what is going to happen, for example, in the \nrefining industry or what is going to happen in terms of some of the \ntransport.\n  But that is beside the point. We actually have a policy that is \nworking. There will come a time, perhaps, when it makes sense in a \nstrategic matter to make an adjustment.\n  Right now, the President has the latitude to be able to help some of \nour strategic partners. He has that flexibility. We are awash in oil in \nthis country, and to expect that somehow exporting more of it is going \nto make a dramatic impact at the pump here is a pipe dream. It won't. \nIt might make a modest impact.\n  What we could do is provide a benefit to the large oil companies as \npart of a larger package that would help everybody. We have expiring \ntax provisions, for instance, dealing with the production tax credit, \ndealing with wind and solar that actually create far more jobs than \nwill be found in the refining and in the oil production. And these are \ngood, family-wage jobs all across the country\n  Let's put together a package that speaks to alternative energy \ncontinuity, that speaks to conservation, that speaks to a long-term \nstrategy that is a win-win. I am absolutely confident that Mr. Pallone \nand Mr. Barton could sit down and deal with a\n\n[[Page H6948]]\n\npackage that would have far more benefit for America.\n  If you are going to hand out another goodie to the oil companies, \nlet's have a more comprehensive approach that meets our comprehensive \nenergy needs. This bill doesn't do it.\n  Mr. BARTON. May I ask how much time remains, Mr. Chair?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 10\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the gentleman from New Jersey has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCuellar).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, the \nban on crude oil exports is an outdated policy. It was 1975 that it was \nenacted. A lot has changed since 1975.\n  I believe this bipartisan, commonsense solution is needed to develop \na comprehensive effort to deal with our energy policy in America that \ndeals with both our short-term and our long-term needs. I think we have \nto use all the tools in our energy toolbox, and I think this is part of \nthat effort.\n  New technologies have provided the United States with an abundance of \ncrude oil that is only continuing in nature, combined with our \nrenewables and our other energy sources.\n  We need to understand that this is about stimulating our economy and \ncreating jobs, and it also has a very important geopolitical influence \non bad actors, like Russia and Iran, who use energy as a political \nweapon.\n  I understand there are concerns by my colleagues about eliminating \nthis ban and the negative impacts it will have. I have some concerns \nwith small and midsized domestic refineries, which I have represented.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the \ngentleman from California.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, this is a work in progress. We obviously need \nto address a number of other issues with the Senate.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is important. It is about jobs, the \neconomy, and providing alternatives of energy to Russia and Iran, and \nthat is why I support this legislation as we continue to work together \nin a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from the Golden \nGate State of California (Mr. Hunter), a distinguished subcommittee \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I am voting for this bill overall.\n  In California, we don't drill anymore, and we are cutting down on our \nrefineries even, but this is important for the Nation.\n  One big part of this bill is the Maritime Security Program. If you \ndon't know it, over 90 percent of all the stuff that we transfer to \nIraq, Afghanistan, anywhere where there are American troops--all of \ntheir gear, their tanks, their weapons, their ammo, everything, for the \nmost part--is shipped on American-flag commercial vessels.\n  Of the 50,000 cargo ships that travel the ocean every day, 79 of \nthose are American-flag. That is it, 79 out of 50,000. Sixty of those \nare on call when America needs them to transfer our gear to our troops \noverseas.\n  When I was a lieutenant in the Marine Corps, on my second tour in \n2004, I drove down to the San Diego Port with my Marine battery, and we \nloaded up all the equipment that we would then fall in on in Iraq 2 \nmonths later.\n  Without the Maritime Security Program plus-up that is in this bill, \nwe would not be able to go fight wars. We would not be able to move our \nequipment. We would not be able to support our troops.\n  This is a national security bill. It is not only national security \nbecause it is energy security, but it is national security because that \nis how we support our troops overseas is with the Maritime Security \nProgram, which this bill pluses up.\n  I just want to say thank you to the chairman and everybody who \nsupports this.\n  I would urge my colleagues to not just support energy security, but \nsupport national security.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I had planned to \nsupport this bill, as a matter of fact, as a cosponsor; but since I \nhave been unable to remove myself from the cosponsorship, I wish to \nspeak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill.\n  While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all \nenergy sources to meet our Nation's current and future needs, I believe \nthat this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for \nsuch a major change in our Nation's energy policy. The bill does not \nappropriately consider the implications of our national security, the \neconomy, consumers, and, especially, the environment.\n  Exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively \nincrease the number of U.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, \nmany U.S. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may \nbe threatened.\n  In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes \nwould likely increase overall CO2 emissions.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, the bottom line is \nthat we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio \nbefore we lift any current restrictions.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. Since I am unable \nto remove myself as a cosponsor of the legislation, I would like to \nspeak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill.\n  While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all \nenergy sources to meet our nation's current and future needs, I believe \nthat this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for \nsuch a major change in our nation's energy policy. The bill does not \nappropriately consider the implications for our national security, the \neconomy, consumers, and especially the environment. Exporting crude oil \ndoes not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of \nU.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, many U.S. jobs that \nare downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened.\n  In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes \nwill likely increase overall CO2 emissions, thus amplifying \nthe impacts of climate change. Facing the challenge of climate change \nrequires us to be responsible and accountable for our own natural \nresources. This bill does not provide any recourse to mitigate or even \nexamine these potential impacts, and thus ignores this responsibility \nentirely.\n  It should be noted that the Obama Administration has made every \neffort to compromise by easing export restrictions where appropriate \nafter careful review. The Commerce Department recently approved limited \ncrude oil exchanges with Mexico. However, the President believes that \nunilaterally lifting the export ban is excessive, and I join him in his \nopposition. Lifting the crude oil ban for short-term gains with no \naccounting of the costs that will be incurred is ill-advised and short-\nsighted.\n  The bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our \nenergy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. Without \nserious deliberation and oversight of the potential environmental and \neconomic impacts of such as significant shift in our national energy \npolicy, I must urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the \nPeach State of Georgia (Mr. Bishop) on behalf of the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I come to the floor today to \nexpress my support of H.R. 702, much-needed legislation which will lift \nthe arbitrary ban on the export of one of our country's most abundant \nnatural resources: crude oil.\n  The current ban on exports is a relic of a different time before we \nas a nation knew just how much crude oil we have stored in the earth \nacross this country. We are entirely too dependent on foreign oil \nsources, particularly from countries who have no regard for the \nAmerican economy.\n  Today is different. In fact, from the period between 2000 and 2013, \nU.S. production of crude oil increased by nearly fourteenfold, from \n250,000 barrels per day to 3.5 million. With this large amount of \nexcess capacity, we can sell our oil to the global markets, which will \nbring U.S. crude prices in line with global prices, and global prices \nwill go\n\n[[Page H6949]]\n\ndown because of the increased supply. No less than 68 percent of \nconsumers' cost of gasoline--and 57 percent for diesel fuel--come from \nthe price of the source: crude oil.\n  Numerous studies have shown that the increased global supply will \nlead to lower prices at the pump. Not only will consumers have more \nmoney to spend on school supplies, food, clothing, and other household \nstaples, but the prices of these goods will go down because the cost to \ntransport them from manufacturer to store will decrease.\n  Possibly, more importantly, we have to consider the security \nimplications of allowing the export of crude.\n  We are in the position of showing the world that we can provide a \nstable source of energy to friendly countries around the globe. Our \nsupplies will dilute the market share of unfriendly countries and \nweaken their grip on our democratic ally nations who have to depend on \nsome of our unfriendly countries for their oil supplies. We can provide \nan alternative source to those who don't want to support our \nadversaries and their adversaries.\n  So I thank my colleagues Mr. Cuellar and Mr. Barton for bringing \nforth this critically important legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 702.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only have two speakers, myself and Mr. \nCuellar. I believe I have the right to close, so I would ask my friend \nfrom New Jersey how many speakers he still has.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Just myself and Mr. Garamendi remain.\n  Mr. BARTON. Well, at this time, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains on my \nside?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Garamendi).\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, we have before us a very, very important \nissue. It is a national security issue. My good friend from San Diego \nspoke to one part of our Nation's security, and that is the ability of \nthis Nation to move its interests around the world not just with \nairplanes, but with ships.\n  Unfortunately, this is a very narrowly constructed piece of \nlegislation that speaks to the interests of the petroleum industry and \nthe many thousands of people who work there. We concede that. But this \nbill could also be a boon to another part of our Nation's security, and \nthat is our maritime industry. Unfortunately, the bill does not do \nthat.\n  While it does deal with the Maritime Security Program--and that is \ngood--it does not deal in full potential with what we can do, and that \nis to require that this strategic asset, oil, be shipped on American-\nbuilt ships with American mariners. That is not in the bill. It should \nbe. It could be.\n  If it were, our shipyards and our mariners all around this Nation \nwould have tens of thousands of jobs, and we would secure yet not only \nthe interest of our petroleum industry but, also, the interest of our \nmaritime industry as well as the shipyards upon which this Nation's \nnational defense depends. Put it in the bill. Then let's see how many \nvotes you can get.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Cuellar), my chief sponsor, the gentleman that represents \nsouth Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale.\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Barton for the leadership he has \nprovided on this bill.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 702 that repeals the ban on crude oil. This \nban reflects an America of yesterday. It is our job, as Members of \nCongress, that our laws reflect the America of tomorrow.\n  If you look at why this is important, this ban hurts the economy and \nprevents the creation of jobs. This ban imposes an estimated $200 to \n$300 billion cost to the economy and discourages domestic, made-in-\nAmerica crude oil production.\n  By lifting the ban now, we will create 359,000 new jobs. How do I \nknow? Because I represent the Eagle Ford and I have seen small-business \npeople, men and women, that work very hard every single day to have \nthis type of job. And I think we owe it to them and across the Nation.\n  This ban also reduces the Federal direct spending by $1.4 billion, \naccording to the CBO. So it also helps our deficit. This ban is \nsomething that we need to change, and we need to make sure that we lift \nthis ban.\n  What about gasoline prices? You heard Mr. Ryan. You heard other \nfolks. According to the General Accounting Office, this will bring \nprices down from 1.5 cents to 13 cents. The CBO says the same thing: 5 \ncents to 10 cents. The administration's own agency, the Energy \nInformation Administration, says it will bring it down one penny or \nremain. It doesn't go up. It goes down.\n  This ban also doesn't allow us to use our powers in foreign policy. \nWhy are we allowing Russia or Iran to dictate what happens in this \nworld? This is why we need to make sure that we support the repealing \nof this ban.\n  Now, who supports this? Mr. Barton, you know it is a bipartisan bill. \nDemocrats and Republicans support this bill, but it is also supported \nby business, small-business owners, and by some of the labor \norganizations. We have talked to those labor organizations.\n  Mr. Chairman, support H.R. 702, a bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me point out that the administration, the \nPresident, has issued a SAP saying that he would veto this bill. This \nbill is going nowhere because of that veto and the potential for a \nveto.\n  All this legislation does is to give a windfall of $30 billion in \nprofits to the oil industry, no strings attached, no sacrifices \nrequired.\n  The legislation is opposed by over 40 environmental groups: the \nUnited Steelworkers, the IBEW, the BlueGreen Alliance, and the \nIndustrial Energy Consumers of America.\n  Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, it is supported by the American \npublic who, regardless of party, support investing in refineries at \nhome rather than lifting crude export restrictions. In fact, around 70 \npercent of voters oppose allowing oil companies to export more U.S. \noil.\n  The Republican majority has spent the whole week doing little more \nthan attacking women's health and assisting Big Oil for their big \nprofits. It is time to come together in the name of energy and national \nsecurity. In the name of common sense and economic good sense, I urge a \n``no'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3\\3/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we have had a very enlightening debate for \nthe last hour. I would say 30 Members of Congress have stood up and \nspoken either in favor or opposition to the bill.\n  I want it to be noted that a large number of my friends on the \nDemocratic side have risen in support of the bill. I want to compliment \nMr. Cuellar for his strong leadership in that area. This is a \nbipartisan bill.\n  When we do our town hall meetings, Mr. Chairman, person after person \nstands up and says: Why can't you folks in Congress get along? Why \ndon't you try to be positive? Why don't you try to do what is right for \nAmerica? Why don't you work together on a bipartisan basis?\n  Mr. Chairman, that is what this bill does. This is a bipartisan bill.\n  We have a large number of Democratic cosponsors and a large number of \nRepublicans. This bill will help all 50 States. As Mr. Bishop and Mr. \nScott have stated on the Democratic side, it helps low income, it helps \nminorities, it helps women. It helps every sector of the economy, not \njust the oil industry, not just the roughnecks, not just the drillers. \nIt helps truck drivers. It helps steelworkers. It helps refinery \nworkers. It even helps computer programmers. You name it, it helps it.\n  Some estimates are this bill, if enacted, would create as many as a \nmillion jobs. We know, for a fact, that the\n\n[[Page H6950]]\n\ncollapse in oil prices in the last year and a half has cost the U.S. \neconomy over 500,000 jobs, 750,000 jobs. Those are real people.\n  That is not Big Oil, Mr. Chairman. That is people that get up every \nmorning and kiss their wives, hop in their car, go to work and work \nhard 8, 10, 12 hours a day, get the bills at the end of the month and \nhope they have enough money to pay the bills. It is blue-collar \nAmerica. It is not Big Oil. It is everybody in this country, Mr. \nChairman.\n\n  This bill is a market-based bill: willing buyer, willing seller. The \nU.S. has the largest oil reserves in the world. We have the capability \nto be number one in the world. Why on God's green Earth don't we use \nit? Why are we the only nation in the world that is restricted in one \nof the blessings that God has endowed our great Nation with?\n  We could produce, if we wanted to, up to 20 million barrels a day. We \nare producing right now 9 million barrels a day. U.S. oil can go \nanywhere in the world if we allow it to. That is an economic asset. It \nis a military strategic asset. All we have to do is repeal an archaic \nlaw that was passed in 1975 when we couldn't export a barrel of oil if \nwe wanted to. We were importing two-thirds of our oil.\n  We have a bipartisan bill that helps everybody in America, that is in \nthe economic interests of America, that is in the environmental \ninterests of America, that is in the military strategic interests of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Chairman, let's work together. Let's send this bill to the Senate \nwith strong bipartisan support. God bless America. God bless this great \ncountry. Pass H.R. 702.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2015.\n     Hon.

I would request your \n     support for the appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees \n     during any House-Senate conference on this legislation.\n       I respectfully ask that you place our letters on H.R. 702 \n     into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of \n     the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this \n     legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce as this measure moves \n     through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Edward R. Royce,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2015.\n     Hon. Edward R. Royce,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,\n     Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for your assistance \n     regarding H.R. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil \n     market conditions, which was referred to our respective \n     committees on February 4, 2015.\n       I appreciate your willingness to agree that the Foreign \n     Affairs Committee might be discharged from further action on \n     H.R. 702 so that it can proceed expeditiously to the floor, \n     and I agree that this waiver does not in any way diminish or \n     alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or \n     prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or \n     similar legislation in the future. In addition, I would \n     support your request for the appointment of Foreign Affairs \n     conferees during any House-Senate conference on this \n     legislation.\n       I will place our letters on H.R. 702 into the Congressional \n     Record during floor consideration of the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this legislation.\n  Increased U.S. energy exports benefit our national security and \nforeign policy. The Administration has created an absurd situation. \nWhile they are lifting sanctions on Iranian crude oil, they are \nfighting to keep sanctions on American crude oil. It makes no sense.\n  I am, however, concerned by language that would increase subsidy \npayments to U.S. shipping companies participating in the ``Maritime \nSecurity Program.'' By increasing our oil exports, as this legislation \ndoes, that's already a boon to U.S. shipping. So why the government \nsubsidy?\n  So I will support an amendment that is to be offered to strike this \nprovision of the bill.\n  But Mr. Chair, if this maritime subsidy is ultimately part of this \nlegislation, the door is then open to offset it by eliminating yet \nanother damaging subsidy: U.S. cargo preference for international food \naid.\n  Over the past three years, the Foreign Affairs Committee has led \nefforts to reform U.S. international food aid programs so we could \nreach more starving people in less time, and for less money.\n  A stumbling block to this effort has been a requirement in U.S. law \nthat U.S. food aid be shipped on U.S. vessels--even though many of them \nare foreign-owned. This requirement remains year-after-year despite the \nfact that the Defense Department has concluded that relieving a portion \nof our food aid budget from U.S. purchase and shipping requirements \nwould have no effect on U.S. maritime security.\n  If maintained in this bill, the proposed increase for ``Maritime \nSecurity Program'' payments literally ``sinks'' the arguments against \nfood aid reform. One wasteful corporate subsidy is bad enough; a second \nthat kills our ability to reform food aid and save lives would be \nbeyond conscience, and something I am confident this body would wisely \nreject.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, a \nbipartisan bill to lift the 40-year old, self-imposed, crude oil export \nban.\n  The United States is now among the top oil producing nations in the \nworld. Lifting this export ban will bring us roaring back into the \nglobal oil markets at a time when market conditions are particularly \ncompetitive.\n  Contrary to what some of my friends across the aisle may say, this \nbill would actually lower gas prices here at home. We live in a global \neconomy, and participation in a global market leads to competitive \npricing. The non-partisan Government Accountability Office--in addition \nto the world-renowned analytics firm, HIS--have both determined that \nenacting this bill will lower gas prices, create hundreds of thousands \nof jobs, and provide a much-needed boost our economy.\n  With all these benefits, why would we continue to hold onto this \nexport ban? The only reason it was imposed in the first place was in \nresponse to the Arab oil embargo. That was over 40 years ago. It is \nprudent to move past these decades-old issues, and instead focus on the \nissues we face today.\n  Today, we are facing a dangerous nuclear deal with Iran--a deal of \nPresident Obama's making. And one component of this terrible deal is \nthat sanctions will be lifted on Iran so that they will be able to \naccess a much larger portion of the world oil market, yielding billions \nof dollars to their coffers. Why would we make a deal with Iran--a deal \nthat allows them to export their oil so they can fund terrorism around \nthe world--but still hold onto this self-imposed ban?\n  Without this bill, the U.S. would be missing out on billions in \ndirect revenue to the Treasury, not to mention the secondary revenue \nstreams from improved economic conditions.\n  Let's pass this bill to unleash economic growth. Let's pass this bill \nto create hundreds of thousands of much-needed jobs. Let's pass this \nbill to counterbalance the exports of Iran, Russia, and the OPEC \nnations.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss H.R. 702, a bill to \n``Adapt to Changing Crude Oil Market Conditions.''\n  H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that \nhas been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab \nOil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and \ninflicted substantial damage on the American economy.\n  Let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and \nRanking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American \nenergy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding \nopportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce.\n  I support H.R. 702 because it holds the promise of moving our country \ntowards energy independence, create good-paying jobs, lowering gasoline \nprices, promoting our geopolitical interests, and strengthening our \ndefense capabilities.\n  But I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro-\nsustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and \nnational security.\n  That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal \nbrought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when \nthey are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest.\n  As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the \nnation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly \nadvocated for national energy policies\n\n[[Page H6951]]\n\nthat will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create \njobs, and keep our nation's economy strong.\n  The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I represent and is home \nto Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation of North \nAmerica, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and Gas \nPipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others.\n  My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or \nenhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in \nthe world oil markets.\n  Mr. Chair, the world is very different than it was in 1973 when the \nban on crude oil exports was adopted.\n  And much of the change we see today is attributable to America's \nunconventional oil boom.\n  U.S. crude production is now more than 11 million barrels per day \naccording to the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, up from \n7 million barrel per day in 2008.\n  And it is estimated that U.S. output will exceed 18 million barrels a \nday by 2040.\n  Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined \nnearly 30 percent between 2005 and 2013.\n  Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban \nmay pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to \nthe economy.\n  This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline \nin oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues \nhas forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash \ninvestment and cancel projects.\n  Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, \nincluding many in my district.\n  I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by \nindustry job reductions.\n  Lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American crude oil \nproducers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs.\n  Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other \norganizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of \nrepealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial.\n  Specifically, it is predicted that repeal of the crude oil export ban \nwill: 1. generate over $1.4 billion in revenue to the federal treasury \nover the next 10 years from oil and gas leases, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office; 2. lower gasoline prices by 13 cents per \ngallon according to the Government Accountability Office; 3. support up \nto 964,000 additional American jobs; 4. allow the United States to help \nits allies, enhance its energy security, and weaken the influence and \nmarket power of OPEC and Russia; and 5. strengthen the 60-ship Maritime \nSecurity Fleet, assuring that United States flag ships and crews will \nbe available to provide support to the military in defense of our \nnational interests and our allies.\n  The economic benefits projected to be derived from a repeal of the \ncrude oil export ban are stunning in their magnitude: 1. 300,000 \nadditional jobs by 2020; 2. $5.8 billion savings in fuel costs each \nyear between 2015 and 2035; 3. $70 billion in additional investment in \nU.S. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 \nand 2020; 4. 500,000 barrels per day increase in domestic crude oil \nproduction in 2020; 5. $38 billion in additional economic activity in \n2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue \nin 2020; and a 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in \n2020.\n  It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the \nban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 \nmillion into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government \nrevenues in the amount of $227.7 million.\n  Another positive impact of repealing the crude oil export ban is that \nthe U.S. crude oil production would increase 1.2 million barrels per \nday average between 2016 and 2030.\n  Additionally, manufacturing jobs are expected to increase by an \naverage of 37,000 per year through 2025 and analysts predict that \nconstruction jobs will increase 217,000 in the peak year 2017, while \nrelated professional services jobs would grow by an average of 148,000 \nper year.\n  Repeal of the crude oil export ban is expected to spur capital \ninvestment in machinery, exploration, and development by $7 billion in \n2020.\n  The gross domestic product would increase by nearly $73 billion in \n2016 and by at least $134 billion in 2018.\n  Total government revenues would increase by a combined $1.3 trillion \nbetween 2016 and 2030.\n  The revenue generated translates to an expected average annual \nincrease of $2,500 in disposable income per household, additional jobs \nfor American workers, and lower gasoline prices for American consumers.\n  As it relates to our geopolitical stance, Mr. Chair, lifting the \ncrude export ban will enhance our national influence in international \naffairs because we will be stronger economically and more energy \nindependent.\n  This will enhance our ability to achieve our geopolitical objectives \nof maintaining peace and security across the globe which in turn \nfurthers our national security interests.\n  For all of these reasons, I support H.R. 702 and urge my colleagues \nto join me and also support Jackson Lee Amendments 9 and 10.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, it shall be \nin order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nconsisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-29. That amendment \nin the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the amendment in the nature of the substitute is as \nfollows:\n\n                                H.R. 702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy \n     production, establishing the United States as the world's \n     leading oil producer.\n       (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur \n     domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help \n     maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that \n     is essential to national defense, and generate State and \n     Federal revenues.\n       (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter \n     of energy has the potential to transform the security \n     environment around the world, notably in Europe and the \n     Middle East.\n       (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of \n     more United States oil in the market will offer more secure \n     supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic \n     alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political \n     weapon.\n       (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element \n     of our military's strategic sealift and global response \n     capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United \n     States crews will be available to support the United States \n     military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and \n     is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current \n     and projected sealift requirements for the United States.\n       (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor \n     base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew \n     the United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, \n     as well as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace \n     and war.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL.\n\n       Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of \n     contents of that Act are repealed.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the \n     efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, \n     marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, \n     including fossil fuels, no official of the Federal Government \n     shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of \n     crude oil.\n\n     SEC. 4. STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study and \n     transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House \n     of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the Senate recommendations on the appropriate \n     size, composition, and purpose of the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve.\n\n     SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act limits the authority of the President \n     under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies \n     Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or part B of title II of the \n     Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.) \n     to prohibit exports.\n\n     SEC. 6.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, lines 3 through 15, strike paragraphs (5) and (6).\n       Page 3, line 18, through page 4, line 21, strike section 6.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Amash) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, my amendment removes a new section of the \nbill added by the Committee on Rules that increases funding for the \nMaritime Security Program by $500 million. My amendment does not \neliminate the program. It simply keeps it at its current authorization \nlevel.\n  Just last week the House passed the conference report for the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. This defense policy bill, \nnegotiated at length between House and Senate conferees, increases the \nannual subsidy for Maritime Security Program participants from $3.1 \nmillion per vessel to $3.5 million per vessel, a 12.9 percent increase. \nThe provision, added quietly by the Committee on Rules, circumvents \nregular order and increases funding even more.\n  As amended, H.R. 702 boosts per-vessel payments to $5 million per \nyear, increasing the subsidy by a whopping 42 percent. The proper place \nfor a discussion on funding for the Maritime Security Program is in a \ndefense bill like the NDAA, not as part of a bill that lifts a ban on \ncrude oil exports.\n  This spending increase is all the more reckless, given our more than \n$18 trillion national debt. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, lifting the export ban will increase receipts from Federal oil \nand gas leases by $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. We should use \nthose receipts to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are two ways we should amend bills. The first way \nis to go through the normal committee process, by introducing \namendments during a markup. Members have the opportunity to debate and \nvote on amendments in the committee of jurisdiction. We should respect \nthe work committees do by not altering the bills they report before we \neven consider the legislation on the House floor.\n  The second way is to offer an amendment when the bill comes up for \ndebate on the House floor. This gives all Representatives the \nopportunity to participate in the debate and represent their \nconstituents by voting on the measure. Unfortunately, the Committee on \nRules changed this bill behind closed doors late last week.\n  The Maritime Security Program is a defense-related program that has \nnothing to do with oil exports or energy production. This provision has \nno place in H.R. 702, and its eleventh-hour addition by the Committee \non Rules is the latest example of our broken legislative process.\n  Mr. Chairman, we must protect this institution and the legislative \nprocess. Adding an unrelated provision to this bill behind closed doors \nis no way to legislate.\n  I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to remove this \nunrelated $500 million spending increase so we can consider H.R. 702 as \nreported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Dold). The gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/4\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Forbes).\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 702 but, more \nimportantly, to oppose this amendment.\n  First of all, I would tell the gentleman, this amendment was \nconsidered and this provision was considered in the NDAA, and we \nactually did mark it up.\n  The second thing is this is vital to the national security of this \ncountry to maintain the private sector sealift capacity. Our top \nmilitary commanders have called MSP a vital element of our military \nstrategic sealift and global response capability, and it is worth \nnoting that 90 percent of all U.S. military cargo moved from Iraq and \nAfghanistan has been by American-flagged, American-crewed commercial \nvessels enrolled in the MSP program.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  If we were to adopt this amendment, it would basically cost us $13 \nbillion to re-create this. The U.S. Transportation Command has \nestimated it would cost $52 billion. In other words, Mr. Chairman, it \nwould take us between 42 years and 168 years to recoup our costs.\n  Let's defeat this amendment and protect the Maritime Security \nProgram.\n  Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about process. I recognize \nthe concerns of my colleague. This should be handled in the NDAA or in \na defense bill.\n  I urge all Members to support my amendment eliminating this $500 \nmillion increase in spending and reject the Rules Committee's eleventh-\nhour revision that has nothing to do with crude oil exports.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I join my friend, Mr. Forbes, in opposition \nto this amendment.\n  This amendment would harm America's national security. Under the \nprogram that it seeks to eliminate, the Pentagon reserves capacity on \nroughly 60 U.S.-flagged commercial ships to ensure the supply and \ntransport of American troops. It is a program that supports our private \nsector as well, requiring the Defense Department to contract private \ncommercial ships rather than building their own. So there was not \nredundancy, but complementary ability.\n  It is a program that enhances America's national security by ensuring \nthat our military can depend on U.S.-flagged and crewed vessels instead \nof foreign ones. It is a program that supports important domestic \nmaritime jobs.\n  In my view, we ought to reject this amendment. This legislation is, \nobviously, controversial. I hope this amendment is not controversial \nand that it receives overwhelming bipartisan opposition.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green).\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  I represent the Port of Houston, and maritime transportation is vital \nto our success. Last year, the United States imported $2.4 trillion and \nexported $1.6 trillion in cargo and goods. Much of that cargo came to \nthe United States on foreign-built ships, under foreign flags, and \nwithout U.S. citizens on board.\n  Our maritime industry has been the bedrock of our economy since our \nfounding. More cargo moves through our waterways than any other mode of \ntransportation. We need to protect our domestic maritime industry, and \nthat includes men and women that work on these ships.\n  I have worked with the maritime unions, including the Seafarers and \nthe Marine Engineers, since my first days in Congress. I want to thank \nmy colleagues for supporting our U.S.-flagged maritime unions. I oppose \nthis amendment because I support any effort to keep these folks \nworking.\n  I would like to take a minute and acknowledge a recent incident in \nthe Atlantic Ocean. The disappearance of the El Faro resulted in the \nloss of life. I\n\n[[Page H6953]]\n\nwant to extend my prayers to the families. Working on these ships is \ntough and can be hazardous, as we learned last week.\n  It is my hope that we can defeat this amendment and ensure our \neconomic viability and national security by putting U.S. crews and U.S. \nflags on more ships.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, to the gentleman from Michigan's point, \nthis is the process.\n  I chair the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee. I \nam also the vice chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee in the Armed \nServices Committee. Mr. Forbes is the chairman of the subcommittee that \nhandles this stuff. This went through the process. This is the process. \nThis is how it is supposed to work.\n  There are only--I will say again--79 U.S.-flagged commercial vessels \non the ocean today. That is 79 out of about 50,000; 60 of those are \nused in times of war. It would cost us billions of dollars to create a \nfleet that sits there mothballing until we go to war and then we get to \nuse it.\n  This is how the system works. This is the process, and this is how we \nkeep national security strong. Republicans and Democrats realize this \nis the process. It is the right way to do it, and it shores up the \nMaritime Security Program for a decade. That is 10 years that we don't \nhave to worry about this, and it is paid for. The gentleman from \nMichigan would have a point if this were not paid for. It is totally \npaid for.\n  This is the right vehicle for it, and I would urge all my colleagues \nto vote against the gentleman's amendment and support maritime security \nand national security.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to Amash amendment that \nwould undermine our domestic maritime industry and its workers.\n  The Pacific Northwest has a proud maritime tradition that supports \nquality jobs and keeps our economy moving.\n  The Maritime Security Program ensures that we have the ships and \nmariners to support our local, regional, and national economy--to keep \nfolks employed and get goods to market.\n  Having worked in economic development for a decade I believe the MSP \nis the kind of program we ought to back, not completely scrap.\n  Let's not turn our back on the hard-working men and women that are \nout on the sea.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Delaney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, after line 15, insert the following:\n       (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over \n     the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy \n     technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, \n     reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national \n     security.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Delaney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, recent data suggests that climate change \nis accelerating. As a result, the destabilizing effect it has on our \nenvironment is worsening. To my mind, this is a clear threat to \nAmerican prosperity and global stability.\n  Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the Governor of the Bank of \nEngland in a speech recently said that he is very concerned that unless \nwe respond to climate change, there will be a dramatic reduction in \nvalue of carbon assets, which will cause a financial crisis. As a \ncountry with the largest financial markets in the world, we should be \nconcerned about that.\n  Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that Citigroup recently put out a \nresearch report that said unless we deal with climate change, the \neffect on global GDP will be $44 trillion to the negative by 2050. That \nis twice the size of the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the U.N. has estimated that \nunless we deal with climate change, 150 million people will be forced \nto be relocated by 2050; 20 million, alone, in Bangladesh. Put that in \nthe context of the fact that in Syria we are seeing the effects of 7 \nmillion people being forced to be relocated.\n  Again, Mr. Chairman, this is a clear threat to American prosperity, \nand the bad news is that our environment is worse.\n  The good news is the technology is better for dealing with this \nproblem. Consider the fact that, as we have doubled the installed base \nof solar energy in this country, we have reduced the cost of energy by \n23 percent. It has happened over the last several cycles of doubling \nsolar, and people expect it to continue. This is occurring because of \ngood old-fashioned American innovation.\n  And while I believe there should be policy prescriptions from the \ngovernment that effectively cost and price carbon, at a minimum, Mr. \nChairman, we should agree that by investing in clean energy technology, \nwe will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will lower energy costs for \nthe American public, and we will increase national security. That is \nwhat the amendment that I have here today is designed to do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but \nonly in order to control the time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I are prepared to accept the \ngentleman's amendment, but we do have some Republican speakers who \nwould like to speak in favor of it.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  First, Mr. Chairman, let me offer my support for the underlying bill, \nH.R. 702.\n  Over the August district work period, I had the opportunity to visit \nan oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico and see firsthand the safety \nregulations and enhancements that have been put in place by the \nindustry in recent years. Two of the primary topics of discussion \nduring our visit were safety and the environment. I was glad to learn \nthe industry has put a lot of contingencies in place to make sure we \ncan continue drilling for oil in a manner that is safe and responsible.\n  I have joined my colleagues Mr. Delaney and Mr. Gibson in offering \nthis simple amendment that would recognize our country is making \nprogress in becoming more energy efficient; and that is better for the \neconomy and the environment.\n  It is also very important to note the other forms of energy that are \nbenefiting our country's economy and its national security. Wind, \nsolar, natural gas, and nuclear energy are all contributing greatly to \nour energy independence, and this amendment before us today \nacknowledges that we should continue to promote an all-of-the-above \nenergy strategy for this 21st century.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. DELANEY. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great city of \nKinderhook, New York (Mr. Gibson).\n  Mr. GIBSON. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I am honored to be \nworking with my colleagues John Delaney and Carlos Curbelo to offer \nthis bipartisan amendment.\n  This amendment adds another strategic dimension to this bill: support \nfor\n\n[[Page H6954]]\n\nclean energy and energy efficiencies. On our way to energy \nindependence, it is critical that we support research and development \nfor clean energy technologies.\n  In New York, we are doing a lot of this work supporting important \nprograms like the SunShot program, with the ambitious goal of driving \ndown the total cost of photovoltaics to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, \nwhich would allow it to compete with any other energy source and \ndemocratize energy, transforming the way we produce, convey, and \nconsume energy.\n  With improved technologies, we will also see more proliferation of \nwind power, hydroelectric power, and biomass energy complementing all \nother traditional energy sources, including crude oil, adding up to a \nstronger America.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a country that can do hard things. We have \nproven that time and again. With the proper focus and investment, we \nwill dominate the clean energy world market. And when we do, we will \ndrive down energy costs; we will grow our economy, strengthen our \nnational security, and conserve our environment.\n  I urge support of this amendment. Let's take a robust and holistic \napproach to energy independence.\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague and my friend \nfrom Texas for accepting this amendment. I want to thank my colleague \nfrom New York and my colleague from Florida for their support of their \namendment and their insight into this issue.\n  Again, I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment. It is very \nsimple. It simply says that investing in basic research and investing \nin American innovation will, in fact, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \nwhich it has been proven to do; will, in fact, lower energy costs, \nwhich it has been proven to do; and will, in fact, increase national \nsecurity in this great country.\n  So, again, I want to I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I accept the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve'' \n     before ``Not later than''.\n       Page 3, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (b) Greenhouse Gas Emissions.--Not later than 120 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Energy shall conduct, and transmit to the Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate the \n     results of, a study on the net greenhouse gas emissions that \n     will result from the repeal of the crude oil export ban under \n     section 2.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Huffman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 702. \nThis is the only amendment that the majority would allow in order to \nhelp us understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban on \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Before the Rules Committee, Ranking Member Pallone and I offered two \nother amendments that would have more proactively studied the increase \nin greenhouse gas emissions caused by this bill. Instead, the majority \nonly allowed this amendment, which requires that the Department of \nEnergy do a report on the increasing greenhouse gas emissions caused by \nthe lifting of the crude oil export ban, but still allows the ban to be \nlifted.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  This is what the legislative process has come to, unfortunately, in \nthis Chamber. Instead of analyzing full impacts before voting, the \nmajority has adopted a ``pollute first, ask questions later'' approach. \nRepeal the restrictions on fossil fuel extraction and production, and \nthen we will figure out the environmental impact later.\n  Now, lifting this 40-year-old ban on exports could increase oil \nproduction by as much as 500,000 barrels a day. That is a significant \nincrease that risks expanding production into sensitive areas off our \ncoasts and our public lands.\n  According to the Center for American Progress, this surge in \nproduction would result in an additional 515 million metric tons of \ncarbon pollution each year. That is the equivalent of an additional 108 \nmillion passenger cars on the road or 135 coal-fired power plants put \nonline. That is what this bill could do. That is why over 40 \nenvironmental groups are opposing it.\n  Now, my Republican colleagues might dispute this study. It is the \nCenter for American Progress. And so, when we hear studies from any \ngroup that is not funded by the fossil fuel industry, we typically hear \nthem accused of being biased, left-leaning sources, and certainly they \nare welcome to make that argument.\n  But doesn't that support the need for an established, nonpartisan \nsource of assessments on the impacts to our environment for bills that \nthis Congress considers?\n  That is why today, Mr. Chairman, I am also introducing the Carbon \nPollution Transparency Act of 2015. This is a bill that would require \nthe CBO to estimate and report on the projected carbon footprint of \neach bill Congress considers. That way, we know before we vote how a \nbill would impact our climate and our environment.\n  Members of Congress already rely on the fiscal impact estimates \nproduced by the nonpartisan CBO to help us make good decisions, make up \nour minds. But we need to also take into account the environmental \nconsequences of our votes.\n  The American public has the right to know whether their \nRepresentatives in Washington are voting to help harm the environment, \nto worsen climate change, or whatever the impact may be. That is why my \nbill ensures that we have a fair judge, the CBO, for each bill that we \nconsider on its environmental impact.\n  But today we at least have an opportunity to require such a study as \npart of H.R. 702. It is not enough, but it is a step forward to fully \nunderstand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban and, \npotentially, the harm that would result to our environment.\n  So I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment and a ``no'' vote on the \nunderlying legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, and I may change \nmy mind, depending on what the gentleman says.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BARTON. I want to make a deal with the gentleman. We want to be \nopen and transparent. We are the open, transparent Congress.\n  We will accept your amendment if you voice vote it and at least \nconsider voting for the bill. But if you are going to rollcall vote it \nand vote against the bill, then I will oppose it, and we will defeat \nyou on the rollcall vote.\n  So I am going to make you a deal. I am not saying you have to vote \nfor the bill. I am just saying I want you to think nice thoughts about \nthe bill and consider voting for the bill, and then we will accept it \non a voice vote, but we don't want any rollcall votes.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is advised to direct his \nremarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. BARTON. Well, I hope the Chair was listening.\n  I yield to my friend from California, if I have time to yield, to see \nwhat his thoughts are.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Through the Chair, I would say to my friend, I \nappreciate the offer, but I don't think there could be anything more \ntransparent than going on record and voting on these.\n  Mr. BARTON. So the gentleman is going to ask for a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I am going to ask for a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. BARTON. Then, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman's amendment \nand ask every Member to vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are not violently opposed to this. It is a study. I \nam confident that this bill will on a net basis\n\n[[Page H6955]]\n\nreduce greenhouse gases because the oil that would must probably be \nexported is produced under the strictest environmental regulations in \nthe world.\n  It also happens to be the easiest oil to refine because it is light \nsweet, which means it doesn't have a high sulfur content. When you run \nit through the cracking process, because it is lighter, it tends to \nseparate into the various refined products more easily.\n  So the gentleman's amendment is benign in nature in the sense that, \nif we were to conduct the study, I think the results from the study \nwould be positive.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. BARTON. I will be happy yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. To my esteemed colleague and coach of the baseball team, \nin the spirit of thinking good thoughts, if you will think good \nthoughts about considering the impacts to our environment and our \nclimate, I will accept your previous offer to voice vote this \namendment, and maybe all of this great good thought stuff will get us \nhome faster.\n  Mr. BARTON. Reclaiming my time, I commend the gentleman for his \nthoughtful understanding from Mr. Pallone. And, with that, we accept \nthe gentleman's amendment. I'm going to ask everybody to vote for it on \na voice vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mrs. Lawrence\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     Study.--'' before ``Not later than''.\n       Page 3, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (b) Crude Oil Export Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Department of Commerce, in \n     consultation with the Department of Energy, and other \n     departments as appropriate, shall conduct a study of the \n     State and national implications of lifting the crude oil \n     export ban with respect to consumers and the economy.\n       (2) Contents.--The study conducted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include an analysis of--\n       (A) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on the economy of the United States;\n       (B) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on consumers, taking into account impacts on energy prices;\n       (C) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on domestic manufacturing, taking into account impacts on \n     employment; and\n       (D) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have \n     on the refining sector, taking into account impacts on \n     employment.\n       (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Industry and \n     Security shall submit to Congress a report containing the \n     results of the study conducted under paragraph (1).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould direct the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the \nDepartment of Energy and other departments, as needed, to conduct a \nstudy.\n  This study would measure the impact of exporting millions of barrels \nof domestically produced crude oil on Americans and our economy.\n  Let's be clear. Lifting the crude oil export ban benefits very few. \nLet's also be clear about who does not benefit: American consumers and \nthe American economy.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will make the case for \nlifting the ban on crude oil exports. They will cite reports by the \nU.S. Department of Energy, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, and various other organizations to \nsupport their claims.\n  Some of the benefits they will list include claims of an increase in \ncrude oil production, additional investment in crude oil production, \nand an increase in employment along the energy supply chain.\n  But there is a problem with these claims, that the U.S. crude oil is \nalready at peak production. According to a report by the EIA, \nproduction reached 9.7 million barrels 1 day in April of 2015, the \nhighest levels since 1971.\n  In 2015, production is expected to average 9.2 million barrels a day. \nWe still import 7 million barrels of oil a day. Let's find a way to \nkeep domestically produced crude oil within our borders, which benefits \nour consumers and the economy in the U.S.\n  For example, the domestic gas prices are at record low levels due to \nthe surplus of crude oil.\n  According to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, Americans drove \nnearly 2 trillion miles during the first 7 months of 2015, contributing \nto the high gas consumption and setting a record level.\n  Lifting the ban now on U.S. crude oil benefits will undoubtedly raise \nprices. For consumers, these increases will result in higher gas prices \nat the pump and higher heating costs for families in the winter.\n  As all of you know, the manufacturing industry is the backbone of \nMichigan's economy. While the U.S. manufacturing industry has struggled \nin the past, it has been one of the bright spots in our economy since \nthe recession and remains a vital part of America's economy, as well as \nour Nation's economy.\n  Since 2010, over 700,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost during the \nrecession have been recovered. One major reason for this resurgence of \nthe manufacturing sector is low energy prices. Up to one-third of all \nenergy used in the United States goes into the manufacturing sector.\n  Rushing to lift the ban on crude oil now would only hurt the \nmanufacturing industry and dent its growth. Let us find a way to keep \ndomestically produced crude oil within our own boundaries and allow the \nconsumers and the economy to reap the benefits of lower energy prices.\n  Let us put together a comprehensive study of the impact of lifting \nthe U.S. crude oil export ban on the consumers and our economy first, \nbefore we rush to export millions of barrels of domestically produced \ncrude oil.\n  For the benefit of all Americans, for the benefit of our economy, I \nurge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, but I could \nbecome a supporter of the amendment under certain conditions.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman from Michigan is willing \nto accept the same deal that the gentleman from California just \naccepted, we will accept the amendment. We will vote for it on a voice \nvote, and we will move on down the road to catch my plane at 1:40 from \nReagan National Airport.\n  Does the gentlewoman agree to voice vote it?\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. To the Chair, considering all that is happening here, \nI really need good thoughts, and I want to be part of the process of \nexpanding good thoughts in Congress.\n  So I will accept, sir.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in enthusiastic support of the \ngentlewoman's amendment and ask that it be voted for on a voice vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Messer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 15, strike ``or''.\n       Page 3, line 17, after ``(42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.)'' insert \n     the following: ``, the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. \n     App. 1 et seq.), or any other provision of law that imposes \n     sanctions on a foreign person or foreign government \n     (including any provision of law that prohibits or restricts \n     United States persons from engaging in a transaction with a \n     sanctioned person or government), including a foreign \n     government that is designated as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism,''.\n\n\n[[Page H6956]]\n\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague and the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill, and \nI am hoping today to join the voice vote kumbaya, if possible.\n  H.R. 702 is a commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban \non crude oil exports. This ban was originally implemented when America \nwas going through an energy crisis. I was very young then, but \ncertainly remember the gas lines in the early 1970s.\n  The truth is things are different today. America is one of the \nlargest oil exporters, thanks to a boom in production all across our \ncountry. Gas prices are at historic lows, and refineries are near \ncapacity.\n  Yet, our laws do not reflect this new reality. Producers are still \nheld captive to the domestic marketplace. It is long past time to \nmodernize.\n  This bill will pave the way for a new age of energy innovation in \nAmerica. It will support and create thousands of U.S. jobs, good-paying \njobs, and encourage the investment of millions of dollars into our \neconomy.\n  America now has opportunities that would have seemed unimaginable \neven a generation ago, potentially even a few years ago.\n  We could now become a net exporter of energy. Think about that. And \nwhen we do, it will jump-start our economy, create thousands of good-\npaying jobs, and improve our national security and economic security as \nwell.\n  Now, Mr. Chair, I am offering a bipartisan amendment today that \nclarifies language in the bill to avoid creating any unintended \nconsequences regarding terrorist enemies of our country.\n  I want to thank my colleague from California (Mr. Lowenthal) for \ncosponsoring this amendment and Chairman Royce for working with us in \ncrafting the amendment as well.\n  While we should all want to see crude oil exports expanded, we do not \nwant this bill to inadvertently help our enemies. My amendment very \nsimply clarifies the bill's language to allow the administration to \nretain its ability to prohibit the export of crude oil to state \nsponsors of terrorism.\n  I believe this amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of \nthe bill. I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I strongly support the gentleman from \nIndiana's amendment. We commend him for offering it. We think it adds \nto the bill.\n  Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I support the amendment but would note that the best way \nto prevent our Nation's oil resources from falling into the hands of \nbad actors is to maintain the reasonable, time-tested controls on \nexports that are currently in place.\n  If you are concerned about our oil falling into the wrong hands, then \nyou should vote ``no'' on final passage of H.R. 702.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Messer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n     SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED \n                   PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS \n                   TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the \n     export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and \n     petrochemical products by or through any entity or person, \n     wherever located, subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States to any entity or person located in, subject to the \n     jurisdiction of, or sponsored by the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, again, I want to thank the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill and \nreiterate my support for H.R. 702. This is commonsense legislation that \nrepeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports.\n  The U.S. is producing more oil today than ever before, and we could \nliterally become a net exporter of energy, something that would have \nbeen unimaginable a generation ago and would have incredible results \nfor our economy. The fact that we are the only advanced nation that \nprohibits the export of domestically produced oil holds us back.\n  I believe very strongly that we should not empower our enemies \nunintentionally through this legislation, and this includes the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. My amendment today prohibits the export of crude oil, \nrefined petroleum products, and petrochemical products to Iran.\n  Obviously, Iran has oil. It has no need to import it from the United \nStates. But my amendment goes beyond just crude oil. It ensures Iran \nwill not inadvertently have access to other petroleum-based products \nproduced in the U.S.\n  Refined petroleum and petrochemical products are used to manufacture \nthousands of goods that we use every day. Things like plastics, \nasphalt, paints, and cell phones are manufactured in this way.\n  It was only a few weeks ago in this very Chamber that we discussed \nthe dangers of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as \nthe Iran nuclear deal. Despite being able to enrich uranium and self-\npolice its nuclear facilities, Iran will receive sanctions relief to \nthe tune of $150 billion. That is $150 billion pumped into a $400-\nbillion-a-year national economy. $150 billion of that will, no doubt, \nbe used by Iran to bankroll terrorist organizations, further \ndestabilize the Middle East, and continue their work to wipe Israel off \nthe map.\n  Things should not be made easier for them. The intent of the \nunderlying bill is not to aid and support Iran. It is to open up the \nU.S. energy sector, export oil, grow our economy, and create thousands \nof jobs.\n  My amendment ensures that the intention of this bill is clear. I \nbelieve the amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the \nbill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BARTON. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield), and myself support your amendment and \nask that it be accepted.\n  Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in mild opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana. However, I would point out that Iran has the \nfourth largest number of proven oil reserves in the world. In fact, \nsupporters of this bill often state concern over the\n\n[[Page H6957]]\n\nmarket impact of increased Iranian exports on domestic producers.\n  So while it is hard to understand why we need to worry about our \ncrude oil going to a country that is a major net exporter of oil, I \nhave no objection to adopting this amendment and making really sure \nIran doesn't get any of our oil and petroleum products.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MESSER. I appreciate the gentleman's comments.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Cuellar\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 7. PARTNERSHIPS WITH MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Department of Energy shall continue to \n     develop and broaden partnerships with minority serving \n     institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) \n     and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in \n     the areas of oil and gas exploration, production, midstream, \n     and refining.\n       (b) Public-private Partnerships.--The Department of Energy \n     shall encourage public Private partnerships between the \n     energy sector and minority serving institutions, including \n     Hispanic Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges \n     and Universities.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cuellar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I am here, of course, to talk about an \namendment to H.R. 702, this important legislation before us that will \nlift this outdated ban on the export of oil, modernize the U.S. energy \neconomy, and create U.S. jobs. The amendment that I bring forward is to \nhelp Minority-Serving Institutions grow the leaders of the future in \nthe oil and gas industry.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that Hispanics will account \nfor 74 percent of the growth in the Nation's labor force from 2010 to \n2020. This amendment ensures that our Minority-Serving Institutions, \nsuch as Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities, can create a competitive and able workforce in our \noil and gas industry. This will ensure that our Nation can continue to \ncompete in the global market far into the future. Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions are about 12 percent of the nonprofit colleges and \nuniversities, yet they enroll 59 percent of all Hispanic students.\n  The other part of this amendment, Mr. Chairman, is that it also calls \nfor the Department of Energy to encourage public-private partnerships \nbetween the energy sector and Minority-Serving Institutions.\n  This is an amendment that I think will be good for all workers across \nthe Nation. I ask all Members to vote in favor of this amendment and to \nsupport the underlying bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I do support the gentleman's amendment. I \nwant to commend him for his leadership on this issue. I hope we will \naccept it on a voice vote.\n  I see Mr. Rush. I am willing to yield to my good friend from Chicago \n(Mr. Rush) if he wishes to speak on it. I was told he might.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield for the 1-minute prayer, not the 5-minute sermon.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully decline the time the gentleman \nwas gracious to give. I really want my own time on the bill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time has already been claimed.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), which couldn't exceed 5 minutes \nbecause that is all I have.\n  Mr. RUSH. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I must say that I did not come here to Congress to \nshadowbox with the majority party over jobs and economic opportunities \nfor the intergenerationally and chronically unemployed citizens of my \ndistrict and similarly situated districts across the country.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which was not allowed by the majority \nparty, would have provided real solutions to real problems. My \namendment would have put dollars in the pocketbooks of the unemployed \nminorities, the unemployed women, and the unemployed veterans of this \nNation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I must say, this amendment before us is like pouring \nperfume on an overused pigsty. It provides DOE--and I quote from the \namendment, Mr. Chairman--it provides DOE with the authority to continue \nits ongoing work. In other words, it tells the Department of Energy: Do \nwhat you are already doing.\n  Mr. Chairman, unlike the amendment I offered in the Rules Committee \nthat was drafted with input and collaboration from the various \nstakeholders who would benefit most had it been adopted, there is no \nspecific initiative, no program, and no objections in the Cuellar \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not \nencouraged, but established--partnerships between DOE, Commerce, the \nSmall Business Administration, Minority Business Development Agency, \nindustry, the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council, the Women's \nBusiness Enterprise Network Council, and minority chambers of commerce \nchapters across the Nation.\n  The Rush amendment would have established programmatic commitments \nfor diversity hiring for vendor and contracting opportunities within \nthe supply chain through contractual obligations, incentives, and other \nmeans with a goal of no less than 10 percent participation by minority-\nowned firms by the year 2020.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would have created regional diversity \nsupply chain specialty centers to develop strategies for minority \nbusiness contracting and vendor opportunities, and to hold business \ndevelopment sessions in strategic locations where energy development \nexists or is expanding.\n  The Rush amendment would have helped minority- and women-owned firms \nform consortiums and partnerships in order to better meet \nqualifications and capacities that industry is seeking.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established a program to \nprovide access to capital for loans, financing, and insurance \nassistance for minority- and women-owned businesses.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not just \nencouraged, but established--public-private partnerships between \nminority-owned banks and private investors as well as provided grants \nto Minority-Serving Institutions to help recruit businesses for energy-\nrelated supply chain sector activity.\n  Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not here to criticize my friend, the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). I am here to just bring out the \ndifferences between what an imaginary amendment would do and what a \nreal amendment would do.\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the kind words of the \ngentleman from Illinois.\n  I understand the amendment that he was trying to get in. Actually, I \nwas trying to help try to get his amendment accepted, but it is up to \nthe Rules Committee and the democracy there.\n  This amendment is very simple. It is something that we have added in \nthe\n\n[[Page H6958]]\n\nappropriation bill on different agencies. We all have voted for this in \nthe appropriation bills time after time after time, and it is to help \nthe Minority-Serving Institutions.\n  I ask the gentleman from Texas and Members to please accept this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 8 will not \nbe offered.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 7. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the \n     impact of lifting the oil export ban under this Act as it \n     relates to promoting United States energy and national \n     security.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank Mr. Pallone and Mr. \nBarton for their courtesies and as well the Rules Committee. Let me \nfirst of all say there has been a lot of discussion on the floor of the \nHouse regarding this bill and different opinions. Might I add that this \nis an important and vigorous discussion. I think this is the best of \nwhat this Congress is all about.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to take note of H.R. 702, which many of us \nknow came about because of the gas prices in the 1970s. This bill \nsimply repeals that portion of the legislation that responded to that \ncrisis.\n  What I like in the bill is, of course, we have in the bill that we, \nas a Congress, will get a report some 120 days after dealing with the \nmaintenance and the strength of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That \nis a very important national security item.\n  A savings clause indicates, of course, that the President has all of \nhis powers in the light of crisis and other issues to implement any \nnecessary changes or any necessary restrictions on this legislation.\n  My amendment tracks giving more information. Not later than 10 years \nafter the date of enactment of this act, the Secretary of Energy and \nthe Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report \nthat reviews the impact of lifting the oil import ban under this act as \nrelates to promoting, supporting, and providing for the United States \nenergy and national security policy.\n  Our number one responsibility is the American people--I understand \nthat--both environmentally, which reflects to their own energy \nresources, and certainly with national security. This amendment allows \nfor that report to be on the front side of 10 years. It could be 2 \nyears from now, 3 years from now, and the Congress can dictate that.\n  U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels a \nday. It is now more than 11 million barrels a day, and it is now \npossible to go up to 18 million barrels a day in 2040 under the \nstrictest environmental concerns.\n  But right now in my district--right now in my district--they are \nlaying off thousands of people because there is no work. So I would \nargue to my colleagues that this amendment provides the insight on what \nis going on.\n  This bill could provide the GDP would rise by 550 billion to 1.8 \ntrillion between 2015 and 2039. It is estimated in my own congressional \njob lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 hundred jobs, an \nadditional 270 million in the local economy, and increase government \nrevenues in 227 million.\n  This 10-year period under that--by the way, it is up to 10 years--is \ngiving long enough time to provide a probative, intelligent assessment \nof whether there is irreversible damage.\n  Amendment No. 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures that those \nwho may be skeptical of lifting the export ban get reasonable \nopportunities to oppose it or get the right information. The same thing \nwith those who may support it. It gives us a basis of empirical data \nrigorously analyzed.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment can be summed up as follows: For those who \nare confident in the future, my amendment offers vindication. For those \nwho are skeptical of the new change, my amendment will provide the \nevidence they need to prove their case.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I would rise in mild opposition, which \ncould turn to support.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from \nHouston for offering it.\n  Is she willing to do this on a voice vote and consider voting for the \nbill if we accept it?\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Is the gentleman rising to support the gentlewoman's \namendment with great enthusiasm?\n  Mr. BARTON. I will if you rise to voice vote on your amendment. I \nwill make it a package deal. I will give you this amendment and the \nnext amendment double enthusiasm if they are both voice votes and you \nactually really do vote for the bill or at least start thinking about \nit strongly.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman surmise that amendments that are \npassed by voice vote are still strong amendments?\n  Mr. BARTON. Oh, they are.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. And included in the bill?\n  Mr. BARTON. Yes, ma'am.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. As opposed to being susceptible to being gotten rid \nof?\n  Mr. BARTON. No. You have got my word. I will be on the conference \ncommittee if we have one. Your amendments will be in the conference \nreport that goes to the President if we get that far.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am always eager to work with my \nfriends on this side of aisle, Mr. Pallone. I am always eager to work \nwhen we are moving forward. And so I would offer my amendment and offer \nit for a voice vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in, as I just said I would, double \nenthusiastic support of her amendment, but I am going to be looking on \nthat board when it comes time to vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me just simply say my amendment \nanswers many of the concerns that have been expressed on the floor of \nthe House by giving empirical data, not 10 years and beyond, but in a \nperiod up to 10 years, to let us make further informative decisions to \nprovide for the energy resources of the American people, the national \nresources, and, of course, being able to provide for the national \nsecurity.\n  With that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton \nand Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to \nAmerican energy independence and economic growth and security.\n  I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and \nthe members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee \nAmendment Number 9.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich provides:\n\n       Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 10 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a \n     report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban \n     under this Act as it relates to promoting United States \n     energy and national security.\n\n  As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the \nnation, I have always\n\n[[Page H6959]]\n\nbeen mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national \nenergy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, \npreserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong.\n  The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I am proud to represent \nis home to Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation \nof North America, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and \nGas Pipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others.\n  I am strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro-\nsustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and \nnational security.\n  Volatile energy prices threaten economic security for millions of \nmiddle class Americans and hits consumers hard; rising gas prices \nstrain budgets for millions of American families.\n  It is a familiar story, but in order to restore lasting security for \nmiddle class families we need a smart and reasonable plan for American \nenergy, not false promises or quick fixes.\n  That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal \nbrought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when \nthey are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest.\n  So my constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain \nor enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in \nthe world oil markets.\n  Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to \nimprove them by offering constructive amendments.\n  H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that \nhas been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab \nOil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and \ninflicted substantial damage on the American economy.\n  But much has changed since 1973; America's unconventional oil boom \nchanged everything.\n  U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels per \nday; now it is now more than 11 million barrels per day and according \nto the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, U.S. output is \nestimated to top 18 million barrels a day by 2040.\n  Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined \nnearly 30% between 2005 and 2013.\n  Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban \nmay pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to \nthe economy.\n  This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline \nin oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues \nhas forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash \ninvestment and cancel projects.\n  Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, \nincluding many in my district.\n  I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by \nindustry job reductions.\n  Mr. Chair, lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American \ncrude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer \nlayoffs.\n  Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other \norganizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of \nrepealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial: 1. GDP \ncould rise by $550 billion to $1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039; 2. \nU.S. oil production could rise by 1.3 million to 2.9 million barrels \nper day in 2020; 3. 300,000 additional jobs created by 2020; 4. $5.8 \nbillion in estimated reduced consumer fuel costs each year between 2015 \nand 2035; 5. up to $70 billion in additional investment in U.S. \nexploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and \n2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue \nin 2020; 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in 2020; \nand 8. 100,000 barrels per day increase in refinery throughout between \n2015 and 2035.\n  It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the \nban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 \nmillion into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government \nrevenues in the amount of $227.7 million.\n  Admittedly, these are predictions, projections, and forecasts made on \nthe basis of the best information currently available.\n  We hope they are accurate but candor requires that we acknowledge \nthat no one can say with certainty they will come to pass.\n  That is why it is essential that at an appropriate juncture we review \nand assess the impact on the American petroleum industry, the national \neconomy, and consumers.\n  And that is the purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment #9, which mandates a \ncomprehensive review of the impact of crude oil export ban repeal after \na 10 year period.\n  This 10 year time period is long enough to accumulate data sufficient \nand probative enough to assess the impact of H.R. 702, but not so long \nas to prevent irreversible damage if the evaluation does not \napproximate the expected benefits reveals unintended adverse \nconsequences.\n  In sum, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 will help ensure that the \nbrave new world of unrestricted crude oil exports by American producers \nis more than a leap of faith.\n  Rather, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 operates as a safety valve and \nreassures those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban that \nreasonable opportunities will exist to make an informed evaluation of \nthe effect of the ban's repeal on our economy and national security.\n  And it is important to emphasize Mr. Chair, that this evaluation will \nbe based on empirical data rigorously analyzed.\n  In short, Mr. Chair, my amendment can be summed up as follows: for \nthose who are confident of the future, my amendment offers vindication.\n  For those who are skeptical that the new change will work, my \namendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case.\n  And for those who believe that maintaining the status quo is \nintolerable, my amendment offers a way forward.\n  I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-290.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how \n     lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create \n     opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, \n     while promoting energy and national security.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I ask that my amendment be considered \nby my colleagues.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment requires within 180 days of enactment the \nSecretaries of Energy and Commerce submit a report to Congress \nanalyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil, in particular, on exports, \nwill create opportunities for veterans and women.\n  Mr. Chairman, just a few days ago I went to an initiative called \nStand Down. I have gone a number of years. Most military persons will \nunderstand it is where you come and stand down from battle.\n  In this instance, they were veterans, many of them homeless, many of \nthem in great need. Obviously, social services, substance abuse \nservices, and others were offered there. What I heard from these men \nwho wore the uniform in dignity is they want jobs.\n  Mr. Chairman, I believe that this legislation will provide a strong \npro-jobs agenda growing the economy. As my previous amendment said, I \ndo not take lightly the impact of lifting the ban; therefore, my \nprevious amendment would provide the insight on whether or not this is \na positive impact.\n  I can tell you that there is a great need, as has been discussed \nearlier, about collaborating with historically Black colleges and \nHispanic-serving colleges.\n  I have worked on those issues and have certainly seen the leadership \nof Mr. Rush and Mr. Cuellar. But I will tell you that it is indicated \nthat State shale development supports American jobs.\n  Mr. Chairman, $107,000 is the average salary that is provided by the \nenergy company in energy jobs, 1.7 million employment attributed to \nupstream, unconventional oil and natural gas. Women fill 40 percent of \nthe vacancies in oil and gas.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will insert this into the Record.\n\n[[Page H6960]]\n\n  \n\n\n                            [Apr. 23, 2014]\n\n The Energy Revolution is Creating Career Opportunities for Women and \n                               Minorities\n\n                          (By Cheryl Jackson)\n\n       Minorities are projected to fill an unprecedented number of \n     jobs in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries--\n     increasing from one-quarter of total jobs in 2010 to one-\n     third by 2030--according to a new IHS report sponsored by \n     API.\n       ``The oil and natural gas industry pays wages significantly \n     higher than the national average and can provide tremendous \n     career opportunities for women and minorities,'' said Jack \n     Gerard, API President and CEO. ``To lower unemployment and \n     shrink the income inequality gap without spending a dime of \n     taxpayer money, we encourage President Obama to embrace this \n     pro-development energy opportunity.''\n       Of up to 1.3 million new job opportunities in the oil, \n     natural gas and petrochemical industries predicted by 2030, \n     almost 408,000 positions--32 percent of the total--are \n     projected to be held by African American and Hispanic \n     workers, according to the report. Women are estimated to fill \n     185,000 of those jobs, and 63 percent of new job \n     opportunities will be in blue collar professions.\n       ``We have the natural resources and the technology to be a \n     global energy superpower with all the economic and national \n     security benefits that entails,'' Gerard said. ``Smart energy \n     policy will create tremendous opportunity for hundreds of \n     thousands of workers--from those with just a high school \n     diploma and some post-secondary training to those with post-\n     graduate degrees.''\n       ``As the study highlights job opportunities, it signals the \n     tremendous need to prepare African Americans, Hispanics and \n     Women to be ready to fill the workforce gap'', said Paula \n     Jackson, president and CEO of the American Association of \n     Blacks in Energy. ``These jobs in the oil and natural gas \n     industry don't just put people to work, they help to \n     transform communities.''\n       ``This powerful and important report is a road map for \n     workforce development stakeholders to align the content of \n     their training with a sense of urgency to adequately prepare \n     people for energy jobs,'' said Jose L. Perez, chairman and \n     CEO Of Hispanics In Energy. ``Energy job replacement and \n     growth is a clear pathway for diverse communities to rise \n     from poverty to middle-class, what a rare opportunity.''\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. The government and the administration are working to \npair up and find jobs for veterans. The unemployment rate for veterans \nwe have seen has been a constant issue, and it is going down. But we \nneed to provide them with other opportunities. They were higher \nunemployment, as we can see, than the regular workforce.\n  So my amendment wants to ensure that, if we lift this ban, women and \nveterans will benefit. We know, of course, that we have been pushing \nour educational facilities to engage in STEM, but what we need now is a \npipeline for qualified veterans and women looking for jobs right now.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee \namendment. It causes us to focus on these vulnerable populations--women \nand veterans--to direct them into the industry.\n  Might I say to my constituents, the energy companies that I \nrepresent, a long list of names that I will not name at this time, that \nwe hope that they are focused as well on expanding opportunities in the \nenergy industry for veterans, returning soldiers, if you will, women, \nand, of course, across-the-board minorities. This is an industry that \nis moving and growing, and the opportunities should move and grow as \nwell.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson \nLee amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not \nopposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only would like to say we support the \namendment and we will honor the deal we just made on the prior \namendment. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on a voice vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Pallone. I hope that our colleagues have \nheard us to emphasize the creation of jobs along with the environment, \nnational security, and the energy resources of America.\n  Mr. Chair, again, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus \nBarton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment \nto American energy independence, economic growth, national security, \nand expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector \nworkforce.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich provides:\n\n       Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a \n     report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports \n     will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the \n     United States, while promoting energy and national security.\n\n  I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and \nthe members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee \nAmendment Number 10.\n  As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the \nnation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly \nadvocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more \nenergy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's \neconomy strong.\n  I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' and ``pro-\nexpanding economic opportunities for women, veterans, minorities, and \nsmall business!''\n  That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal \nbrought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when \nthey are sound, balanced, promote the national interest, and expand \neconomic opportunities for everyone, particularly for women, veterans, \nand members of underrepresented communities.\n  My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or \nenhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in \nthe world oil markets.\n  Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to \nimprove them by offering constructive amendments.\n  That is why I have offered Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10, which \nrecognizes the fact that veterans, minorities, small businesses and \nwomen currently are significantly underrepresented in the oil and gas \nindustries at all levels and severely underrepresented in the senior \nmanagerial, professional, board and ownership ranks.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 directs the Secretaries of Commerce \nand Energy to submit a report to Congress within 180 days assessing the \nbeneficial impact, if any, that lifting the crude oil export ban holds \nfor veterans and women.\n  This report should shed light on any additional measures that should \nbe taken to increase the participation of women and veterans in the \npetroleum industry as workers, executives, and entrepreneurs.\n  Nationally, there were 1.2 million people employed in the oil and gas \nindustry in 2010, only 17% of which are women.\n  Our booming energy sector has been one of the great American success \nstories over the last decade, and remains a bright spot in our economy \nas it continues to fuel job creation.\n  To continue this success and to ensure that opportunities and \nbenefits are shared equitably, it is critical that we have a diverse \nenergy workforce equipped with the skills, knowledge, and experiences \nneeded to compete and win in the global economy.\n  And there is no better place to look than from our pool of talented \nveterans and women?\n  Women make up half our population and are increasing their presence \nin the STEM fields vital to success in the petroleum energy sector.\n  Veterans not only have proved their mettle and leadership skills in \ndefense of our country but also are among the most resourceful and \nresilient members of our society, possessing the mission-critical ethic \nnecessary for success in the workplace.\n  A pipeline of qualified veterans and women looking for employment \ncould play a key role as the energy industry seeks qualified, \nmotivated, and skilled workers and entrepreneurs.\n  As a nation, we must remain committed to utilizing the talents of \nwomen and veterans if our nation is to meet the challenges and take \nadvantage of the opportunities offered by a dynamic global energy \nmarket.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 helps us meet this challenge by \nproviding critical information regarding the impact of lifting the \ncrude oil export ban will have on creating opportunities for veterans \nand women.\n  I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10.\n  Mr. Chairman, with that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, last Thursday was a tragic day for the \nAmerican maritime community and America. El Faro, an American flagship \nen route to Puerto Rico, was lost in Hurricane Joaquin and, with it, \nits 33 crew, including 28 Americans.\n  In the hours after we learned El Faro was in trouble, the Coast \nGuard, DOD, and other government and private sector partners mobilized \nassets with search crews battling treacherous weather conditions in an \nattempt to find survivors; and we appreciate their efforts.\n  Mr. Chair, today our thoughts and prayers are with the crewmembers' \nfamilies and loved ones. I ask that the House observe a moment of \nsilence to honor the brave men and women who served on the El Faro.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members will rise and observe a moment of silence.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Messer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Huffman moves to recommit the bill H.R. 702 to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Page 3, line 17, insert ``Nothing in this Act prevents the \n     President or any other Federal official from enforcing \n     Federal laws or regulations necessary to protect human \n     health, the environment, or public safety, including the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), the Hazardous \n     Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-129), the Pipeline \n     Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-355), the \n     Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act \n     of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-468), or the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory \n     Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pub. L. 112-90).'' \n     after ``prohibit exports.''.\n\n  Mr. BARTON (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to \nmake a point of order against the bill that it is not germane.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will continue to read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we suspend the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. BARTON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. BARTON. If I make a point of order that the motion to recommit is \nnot germane and it, in fact, is not germane, there is no vote. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not respond to a \nhypothetical. A point of order has been reserved.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order that the motion to \nrecommit is not germane. Oh, it is germane. I withdraw the point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The point of order and the reservation of \nthe point of order is withdrawn.\n  The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin with the usual stipulations. \nThis is the final amendment to the bill. It won't kill the bill or send \nit back to committee. When this is adopted, the bill will immediately \nproceed to final passage as amended, so there is no procedural reason \nto oppose this motion to recommit.\n  Let's talk about the substance. Now, we have heard a lot of debate \nthis morning about the need to give Big Oil--the most profitable \nindustry in the history of the world--yet another advantage. For years, \nAmericans have been told that we have to ``drill, baby, drill.'' The \ntheory that we always hear is that we need to extract every barrel of \noil from every acre of American soil to keep gas prices low and to \nprovide ``energy security.''\n  But as soon as American gas prices started to drop, the curtain was \nraised, and the truth was revealed. The real reason for ``drill, baby, \ndrill,'' surprise, surprise, was to give Big Oil the chance to maximize \ntheir profits on the world market.\n  It is not enough that they have been able to game the Tax Code for a \ncentury with billions of dollars of tax breaks not available to other \ntaxpayers or businesses. It is not enough that they continue to enjoy \naccess to our public lands and waters for oil drilling, even though \nthey are no longer paying into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nthe longstanding law that expired at the beginning of this month.\n  As a reminder, for the past 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation \nFund was an agreement, a compact between the American people and Big \nOil. It said that when we let oil and gas companies drill and profit \nfrom drilling in Federal waters, they have to dedicate a fraction of \nthe profits, just a fraction, to protect our great outdoors for future \ngenerations. The deal is that they have to dedicate a fraction of those \nprofits to protecting our great outdoors for future generations so that \nour grandchildren will be able to hike and hunt and fish in our parks \nand wildlife refuges.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was shamefully allowed to lapse \nat the beginning of this month, and the majority hasn't scheduled a \nsingle vote--or even a hearing--to get it back on the books. No, all of \nthese concessions to the oil and gas industry are not enough for this \nHouse.\n  With today's bill, the House majority is saying that American oil and \ngas companies can drill more, export more, and realize even greater \nprofits, no matter the environmental consequences, no matter the \nconsequences to health and safety. As presently written, the underlying \nbill, H.R. 702, would permanently ensure that no export restrictions \nfor any reason could be implemented or enforced in the future. That is \nwhat this bill says. That is breathtaking in its devotion to the oil \nand gas industry's agenda.\n  Now, my motion to recommit would ensure that the President and \nFederal\n\n[[Page H6964]]\n\nGovernment agencies charged with protecting human health, the \nenvironment, and public safety can continue to do their job that \nconstituents rely on them to do. Specifically, with this amendment, we \nwill ensure that bedrock health and safety laws, like the Safe Drinking \nWater Act and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act, that laws like \nthat will not be cast aside in favor of Big Oil's desire to sell more \ncrude overseas.\n  Now, if you think about it, this is a very straightforward motion.\n  I just want to ask my colleagues a question: Should crude oil exports \ntrump the Safe Drinking Water Act?\n  Should Big Oil profits trump the need for pipeline safety and \npipeline inspection?\n  Of course not. We need to protect safe drinking water. We need to \nensure pipeline safety. So, my colleagues, I urge you to vote ``yes'' \non this MTR to improve this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BARTON. First of all, I want to thank the minority for giving us \na one-page motion to recommit that I can actually read and understand. \nI have read it. I don't like it. It is not necessary. It is redundant. \nI oppose it. Please vote against it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

And although I wish the results had been very, very \ndifferent, we owe those men, as well, men and women, a debt of \ngratitude for risking their lives to try to find the crew of El Faro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6966-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING RON GIFFORD OF SCILL\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI.

A \nhighly trained workforce is the backbone of a strong, diverse economy. \nMany of the skills needed to compete in the global market of the 21st \ncentury are technically demanding.\n  Currently, the demand for qualified workers is increasing at a pace \nfar greater than existing communities can produce. Thanks to Ron's \ndedication, SCILL has focused on developing and training more workers \nto meet this demand, building a strong workforce to ensure the growth \nof our economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Ron Gifford for elevating the \ncontributions skilled workers make to ensure that our economy is \nstronger than ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6966-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Nothing. Despite an overwhelming amount of support \nacross the country for universal background checks, and bipartisan \nlegislation to implement them, this Congress did nothing.\n  Across my district in San Diego, moms, dads, college students, \nseniors have all been calling on us to take action that will keep our \nchildren and our community safe. They are angry at our inability to \nact, and I share their anger.\n  We should pass the bipartisan Thompson-King bill on background \nchecks, and we should do it today. That would be a good start to \naddressing this devastating problem.

It is an inclusive Latino \ncommunity-based, multicultural organization committed to strengthening \nthe emotional values of individuals and the preservation of families.\n  Their services help build strong families and communities, fight \ncycles of poverty, and bridge education and health disparities. For \nexample, they offer important healthcare services, job training, \neducation, and leadership development opportunities for disenfranchised \nyouth living in our neighborhoods.\n  I enjoy working with them.

Mr. Speaker, in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, \nI rise to pay tribute to an important Hispanic leader and public \nservant from my district, the late Governor Raul Castro.\n  Born in Cananea, Mexico, and growing up outside of Douglas, Arizona, \nGovernor Castro overcame many obstacles in his early life and attended \nthe Arizona State Teachers College.\n  He earned a law degree from the University of Arizona, later serving \nas Pima County attorney, a superior court judge, and the first Mexican-\nAmerican to serve as the Governor of the State of Arizona. He has also \nserved as U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, Bolivia, and Argentina.\n  Next week, I will join officials from around Arizona for a ceremony \nrenaming the Douglas port of entry after Governor Castro. I can think \nof no more fitting tribute for a man who served as a role model and \nbridge to a generation of young Hispanics looking to enter public life.\n  We are a stronger and more diverse Nation thanks to the influence and \nhard work of Hispanic Americans like Governor Castro, and I am proud to \njoin in recognizing their invaluable contributions this month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6967-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPPORTING OUR SENIORS\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE.

For 30 percent of \nbeneficiaries in 2016, their cost is projected to increase by 52 \npercent, from $154 to $159. This increase will be accompanied by an \nincrease in the part B deductible, from $147 to $223. Congress must act \nto protect the approximately 6 million Medicare beneficiaries who will \nsee a significant increase in their Medicare premiums and deductible.\n  It is very important to realize that my State of Texas would have a \n$159 million increase. It is my intention to introduce legislation, a \nsense of Congress, that indicates that Congress must act to protect our \nseniors. They helped build this Nation.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the recognition. I appreciate \nyou staying on the floor with me today.\n  It has been a week of inside-the-beltway activity. I can't find a \nsingle Member of Congress on this floor--and I have been talking to a \nlot of them--who ran for Congress because they thought the most \nimportant job we were going to have was picking our House leadership.\n  It is an important responsibility. It is an important job, Mr. \nSpeaker. I can't tell you how difficult it is to lead 435 leaders. It \nis not a shortage of leaders we have here. Sometimes it is a shortage \nof good followers we have here.\n  But nobody ran for Congress for that. You ran for Congress because we \nhad serious business that the American people asked us to be about, and \nmost of that business is not inside leadership conversations. It is \nabout the American economy. It is about feeding one's family. It is \nabout having a predictable future for one's children. It is about \nopportunity.\n  I want to begin, Mr. Speaker, with three of the challenges that are \nout in front of us. The reason good leadership in this institution is \nimportant is because we have serious challenges.\n  When I got here in 2011, we elected John Boehner Speaker of the House \nbecause John Boehner said we can do amazing things in divided \ngovernment. We don't have to sit back and wait until we control all \nbranches of government as Republicans. The Democrats don't have to sit \nback and wait until they control everything, Mr. Speaker. We can do \namazing things together, and that is exactly what he did.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  And we did it around finding those things on which Americans agree.\n  I have up here the looming insolvencies for our major social safety \nnet programs, Mr. Speaker. Social Security Disability Insurance reaches \ninsolvency next year, next year. It is not 20 years from now, not 10 \nyears from now. It is next year.\n  If you are an American and you are counting on Social Security \nDisability Insurance to provide for you and your family because you \nhave paid into it faithfully your entire career--forbid the thought \nsomething has happened to you, now you must rely on it--we have a cash \nflow situation next year leading to insolvency. That is the smallest of \nour concerns, Mr. Speaker.\n  We go next to Medicare, insolvent in 2030. Medicare. Social Security, \ninsolvent in 2035.\n  Social Security and Medicare, as you know, Mr. Speaker, are funded by \npayroll taxes. Payroll taxes are that FICA line on our pay stubs. It is \nthe largest tax, at 15.3 percent of every worker's paycheck in this \ncountry. It is the largest tax that most American families pay.\n  I want you to think about that. Here we are talking about earning the \nAmerican people's trust. Here we are talking about delivering for the \nAmerican people on their priorities. The largest tax that most \nAmericans pay goes to fund two programs that we\n\n[[Page H6968]]\n\nknow with certainty, as we sit here today, aren't going to survive in \ntheir current configuration. The cash flow just won't allow it.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to preach doom and gloom. I am here \nto preach opportunity. I am preaching opportunity because I work with \n434 other people here who also believe that, if we work together, we \ncan do amazing things for the American people.\n  I have got a chart here, Mr. Speaker. You can't see it from your \nperch. But it is the projected economic growth rates in this country. \nAgain, I am trying to distinguish what is happening in terms of a \nleadership discussion here from what is happening in a broader \nleadership discussion about America.\n  And what I show here is that year after year after year for the \npast--I have 3 years represented here on the screen, Mr. Speaker, but \nit goes back 5 years. Every year the Congressional Budget Office--that \ngroup of economists that help us to craft the numbers in a bipartisan \nway--every year the Congressional Budget Office reports that their \nanticipated economic growth for America is lower in this year than it \nwas the year before. And it was lower last year than the year before \nthat. And it was lower that year than the year before that.\n  When we fail to succeed together, Mr. Speaker, it is not an academic \nconversation. When we succeed in the wrong way, it is not an oops \nmoment. It has a real impact on economic growth in this country.\n  These may be colors on a chart, Mr. Speaker, but what they represent \nare jobs for families. What they represent are manufacturers who \ndecided to stay in America or leave America. What they represent are \nentrepreneurs who either succeeded in their business or who were \ncrushed by regulatory burdens. These decisions we make have \nconsequences, Mr. Speaker.\n  I have an interest rate chart here. You can't tell, but what you \nwould see if you could see it, Mr. Speaker, is that we are borrowing \nmoney today at the lowest interest rate in American history. It is \nvirtually free. It is virtually free today because we have the best of \nall the worst economies on the planet.\n  Folks are interested in buying our debt. Right now there are stories \nin The Wall Street Journal about the Germans dumping our debt, about \nthe Chinese dumping our debt. But because markets are frightened around \nthe globe, there is more demand than there are folks selling.\n  I put the interest rates up, Mr. Speaker, because I am talking about \nsolving big problems today. We are going to talk about big problems. We \nare going to talk about solutions that we have come to here in this \nbody. But too often, when we talk about balancing the budget, it sounds \nlike it is a numbers game.\n  The only numbers game balancing the budget is the numbers game 320 \nmillion because that is how many Americans live in this country and are \ncounting on us to succeed for them.\n  When we borrow money, we end up paying interest on that money.\n  I am so weary of the political ecochamber, Mr. Speaker, that tells \nthe story of the folks on the left who say, ``I want every program in \nAmerica to succeed, and, in fact, I want to spend even more on it'' or \nthe folks on the right who say, ``I will never ever raise your taxes. \nYou don't have to pay for those programs that you want.'' Because both \nsides are wrong.\n  What I have here, Mr. Speaker, is a chart of the interest that we are \npaying on our national debt today. Now, we will talk about the interest \nwe are going to be paying 10 years from now if we don't solve the \nproblem. But this red line represents the interest we are paying on our \nnational debt today: $229 billion this year.\n  Balancing the budget is not an academic conversation. Balancing the \nbudget is the difference between spending $229 billion on interest on \nthe debt versus other American priorities.\n  You can't see it, Mr. Speaker, but education is represented by this \nblue line. I want you to see that. The Federal Government spends more \nmoney in interest on our national debt. Even though we borrowed that \nmoney at the lowest interest rates in American history, teaser rates, \nwe spend more in interest on our national debt than we spend on \neducation for our children.\n  We are trying to pass a transportation bill right now, Mr. Speaker. \nWe are trying to put people back to work in America building roads so \nthat we will have the best infrastructure in the world, so that we will \nmove goods and services to market better than any other nation in the \nworld, so that we can have our people moving from place to place, \ncreating jobs and economic activity better than anyplace else in the \nworld.\n  We spend half. Half of what we spend on interest payments this year \nwe will spend on transportation, Mr. Speaker. We spend the same amount \non interest payments in 2015 that we will spend on education and \ntransportation combined.\n  I want you to think about that, Mr. Speaker. We could double the \nspending on education in this country, as my friends on the left \npropose to do. We could double spending on transportation in this \ncountry, as my friends on the left propose to do, if we would balance \nthe budget and get out of the interest payment business, as my friends \non the right propose to do.\n  This is a common goal. This is a shared focus. This is not something \nthat divides us. This is something that unites us.\n  Environment and natural resources: $41 billion is being spent by the \nFederal Government this year. We spend five times more than that on \ninterest payments.\n  Science, space, and technology, Mr. Speaker: Who is going to have \nthat next manned mission to space? Who is going to be the first to have \na human being on Mars? What are we going to learn out beyond the stars? \nWe spend one-tenth the amount of our interest payments on that \npriority.\n  Energy policy: How many times have we heard the refrain ``an all-of-\nthe-above energy policy. Let's find next-generation energy solutions. \nLet's focus on wind and solar and fuel cells''? I don't dispute any of \nthat. I dispute the commitment that we have to it when we spend 23 \ntimes more on interest payments than we spend on all energy policy \ncombined.\n\n  When I am talking about balancing the budget, Mr. Speaker, when I am \ntalking about making tough choices, I am not talking about an academic \nconversation about making the numbers balance. I am talking about a \nreordering of American priorities, where we would rather spend money on \nour children, on our roads, on our environment, on exploration, on \nnext-generation energy, than we would paying back debts of the past.\n  We are going to make good on our debts. But we can control whether or \nnot we are paying those debts down or whether we are running those \ndebts up. Interest that we pay on our national debt isn't a number on a \nledger. It is a category that pushes out so many other American \npriorities.\n  That is this year, Mr. Speaker. This chart represents this year.\n  If you fast-forward 10 years, under current law, we will be spending \nmore on our national debt than we spend on national security. I don't \nmean paying back our debt, Mr. Speaker. I mean we will be spending more \nin interest payments on our national debt than we will be spending \nprotecting the national security of the United States of America.\n  That is why the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral \nMullen, said the largest threat to America's national security is \nrising debt, because our debt and the accompanying interest payments \nare squeezing out so many other American priorities.\n  Mr. Speaker, folks don't understand how the American budget works. I \nput a pie chart up here that captures that. We are going to get into \nsome pretty serious debates here on the floor of this House in the next \ncouple of months, primarily about something that we call discretionary \nspending.\n  Discretionary spending I have represented up here, Mr. Speaker, by \nblue pie slices on the pie chart. Defense and nondefense spending are \nthe two big categories, which means defense and almost everything else \nyou think of as the Federal Government. Those are the decisions--these \nin blue, Mr. Speaker--that you and I have to make every year. That \ndistinguishes it from these decisions in red.\n  Social Security spending, Medicare spending, Medicaid spending, \ninterest on the national debt, other mandatory\n\n[[Page H6969]]\n\nprograms. These programs in red, Mr. Speaker, as you know, we won't \nrevisit those this year.\n  Yes. The Constitution requires that every dollar appropriated from \nthe Treasury be appropriated from the House. But the House, in 1935, \ndecided that some of these dollars needed to go out the door, and they \nare still going out the door today. We can't change it without passing \na new bill in the House, a new bill in the Senate, and a new bill that \nthe President signs.\n  We spend all of our time in this body, Mr. Speaker, arguing about \nnibbling around the edges on the blue categories of the chart, which is \nthe small third of the pie. The real challenge in balancing the budget \nlies in these red slices of the pie, and I am going to tell you why.\n  What I have charted here is a look at revenues in this country as a \npercent of GDP. So often we measure our success against the size of the \neconomy. What are we spending relative to the size of the economy? \nBecause if our population grows, if the economy grows, of course our \ntax base will grow. And so, too, in many cases will our expenses grow. \nSo we chart these things against the size of the economy.\n  This red line represents our historic revenues going back to 1965: \nall of the taxes through the Nixon administration, into the Ford \nadministration, Carter administration, Reagan administration, all the \nway through to today. In fact, we chart it out into 2045. When you see \nthis line go flat on revenues, Mr. Speaker, it is because we are just \npredicting they are level as a percent of the economy.\n  But what I have also charted are the spending priorities that were in \nthe red slice of the pie shown earlier, the mandatory spending slices \nof the pie.\n  This blue line represents Medicaid and other Federal healthcare \nexpenditures, like the President's Affordable Care Act.\n  This green line represents Medicare, created in 1965. It used to be \nnonexistent. Now it is a very large slice of the pie. Again, it \nrepresents some of the largest taxes that the American people pay.\n  This light section here represents Social Security, Mr. Speaker, and \nthis blue line represents net interest.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you could see it out on the end of this chart, what \nyou would see is Medicaid spending is growing quickly, but on a \npredictable line. Medicare spending is growing quickly, but on a \npredictable line. Social Security spending is almost flat, Mr. Speaker, \neven though it is a big part of the pie.\n  What is growing is interest payments. And when the blue line crosses \nthe red line, that is where these four programs--interest on the \nnational debt, Social Security payments, Medicare payments, and \nMedicaid payments--where those programs alone consume every single \npenny in any tax paid by any American. This is out about 10 years from \nnow, Mr. Speaker.\n  About 10 years from now every single penny that every single American \npays in taxes will be consumed by these four programs. These programs \nwill be insolvent because there is no more money.\n  Every other priority will have been squeezed out of the budget. And \n``by every other priority,'' Mr. Speaker, I mean we are cutting \ntransportation to zero, we are putting education to zero, we are \ncutting national parks to zero, we are cutting national security to \nzero.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  This is not an academic conversation about balancing the budget. It \nis a national security conversation because we need to fund that \npriority. It is an education conversation because we need to fund that \npriority. It is an environment and parks conversation because we need \nto fund that priority. These mandatory spending programs threaten to \nconsume every single penny of Federal revenue.\n  Just to be clear, Mr. Speaker, in case there is any confusion, some \nfolks say: Well, Rob, why don't you just raise more revenue? Let's just \nraise taxes on the American people, then we will have enough money to \nmake that happen.\n  Mr. Speaker, what I am showing you in this chart is, no, that won't \nsolve the problem. This green line, I go from 2006 out to 2044 here, \nMr. Speaker, and this green line represents historical revenue. When we \nhit this big economic downturn over the past 5 years, Mr. Speaker, \nrevenues collapsed. It turns out if the American people can't find a \njob, the American people can't pay any taxes. That is pretty common \nsense.\n  I say to my friends on the left, Mr. Speaker, if you want more taxes \nin the tax base, create more jobs. If folks have jobs, they can pay. \nWhen we ran out of jobs, we ran out of money, yet we spent even more \nbecause American families were hurting in that period of time.\n  Well, I graphed this out to 2044, Mr. Speaker, and what you see is, \nunder current law--this red line represents current law--if we add no \nnew programs, if we don't spend any additional dollars, we just follow \nthe current law, make no new promises to the American people, the \nspending required by current law more than doubles current revenues.\n  So we are not talking about raising somebody's taxes a percent or \ntwo. We are talking about doubling everyone's taxes all across this \ncountry in every category. And when we do that, Mr. Speaker, that will \nsolve the problem until about 2030, and then that won't be enough to \nfund it either.\n  Taxes are not the problem. Our problem is that we are not raising \nenough money. Our problem is that current law is spending too much \nmoney, and we have got to come together to fix it.\n  Well, now I get to the good news part of the presentation, Mr. \nSpeaker. I am talking about bad news and the debt is squeezing out \nevery other funding priority in America. I am talking about bad news \nthat the major social programs of this Nation are fiscally insolvent. I \nam talking about bad news because there is just no way to tax the \nAmerican people at a high enough rate to fund those priorities. The \ngood news is we have come together in this body to work on the spending \nside together.\n  Look at this, Mr. Speaker. It is unbelievable. Folks sometimes ask me \nback home, Mr. Speaker, they say: Rob, why do you take so many charts \ndown to the House floor? Why are you down there talking about this? Do \nyou know what my answer is? Because no one believes me. No one believes \nme.\n  If you go home, Mr. Speaker--and I challenge you to do this. Go home \nand tell your constituents that when the big class of 2010 got here, \nwhen Republicans took over the House in 2011 and so we had divided \ngovernment--again, as John Boehner always says, you can do big things \nin divided government. When Republicans took over the House, President \nObama was leading the White House, we were spending $3.6 trillion as a \nnation--3.6 trillion.\n  Now, the baby boomers began to retire in this window, so 10,000, Mr. \nSpeaker, 10,000 men and women every day who had been paying Medicare \nand Social Security taxes their entire lives began applying for the \nbenefits that they had earned through that lifetime of work. So we have \nSocial Security and Medicare spending, two of the biggest categories of \nFederal spending, growing exponentially because of all these new \napplicants to the program, all these folks coming to cash in on their \nbenefits.\n  And what happened in divided government? We came together in this \nbody in what is the best vote I have taken in 4\\1/2\\ years with a \nvoting card, and we passed the Budget Control Act. I didn't get \neverything I wanted. My Republican colleagues didn't get everything \nthey wanted; my Democratic friends didn't get everything they wanted; \nand the President didn't get everything he wanted; but we made a step \nforward for America, and we cut total Federal spending.\n  We changed our priorities, Mr. Speaker. We began to look and see what \nwas essential Federal spending and what was just kind of nice to do? \nWhat did we have to do to meet the promises we made to America, and \nwhere were those dollars that we weren't getting as much utility out \nof? So total Federal spending--not funny, Washington, D.C., math with \ninflation-adjusted dollars--total dollar bills going out the door from \nthe Federal Government dropped from 2011 to 2012.\n  I had never seen it before in my lifetime, Mr. Speaker, never seen it \nbefore in my lifetime. But we weren't done, because when you put 435 \nminds together in here, you really can do some neat things, Mr. \nSpeaker. In divided government where we all have skin in the game, \nwhere we are all trying to\n\n[[Page H6970]]\n\naccomplish a goal, you can do some amazing things. So from 2012 to \n2013, still with 10,000 men and women a day applying for new Social \nSecurity and Medicare benefits that they had earned, we cut total \nFederal spending again--again, not funny Washington, D.C., math, but \nreprioritizing what those goals were the American people sent us here \nto achieve and trying to achieve those goals, not because it is a \nmathematical exercise, but because if we don't, interest on our \nnational debt is going to squeeze out all of the other priorities that \nwe share as a nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, 2 years in a row, while the population was growing, \nwhile the economy was struggling, and while seniors were retiring at a \nrecord pace, we came together and reprioritized Federal spending to \nunburden the next generation. Mr. Speaker, we couldn't do that alone as \nRepublicans, and we couldn't have done that alone as Democrats. We \ncould only do that working together, and we did, 2 years in a row, \nfirst time, Mr. Speaker, in anybody's lifetime on this floor.\n  I have charted it a different way, Mr. Speaker, because we spend so \nmuch time beating up on each other as if we are failures. I tell folks \nback home that Congress has about a 12 percent approval rating, and we \nseem to use that entire 12 percent approval rating to tell everybody \nhow awful we are: Oh, it is just terrible; folks can't get along; they \nall hate each other; everybody is on the take; and Washington is a \ngiant cesspool. Please send me back for 2 more years.\n  Where does that come from? What kind of sense does that make.\n  We have had a lot of conscientious people on the floor of the House, \nMr. Speaker, who leave their families and who leave their communities \nto come here on a mission that their constituents sent them to do, and \nin every category--I have charted three things here, Mr. Speaker. I \nhave charted what we call discretionary spending, that is what most \npeople think of as government: parks, courts, environment, \ntransportation, and national security. All of those things that you \nthink of as government, if you are on the green line in discretionary \nspending.\n  This red line is the mandatory spending. That is the interest on the \nnational debt: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those mandatory \nprograms, dollars go out the door every year.\n  This blue line is total spending across the whole government, Mr. \nSpeaker. What I have shown here--and again, these are not inflation-\nadjusted dollars; these are actual dollar bills going out the door--\nthis dotted line in each category represents where the spending was \ngoing, where the Congressional Budget Office--again, it is a \nnonpartisan group of economists here--predicted the Federal Government \nwas going to go when John Boehner took over as Speaker in 2011, before \nwe had divided government, before we were able to come together and do \nbig things.\n  The solid line represents what is actually happening with Federal \nspending, what is actually happening. What you see, Mr. Speaker, is \nthat even on the mandatory spending programs, we are getting reductions \nover what was anticipated. Certainly on the discretionary spending \nprograms we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. In total \nFederal spending, we are getting reductions. Folks think nothing is \nhappening here. They say: Rob, for Pete's sake, you have to go and you \nhave to balance the budget. You have to make these things happen.\n  I can't make everybody agree with me on everything. Put me and two or \nthree other Members together, Mr. Speaker, give us all the powers of \ngovernment, and we could probably solve this in a week or two. But \nthere are 435 of us, and that is not all of us. That is just here. We \nhave another 100 folks across the way in the Senate.\n  Do you know what they say about the Senate, Mr. Speaker? They say the \ndifference between a Senator and God is that God knows He is not a \nSenator. You have heard that one, haven't you?\n  The power that is on the other side of the Hill has to be reckoned \nwith, too, not to mention folks down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But \nwe all got together, 100 of them, 435 of us, and 1 President at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue, and we bent the lines on spending.\n  Now, is spending still going up, Mr. Speaker? It is. What you see \nhere is that we have curtailed it inside our current window. It is the \noutyears where the rise really begins.\n  Why is it rising? Look here. Discretionary spending, these are all of \nthose priorities we talked about earlier, that is going down in kind of \na flat line going out over the 10-year horizon. It is mandatory \nspending that is still going up. Even with the changes we have made, it \nis still going up.\n  When we talk about what the problem is with spending in this country \nand we talk about what the challenge is with balancing the budget, it \nis not that we are spending a little money here or a little money there \non education or transportation or the courts or the parks or even \nnational defense. The problem is that you have promised me--I am in my \nforties, Mr. Speaker. You have promised me Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits that you can't possibly live up to. There is no cash flow \nmodel that leaves enough money in the trust funds for me to access it \nwhen I retire, and you need to be honest with me and tell me that today \nwhile I have another 30 years to prepare for it.\n  They did a survey of young people, Mr. Speaker. More young people in \nAmerica, more millennials believe that they would see a UFO in their \nlifetime than see a Social Security check in their lifetime.\n  Now, I have just told you this is the largest tax that most Americans \npay, and we have so broken the trust with the American people as a \nspending body here in government that young people who are paying that \ngiant FICA tax, the largest FICA tax in American history, they don't \nbelieve they will ever see a penny from it.\n  We have made these changes together, Mr. Speaker. We can do better. \nWe can make more. But the arguments that the American people are going \nto hear--and this is critically important. The arguments that the \nAmerican people are going to hear over the next 4 months are going to \nbe about $1 billion here and $1 billion there when we have a $100 \ntrillion problem.\n  The arguments that folks are going to hear over the next 4 months, \nMr. Speaker, are all going to be focused on this sliver down here in \nthe green area. This body is going to become consumed with nibbling \naround the edges on discretionary spending on which we have already \nsucceeded. We have already begun the process of redefining those \npriorities. Where we haven't done enough is on mandatory spending.\n  I have got to find a way, Mr. Speaker, we have got to find a way to \ncome together to do the heavy lifting that is mandatory spending. No \none is going to go to any senior in America and tell them that we are \ngoing to pull the rug out from under them now that they have already \nretired. Nobody is going to do that. Nobody is proposing that. Nobody \nis talking about that. And if you are a senior citizen in America, Mr. \nSpeaker, rest assured that the only thing anyone is working on here is \nmaking sure the trust funds survive to pay you those benefits that have \nbeen promised.\n  When we are talking about making changes, we are talking about making \nchanges to my generation and younger folks to connect the reality, \nwhich is we can't afford those promises with the reality that I am \nstill paying those taxes and redefining that relationship, Mr. Speaker, \nin a way that America can keep the promises.\n  I don't mind delivering bad news to folks. You have to pay for what \nyou want in this country. If you want more benefits, we will have to \nraise your taxes. If you want fewer benefits, we can cut your taxes. \nRight now, we are providing more benefits without raising taxes. We \nwon't raise taxes on each other. We will raise taxes on our children \nand grandchildren instead. We won't cut benefits for each other. We cut \nbenefits for our children and grandchildren instead. There is a better \nway forward, but we are going to find it together.\n  Again, I put the charts up, Mr. Speaker, because folks won't believe \nit. These are actual dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. This \nchart represents the dollars that we have control over in this body, \nthe dollars that we have to get together and decide on every year. \nAgain, two-thirds of the budget goes out the door whether this body \nshows up for work or not. It is on autopilot.\n\n[[Page H6971]]\n\n  The dollars that go out the door because we show up for work we have \nbeen reprioritizing, reallocating, and refocusing every single year. \nThe result of that is a more effective and more efficient Federal \nGovernment to accomplish the priorities the American people have sent \nus here to accomplish, and we are borrowing less from our children and \nour grandchildren.\n  It is a morality issue, Mr. Speaker. These are our Federal deficits. \nThis is the money that we are borrowing from our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  When George Bush was leaving office, and if he were here on the floor \nof the House today, Mr. Speaker, he would tell you, it was no source of \npride for him as he was leaving office that he ran up the single \nlargest deficit in American history. It was a Republican in the White \nHouse, it was Democrats running Capitol Hill, but together, in divided \ngovernment, they came together and ran up the single largest annual \ndeficit in American history.\n  This one, Mr. Speaker, you can't see it, this little bitty one that \nis almost too small to read on the chart, this was once the largest \ndeficit in American history.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Then we left divided government. We went to unified government where \none party controlled everything, and we went to this deficit for 1 year \nand this deficit for the next year and this deficit for the next year, \ndeficits, Mr. Speaker, two and three times larger than the deficit that \nGeorge Bush set as the highest annual deficit in American history.\n  Mr. Speaker, those were dark economic times for the country. \nEverybody has hindsight that is 20/20. No, I wouldn't have supported \nthat spending had I been here at that time. I wasn't in Congress at \nthat time. But those deficits are a reality. Those dollars have been \nborrowed.\n  That money is now being repaid with interest every day of the week. I \ntake that back. No, it is not. We don't repay a penny of our debt. I \ndon't know if we have ever had that conversation. We don't repay a \npenny.\n  Let's be clear. We pay interest on our national debt. We just keep \nborrowing. When a principal payment comes due, we borrow more money \nfrom someone else to pay back the interest and principal that we \nborrowed from somebody years ago. We don't pay back a penny. We just \nborrow more and more and more. These represent increasing borrowing \namounts.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, this is the first budget that that class of 2010 \ngot to work on together. This is the second. This is the third. This is \nthe fourth. This is where we are right now.\n  We are making progress together. We are doing this together not as a \nmathematical exercise, but as a moral imperative not to borrow and \nmortgage the future of our children and our grandchildren. We are \nheaded in the right direction, but we have to do more.\n  I don't want to look like I am patting us on the back, Mr. Speaker. \nThe challenge is enormous. And, yes, we are grappling with it. But, \nlook, this chart represents historical deficits back again as a percent \nof GDP. These other charts I showed you were in actual dollars going \nout the door.\n  We use percent of GDP so we can kind of compare apples to apples \nbecause a dollar going out the door in 1942 would have been more money \ngoing out the door today. So we do it as a percent of the economy to \ntry to make it be comparable.\n  We go back here to 1965, Mr. Speaker. We borrow, borrow, borrow, \nborrow, borrow. Throughout all the 1980s we borrowed. Do you remember \nthose conversations in the 1980s, Mr. Speaker, where folks thought \nRonald Reagan and Tip O'Neill and Congress were going to borrow us into \noblivion? We thought the 1980s were the dark days of Federal spending \nbecause we were running up deficits that were so large.\n  Here those are, Mr. Speaker, these, what looked like high points \nthen, but turned out to be low points by more recent history standards. \nThese are those 1980 deficits. These are the early Clinton deficits. \nThese surpluses are the successes that Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton \nhad together, again, divided government producing results. We went back \nto unified government here with not-so-good results. We went to divided \ngovernment. Now we are getting back on track.\n  But if you look at--and I project it another 10 years out, Mr. \nSpeaker. If we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. Under current \nlaw, if we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again.\n  Yes, we have come together on the Budget Control Act and we have done \namazing things. We have come together to end what was called the \nsustainable growth rate. They call it the doc fix. I don't know why \nthey call it that. It was a patient fix. It was this gimmick in law \nthat was undermining healthcare security for all seniors. We came \ntogether and we fixed that.\n  We made changes to the Medicare program that both solved a current \nproblem and prevented future problems. Reinvesting more money in the \ntrust fund, putting off those deficits, we can do those things \ntogether.\n  But we have got to start now, Mr. Speaker. Again, we are going to \ntalk over the next 4 months about $1 billion here and $1 billion there. \nI want to talk about $1 trillion here and $1 trillion there. This \nchart, Mr. Speaker, represents the nature of our challenge.\n  If we want to get back to what I would call Federal debt levels that \nare historically normal, if it is okay to confess that, yes, we have a \nchart that says: As America, let's not have debt that is incredibly \nhigh. Let's just have debt that is kind of an average high.\n  That is what we are going to define as success, just an average high \ndebt, average dangerous debt. We are going to define that as success.\n  And to get to that point, Mr. Speaker, if we start today, we are \ngoing to have to deal with about 1.1 percent of GDP. That is going to \nbe the size of the change. We are going to have to deal with about 1 \npercent of the size of the entire economy.\n  What is that going to be? A 1 percent increase in taxes? A 1 percent \nreduction in spending? No. It is much larger than that. GDP is the \nentire American economy. Federal spending and Federal taxes are just a \nvery small part of that.\n  When we talk about moving the needle on 1 percent of GDP, we are \ntalking about big, big dollars. It is a huge challenge, huge challenge, \nif we started today.\n  The tale I am telling, Mr. Speaker, is, if we wait 5 years, the \nchallenge gets 30 percent harder. It is a huge challenge today. Some \nwould argue it is an insurmountable challenge today.\n  If we fail to address it today, Mr. Speaker, it will be 30 percent \nharder just 5 years down the road. Mr. Speaker, wait 10 years down the \nroad and it is almost twice as hard. It is almost twice as hard to \nconquer 10 years down the road.\n  We don't talk about Social Security going bankrupt in 2035 because we \nare trying to be alarmists. We talk about it going bankrupt in 2035 \nbecause the time to solve that is today. We talk about Medicare going \nbankrupt in 2030 not to be alarmists, but because the time to solve \nthat is today.\n  These funding challenges that we have are hard today. They are twice \nas hard tomorrow. We have got to find the courage today to come \ntogether and make these changes.\n  Now, that is to keep things as they are. If what you want to do is to \nmake things better, you see, the challenge is even harder. If what you \nwant to do is begin to pay some debt back, the challenges are even \nlarger.\n  I am not setting my sights on the big line, Mr. Speaker. I am trying \nto focus on the little line because success begets success.\n  When we came together and solved the Budget Control Act, we were then \nable to come together and solve the Medicare challenge. When we came \ntogether and solved the Medicare challenge, we were then able to come \ntogether and solve our defense challenge. One time and one time and one \ntime and one time. When you wake up 365 days later, you find out you \nhave really gotten some work done.\n  There are a lot of numbers on this chart, Mr. Speaker, and I will \nsend you a copy of it. But we are talking about a 14 percent revenue \nincrease or a 13 percent spending increase today, today, to begin this \nprocess.\n  The size of our challenge today, the challenge that I said was easy, \nthe challenge that I said we could achieve together, the challenge that \nI said divided government gave us an opportunity to be successful at, \nthat is a 14 percent revenue increase, 14 percent tax hike today, or a \n13 percent spending cut today. And then we are going to\n\n[[Page H6972]]\n\nneed to do it again next year and again next year and again the year \nafter that.\n  This is the easy challenge, Mr. Speaker. We have come together to \ncreate the largest deficit reduction package in the history of the \ncountry. Republicans, Democrats, Congress, the White House, we did it. \nWe have time to do it again.\n  I know there is an election year coming. I know folks want to focus \non who is going to win in November. I know folks want Democrats to try \nto take over Congress or Republicans to try to take over the White \nHouse. I know that is the national conversation.\n  But whichever side of that battle you pick, wouldn't your candidate \nbe advantaged if Republicans and Democrats had been successful for the \nAmerican people on yet another big challenge?\n  There is only one way forward, and it is hard. There is only one way \nforward, and it is together. Please let us not burn bridges quibbling \nover $1 billion here and $1 billion there over the next 4 months. One \nbillion dollars is a lot of money, a lot of money. But our problems are \ntrillion-dollar problems, and I want us to join together to solve them \nbecause I know that we can.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6972-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. DeFazio (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of a \nmedical procedure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/09/house-section/article/H6972-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. WOODALL.
