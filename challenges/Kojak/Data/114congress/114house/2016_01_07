The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, Washington has, once again, \nundermined and betrayed struggling American workers who seek jobs that \npay enough to support their families.\n  In December, on less than 72 hours' notice, Congress and President \nObama shoved down the throats of Americans a 2,000-page, financially \nirresponsible, $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill that not only risks \nAmerica's solvency, it also threatens American jobs for American \nworkers.\n  Under old law, 66,000 H-2B foreign worker visas could be issued each \nyear. Buried deep inside the 2,000-page omnibus spending bill, on page \n701, is an obscure provision without even a heading that, according to \nlabor expert John Miano, increases available H-2B visas up to 264,000 \nper year, effectively quadrupling visas for low-skilled, temporary \nnonagricultural foreign workers.\n  Making matters worse, on New Year's Eve, while America focused on \nfootball games and celebrations, President Obama issued a 200-page \nproposed rule to illegally bust statutory green card immigration caps \nby approving unlimited numbers of work permits for foreigners who don't \nhave green cards. This White House action is yet another brazen display \nof contempt for immigration statutes, the rule of law, and American \nworkers.\n  The White House argues importing foreign labor is necessary because \nof a claimed shortage of American labor. Similarly, House Speaker Paul \nRyan claims increasing foreign worker visas ``helps small businesses \nwho cannot find labor when there's a surge in demand for their labor, \nlike seafood processing or tourism.''\n  This claimed labor shortage is unsupported by jobs or wage data and \nis political bunk. Per Federal labor statistics, 57 percent--57 \npercent--of Americans without a high school diploma had no job in \n2015's second quarter. That bears repeating. Fifty-seven percent of \nAmericans without a high school diploma had no job in 2015's second \nquarter. That is a lot of Americans who would love to have those jobs \nPresident Obama and Congress denied Americans and gave to foreigners.\n  Economics 101 explains that wages rise if there is a labor shortage \nand fall if there is a labor surplus. According to Census Bureau data \nfrom 2007 to 2014; wages for security guards went down 6.1 percent, for \ncooks down 4.4 percent; for janitors down 1.2 percent; for ushers, \nlobby attendants, and ticket takers, down 7.1 percent; for hotel, \nmotel, and resort desk clerks, down 7 percent. The list of falling \nwages for low-income American workers goes on and on. This falling wage \ndata is compelling evidence that there is no shortage of American labor \nand, to the contrary, that there is an oversupply of American labor \nthat demands cutting foreign labor, not expanding it.\n  Mr. Speaker, while these surges in foreign worker visas and foreign \nlabor work permits is a huge victory for special interests that profit \nfrom suppressed wages, it is a debilitating loss for struggling \nAmerican families.\n  Unemployed and underpaid Americans desperate for a good-paying job \nhave every right to be angry at a Federal Government that takes \nAmerican jobs from American citizens and gives\n\n[[Page H106]]\n\nthem to foreigners. Americans have every right to be angry at \nWashington elected officials who care more about special interest \ncampaign contributions than American voters who elected us. I hope \nthose Americans will remember their anger during 2016's primary and \ngeneral elections. That is the way to force Washington to represent us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for anybody else, but, as for me, Mo \nBrooks from Alabama's Fifth Congressional District, I fight for the \neconomic interests of American citizens and against policies that \nundermine the struggling American voters who sent us here. That is part \nof the reason why I voted against December's financially irresponsible \nomnibus spending bill--and am proud of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H106-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MALHEUR NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, with the odd drama playing out in Oregon \nwhere armed thugs have taken over a Federal wildlife facility, it is \nimportant to reflect on what the wildlife refuge system is all about.\n  If these people had any argument with the President, it was with \nPresident Roosevelt, who 108 years ago established the Malheur National \nWildlife Refuge as a response to protect natural resources, especially \nthe slaughter of wild birds for feathers to adorn women's hats.\n  It is ironic that the President, who in his younger days participated \nin the slaughter of over 6 million buffalo that roamed the Midwest \nplains on a magnificent ecostructure, realized the necessity of \nprotecting these resources. Today we benefit from the foresight of this \nconservation President who provided the cornerstone of environmental \nprotection that enriches us all.\n  The notion that somehow this is the ``wild west,'' where people can \ndo with public land what they want, is thoroughly discredited. This \nmind-set from the 1800s that there were endless, wide-open spaces, \nwhere people could do what they wished, when they wished, where they \nwished, is tinged with regret and tragedy. We took away the land from \nNative Americans that our government had given to them in solemn \ntreaty, ratified by Congress.\n  The mind-set that public lands of the West were to be exploited as \nrapidly as possible is still embodied in the Mining Act of 1872, which \nessentially allows anyone, including foreign mining operations, to \nexploit our country's mineral resources at basically no cost and with \nno enforceable obligation to repair the damage they inflicted. The West \nis now blighted with thousands of abandoned mines and oil and gas wells \nthat will risk being a permanent scar on the landscape. While private \nprofit was pursued, the public was left with the consequences and the \ncost of cleanup, if it ever occurs.\n  The longstanding battles over American rangeland between competing \nowners and between competing uses, like cattle and sheep, were not \npretty. There is no doubt that there are still significant problems \ndealing with public land management, in part because the rules of the \ngame are still set by the Mining Act of 1872 and the Taylor Grazing Act \nof 1934.\n  All but the most reckless individuals would agree that if these \nstatutes were written today they would look fundamentally different \nwith more protections and clarity. It was into this void that Teddy \nRoosevelt stepped, declaring critical national monuments. He \nestablished wildlife refuges to benefit countless generations to come.\n  These amazing treasures are not just scenic wonders. They hold \nextraordinarily valuable habitat for wildlife, waterfowl, helping \npreserve the land and the water and the ecosystem that goes far beyond \nwhat is simply spectacular to look at.\n  This is America's heritage. We struggle on an ongoing basis to \nrecover from the reckless, thoughtless exploitation of the last two \ncenturies. The vast majority of the American public supports this \neffort, even if they never visit the remote Western regions. Indeed, \nthe fact that they are often inaccessible is the only way that they are \npreserved. Imagine tour buses, motorized vehicles, hordes of tourists, \ntheir infrastructure and their litter, and the destructive effects that \nwould have.\n  The sideshow with the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge obscures a \nmuch larger and important public policy: protecting our heritage, \nenhancing it, and avoiding reckless behavior of a few that will \npenalize generations to come.\n  That is why the Harney Basin Wetlands Initiative of people in that \nregion, facilitated by the refuge between 2010 and 2013, was a textbook \nexample of collaboration, where all the stakeholders created a vision \nand a 20-year plan for the refuge and the surrounding landscape, \nincluding the biggest wetland restoration project ever undertaken.\n  It would be valuable for us to look behind the headlines to the facts \non the ground, the history of the resource, the struggle for \nprotection, the tremendous benefits for all Americans, and what the \nstakeholders in that region accomplished together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H106-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was proud to \nvote in favor of the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act, which repeals the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA. \nWith yesterday's passage of the bill, it marks the first time repeal of \nthe ACA has been sent to President Obama's desk.\n  In the past year, several significant problems with this law have \nbecome ever more clear. We have seen a large number of healthcare co-\nops go under. One major healthcare provider, UnitedHealthcare, \nannounced it is pulling out of the ACA exchange. This system is just \nnot sustainable.\n  Late last year, the Congressional Budget Office released a report \nstating that the ACA will lead to a reduction of work-hours equivalent \nto 2 million jobs over the next decade. The CBO attributes this \nreduction to healthcare subsidies tied to income, raising effective tax \nrates for Americans, and creating a disincentive for people seeking \npromotions or new, higher paying jobs. It also points to higher taxes \nand penalties as a reason for the reduction in work-hours.\n  In comparison, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act will reduce the Federal deficit by more than half a \ntrillion dollars over the next 10 years. It will also eliminate costly \nprovisions, such as the individual and employer health insurance \ncoverage mandates, the Cadillac tax on high-cost plans, and it will \nenhance the solvency of Medicare. It also ensures that Federal tax \ndollars will not go to providers of abortion.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the past several years, dozens of ACA reforms have \nbeen signed into law. However, we have only scratched the surface when \nit comes to addressing problems with this law. It is time to come \ntogether to support a comprehensive approach that ensures responsible \nuse of taxpayer dollars and fixes the issues affecting our Nation's \nhealthcare system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H106-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H106-H107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HAYMARKET CAFE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to share the story of \nthe Haymarket Cafe, started by brothers Peter and David Simpson, in \nNorthampton, Massachusetts.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the surest signs of a vibrant local economy is a \nlively restaurant scene. You know a town or a region is humming \neconomically when you have a wide variety of restaurants to choose \nfrom. It is a sign that people have enough money left over after paying \nall of their bills to spend on treating themselves and their families. \nIt is a strong indication that people feel secure in the direction of \nthe economy.\n  But for millions of low-wage workers across the country, the story is \nmore complicated than that, and the picture is not all that pretty. For \nall the economic vibrancy associated with restaurant culture--and \nthough restaurants employ almost 1 in 10 private\n\n[[Page H107]]\n\nsector workers--restaurant workers are among the worst paid, worst \ntreated within the economy as a whole.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  While non-restaurant private sector workers make a median hourly wage \nof $18, restaurant workers earn a median hourly wage of $10, including \ntips. The results are predictable in that more than 16 percent of \nrestaurant workers live below the poverty line.\n  This picture is made even worse by how it is skewed along race and \ngender lines. The highest paid positions in restaurants tend to be held \nby men and people who are White while the lowest paid positions are \ntypically held by women and people of color. At the bottom of the \nladder are undocumented workers, who comprise over 15 percent of the \nrestaurant workforce, more than twice the rate for non-restaurant \nsectors.\n  The good news is that it doesn't have to be this way. There are \nforward-thinking restaurant owners who are choosing the high road, \nrestaurants where conscious efforts are made to break down gender and \nethnic divisions and that choose to pay a living wage with good \nbenefits.\n  If you ask them, the owners of these establishments will tell you \nthat they choose this path because it is not only the right thing to \ndo, but it is also the smart thing to do financially. They choose this \npath because it is a solid business model that improves the chances of \nsuccess in a highly competitive industry.\n  I am proud to represent one of those restaurants in my district. The \nHaymarket Cafe in Northampton, Massachusetts, has led the way for \nalmost a quarter century in treating its employees with respect and in \npaying them a living wage.\n  I attended an event a couple of weeks ago at the Haymarket Cafe at \nwhich the owner, Peter Simpson, announced that his restaurant was \nmoving to a $15 per hour minimum wage and would be eliminating tips. \nNow, I have known Peter for a long time, and I was not surprised that \nhe would take such a step.\n  Peter opened the Haymarket with his brother, David, almost 25 years \nago. From the beginning, they were committed to paying a fair wage and \nin creating a positive work environment for their employees. In talking \nto Peter, I realized that his decision, while it reflected his \nidealism, was rooted in hard-nosed business sense.\n  You don't survive and thrive for a quarter century in the highly \ncompetitive restaurant industry, especially in a small, tight-knit \ncommunity like Northampton, if your business model isn't airtight. \nEvery decision you make has to make sense financially in order to \nsucceed and stay competitive.\n  The decision to go to a $15 per hour minimum wage and eliminate tips \nwas not something Peter took lightly. He did his homework. He looked at \nother restaurants in other cities that had made a similar move. He \ntalked to all of his employees. He worked closely with the Pioneer \nValley Workers Center, which is leading the charge to better the lives \nof low-wage immigrant workers in western Massachusetts.\n  Eliminating tips allowed Peter to make the wages between better paid \nwaiters and less well-paid kitchen staff more equitable. It allowed his \nwait staff to earn a wage they could count on, rather than having to \ndepend on the tipping whims of customers. It also gave him increased \nstaffing flexibility, as he could train all of his staff to do all jobs \nso he could more easily shift people around when necessary. In \ncommitting to a $15 per hour minimum wage, Peter also increased staff \nloyalty while decreasing turnover and training costs.\n  As a result of Peter's bold decision, the Haymarket Cafe has been \noverwhelmed by an outpouring of support. Staff and customers are \nequally enthusiastic, and business has jumped. This commitment to wage \nequity has shown, once again, to be a sound business strategy and has \nshown that a business based on such principles can provide a decent \nliving for its staff and can contribute to the economic health of the \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Haymarket Cafe is living proof, especially in an \nindustry with such a dismal track record on wages, that paying a living \nwage is good for business and that a commitment to wage equity makes \nfinancial sense. The restaurant industry can and must do better, and I \nam proud to say the Haymarket Cafe is leading the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H107-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTION ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SHARON ELLIOTT-BYNUM, A TRAILBLAZER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my condolences on the \npassing of a giant in the Durham, North Carolina, community, a \ntrailblazer, one who dedicated her life to improving health outcomes \nfor disadvantaged citizens, including veterans.\n  This trailblazer, Mr. Speaker, was my friend, Dr. Sharon Elliott-\nBynum. Sharon passed away on Sunday, January 3, at the young age of 58, \n2 days before her 59th birthday.\n  We lost this giant far too soon, but not before she revolutionized \nthe delivery of care for those in need through the founding of Durham's \nfirst free-standing, comprehensive healthcare clinic, called Healing \nwith CAARE.\n  My first visit as Durham's Congressman was an enlightening visit to \nCAARE. I saw Sharon at work, I saw paid staff, and I saw dozens of \ncommunity volunteers. We mourn this tremendous loss, but we also \ncelebrate Sharon's remarkable life, which was replete with the success \nthat many can only hope to achieve.\n  Born in Durham, Sharon Elliott-Bynum was a graduate of Northern High \nSchool, Durham Technical Institute, the Watts School of Nursing, and my \nalma mater, North Carolina Central University. She also received a \nmaster's degree and a Ph.D. from Victory International College.\n  Sharon was a dedicated member of a great sorority, Delta Sigma Theta \nSorority, Inc. As a member of the Durham Alumnae Chapter, founded in \n1931, she led by example. Sharon was also a member of the National \nCouncil of Negro Women, of Sigma Theta Tau International, of the Top \nLadies of Distinction, and of many more service organizations. Finally, \nshe was a faithful member of the Faith Assembly Christian Center in \nDurham.\n  Dr. Elliott-Bynum was attracted to the field of nursing when she, at \nthe age of 16, began volunteering at the historic Lincoln Community \nHealth Center. Sharon's volunteerism motivated her to pursue a nursing \ncareer. So, in 1995, Dr. Elliott-Bynum and her late sister, Patricia--\n``Pat'' she called her--founded Healing with CAARE, Inc.\n  What began as a nonprofit, community-based provider of services for \nindividuals who were living with HIV expanded to being the primary \nhealthcare home for more than 1,000 individuals who live with cancer, \ncardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. CAARE\n\n[[Page H108]]\n\nalso provides free dental care, substance abuse counseling, a food \npantry, and free housing for homeless veterans.\n  Her remarkable work has been honored over the years through many \nawards and recognitions. They include The Order of the Long Leaf Pine, \nwhich is the highest civilian honor presented by the Governor; the \nCongressional Black Caucus Foundation's Veterans Braintrust Award; the \nNCCU Distinguished Alumni Award; and the Durham Chamber of Commerce \nWomen's Leadership Award.\n  Dr. Elliott-Bynum's lifetime of tireless work and service to \nthousands of disadvantaged individuals had an immeasurable impact on \nthe Durham community, a grateful community that joins me today in \ncelebrating this life.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our recognition to Dr. \nSharon Elliott-Bynum's two children, Ebony Elliott-Covington and Damien \nElliott-Bynum; to her beloved brother, Joe Elliott, Jr.; to her \nsisters, Carolyn Hinton and Addie Mann; to her grandson, Ahmad; to the \nentire CAARE family; and to all of those who have been impacted by her \nextraordinary work. Some of her family members are with us today.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, on tomorrow, I will say just a few words at \nthe Celebration of Life service in Durham by making a very plain, but \nprofound, point. It goes like this: Durham, North Carolina, is a better \nplace to live and work because of the unselfish service of Dr. Sharon \nElliott-Bynum.\n  May she rest in peace, a life well lived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H108-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF LAWRENCE AGEE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sadness to commemorate the life \nof Mr. Lawrence Agee, a man I call a friend.\n  He was a long-time resident of McArthur, California, in eastern \nShasta County. Born in 1937, he operated an institution in the area for \n55 years, known as the Highway Garage, which was the smallest, I think, \nChevrolet dealership, maybe, in the West, and it was the only one for \nabout an 80-mile radius for a lot of years until the reorganization of \nGeneral Motors happened and they took the franchise away.\n  On that lot, he might have in his inventory seven, eight, nine new \ncars--pickups, mostly, for the farmers and ranchers in the area. It was \nreally an institution to the people of the area. When that dealership \nwas pulled, they continued on, he and his family, in providing service \nand towing and all of the things that you would need in that area.\n  I got to know Lawrence when I was a new candidate in 2002, striking \nout from where I lived--about 2\\1/2\\ hours away--to go out and meet \npeople in the vast northern California district I have represented over \nthe years. I stopped in one day on Highway 299, in eastern Redding, \nright in McArthur there, and said hi to this tall, lanky fellow here, \nwho just felt like the heart of America right there. I struck up a \nconversation and had a great old time.\n  For many, many years, he did operate a Chevrolet dealership, but I \ndrove up in my Ford. So that started a little banter going back and \nforth, especially if you are a partisan NASCAR fan or an automobile \nbrand fan, which kind of tends to go with that there.\n  One of the lines I remember him teasing me about was, ``Well, you \nknow, it is a nice car there, but here we sell the best and service the \nrest.'' I guess he probably figured he was going to have to service my \ncar a lot if I were in the neighborhood. Yet, the teasing and the \nbanter was just one of the great parts of our friendship and \nrelationship.\n  Soon after that, every time I would have a chance, I would go through \nthere, whether it was going up to the Inter-Mountain Fair for a day or \ntwo right there in town. He was a big part of that institution as well \nand would hang out with the people there.\n  There is a parade at that fair each year. After I got to know him and \nEleanor and his family a little bit, he even let me use his convertible \nto drive in the parade there. It was a neat, old Chevy SSR.\n  I think that was his subtle way to get me into a Chevrolet at least \nonce a year. The funny thing is that he didn't drive it that much; so, \npeople around there would only see it once a year. And they got to \nthinking it was my car or something; so, it was a funny deal.\n  That just shows his generosity and his trust. I know he was well \nloved in the whole community because, during fair time, he was a big, \nbig supporter and sponsor of the fair. But I don't know if he got to go \nto it very often because he was always helping people with lock-outs \nand dead batteries or was making a tow run nearby or whatever. He was \njust helping keep that town together.\n  For many of us who are in and around Shasta County there, I know he \nwill be greatly missed. His wife, Eleanor, is a gem as well. My heart \ngoes out to her and to the whole family there because there is really a \nlot happening around Highway Garage in McArthur.\n  Again, at fair time, you would see a lot of destruction derby cars \nlined up at that place. His son, David, was always working on those, as \nwere other family members. I think that is the place if you need a \ndestruction derby car. Go see them, and they might be able to give you \nthe best technology on that as well.\n  In his service, he was nationally recognized as one of the best \nserving dealers in that dealership they had, up until 2009, when he \nmoved on to service only and was no longer selling cars.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  You could see it on the awards in the shop building. This big wooden \nbuilding there just takes you right back to Americana from 80 years \nago. I think the dealership was established in 1924. His family took \nover in 1949. With the passing of his father in 1959, Lawrence took \nover as the youngest dealer, again, in the West of a Chevrolet \ndealership.\n  He was a volunteer with the McArthur Fire Department. He was a \nlongtime leader of the Cloverleaf 4-H for over two decades. He was a \nmember of the Fort Crook Masonic Lodge, citizen of the year at least \ntwice, blue ribbon winner, and a longtime supporter of the Inter-\nMountain Fair in many capacities. Of course, he leaves behind a legacy \nof what small-town America really is about.\n  The impact he had on his community was felt not only there, but far, \nfar away. For those people that were helped by him in the middle of the \nnight--there maybe would be a rock in the road or something like that \nand if somebody would run over that, he would go out and bail them out. \nIndeed, one of the times when I was up for the fair and leaving town, \nthere he was, coming up the grade in his big, yellow tow truck. That is \nLawrence right there.\n  A rewarding part of this job is getting to know people like him, and \nyou hate it when you have to lose people like that, that are pillars in \nthe community. Doggone it, he leaves a great legacy, and I am proud to \nhave known him.\n  God bless his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H108-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H108-H109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ANNIVERSARY AND EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, Friday marks the 14th \nanniversary of the enactment of the No Child Left Behind legislation \nwhich, when we passed it, held so many dreams and so many aspirations \nfor all of us because we believed that our children would get a world-\nclass education out of that. Unfortunately, No Child Left Behind, with \nall its potential, fell short.\n  So I think it is important that we all understand and we all believe \nin this Chamber that through education, we lift this Nation. It is \nprobably the greatest investment that we can make in the American \npeople. That is why, as lawmakers, we have to really work on the best \npolicies for education, starting at the national level, because we now \ncompete internationally, and, of course, at the State and at our local \nlevels right at our school boards.\n  I have been to every single school in my district in Orange County. I \nhave\n\n[[Page H109]]\n\nmet with teachers, with parents, with administrators, and with business \nleaders. They all had concerns with No Child Left Behind. That is why I \nthink the recent passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, a \nlandmark piece of bipartisan legislation, hopefully will fix the \noutdated policies of that No Child Left Behind legislation.\n  The new legislation, the new law we just passed, takes into \nconsideration the collective criticisms of the teachers, the students, \nparents, administrators, business leaders, and everyone who is involved \nin the education of our children. The ESSA has the support of many \ncivil rights groups, teaching groups, and community institutions.\n  I would like to highlight a few of the improvements our parents and \nstudents can look forward to with this new law.\n  During the No Child Left Behind era, schools were not held \naccountable for ensuring that the most disadvantaged students actually \nwere aided and helped to get an education. The Every Student Succeeds \nAct changes this. It benefits low-income students, minority students, \nEnglish language learners by requiring the schools to include student \ndata about these groups so that we can make better policy for the \naccountability of how these students learn.\n  States are also required to create exit and entrance exams for \nEnglish language learners, ensuring that they will actually receive \nattention in these classrooms and will learn.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I know that we all think that there are way too \nmany tests in life every single day, and of course it is not the \nfavorite part of the school day to take a test. The high-stakes testing \nthat was under No Child Left Behind has created a lot of anxiety \ncampuswide. Teachers felt the need to teach to the test, rather than \nactually teach the student that critical learning that must take place \nin the classroom at an early age.\n  My mom was a teacher. She finally got out because she got tired of \nteaching to the test, test, test, test. She had seven kids, and they \nall have master's and Ph.D.s. She was a parent teacher before she went \nto teach in the classroom, and she knew that students learn in \ndifferent ways, that not everybody learned the same way.\n  She would work with students. Some students learn verbally, some by \ntest-taking, others by acting out plays that get across the idea. There \nwas no time in the classroom after No Child Left Behind. It was just \none way: the test, the test, the test.\n  I am proud to say that high-stakes testing under the new law will no \nlonger disadvantage our schools who don't pass those tests. There are \ngoing to be other ways, including tests, to decide whether schools, \nteachers, and educators are doing well by our children in the \nclassroom. Testing students will not be the end-all of what is \nhappening in the classrooms.\n  Schools also have the flexibility to pilot innovative testing \nmeasures, allowing more time for learning in the classroom.\n  I am excited about this new law, Mr. Speaker, and I hope that we \ncontinue to look at it and make sure that every child has a chance in \nthis education system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H109-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H109-H110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REPEAL OBAMACARE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Roskam) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, an interesting thing happened when President \nObama was elected in 2008: We basically had a national consensus about \nsome elements of health care. What I mean by that is, most people \nrecognized two things about our healthcare system that were flawed. \nFirst, they recognized that it was too expensive; and, second, they \nrecognized that people with a preexisting condition should be included \nand not be excluded from an insurance pool. There was a great deal of \nconsensus around that, and that is where the opportunity was for the \nObama team to bring the country together around those two core things.\n  Instead, they did something different. Instead, they went out on a \nhighly partisan path, and that was to create ObamaCare. We were told \nthat the bill had to be passed in order to understand what was in it, \nand so forth and so on. We are familiar with the false premises and the \nfalse claims and the false narratives about it.\n  Do you remember this? We were told that if you liked your doctor, you \ngot to keep your doctor. If you liked your insurance coverage, you got \nto keep your insurance coverage. Your insurance policies, the premiums \nper family were going to drop by over $2,000 a year. None of that \nturned out to be true. None of it. People lost their coverage. People \nlost their physicians. Their premiums have gone up.\n  So now what has happened, there has been this effort, and the effort \nover the past several years has been met by some mockery from some who \nhave said: Hey, your efforts to repeal ObamaCare, how many times are \nyou going to do it? Do you know how many times we are going to do it? \nWe are going to do it until it gets done. Now it is closer than ever.\n  I have three constituents that I want to briefly mention to you. One \nis a fellow that I connected with on the phone last night. His name is \nJay. Jay told me that, notwithstanding the false promises of ObamaCare, \nhis insurance premiums for him and his daughter have skyrocketed to the \npoint where the amount of anxiety that he was communicating to me on \nthe phone was palpable. This is not somebody who is just upset about \nthe direction that the country has gone under this false claim of \nObamaCare. He is fearful of it, and he is anxious for his future and \nthe future of his daughter.\n  How about Diane? My other constituent is a 9-year breast cancer \nsurvivor who was told, if you like your doctor, you get to keep your \ndoctor, until all of a sudden, her insurance policy, after ObamaCare, \nkicks her physician out of the group, and she doesn't have access to \nthe doctor that had cared for her and kept her cancer-free for 9 years.\n  How about the small-business owner who I met with on Monday in Kane \nCounty, Illinois, who said: Congressman, we would really like to expand \nour business; we want to open up a new location. It was a restaurant. \nIf we do it--and we have done the math--it is going to cost us $150,000 \na year in ObamaCare payments, and we can't afford to expand.\n  Here is what we have got to do: We have got to repeal this thing, and \nwe have got to replace it and get back to those two core themes that \nsay, let's deal with the underlying cost drivers in health care that \nmake it more expensive than people can afford--and we can do that--and \nlet's deal with the preexisting condition question. We can do that \nthrough high-risk pools and other things that don't cost the trillions \nof ObamaCare.\n  Now, there is an interesting thing that has been happening, and that \nis this: The story of ObamaCare is shifting. You ask, well, how is it \nshifting? It is shifting in this way: It is shifting because we have \nbeen told that there is no way to undo this. There is no way. It is \nbasically orthodoxy in our country. It is an entitlement, which it is, \nand it is so deeply embedded that it is all a fait accompli. In other \nwords, there is no way to undo this.\n  For a long time, that appeared to be--although it wasn't true, it \nappeared to be true because the Senate blocked its passage. Now, as we \nknow, the other body has actually preceded us in this and, through the \nreconciliation activity, we are now able to avoid the 60-vote \nthreshold. A simple majority of United States Senators can join with a \nmajority of the United States House of Representatives, which I would \nargue is reflecting a majority of the American public, to say: Get this \nthing off our backs. Let us flourish. Yeah, we can deal with these \nthings. Yes, health care needs improving, but this thing on our backs \nis simply smothering us.\n  So here is the opportunity. This will be on President Obama's desk. \nWill he veto it? Absolutely. It is the first time it has ever gotten on \nhis desk before. What it says is this: that there is only one office \nbetween us and the repeal of ObamaCare. One office is between us and \nthe repeal of ObamaCare, and that office changes next November. So in \n11 months, there is every opportunity for us to see its repeal and, \nultimately, its replacement.\n\n[[Page H110]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H110-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   REDONDO UNION HIGH SCHOOL PROTEST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Hahn) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, this upcoming Monday, the Westboro Baptist \nChurch plans to hold protests outside of Redondo Union High School in \nRedondo Beach, California. We have seen these protests before, often at \nthe funerals of our fallen servicemen and -women. They are known, \nunfortunately, for their hateful message, especially against LGBT \nAmericans.\n  The members of this church believe that America's generation of high \nschoolers is ``utterly without hope.'' They say that because these \nyoung students are promoting acceptance and inclusion of all people, \nregardless of whether they are gay or straight.\n  I couldn't disagree more with their premise of calling these students \n``without hope.'' I think because these students are promoting \nacceptance and inclusion of all people, regardless of whether they are \ngay or straight, they are building a future full of hope. I have the \nutmost faith in the next generation as the future leaders of this \nNation.\n  Of course, no matter how much I disagree with this group, these \nindividuals should be allowed to exercise their right to protest, and \nthey do have a right to free speech in this country. The students have \nthose same rights, and an inspiring group of Redondo High students are \norganizing a peaceful counterprotest on Monday.\n  Yesterday, I wrote a letter to the members of the school's Gay-\nStraight Alliance and told them that I wished I could be there on \nMonday to protest alongside of them. These students deserve to live in \na world where they can be who they are and love whom they choose. In \nstanding up against hate and living a life of acceptance, inclusion, \nand understanding, they are making that world a reality.\n  I know my colleague here, Ted Lieu, who represents Redondo Beach, \njoins me in saying that we are so proud of these students. We are proud \nof their courage, their bravery, their intelligence, and skill in \nstanding up for what they know is right, just, and for being brave \nenough to organize a counterprotest.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  I am going to be in Washington, D.C., on Monday. But if I were not \nhere, I would want to be standing alongside each and every student to \nshow my solidarity with them. Instead, let me tell them that I will be \nthere in spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H110-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATIONS TO MIAMI-DADE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Miami-\nDade County Public Schools, where the graduation rate recently reached \nan all-time high of 78.1 percent for the 2014-2015 academic year, \nsurpassing the State average of 77.8 percent.\n  This is a 1.5 percent growth from last year's rate, marking the \nhighest graduation rate MDCPS has achieved since the Florida Department \nof Education began implementing new standards to track graduation \nfigures in the late 1990s. This is a landmark accomplishment, \nconsidering the major challenges Miami schools face, including high \npoverty rates and a large population of English language learners.\n  As a former member of the Miami-Dade County School Board, I salute \nthe students, teachers, faculty, and parents for their dedication and \nfor their commitment to excellence. I also want to recognize School \nBoard Chair Perla Tabares-Hantman, my other former colleagues, and \nSuperintendent Alberto Carvalho for their exceptional leadership. I \nthink of them frequently, and I am constantly reminded of how fortunate \nour community is to have them.\n  To the entire MDCPS family, congratulations. You are a model for the \nNation. I am proud to represent you.\n\n\n             Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2015\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on October 24, 2015, Monroe \nCounty Sheriff's Deputy Josh Gordon found himself in a firefight with a \nrobbery suspect on Stock Island in the Florida Keys. Amidst the \nexchange of gunfire, Deputy Gordon's bulletproof vest stopped a round \nof ammunition, ultimately saving his life. If a bullet would have \nstrayed a few inches one way or another, the outcome could have been \nentirely different.\n  Every day, men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the \nline to ensure our safety. Incidents such as this shed light on the \nsignificance of effective body armor for those who protect us. Officers \nlike Deputy Gordon are never off duty, and we must, in turn, do \neverything in our power to protect them.\n  To address this, I stand in strong support of H.R. 228, the \nBulletproof Vest Grant Act of 2015, which extends the grant program for \narmored vests through fiscal year 2018. I strongly encourage Congress \nto pass this essential legislation and protect the backbone of our \nNation's domestic defense.\n\n\n             Miami International Airport Passenger Records\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miami \nInternational Airport and their record-breaking year in 2015. Forty-\nfour million passengers passed through this world-renowned airport last \nyear, shattering the previous annual record of 40.9 million passengers \nin 2014.\n  MIA has some of the most dedicated employees in the country who \nensure passengers have a pleasant experience on their journey, whether \nvisiting relatives, conducting business, or visiting the abundance of \nattractions south Florida has to offer. Tens of thousands of passengers \npass through MIA on a daily basis, and I am proud to recognize an \nairport that connects so many people throughout the world.\n  I offer my continued support to my friend, MIA Director Emilio \nGonzalez, as his team works in the new year to attract more domestic \nand international routes, and I know cafecitos will continue to be \navailable at each terminal so all visiting guests can enjoy the \nwonderful culture of south Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H110-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H110-H111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VIOLENCE AGAINST SIKHS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support and stand with the \nSikh community in the San Joaquin Valley.\n  In the past 2 weeks, two Sikh men have been brutally attacked and, \nvery sadly, one of them was killed. He lost his life. The Fresno City \nPolice Department has labeled these two crimes as potential hate \ncrimes.\n  Amrik Singh Bal was attacked in the middle of the street while \nwaiting for a ride so he could go to work, as any average American \nwould do throughout our country. Gurcharan Singh Gill was killed while \nworking at a local convenience store. Both tragic incidents took place \nin my district. My thoughts and prayers are with Amrik and his family, \nand my deepest sympathy and condolences go to the Gurcharan family for \nthe loss.\n  The attacks on these innocent American citizens are really an attack \non all American citizens who choose to practice their religion and \nobserve their cultural heritage, as Americans do throughout our land.\n  Sadly, since September 11, 2001, the Sikh community has endured \ndiscrimination because of a lack of understanding of Sikhism, which is \nbased on equality and love. They are not alone.\n  As a nation of immigrants, we must remember, we have an opportunity \nto learn and benefit from the thousands of different cultures that are \npart of the mosaic of what makes America great. After all, we are a \nnation of immigrants, both past and present, and we must never ever \nforget that.\n  Today, in Fresno, in spirit, we are all part of the Sikh community as \nwe mourn these tragic incidents. Every American citizen, regardless of \nrace, creed, or gender has the right to live free of fear and \ndiscrimination.\n  I commend Chief Dyer and the Fresno City Police Department for \nworking diligently to find the individual or individuals who killed \nGurcharan and for continuing to look for the other individuals who are \nresponsible for the attack on Amrik.\n  I continue to urge the FBI and the U.S. Attorney General's office to \nwork, as they have been, in making this investigation inquiry resolve \nitself, solving these very sad crimes that we\n\n[[Page H111]]\n\nthink were based on hate and is truly an unfair and discriminatory \nsituation that occurred in the last 2 weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H111-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CENSURING PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Palazzo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, time and time again, the President has \nviolated the boundaries of executive power. He has refused to enforce \nour immigration laws. He has opened the borders to Syrian migrants \nagainst the will of the American people. He has even changed the \nprovisions of his own disastrous healthcare bill.\n  This week, the administration once again thumbed its nose at Congress \nand the American people by jeopardizing the gun rights of law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up. The American people \ncontinue to see the executive branch not only deciding which laws they \nchoose to enforce, but changing and interpreting the laws as they see \nfit. The White House has become judge, jury, and executioner, in clear \nviolation of the principles on which this Nation was founded.\n  Today I am introducing a resolution to censure President Barack Obama \nto serve as a clear rebuke and condemnation of the unconstitutional \nactions of this President. This is a bold measure, but is one that is \nnecessary to preserve the very institution that we are all honored to \nserve: the United States Congress.\n  The Constitution requires that the President shall take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed. This President has failed to do so on \nnumerous occasions.\n  The Constitution also requires the President to preserve, protect, \nand defend the Constitution of the United States. The President has \nfailed to do so.\n  Not only is the President trying to do our job, but he has failed to \ndo his.\n  His announced actions on gun control are just the latest example of \nblatant executive overreach by the President. Congress must fight back. \nI want to make it very clear. This is not about President Obama. This \nis about the actions of a President who has encroached too far on the \npowers of Congress.\n  Under the Constitution, Congress is an equal branch of government and \nshould be treated as such. We cannot roll over on every executive \noverreach. We cannot wait to fight next time.\n  We cannot wait for the next President because it is not about this \nPresident or the next President. It is not about politics. It is about \npreserving the power of the legislative branch against this President \nand any future President who seeks to use egregious executive action at \nthe expense of Congress.\n  A resolution of censure of the President has been used rarely, but is \nnot without precedent. It is a way for Congress to fight back against \nexecutive overreach. Censuring the President will preserve for the \nhistorical and legal record that this Congress at this time disapproves \nof this President's executive overreach. It is time Congress fights \nback as an institution.\n  I urge my colleagues to live up to their oath of office, both \nRepublican and Democrat, to support this resolution to censure the \nPresident and put the executive branch on notice that violating the \nseparation of powers and using unconstitutional executive overreach \nwill not be tolerated by Members of the United States Congress now or \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H111-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H111-H112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST OIL AND GAS LEASES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Tipton) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an ongoing \nenvironmental review process within my district that I firmly believe \nrepresents yet another in a long line of abuses of private property \nrights by the Federal Government and, more specifically, the land \nmanagement agencies that oversee the majority of the land in the United \nStates.\n  The outcome of this process will likely set a disturbing precedent \nunder which the integrity of contracts that the Federal Government \nenters into with private parties is undermined.\n  The Bureau of Land Management is currently reviewing 65 existing oil \nand gas leases issued in White River National Forest beginning in 1993. \nThis retroactive review was prompted by a 2007 decision on three of the \nleases by the Interior Board of Land Appeals in which the BLM was found \nto have not formally adopted a Forest Service environmental policy \nanalysis that was utilized to make these leasing decisions--basically, \nwhat amounts to an administrative oversight.\n  It should be emphasized that there are extensive environmental \nreviews that did, in fact, take place and that the BLM played a \nsignificant role in that process. The agency argued as much to the \nBoard of Land Appeals during the review.\n  The fault was simply that the BLM needed to sign on the dotted line, \nand the Board expressly made this option available to remedy the \nproblem. However, instead of adopting that commonsense approach, the \nBLM succumbed to political pressure from the environmental extremists \nand determined to revisit every one of the leases issued since 1993.\n  The new proposal from the BLM deals with leases in one of two ways. \nIt either imposes new, significantly restrictive stipulations that were \nnot in place at the time of the original leases when they were acquired \nor it outright revokes the leases.\n  The Federal Government is acting as nothing more than a highway \nrobber in this case and in many others, robbing citizens and businesses \nof property that they have bought and paid for, telling us that we \nshould simply be grateful that there is someone looking out for our \ngreater interests.\n  I highlight this particular process because, should the BLM follow \nthrough with certain of its proposed actions, it will set a precedent \nnot only for oil and gas development, but for any lessee or permittee \nwho, in entering into a contract in good faith with a Federal agency, \nmay see their lease or permit threatened with retroactive revocation or \nseverely restricted based on any flimsy pretext.\n  Many important industries rely on Federal leases and permits, \nincluding livestock grazing, recreation, and renewable energy; and no \nbusiness can successfully operate if its license to do so no longer \nenjoys protections against arbitrary cancelations or changes, depending \non the ideology of the current occupant of the White House.\n  Numerous stakeholders and local governments recognize that the BLM's \nfinal decision would have impacts far beyond those of the specific \nleases in question and undertook efforts to draft detailed and \nsubstantive feedback to the agency.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  This is a very laborious and time-consuming process. Yet the BLM \nprovided only the bare minimum public comment during this period \nrequired by law, and the agency's scheduled comment period overlapped \nwith Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Year's Day holidays.\n  It also overlaps another environmental review comment period for the \nwell-known Roan Plateau, which involves many of the same stakeholders \nand local governments and has been under review in some form since the \nlate 1990s.\n  As such, several stakeholders and local governments, with the support \nof several members of Colorado's congressional delegation, requested a \nmodest extension of the comment period. These extension requests are \nroutinely granted by Federal agencies in recognition of the technical \nnature of these issues: interruptions due to Federal holidays and when \nthere are several similar issues under simultaneous review.\n  Despite this, the requests in this instance were dismissed out of \nhand. One can only conclude that the BLM is afraid of the scrutiny that \ncould result from them effectuating a government taking of property \nrights under the guise of rectifying an administrative error from over \n20 years ago.\n  It is abundantly clear that the BLM intends to ramrod through a \ndecision that will trample on lease owners' rights by canceling or \naltering leases to the point as to make them economically unviable. \nThis is, unfortunately,\n\n[[Page H112]]\n\nin line with a disturbing trend of Federal agency abuses of private \nproperty rights, whether it is the Forest Service's repeated attempts \nto leverage special use permits to forcibly acquire private water \nrights, or the EPA's determination to classify every ditch and puddle \nas a ``water of the United States'' to further insert itself into the \neveryday lives of ordinary, hardworking Americans.\n  Property rights and the integrity of contracts are at the very \nfoundation of our economic system, yet too often Federal agencies \ncasually cast these important considerations aside.\n  If the BLM is confident that it is making the right decision and is \nwilling to defend it, then they should have no problem providing \nadditional time for the public and other interested stakeholders to be \nable to comment on the proposed actions in the White River National \nForest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H112-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DO NOT LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call on this \nadministration to keep intact all existing sanctions on the world's \nleading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran. Sanctions must remain, and \ncloser scrutiny and more accountability by this administration on \nIran's continuing illicit activity must occur. It is imperative for \npeace, security, and stability in the Middle East and across the globe \nthat we do this.\n  Iran's conduct over the past few months and the lack of clear and \nexact leadership by this administration in response is cause for \nserious alarm. Iran has not changed its tone and conduct since the \nsigning of the deal. In fact, they have doubled down on their \nunwillingness not to comply with international agreements, and they \nhave created more danger and instability in the process.\n  Here is the central point why I am speaking on the House floor here \ntoday: Once we lift sanctions, we have even less leverage.\n  So let's look at how Iran has honored their commitments in the past \nfew months and ask ourselves: Do we anticipate Iran will conduct itself \nin the months and years to come better or worse?\n  On October 10, Iran carried out a precision-guided ballistic missile \ntest. This violates U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and 2231. Now \nthat Iran is prohibited from such testing under the deal, what do they \ndo? They send weapons to Bashar al-Assad on Russian cargo planes. This \nviolates U.N. Resolution 1747. They did that in October.\n  On November 21, they carried out a medium-range ballistic missile \ntest with capabilities to carry a nuclear warhead. They can't do that \neither.\n  Last month, they fired several unguided rockets 1,500 yards from two \nU.S. vessels.\n  Just a few days ago, they unveiled a new underground missile depot \nshowing precision-guided missiles that have the capability to hold a \nnuclear warhead.\n  What has been the response of this administration? They notify us \nthey will respond with sanctions against Iranian individuals and \nbusinesses linked to Iran's ballistic missile program.\n  What happened since they notified us of that? Nothing. They have \nwalked it back.\n  Here is my fear, Mr. Speaker. We are forecasting to Iran that they \nhave carte blanche to do as they wish. And once we lift the sanctions, \nwe can expect more of that. Iran is not honoring its commitments, so \nnor should we.\n  We know the State Department classifies the deal not as a treaty, not \nas an executive agreement. It is not even a signed document. It is \nmerely a political commitment. And it is clear Iran is not acting in \ngood faith to our political commitment.\n  I signed correspondence to the administration requesting that the \nPresident ``immediately void the deal and restore and/or continue all \nrelevant sanctions on Iran that have been or will be relaxed under the \nJCPOA.''\n  Let's not concern ourselves if Iran voices outrage or condemnation \nthat we voided a political commitment on the basis that they feel they \nhave somehow honored the deal because, number one, they violated U.N. \nresolutions since the deal was signed, the Iranian Parliament refuses \nto ratify the deal, and the Ayatollah forbids further negotiations with \nthe U.S.\n  The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that Iran's U.N. violations clearly \nviolate the spirit of our political commitment to them. Their conduct \nthreatens our national security, it threatens the security of our \nallies, and it further erodes an already precarious and unstable \nenvironment in the Middle East.\n  Iran isn't honoring its commitments, so nor should we. Let's keep the \nsanctions in place. Do not lift them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H112-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H112-H113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTION ON GUNS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I want to start my time by quoting \ndirectly the Second Amendment of our Constitution: ``A well regulated \nmilitia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of \nthe people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''\n  Aren't those beautiful and resounding words? As a man who likes to \nkeep it simple, I appreciate the Founding Fathers not only for their \nforesight to protect the right to bear arms, but also how plain and \nsimple they made it.\n  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed \nupon. Unfortunately, I think our Founding Fathers spoke too plainly for \ncertain people and certain Presidents to understand. That President may \nalways remind us that he taught constitutional law. Sadly, I have yet \nto encounter someone in that position who disregards the Constitution \nso regularly.\n  Not only does that President trample on the Second Amendment, but he \nwould also trample on Article I, which, as you know, is the Congress \nand going through them to make laws. That President should have known \nthat regulations regarding buying guns must come from legislation, not \nby an oral decree.\n  That President tried to legislate in the Senate several times, but \nhis colleagues refused to do it, even though there was a majority. Now \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not in the \nmajority in Congress, I am assuming that this administration is \ndeciding to create their own regulations--the Constitution be damned--\nbecause, sadly, there are no checks and balances anymore.\n  We know even if Congress passes a bill to repeal any type of order \nthat any President makes, it would still have to go to that individual \nfor the bill to be signed. So what are the chances of putting together \na bill that some Congress may have seen as an inappropriate action and \nthen send it to the person that created that inappropriate action and \nexpect him to sign it?\n  I think, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that has so disappointed the \nAmerican people is the inability to have their Representatives voice \ntheir complaints and do their legislative responsibility with an out-\nof-control government. So each week, as the administration or a group \nis intent on disregarding the Constitution, people become numb. The \nAmerican people become numb to these illegal actions.\n  I think it is time that we brought attention to some of these illegal \nactions that some Presidents in the past and some Presidents in the \nfuture may create. I think it is time that we bring these actions to \nthe attention of the American people and let them know what our \nFounding Fathers had the intention to do originally, what they intended \nthe Constitution to mean, and how it was interpreted by those very \nfirst legislators: President Washington, the Supreme Court, and others.\n  They took this document as a simple document. It was very plainly \nwritten and read. But, unfortunately, we have had Supreme Courts, \nPresidents, and legislative bodies that have tried to take these \nsimple, basic words and turn them into something that they could use \nfor their benefit, to try to change the way that this world works and \nhow the laws they make are applied to our citizens.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we are going to try to do as much as we can in the \nnear future to try to bring this to the attention of the American \npeople and the world, because I think our Constitution\n\n[[Page H113]]\n\nhas been a great cornerstone for this world and for any country that \nwants to have a republic, a democracy, and a people-driven form of \ngovernment and to really feel that coat of liberty wrapped around them. \nI think our Constitution is that.\n  So I think it is time for us not only to make the citizens aware, but \nto make this whole world aware of what has been going on and what we \nare going to do to stop it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H113-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last week The Wall Street \nJournal reported that the National Security Agency, the NSA, is \nactively spying on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of \nour Nation's closest allies. This revelation comes just 2 years after \nthe President's announcement that the United States would cease spying \non our allies.\n  The Journal wrote: ``Officials said Obama insisted that keeping tabs \non Netanyahu served a `compelling national security purpose.' ''\n  Specifically, the President sought to learn about President \nNetanyahu's opposition to the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal. In so \ndoing, the NSA also intercepted personal, direct communication between \nMembers of Congress, the Prime Minister, and his staff.\n  An editorial by The Post and Courier--republished in The Hill this \nweek--raised important questions about the legality of the NSA's \nsharing private conversations with the White House and not discarding \nor getting judicial permission. Regrettably, this is another example of \nthe President's disregard for our Constitution by spying on Congress, \ncorrupting the NSA.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  Our sympathy to the family of Staff Sergeant Matthew McClintock, an \nAmerican hero.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost).

It is a problem. It has led to overcrowded jails, it has led \nto people who are in severe mental crisis ending up in emergency rooms, \nit has led to people not getting the treatment that they need, and it \nhas led to there being desperate families.\n  Folks in our region have decided to do something about it. Together \nwith the two largest healthcare providers, our community has formed the \nSouth Sound Behavioral Health Coalition, which is comprised of \nhealthcare experts, social service providers, local elected officials, \nlaw enforcement, business, labor, and faith leaders.

He served 2 years in the \nUnited States Navy during World War II, and he graduated with a degree \nin mechanical engineering from MIT and Yale in 1950.\n  From 1972 to 1994, he was chairman of the board and the CEO of \nSavannah Foods and Industries, which was the maker of Dixie Crystals \nsugar. Under his leadership, Savannah Foods grew from a small regional \nsugar refinery to a major national sugar company and a Fortune 500 \nmember. In fact, from 1980 to 1990, Savannah Foods was number two in \ntotal returns to shareholders with a total return of 4,862 percent.\n  Over the years, he also served as the director of several national \nand international associations. In 1999, he was inducted into the \nGeorgia Southern University's Business Hall of Fame.\n  He was very involved in the Savannah community, serving as director, \ntrustee, or president for numerous community organizations, and he also \nworked to improve the lives of people in the community in which he \nlived.\n  His passion for life, his sense of humor, and his enthusiasm for \nmaking Savannah, Georgia, a better place will truly be missed.

Mr. Speaker, the administration blames the violence \nin America on gun dealers and Congress. So the administration is going \nto issue some more executive memos and unilaterally ignore the Second \nAmendment.\n  Never mind that the administration's illegal action would not have \nprevented any of the tragic mass shootings in recent years. The \nadministration should be prosecuting criminals who use guns, not \nvetoing the Second Amendment.\n  The administration's executive action on gun control is just the \nlatest example of the White House attempting to bypass the Constitution \nand the legislative branch to implement a political agenda.\n  The Constitution does not have a Burger King provision for the \nexecutive branch. The President cannot have it his way. Laws are \nwritten by Congress. The executive is to enforce the law, and the \nformer constitutional professor should know better than to dictate new \nlaw, regardless of whether he thinks it is a good idea or not.\n  The administration's edict granting of executive amnesty has already \nbeen ruled unconstitutional by lower courts, but it seems that the \nadministration won't let the Constitution get in the way of political \nexpediency.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H115-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LEGISLATION\n\n  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. CAPPS.

These actions are an important \nstep forward, but they are also a recognition that Congress has shirked \nits responsibility to take action to protect all Americans from this \nepidemic.\n  If we are ever going to fulfill our pledge ``not one more,'' we must \ntake bold action.\n  I speak today to urge my colleagues to join us. It is far past time \nto act with urgency, put partisanship aside, do what is necessary to \nkeep our neighborhoods safe.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday we made history. For \nthe first time, Congress put a bill on a President's desk to defund \nPlanned Parenthood, an organization that puts its financial interests \nahead of women and children.

That day, many of us, from both sides of \nthe aisle, mourned the six Americans whose lives were taken by a \nderanged gunman in Tucson, Arizona.\n  Since then, it has become eerily commonplace for a Member to lead a \nmoment of silence to honor their murdered constituents: a colleague of \nours whose life changed forever, twenty 6-year-old children, a Federal \njudge, worshippers in church.\n  How does Republican fervor over the right to own a gun trump the \nright not to be murdered by someone who shouldn't have a gun?\n  President Obama's executive actions are a critical step to reducing \nthis national epidemic. They are well within his legal authority and \nwill help keep guns out of dangerous hands. They are so critical \nbecause of Republican inaction on closing loopholes, which a majority \nof Americans support, and their failure to rise above the NRA's \nfearmongering.\n  Democrats will continue to bring meaningful, commonsense solutions to \nthis floor so we can keep our Nation safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H116-6", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H116-H117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO JESSICA SLAVIK\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota.

She passed away on \nJanuary 2, 2016, but she leaves behind an extraordinary legacy.\n  Cris is an inspiration. She graduated from Coachella Valley High \nSchool and knew the importance of being disciplined, never missing a \nsingle day of work at J. C. Penney for over 40 years. After retiring, \nshe returned to work in the food industry for another 13 years.\n  She still had the energy and passion to volunteer countless hours for \nover 30 years with nonprofit organizations like the Coachella church, \nlibrary, Center for Employment Training, senior volunteer programs, \nsenior centers, chambers of commerce, and the list goes on and on.\n  She was a photojournalist for her own column, ``The Adventures of \nCris.''

Mr. Speaker, after 5 years, the promises of ObamaCare \nthat it would save families $2500 or so per year, let you keep your \ndoctor, and let you keep your insurance plan have all been proven \nfalse.\n  In my district, rates will be seen again going up an additional 30 \npercent likely this year. People can no longer see their family doctor. \nMany people have been forced from their health insurance plans on to \nmore expensive plans with less coverage and a higher deductible.\n  Thanks to a budget procedure known as reconciliation, we have avoided \na Senate filibuster and placed a bill rolling back ObamaCare on the \nPresident's desk. This is a promise kept for restoring healthcare \nfreedom for Americans.\n  If the President vetoes this measure, congressional Democrats have a \nchoice to make. Will they side with Americans who need real reforms to \nthe healthcare system and override this veto or with a President \nconcerned solely with his legacy and a status quo that is destroying \naccess to care and driving up costs?

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to \nthe possible housing of illegal immigrant detainees on Maxwell-Gunter \nAir Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama.\n  An active military base like Maxwell-Gunter is no place to house \ndetained minors, and I wasted no time making it clear to the Obama \nadministration that I am paying attention to this and that I am going \nto fight any attempt to bring detained minors on the base.\n  I have written the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, and \nHealth and Human Services to express my strong objection and to explain \nwhy this is such a bad idea. I have also been in touch with leaders on \nbase in Montgomery to discuss the potential effect on their missions.\n  Our personnel at Maxwell-Gunter are engaged in serious military \nactivities: training, education, cyber warfare, many times in \nclassified settings that are very sensitive.

Mr. Speaker, Tuesday morning President Obama \nformally announced his plans to unilaterally expand gun control laws. \nUnsurprisingly, the President has again overstepped the boundaries and \npowers of his office.\n  While we all want fewer senseless acts of violence, the President is \nchoosing to punish lawful gun owners and restrict their Second \nAmendment rights instead of addressing the actual causes of mass \nmurder, such as the need to improve our mental health system and the \ngrowing threat of terrorism.\n  In addition to the constitutional questions about his actions and the \nmislaid blame toward lawful gun owners, these executive actions won't \neven accomplish what the President claims is his reason for acting. Not \na single mass shooting committed over the last few years would have \nbeen prevented by the gun control measures currently being discussed, a \nstatement The Washington Post's Fact Checker gave a rare Geppetto \ncheckmark, which is being described as ``the truth, the whole truth, \nand nothing but the truth.''\n  As a physician, I think if you want to try to prevent mass killings, \nyou have to do more to intervene with individuals before they commit \nthese heinous acts, which is why so many of us believe reforming our \nmental healthcare system is critically important.\n  As a proud American and concealed-carry permit holder, I am opposed \nto this executive overreach but will work tirelessly to accomplish \nreforms that reduce the chance of mass shootings ever occurring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H117-6", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H117-H123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1927, FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION \n                         LITIGATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nHastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on House Resolution 581 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward \nthis rule today on behalf of the Committee on Rules. It is a structured \nrule that provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Given the House's schedule this month, the rule also provides that a \nvote on any motion relating to disposition of the veto message for \nreconciliation measure passed yesterday by the House may be postponed \nthrough January 25.\n  Consistent with the vision of Speaker Ryan and Chairman Sessions, I \nam pleased that the robust majority of amendments submitted to the \nCommittee on Rules were made in order. Of the 13 amendments submitted, \n10 amendments will be considered on the House floor.\n  Yesterday the House Committee on Rules received testimony from the \nchairman of the Committee on the Judiciary and the ranking member of \nthe Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, in addition to \nreceiving amendment testimony from several Members.\n  Mr. Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania brought forward an important \namendment regarding FDA-approved medical devices. Although his \namendment was not germane to this particular piece of legislation, he \nis a champion for his constituents, and I appreciate the testimony that \nhe shared with the committee. His constituent suffered unimaginable \npain, heartbreak, and ultimately her child because of Essure. It is my \nunderstanding that the FDA will release their Essure safety review next \nmonth. Once we assess the FDA's findings and conclusion, I hope \nCongress will take any appropriate action needed to protect the health \nof women and their unborn babies.\n  This rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 1927, the Fairness \nin Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency \nAct of 2015, introduced by the chairman of the Committee on the \nJudiciary, Bob Goodlatte, and the chairman of the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution and Civil Justice, Trent Franks.\n  Subcommittee hearings were held on this legislation. It was also \nmarked up and reported by the Committee on the Judiciary. Although this \nbill went through regular order and enjoyed lively and meaningful \ndiscussion at the subcommittee and full committee levels, some \nmisperceptions remain.\n  This legislation provides a targeted solution to a targeted problem. \nThe core issue it presents is whether the injury suffered by named \nplaintiffs in a class action suit matches the injuries suffered by the \nclass. Additionally, and this is the point to clarify, the civil rights \nclass actions such as Brown v. Board of Education would not--and I \nrepeat, would not--be impacted by H.R. 1927.\n  Let me be clear. This legislation does not kill class action. \nVirtually every time this body or the courts attempt to reform class \naction lawsuits after clear abuses, opponents claim the reforms, \nwhatever they may be, will mean the demise of class action.\n  When Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act in \n1995 to limit frivolous securities lawsuits, opponents claimed it would \nkill securities class action. It did not. In fact, President Clinton \nvetoed the legislation, Congress overrode the veto, and our legal \nsystem is the better for it.\n  When Congress passed the Class Action Fairness Act, CAFA, in 2005, \nopponents once again claimed that the passage would mean the end of \nclass actions. CAFA had two targeted goals: reducing abusive forum \nshopping by plaintiffs and requiring greater Federal scrutiny \nprocedures for the review of class action settlements in certain \ncircumstances.\n  You may recall an infamous Alabama class action involving Bank of \nBoston, where the attorneys' fees exceeded the relief to the class \nmembers, and the class members lost money paying attorneys for the \nvictory. It doesn't sound like much of a victory. Yet at the time, the \nopponents of reform made virtually identical arguments against that \nlegislation that they are making today against H.R. 1927. They are \nbaseless and unsupported by history.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Researchers at the Federal Judicial Center conducted a study on the \nimpact of CAFA and concluded that post-enactment there was an increase \nin the number of class actions filed in or removed to the Federal \ncourts based on diversity jurisdiction, consistent with congressional \nintent.\n  The class action is alive and well and is an important part of our \nlegal system, and it will remain that way. Claims to the contrary are \noverused and inaccurate.\n  H.R. 1927 is a targeted solution that says a Federal court may not \ncertify a proposed class unless the party seeking the class action \ndemonstrates through admissible evidentiary proof that each proposed \nclass member suffered an injury of the same type and the extent of the \ninjury of the named class representative or representatives.\n  This requirement already exists in rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. Unfortunately, not all courts appropriately interpret \nand apply these standards. If my colleagues across the aisle disagree \nwith rule 23 standards, then we can certainly debate the merits of that \nstandard.\n  But to claim that codifying an existing standard to ensure consistent \nand appropriate application by the courts will kill the class action \nand discourage victims from seeking redress is simply not supported by \nthe facts.\n  Class actions exist--and rightly so--to allow a group of individuals \nsimilarly harmed to seek monetary compensation for their injuries. \nToday, however, there are far too many cases in which a named plaintiff \nwith an injury brings a lawsuit seeking to represent a class. No \nproblem here. This is how the system was designed to work.\n  The abuse of the system arises when the class includes countless \nothers that have suffered no injury at all. These no-injury class \nactions are designed simply to exploit companies and achieve a quick \npayday because either no genuine injury has occurred yet or because it \nnever will.\n\n[[Page H119]]\n\n  Class actions should be preserved as a tool for those harmed to \nreceive compensation. H.R. 1927 will allow the courts to focus their \nresources on cases where injury has occurred and ensuring those \nresponsible are held accountable.\n  Not surprisingly, this commonsense approach is supported by the \nAmerican people. A recent DRI National Poll on the Civil Justice System \nfound that 78 percent of Americans would support a law requiring a \nperson to show that they were actually harmed by a company's products, \nservices, or policies to join a class action rather than just showing \npotential for harm.\n  Further illustrating this body's commitment to do right by victims \nand ensure that they are compensated for their injuries, H.R. 1927 also \ncontains the text of the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act, or \nthe FACT Act.\n  The FACT Act is designed to reduce fraud in compensation claims for \nasbestos-related diseases so we can ensure that resources exist for \ntrue victims. Double-dipping is an all too common occurrence in \nasbestos claims, and for every dollar inappropriately given, it means \n$1 less for true victims who face mesothelioma and other asbestos-\nrelated illnesses.\n  True victims are often those to whom our country owes its greatest \ndebt: our veterans. Veterans currently comprise 9 percent of the \npopulation; yet, they make up approximately 30 percent of asbestos \nvictims. Veterans are uniquely positioned to benefit from the increased \ntransparency that would result from the enactment of this bill.\n  Many veterans groups support this legislation, including the American \nMilitary Society, Save our Veterans, the Veterans Resource list, and \nnumerous other State and local veterans groups.\n  Opponents of this bill also claim that it will negatively impact \nprivacy rights for claimants. This is not true. The bill actually \nrequires far less personal information than is currently required by \nState courts in their current disclosure forms.\n  This legislation will reduce fraud in the asbestos trust system, \nwhich will ultimately protect and maximize assets available to \ncompensate future asbestos victims, veterans or otherwise.\n  I thank Chairman Goodlatte and his staff for their tireless work to \nbring forward these pro-victim reforms, and I am pleased we will have \nrobust general and amendment debate on this important topic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nI thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule, which provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 1927, called the Fairness in Class Action \nLitigation Act, which in practice will unfairly hamper large numbers of \ninjured parties from effectively seeking redress in court, including \ncivil rights, employment discrimination, consumer protection, and \nasbestos victim litigants.\n  Let me put my bona fides on the table here. I have filed class \nactions, particularly in civil rights cases. Each of them were \ncertified as class actions. They led to the desegregation of schools in \nthe county that I am privileged to serve, the desegregation of juvenile \ndetention facilities, and several others too numerous to mention.\n  As a United States district court judge, I also had the privilege of \npresiding in cases where certification was sought for class actions. \nThe great majority of those cases were not certified by me, largely for \nthe reason that they did not meet the rigorous test that is already in \nplace and that has been in place for nearly 40 years, with many changes \nhaving taken place over the years through the Federal process. That is \nwhat I would argue would be the best for us to do.\n  First, this bill includes language that prohibits Federal courts from \ncertifying that a group can file a class action lawsuit unless the \ngroup demonstrates by admissible evidentiary proof that each proposed \nclass member suffered an injury of the same type and scope of the \ninjury of the named class representative.\n  A footnote right here. My read is that Brown v. Board of Education, \nthe most significant school desegregation case in the history of this \ncountry, would not have qualified as a class action under this measure, \nas proposed.\n  My friends in the majority claim that this measure is necessary to \nreduce fraud and exploitation in the class action system, maintaining \nthat, under current rules, Federal courts have certified classes that \ninclude individuals who have not been injured, but have been forced \ninto a class action lawsuit against their will.\n  This claim and the legislation it inspired has been met by much \nopposition from a broad range of legal, civil rights, labor, consumer, \nand public interest groups, including the American Bar Association, the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, AFSCME, NAACP, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, National Consumer Law Center, Public Citizen, Public Justice, \nand American Association for Justice, among a myriad of others.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the American Bar \nAssociation, Public Citizen, American Federation of Labor and Congress \nof Industrial Organizations, the Asbestos Disease Awareness \nOrganization, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. All of those \norganizations that I just identified are opposed to this legislation. \nTheir language speaks for itself, for those who may peruse the \nCongressional Record.\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: On behalf of the American Bar \n     Association and its almost 400,000 members, I write to offer \n     our views as the Committee considers class action reform. I \n     understand that your Committee intends to mark up H.R. 1927, \n     the ``Fairness in Clam Action Litigation Act of 2015'' \n     tomorrow. The ABA has long recognized that we must continue \n     to improve our judicial system; however, we cannot support \n     legislation such as H.R. 1927, because it would unnecessarily \n     circumvent the Rules Enabling Act, make it more difficult for \n     large numbers of injured parties to efficiently seek redress \n     in court, and would place added burdens on an already \n     overloaded court system.\n       This proposed legislation would circumvent the time-proven \n     process for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n     established by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act. Rule 23 of \n     the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs determinations \n     whether class certification is appropriate. This rule was \n     adopted in 1966 and has been amended several times utilizing \n     the procedure established by Congress. The Judicial \n     Conference, the policymaking body for the courts, is \n     currently considering changes to Rule 23, and we recommend \n     allowing this process to continue. In addition, the Supreme \n     Court is poised to rule on cases where there are questions \n     surrounding class certification. For example, the Court \n     agreed to hear Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo, where they will \n     determine whether a class can be certified when it contains \n     some members who have not been injured. We respectfully urge \n     you to allow these processes for examining and reshaping \n     procedural and evidentiary rules to work as Congress \n     intended.\n       Currently, to proceed with a class action case, plaintiffs \n     must meet rigorous threshold standards. A 2008 study by the \n     Federal Judicial Center found that only 25 percent of \n     diversity actions filed as class actions resulted in class \n     certification motions, nine percent settled, and none went to \n     trial. These data show that current screening practices are \n     working. However, if the proponents of this legislation are \n     concerned about frivolous class action cases and believe that \n     screening can be even more effective through rule changes, \n     those changes should be proposed and considered utilizing the \n     current process set forth by Congress in the Rules Enabling \n     Act.\n       In addition to circumventing the rulemaking process, the \n     proposed legislation would severely limit the ability of \n     victims who have suffered a legitimate harm to collectively \n     seek justice in a class action lawsuit. The proposed \n     legislation mandates that in order to be certified as a class \n     each individual member must prove he or she suffered an \n     injury of the same type and scope to the proposed named class \n     representative(s), and requires plaintiffs to show they \n     suffered bodily injury or property damage.\n       We were pleased learn that a manager's amendment is \n     expected to be offered during tomorrow's markup that removes \n     the requirement that the alleged harm to the plaintiff \n     involved bodily injury or property damage. This improves the \n     bill, but the remaining requirement leaves a severe burden \n     for people who have suffered harm at the hands of large \n     institutions with vast resources, effectively barring them \n     from forming class actions. For example, in a recent class \n     action case against the Veterans Administration, several \n     veterans sued for a variety of grievances centered on delayed \n     claims. The requirement in this legislation\n\n[[Page H120]]\n\n     that plaintiffs suffer the same type of injuries might have \n     barred these litigants from forming a class because each \n     plaintiff suffered harms that were not the same.\n       Class actions have been an efficient means of resolving \n     disputes. Making it harder to utilize class actions will add \n     to the burden of our court system by forcing aggrieved \n     parties to file suit in smaller groups, or individually.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to provide our input and urge \n     you to keep these recommendations in mind as you continue to \n     debate class action reform legislation.

The frightening reality is \n     that an unknown amount of the cancer-causing substance is \n     still present in our surroundings, but the asbestos industry \n     does not have to disclose where and when it was and is being \n     used.\n       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that \n     roughly 3,000 people continue to die from mesothelioma and \n     asbestosis every year and some experts estimate the death \n     toll is as high as 12,000-15,000 people per year when other \n     types of asbestos-linked diseases and cancers are included.\n       Instead of helping these victims, H.R. 526 would put \n     unworkable burdens on claims trusts. For example, the bill \n     would impose a requirement for trusts to respond to any and \n     all corporate defendants' information requests. Such a \n     requirement would have the effect of slowing or virtually \n     stopping the ability of trusts to provide compensation for \n     victims. Since patients diagnosed with fatal asbestos-caused \n     diseases like mesothelioma have very short expected \n     lifespans, a delay in justice could leave victims' next of \n     kin struggling to pay medical and funeral bills.\n       The FACT Act does nothing to improve the lives of those \n     facing an asbestos death sentence through no fault of their \n     own. The bill instead adds insult to injury and inexcusably \n     invades the privacy of victims by requiring public disclosure \n     of personal claim information, including portions of their \n     social security numbers, opening the door to identity theft \n     and possible discrimination.\n       Instead of the FACT Act's misguided push for \n     ``transparency'' via asbestos trust claim information \n     disclosures, an appropriate transparency standard would \n     ensure that workers and consumers have all the information \n     necessary to limit their potential exposure to the deadly \n     substance. Specifically, companies should publicly disclose \n     their activities related to the manufacture, processing, \n     distribution, sales, importation, transport or storage of \n     asbestos or asbestos-containing products. That's why Public \n     Citizen supports Sens. Durbin and Markey's and Reps. DelBene \n     and Green's Reducing Exposure to Asbestos Database Act (READ \n     Act, S. 700/H.R. 2030) which would create an information \n     portal for the public to learn about the many asbestos-\n     containing products that are currently bought and sold in the \n     U.S.A.\n       The real outrage is the double oppression of asbestos \n     victims, and the real need for transparency is disclosure of \n     past and ongoing asbestos exposures. Please oppose H.R. 526.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lisa Gilbert,\n       Director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch division.\n     Susan Harley,\n       Deputy Director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch division.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                  Washington, DC, January 5, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: I am writing to express the strong \n     opposition of the AFL-CIO to H.R. 1927, the ``Fairness in \n     Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim \n     Transparency Act'' which is scheduled for consideration by \n     the House of Representatives this week. This bill \n     incorporates H.R. 526, the Furthering Asbestos Claim \n     Transparency Act (FACT Act), which would invade the privacy \n     of asbestos victims by posting personal exposure and medical \n     information online and create new barriers to victims \n     receiving compensation for their asbestos diseases. The AFL-\n     CIO urges you to oppose this harmful bill.\n       Decades of uncontrolled use of asbestos, even after its \n     hazards were known, have resulted in a legacy of disease and \n     death. Hundreds of thousands of workers and family members \n     have suffered or died of asbestos-related cancers and lung \n     disease, and the toll continues. Each year an estimated \n     10,000 people in the United States are expected to die from \n     asbestos related diseases.\n       Asbestos victims have faced huge barriers and obstacles to \n     receiving compensation for their diseases. Major asbestos \n     producers refused to accept responsibility and most declared \n     bankruptcy in an attempt to limit their future liability. In \n     1994 Congress passed special legislation that allowed the \n     asbestos companies to set up bankruptcy trusts to compensate \n     asbestos victims and reorganize under the bankruptcy law. But \n     these trusts don't have adequate funding to provide just \n     compensation, and according to a 2010 RAND study, the median \n     payment across the trusts is only 25 percent of the claim's \n     value. With compensation from these trusts so limited, \n     asbestos victims have sought redress from the manufacturers \n     of other asbestos products to which they were exposed.\n       The AFL-CIO is well aware that the system for compensating \n     asbestos disease victims has had its share of problems, with \n     victims facing delays and inadequate compensation and too \n     much money being spent on defendant and plaintiff lawyers. We \n     have spent years of effort trying to seek solutions to make \n     the asbestos compensation system fairer and more effective. \n     But the FACT Act does nothing to improve compensation for \n     asbestos victims and would in fact make the situation even \n     worse. In our view, the bill is simply an effort by asbestos \n     manufacturers who are still subject to asbestos lawsuits to \n     avoid liability for diseases caused by exposure to their \n     products.\n       The FACT Act would require personally identifiable exposure \n     histories and disease information for each asbestos victim \n     filing a claim with an asbestos trust, and related payment \n     information, to be posted on a public docket. This public \n     posting is an extreme invasion of privacy. It would give \n     unfettered access to employers, insurance companies, workers \n     compensation carriers and others who could use this \n     information for any purpose including blacklisting workers \n     from employment and fighting compensation claims.\n       The bill would also require asbestos trusts to provide on \n     demand to asbestos defendants and litigants any information \n     related to payments made by and claims filed with the trusts. \n     This would place unnecessary and added burdens on the trusts \n     delaying much-needed compensation for asbestos victims. Such \n     a provision allows asbestos defendants to bypass the \n     established rules of discovery in the civil justice system, \n     and provides broad unrestricted access to personal \n     information with no limitations on its use.\n       Congress should be helping the hundreds of thousands of \n     individuals who are suffering from disabling and deadly \n     asbestos diseases, not further victimizing them by invading \n     their privacy and subjecting them to potential blacklisting \n     and discrimination.\n       The AFL-CIO strongly urges you to oppose H.R. 1927.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Government Affairs Department.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Asbestos Disease\n\n\n                                       Awareness Organization,\n\n                              Redondo Beach, CA, February 4, 2015.\n     Re Opposition to the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency \n         Act of 2015 (H.R. 526)\n\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: As both \n     a mesothelioma widow and the President and Co-Founder of the \n     Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, I respectfully write \n     to express my strong opposition to the Furthering Asbestos \n     Claim Transparency (FACT) Act of 2015, H.R. 526.\n       Asbestos is a known human carcinogen that causes deadly \n     cancerous diseases. Asbestos-related diseases kill at least \n     10,000 Americans every year. Yet, it remains a major public \n     health hazard that severely affects too many American \n     families. Notwithstanding these lethal exposures, the 2014 \n     U.S. Geological Survey World Report confirmed that although \n     Asbestos has not been mined in the United States since 2002, \n     the U.S. continues to import Asbestos to ``meet manufacturing \n     needs.''\n       These same manufacturing interests who for years hid the \n     dangers of their lethal Asbestos products, are now asking \n     Congress--under the guise of transparency--to impose new time \n     and cost-consuming requirements on the asbestos trusts, grant \n     asbestos defendants new rights to infringe upon victims' \n     privacy, and operate the trusts in a manner that will unduly \n     burden asbestos victims and their families, without \n     justification. I oppose the bill not only because it is both \n     fundamentally unfair and discriminatory toward asbestos \n     cancer victims, but because it is entirely one-sided, and \n     seeks absolutely nothing in the way of increased transparency \n     from the same industry that caused the largest man-made \n     disaster in human history, and covered it up for years.\n\n[[Page H121]]\n\n       There is no justification for exposing families to the \n     additional burdens set forth in H.R. 526. Information needed \n     to verify the health of the trusts is already publicly \n     available in a way that protects the privacy of the victims \n     of asbestos disease and their families. And trusts \n     established by asbestos companies undergoing reorganization \n     effectively compensate current and future asbestos victims \n     while allowing business operations to continue. Trusts are \n     designed to decrease litigation and costs, yet the proposed \n     reporting requirements contained in the FACT Act work \n     contrary to that very purpose. Instead, the FACT Act grants \n     asbestos companies the right to require from the trusts any \n     information they choose, at any time, and for practically any \n     reason. The resulting delay in compensation will gravely \n     impact patients' pursuit of medical care, negatively affects \n     all victims of asbestos exposure, and effectively limits the \n     justice they deserve. Accordingly, I am strongly opposed to \n     the FACT Act, which creates even greater burdens for patients \n     and families to overcome during an already extremely \n     difficult time.\n       I am extremely disappointed that recent Congressional \n     legislative efforts have focused on ways to limit the \n     litigation designed to compensate victims, when the most \n     obvious way to limit the impact of asbestos exposure is \n     through increased public awareness of the dangers posed, and \n     prevention. Americans need legislation that will stop the \n     continued import of asbestos into our country, and prevent \n     the continued expanse of environmental and occupational \n     asbestos-related diseases. As consumers and workers, \n     Americans deserve transparency to prevent exposure to \n     asbestos, not to penalize victims.\n       More than 30 Americans die each day from a preventable \n     asbestos-caused disease. On behalf of the American citizens, \n     we urge you to take the time to hear from the victims of \n     asbestos exposure and consider legislation that will protect \n     public health, not legislation designed only to delay and \n     deny justice for victims of asbestos exposure.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Linda Reinstein,\n\n                                         President and Co-Founder,\n     Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Military Order\n\n\n                                          of the Purple Heart,\n\n                                    Springfield, VA, July 8, 2015.\n     Hon. John Conyers,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Conyers: As H.R. 526 ``FACT Act'' makes \n     it way through the legislative process, the Military Order of \n     the Purple Heart of the U.S.A. (MOPH) wishes to reiterate its \n     firm opposition to this bill.\n       We are disappointed to see that our declaration of \n     opposition in February of this year has not stopped this bill \n     in its tracks. Have no doubt and make no mistake, the FACT \n     Act will have a very burdensome and detrimental effect on the \n     asbestos personal injury trust claims for veterans and their \n     families who have been exposed to this deadly product. The \n     Association of the United States Navy (AUSN) and American \n     Veterans (AMVETS) recognize this as well and recently joined \n     us in opposing this legislation.\n       On May 14th during the full Judiciary Committee mark-up of \n     H.R. 526 ``FACT Act'', the legislation's author, \n     Representative Blake Farenthold shared with the committee a \n     list of eleven ``veterans organizations'' that support the \n     FACT Act. It needs to be noted that none of the groups \n     mentioned were a national veterans service organization such \n     as the MOPH. In fact, the majority of the groups listed by \n     the Representative are not recognized veterans service \n     organizations at all.\n       The Military Order of the Purple Heart, of the U.S.A. is a \n     Congressionally chartered national veterans service \n     organization and is the only one that is exclusively made up \n     of combat wounded Purple Heart veterans. We carefully \n     consider each piece of veterans' related legislation to \n     assure it is either truly beneficial or truly negative for \n     veterans before we take an official position. We speak on \n     behalf of our 45,000 members across the nation, not just a \n     couple of hundred in a few states.\n       H.R. 526 is bad for veterans. The MOPH has been, and will \n     continue to be, staunch advocates for our members and all \n     veterans of the United States Armed Forces. We continue to \n     oppose H.R. 526 and respectfully ask you to join us.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                J. Patrick Little,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the current screening \npractices for certifying which individuals may file a class action \nlawsuit are working. Currently, plaintiffs must meet, as I said \nearlier, rigorous threshold standards to proceed with a class action.\n  In fact, a 2008 study by the Federal Judicial Center found that only \n25 percent of diversity actions filed as class actions resulted in \nclass certification motions. In the cases I presided in, there were \nless than 25 percent. 9 percent settled and none went to trial.\n  Why must we begin this new year with yet another piece of legislation \nthat is a solution in search of a problem?\n  In short, this ill-conceived and unneeded bill unnecessarily \ncircumvents the Rules Enabling Act, the process established by the \nCongress to amend the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, making it more \ndifficult for large numbers of injured parties to effectively seek \nredress in court and would place additional burdens on an already \noverloaded court system.\n  I should add that the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for \nthe Federal courts of this country, is currently considering changes to \nrule 23, which governs determination of whether class certification is \nappropriate, and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear cases where there \nare questions surrounding class certification, including Tyson Foods v. \nBouaphakeo.\n  It would behoove us to allow these processes for examining and \nrevising procedural and evidentiary rules to work as Congress intended.\n  The requirement in this bill that each proposed class member must \nprove he or she suffered an injury of the same type and scope of the \ninjury of the named class representative effectively bars individuals \nwho have suffered harm at the hands of large institutions with immense \nresources from forming class actions.\n  I am also highly concerned that the injury language included in this \nbill will exclude from the courts entire categories of lawsuits, most \nsignificantly, victims of discriminatory practices or civil rights \nviolations seeking redress.\n  A commonsense reading of this provision, as I indicated, might well \nhave excluded class actions such as Brown v. Board of Education. Brown \nserved as a catalyst for the modern civil rights movement, ultimately \nleading to full equality for African Americans.\n  Under this legislation, class action plaintiffs must effectively \nprove the merits of their case as a condition of class certification, \nmaking most class actions nearly impossible to pursue.\n  A mechanism must exist to hold corporations and other entities \naccountable when they engage in systemic discrimination, unfair and \ndeceptive practices, consumer fraud, and other wrongdoing that harms \nlarge numbers of people. This bill undermines this vital tool.\n  Let me give you an example, which is the cases brought against airbag \ndeception that are currently being litigated and that we see much of in \nthe news. If we were to look at scope of injury, some people were \nkilled, and some people received minor injuries. Some people who had \nthose airbags did not receive injuries.\n  But it seems logical to allow that all of the persons who had those \nautomobiles should have an opportunity for corrective procedures, \nregardless of whether or not that was a wrongful death or whether or \nnot there was an injury. The scope becomes nebulous when you look at it \nfrom the perspective of actual circumstances that we are confronted \nwith sometimes in class actions.\n  H.R. 1927 also includes a provision--and this troubles me deeply and \nshould trouble everybody that is in Congress and in this Nation--that \nwould delay the work of asbestos compensation trusts. Formerly, the \nFurthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act, section 3 of this bill, \nwill shield the asbestos industry from accountability while exposing \ntrust claimants to scams, identity theft, and other privacy violations.\n  This portion of the bill is similarly opposed by a number of groups \nthat I have identified, including the Military Order of the Purple \nHeart, the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, and the \nEnvironmental Working Group, just to name a few.\n  For instance, the bill requires trusts to respond to any and all \ncorporate defendants' requests for information. Ladies and gentlemen, \nthat could take years. By that time, many of the complainants may very \nwell have died. And what troubles me a lot is that the trust fund is \nmaking money.\n  It is similar to what automobile insurance companies do. When there \nis an automobile accident, if they think that there was harm \nperpetrated by their insured, they immediately establish a fund that \nwould cover that liability. Then their lawyers go to work to not pay \nthe claim at all and, next, to delay the claim.\n  The longer they keep it away from an ultimate settlement, the more \nmoney the insurance company makes. And they make enough money sometimes\n\n[[Page H122]]\n\nto pay the claim that they could have settled or paid the claim of the \ninjured victim in the first place.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The measure also requires public disclosure of personal claim \ninformation, including portions of those with asbestos-related \ndiseases' Social Security numbers.\n  Interestingly, this legislation does not impose these same burdensome \nreporting requirements for the companies that exposed Americans to \nasbestos.\n  Despite its promise, this bill does nothing to improve judicial \nefficiency or reduce fraud in the court system and, instead, severely \nhampers justice for victims of corporate wrongdoing.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), a good friend of mine.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding \nto me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today against another handout to corporate \ninterests, this time needlessly limiting access to courts for American \nconsumers and workers.\n  The bill we would consider under this rule is the second blow in a \none-two punch for American families. We kicked off 2016 by defunding \nPlanned Parenthood and, effectively, repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n  Now we are considering legislation that would limit class action \nlawsuits, and needlessly threaten the privacy of asbestos victims, as \nwell as other victims of faulty product designs, negligence, and \ndangerous environmental occurrences.\n  The end goal is obvious: enable corporations to avoid both blame and \naccountability when they have harmed consumers or knowingly exposed \nworkers to toxic chemicals.\n  I wish that I were more surprised, but I am not. The truth is clear \nin this bill. It is just the next step in Republican efforts to lift \ncorporate interests above any level of scrutiny, endangering citizens \nand consumers in the process.\n  Our courts are a cornerstone of justice for everyday Americans. We \nneed to find ways to expand, not restrict, access to our legal system \nfor victims.\n  Class actions have cleaned up the environment after oil spills, \nbanned cigarette ads aimed at children, and policed price-fixing on \nWall Street, among many other things.\n  Other nations allow big corporations to run amok, harming people \nthrough dangerous products, fraud, and dishonesty, virtually unchecked. \nBut here in the United States of America, class action lawsuits are a \nvital tool that hold even the very powerful accountable for their \nmalfeasance.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to get to work on policies for the American \npeople, not against them, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nrule and the underlying bill, H.R. 1927.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch), my good friend and former member of the Rules \nCommittee; and we miss him.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, the 114th Congress will be remembered as the \nCongress that tried and tried again to unravel the extraordinary and \ngreat achievements of that American President of a century ago, \nTheodore Roosevelt.\n  President Roosevelt was a Republican. He believed in capitalism, he \nbelieved in profit, he believed in commerce. But he understood \nsomething that this Congress seems to forget: The axiom that power \ncorrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, applies to Wall \nStreet and to large corporations as much as it does to oligarchs and \ndespots.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation does end any realistic opportunity for \nconsumers who are hammered by corporate negligence or irresponsibility \nor outright deceit from joining together to get the justice they are \nentitled to by using the only practical means available to obtain it, \nthe class action lawsuit.\n  Instead, this legislation would deny class action status to all \nconsumers affected by the exact same corporate misconduct--say, faulty \nbrakes--unless they suffered the identical injury, a broken arm, but \nnot a broken leg.\n  In a case of current moment, of real corporate misconduct and actual \ndeceit, Volkswagen lying about its emissions control and, really, \nfudging the numbers on its mileage, the 3,000 Vermonters and 11 million \nAmericans would have to file individual suits unless each suffered the \nsame exact economic loss.\n  What is the justification for building this barrier to access to the \ncourts? There is none.\n  But the proponents of this legislation are advocating, idealistically \nand ideologically, the underpinning of so much other legislation for \nAmericans who are seeking safety, who are seeking opportunity, who are \nseeking justice.\n  Think about it. Repealing the ACA, Affordable Care Act, with no \nreplacement for those 17 million Americans who are now covered; \nunraveling Dodd-Frank, leaving Wall Street to its old ways that led to \nthe collapse of the economy in 2008; denying Puerto Rico, at the last \nminute, the option that every other municipality or State has if there \nis a credit situation to go into bankruptcy, all in service of hedge \nfund billionaire investors from Wall Street.\n  Starving the FTC and the SEC of their budgets so that they are no \nlonger able to provide protections to consumers and small investors \nthat they are entitled to.\n  Teddy Roosevelt, capitalist that he was, would never have stacked the \ndeck so high against everyday Americans.\n  You know, we are talking a lot in this country about income \ninequality that is real. We can debate the causes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WELCH. But the reality is we are building a structure of \ninequality, bill by bill, brick by brick. Denying class action access \nto the courts for everyday Americans injured by similar or the same \ncorporate misconduct is to deny them a basic American right.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to vote against this legislation \nand stand up for access to justice.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House of Representatives cast its 62nd \nvote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  That we began the second session of the 114th Congress in this manner \nsends the regrettable, but undeniable message that it may be a new \nyear, and we may have a new Speaker, but we are dealing with the same \nold majority Congress, intent on advancing partisan measures with \nlittle chance of becoming law.\n  H.R. 1927 will serve to close the courthouse doors to concerned and \nvulnerable citizens injured by large corporations.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan legislation that will \nclose a glaring loophole in our gun laws, allowing suspected terrorists \nto legally buy firearms. This bill would bar the sale of firearms and \nexplosives to those on the FBI's terrorist watch list.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and \ndefeat the previous question, and vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Again, a lot can be said, and I am so glad for the coming to the \nfloor later. This will be debated, amendments will be offered. The \nHouse is in regular order doing what the House is supposed to be doing.\n  One thing that I would like to share is, as the previous speaker had \ntalked about history--and I am currently, myself, reading a biography \nouttake on Theodore Roosevelt and his time in the Presidency and the \nthings that he did--there is an amazing balance that he\n\n[[Page H123]]\n\nstruck for, basically, common people and victims.\n  I think that is exactly what we are doing here, because one of the \nthings that the underlying bills do not do is they do not close the \ncourthouse. They do not do the things that, if you look in history, as \nI pointed out in my opening statement, if you look at every time the \nCongress has taken up the class action issue, there has been the \nfalling-of-the-sky phenomenon, that it is going to tear the courthouse \ndown, nobody is going to get anything done.\n  The actual truth is the class action has increased and efficiency was \nfound. And for the true victims, they find their compensation.\n  The courthouse that I have had the wonderful privilege of practicing \nin is a place where people find justice. It is not a place to be \nabused. It is not a place to sometimes take advantage of an open \nsystem. That is what we are doing here, and that is what I want people \nwho read and understand this opportunity, because these are the same \narguments that have been had before.\n  But, you know, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come \nbefore this body, explore the differences between the Republican \nmajority's vision for our country and that of this administration and \nthose who share the President's view.\n  The Republican majority is fighting for a legal system that is \nvictim-focused; a legal system that supports our veterans and ensures \nthat those injured have their day in court and receive compensation.\n  A legal system full of fraud, abuse, and waste is a legal system ill-\nequipped to provide justice to victims.\n  The Republican majority is committed to making life better for all \nAmericans. We have done that this week through reducing the regulatory \nburden on families and small businesses so we can jump-start our \neconomy.\n  We have done that this week by sending to the President's desk a bill \nthat rescinds ObamaCare so that we can get to work on restoring a \npatient-centered healthcare system, such as the Empowering Patients \nFirst Act proposed by my colleague, Dr. Price.\n  And let it be said, just as has been said over the centuries, doing \nthe right thing over and over is still the right thing. And I believe \nif it is 62 times, it can be 62 more times, because this Congressman \nfrom the Ninth District of Georgia believes, as his constituents have \nfound in the Ninth District, that ObamaCare is not for the people and \nneeds to be gone and replaced with a patient-centered approach that we \ncan do as a Republican majority.\n  You see, we have also sent to the President's desk a measure to stop \nPlanned Parenthood from destroying our next generation of men and women \nand directing those funds to organizations that provide mammograms and \ntrue women's health care.\n  And we will continue to fight to keep our Nation safe from enemies, \nforeign and domestic, while preserving the sacred constitutional rights \nof all Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and H.R. 1927.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 581 Offered by Mr. Hastings\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding). The question is on ordering \nthe previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H123-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H123-H145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1315\n      SUNSHINE FOR REGULATORY DECREES AND SETTLEMENTS ACT OF 2015\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 580 and rule\n\n[[Page H124]]\n\nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 712.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1316\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 712) to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and \nsettlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take \nregulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other \npurposes, with Mr. Bost in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  General debate shall not exceed 1 hour, with 40 minutes equally \ndivided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary and 20 minutes equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 20 minutes. The gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each \nwill control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz).\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 712, the Sunshine for \nRegulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015. H.R. 712 includes H.R. \n1759, the All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act of 2015, or the \nALERT Act, which the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform \nfavorably reported on May 29, 2015.\n  We have had some good pieces of legislation that made their way \nthrough the process, and we really do appreciate the great work of \nCongressman Ratcliffe.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe).\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Sunshine for Regulatory \nDecrees and Settlements Act of 2015.\n  I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Chairman Goodlatte for their \nhard work on this package of bills that will help push the government \nout of the way of the American people. I am especially grateful that \nthe ALERT Act, which I introduced earlier this Congress, is included as \ntitle II of the bill.\n  The constituents that I represent in northeast Texas work hard every \nday to provide for their families and to contribute to their \ncommunities. But I can tell you from countless conversations that they \nare fed up with a Federal Government that has been invading every \naspect of their lives. They are frustrated with unaccountable, \nunelected bureaucrats who create regulations that have the force of \nlaw, regulations that typically appear out of nowhere and bring with \nthem huge price tags for the cost of compliance, often with little time \nto prepare and implement them.\n  In some cases, regulators are unforgiving to those who either can't \nor don't timely comply by imposing criminal penalties. Now, let's pause \nto think about that. Bureaucrats hammering otherwise law-abiding \nAmericans with criminal penalties for regulatory violations at a time \nwhen the same administration is giving a free pass to millions of \nillegal aliens for breaking immigration laws, giving early release to \ntens of thousands of prisoners--violent criminals--and turning loose \nradical Islamic terrorists from Guantanamo. It is little wonder that my \nconstituents are outraged.\n  And if it were up to this administration, the problem would get \nworse, not better. To underscore that point, we need only look at the \nFederal Register where agencies publish their mandates. That document \ncontained 82,000 pages last year, meaning that this administration \naveraged more than 224 pages of new regulations every day of the year.\n  Americans have every right to demand to know what we are doing here \nin Congress to stop them from being crushed by this snowball of \nregulations.\n  Part of the answer should be that current law requires an update \ntwice a year on Federal regulations being developed by Federal \nagencies. But guess what. Under this administration, these updates have \neither been late or not issued at all, and until now, there hasn't been \na way to hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable.\n  My bill does just that. This bill forces the executive branch to make \nthe American people aware of regulations that are coming down the \ntrack, and it prohibits any regulations from going into effect unless \nand until detailed information on the cost of that regulation--its \nimpact on jobs and the legal bases for it--is made available to the \npublic for at least 6 months.\n  Predictably, the President and others argue that this bill is too \ntough on regulators. But do you know what? I am here to fight for \nhardworking Americans, not for unelected Washington bureaucrats.\n  Mr. Chairman, ensuring that folks aren't steamrolled by new \nregulations should be a no-brainer. Transparency shouldn't be \ncontroversial, it shouldn't be optional, and it shouldn't be a partisan \nissue. That is why I was honored to introduce the ALERT Act and why I \nam grateful that it has been included in this bill.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 712. This \nlegislation represents yet another attack by House Republicans on \ncritical public health, safety, and environmental protections. I oppose \nthis unnecessary and potentially dangerous legislation in its entirety. \nHowever, I will focus my remarks today on title II of this bill, which \nis in the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee.\n  Title II, also known as the ALERT Act, is an attack on agency \nrulemaking that is inaccurately advertised as an effort to improve \ntransparency. In fact, this bill explicitly prohibits the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs from taking into account benefits \nwhen providing estimated cumulative costs to proposed and final rules. \nThat is not providing transparency. That is providing one side of the \nstory.\n  The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which represents over 150 good \ngovernment, labor, scientific, and health organizations, sent a letter \nopposing the ALERT Act when it was marked up in the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee. The letter states:\n\n  ``The requirements of the ALERT Act, which would delay important \npublic protections and waste scarce government resources, fail to \nprovide needed transparency improvements in the regulatory review \nprocess. Instead, the reporting requirements mandated under the ALERT \nAct would undermine transparency by generating cherry-picked data that \nseems calculated to provide a distorted picture of the U.S. regulatory \nsystem.''\n  The bill would also prevent a rule from taking effect until certain \ninformation is posted online for at least 6 months. The only exceptions \nto this requirement would be if an agency exempts the rule from the \nnotice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act or \nif the President issues an executive order. This is an unnecessary \nroadblock that jeopardizes public health and public safety.\n  One example of a rule that would be affected by this bill is the \nrecently published ATF regulation that closes a loophole that allowed \nindividuals to avoid required background checks when purchasing some of \nthe most dangerous weapons through trusts or legal entities. Under the \nbill, this rule could not take effect until certain information had \nbeen posted online by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nfor 6 months. That is 6 months, that delay, in putting commonsense gun \nsafety procedures in place and would delay them.\n  Many of the disclosure requirements in this legislation are \nredundant. Agencies already publish regulatory plans twice a year. This \nbill would require agencies to provide monthly updates to\n\n[[Page H125]]\n\ntheir regulatory plans. This is unnecessarily burdensome and would \nrequire agencies to divert already scarce resources to comply.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 712.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Collins). He is the author and lead sponsor of the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support today of H.R. \n712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte, who will be coming along \nshortly, as my chairman on the Judiciary Committee for his support and \nwork, and the Judiciary Committee staff. I would also like to thank the \nchairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, my friend, \nMr. Chaffetz, a committee which I have served on that continues to do \ngreat work, along with the ranking member. It is good to be with you \ntoday.\n  This is legislation--to me, especially H.R. 712--that addresses a \nproblem and has been passed by the House on three separate occasions to \naddress sue and settle practices that serve special interests at the \nexpense of the American people. This is something I have been dealing \nwith since I have been in Congress because it goes to the heart of what \nI have spoken to many times about the Republican majority and our \ninterest in fairness and our interest in making the court system work \nfor people.\n  What this bill actually does is actually--the heart and the core of \nit--goes after sue and settle litigation, consent decrees, that are \ntaken behind closed doors without, many times, those that are affected \neven having the ability to give input into those and then being \naffected by that.\n  So, if I had a problem with someone and I couldn't resolve it, I \nwould just go to the agency, such as the EPA or others who may have \nsympathetic leanings, and I say, ``You are not doing what you are \nsupposed to be doing.'' I threaten to sue. We get behind closed doors. \nWe settle something. The judge makes a consent order, and then I take \nit back to the areas that are affected, and they have no input into \nthat. That is just not fair, inherently not fair.\n  This bill simply is about transparency. To be against this bill is to \nbe against transparency. To be against this legislation is to say that \nwe believe it is okay to cut people out when they are affected.\n  Just to let you know how this is affected, between 2009 and 2012, 71 \nlawsuits were settled as sue and settle cases and directly led to the \nissuance of more than 100 new Federal Rules--100 new Federal Rules--out \nof consent decrees, including several with a compliance cost--listen to \nthis. We want to talk about small business, we want to talk about local \ngovernments being burdened. Listen to this compliance cost: $100 \nmillion in excess.\n  This issue is not partisan. Cass Sunstein, President Obama's former \nregulatory czar, called the idea of reforming the sue and settle \nprocess excellent.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. He stated: ``In some cases, agencies don't \nreally disagree but have refrained from acting in part because of \npolitical constraints.''\n  He is right. Agencies use sue and settle to skirt potentially \npolitical issues.\n  This is about fairness. This is about simplicity. This is a bill that \nis brought forward to take care of the American people and the \nburdensome regulations--not to stop it, but to simply get our country \nworking again.\n\n                                                  January 6, 2016.\n       To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     250 undersigned groups strongly support efforts by the House \n     of Representatives to make federal agencies more accountable \n     to the American public and improve the transparency of agency \n     actions. The federal rulemaking process was founded on \n     principles of open government and public participation.\n       We are pleased, therefore, that the House is voting on a \n     comprehensive regulatory reform bill, H.R. 712, the \n     ``Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act,'' \n     which would take important steps to stop the abusive practice \n     known as ``sue and settle'' and give the public and affected \n     parties a greater ability to know about potential rulemakings \n     and to participate.\n       H.R. 712 embodies several major principles of \n     accountability, transparency, and fairness, drawn directly \n     from three regulatory reform bills:\n       Title I--the ``Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and \n     Settlements Act.'' Behind closed doors, organizations and \n     agencies enter into consent decrees or settlement agreements \n     compelling the agencies to issue rules on an expedited \n     timeframe. The states and the public are not given notice of \n     the lawsuits, nor do they have a meaningful voice in the \n     process, despite the adverse impact that rushed, sloppy \n     regulations have on them. This title would improve the ``sue \n     and settle'' process by requiring agencies to give early \n     notice and take public comment on proposed settlement \n     agreements obligating agencies to initiate a rulemaking or \n     take other action on a specified timetable. These settlement \n     agreements allow interest groups to commandeer an agency's \n     agenda and regulatory priorities. The bill would allow \n     affected parties to get notice of draft settlements and \n     provide some opportunity to participate.\n       Title II--the ``All Economic Rules are Transparent (ALERT) \n     Act.'' This title would require agencies to disclose \n     rulemakings the agency plans to propose or finalize to OMB's \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). OIRA \n     would disseminate information about these planned rules to \n     the public, including their estimated costs and benefits.\n       Title III--the ``Providing Accountability Through \n     Transparency Act.'' This title would require federal agencies \n     to notify the public of proposed rules each month by posting \n     a brief, plain-English summary of each proposed regulation on \n     regulations.gov.\n       Taken together, these reforms would help Congress to \n     reassert control over federal regulatory agency actions that \n     have become opaque, unaccountable, and often unfair. Congress \n     must perform its critical role as overseer of the federal \n     agencies.\n       The undersigned groups strongly support H.R. 712, the \n     ``Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act,'' and \n     its comprehensive approach to regulatory reform. We urge you \n     to pass this important bill.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alabama: Alabama Forestry Association, Business Council of \n     Alabama, Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce.\n

Doug Collins (R-GA).\n       ABC supports increased transparency and opportunities for \n     public feedback in situations where agencies promulgate \n     rulemakings via consent decrees and settlement agreements, \n     and opposes regulation through litigation. The Sunshine for \n     Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act (H.R. 712) would \n     promote enhanced openness and transparency in the regulatory \n     process by requiring early disclosure of proposed consent \n     decrees and regulatory settlements.\n       The practice of regulation through litigation (or ``sue and \n     settle'' as it is sometimes described) is used and often \n     abused by advocacy groups in order to initiate rulemakings \n     when they feel federal agencies are not moving quickly enough \n     to draft and issue these policies. Organizations routinely \n     file lawsuits against federal agencies claiming they have not \n     satisfied particular regulatory requirements, at which point \n     agencies can opt to settle. When settlements are agreed to, \n     they often mandate that rulemakings go forward and frequently \n     establish arbitrary timeframes for completion--without \n     stakeholder review or public comment. These settlements are \n     agreed to behind closed doors and their details kept \n     confidential. Agencies release their rulemaking proposals for \n     public comment after the settlement has been agreed upon, but \n     this is often too late for adequate and meaningful feedback.\n       H.R. 712 would require agencies to solicit public comment \n     prior to entering into a consent decree with courts, which \n     would provide affected parties proper notice of proposed \n     regulatory settlements, and would make it possible for \n     affected industries to participate in the actual settlement \n     negotiations.\n       Thank you for your attention on this important matter and \n     we urge the House to pass the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees \n     and Settlements Act when it comes to the floor for a vote.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Kristen Swearingen,\n     Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Small Business &\n\n\n                                     Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                      Vienna, VA, January 4, 2016.\n     Hon. Doug Collins,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Collins: On behalf of the Small \n     Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) and its \n     100,000 members, I am writing to express our strong support \n     for H.R. 712, the ``Sunshine and Regulatory Decrees and \n     Settlement Act of 2015.'' SBE Council is grateful for your \n     ongoing leadership in calling attention to and working to fix \n     the sue-and-settle game played by special interests groups \n     and federal government agencies. H.R. 712 is an important \n     solution that will lift the veil on a process that is unjust \n     and hurts small businesses.\n       Americans feel disconnected from a regulatory process that \n     does not consider their\n\n[[Page H127]]\n\n     views or the real world impact of regulation. A recent survey \n     conducted by our Center for Regulatory Solutions (CRS) found \n     that 72% of Americans believe regulations are ``created in a \n     closed, secretive process,'' with 68% saying that federal \n     rules are created by ``out-of-touch'' people pushing a \n     political agenda. As is the case with ``sue-and-settle,'' \n     special interest groups conspire with federal agencies and \n     file lawsuits against them alleging that an action has been \n     unlawfully delayed or unreasonably withheld. In many cases, \n     the outcome of these legal actions--the ``settle''--is \n     excessive and unreasonable regulation.\n       Small business owners and their employees are hardest hit \n     by these burdensome federal regulations, which, again, are \n     the end product of a closed, one-sided process. In a report \n     published by CRS, we document egregious ``sue-and-settle'' \n     cases and their costly outcomes. It is unconscionable that \n     federal agencies act in secret with the very special \n     interests that favor giving them more power.\n       H.R. 712 would require federal agencies to publish and give \n     notice of these actions, and provide the public with more \n     rights in reviewing, participating in and commenting on them. \n     As such, H.R. 712 provides the openness, fairness and access \n     to the federal regulatory process that it currently lacks.\n       SBE Council is again pleased to support you and your \n     colleagues in your efforts to advance this reform into law. \n     Thank you for your leadership, and support of small business \n     owners and entrepreneurs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Industrial Energy Consumers\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 4, 2016.\n     Re IECA Supports H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory \n         Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015.\n\n     Hon. Doug Collins,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Collins: On behalf of the Industrial \n     Energy Consumers of America (IECA), we support passage of \n     H.R. 712, the ``Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and \n     Settlements Act of 2015.'' The legislation would take \n     important steps to stop the abusive practice known as ``sue \n     and settle'' and give the public and affected parties a \n     greater ability to know about potential rulemakings and to \n     participate. The bill would help Congress to reassert control \n     over federal regulatory agency actions that have become \n     opaque, unaccountable, and often unfair. Congress must \n     perform its critical role as overseer of the federal \n     agencies.\n       IECA is a nonpartisan association of leading manufacturing \n     companies with $1.0 trillion in annual sales, over 2,900 \n     facilities nationwide, and with more than 1.4 million \n     employees worldwide. IECA membership represents a diverse set \n     of industries including: chemical, plastics, steel, iron ore, \n     aluminum, paper, food processing, fertilizer, insulation, \n     glass, industrial gases, pharmaceutical, building products, \n     brewing, automotive, independent oil refining, and cement.\n       Mounting EPA regulatory costs and abuse of the legal system \n     through actions such as ``sue and settle'' have made it very \n     difficult for manufacturing companies to compete with global \n     competitors, thereby impacting U.S. jobs. For example, while \n     China's manufacturing jobs have increased by 31.5 percent \n     since 2000, U.S. manufacturing jobs have declined by 21.6 \n     percent. Furthermore, the 2014 U.S. manufacturing trade \n     deficit stands at $524 billion and 70 percent of the deficit \n     is with one country, China.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this important \n     legislation and look forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul N. Cicio,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     American Fuel & Petrochemical\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 7, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan: The American Fuel & Petrochemical \n     Manufacturers (AFPM) writes in support of H.R. 1155, the \n     Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily \n     Burdensome (SCRUB) Act of 2015, and H.R. 712, the Sunshine \n     for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015. AFPM is a \n     trade association representing high-tech American \n     manufacturers of virtually the entire U.S. supply of \n     gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, other fuels and home heating oil, \n     as well as the petrochemicals used as building blocks for \n     thousands of vital products in daily life. AFPM members make \n     modern life possible and keep America moving and growing as \n     they meet the needs of our nation and local communities, \n     strengthen economic and national security, and support 2 \n     million American jobs.\n       The U.S. is in the midst of an energy and manufacturing \n     renaissance that promises to increase our energy security and \n     create high quality jobs for years to come. AFPM members are \n     playing an important role in this renaissance as they \n     continue to invest billions of dollars in facility upgrades \n     needed to handle our increasing domestic production of oil \n     and natural gas. In addition to bolstering economic growth, \n     these investments ensure that American fuel and petrochemical \n     manufacturers can continue to provide consumers with ample \n     and affordable supplies of transportation fuels and other \n     vital products. America's energy and manufacturing \n     renaissance, however, is threatened by a maze of increasingly \n     costly and unworkable federal regulations. Indeed, domestic \n     manufactures face a total federal regulatory burden of at \n     least $1.88 trillion, jeopardizing their global \n     competitiveness and increasing costs to consumers.\n       H.R. 1155 and 712 would improve our broken regulatory \n     process and mitigate some of the burdens on domestic \n     manufacturers. AFPM specifically welcomes the regulatory \n     ``cut-go'' provisions of H.R. 1155, which would create a \n     mechanism for getting excessively complex, costly, and \n     contradictory regulations under control. Additionally, H.R. \n     712 would significantly limit the growing abuses associated \n     with the ``sue-and-settle tactic'' deployed by certain \n     organizations.\n       Meaningful reform is critical for our country. We \n     appreciate your leadership on this issue and urge the \n     immediate passage of H.R. 1155 and 712.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Chet Thompson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                                  January 7, 2016.\n       Dear Representatives: The National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in \n     the United States representing manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support \n     H.R. 712, Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act \n     of 2015, introduced by Representative Doug Collins (R-GA).\n       Manufacturers and other stakeholders are often subject to \n     significant federal regulatory actions mandated through \n     consent decrees and settlement agreements. However, the \n     public can be excluded from the promulgation of rules as \n     agencies and litigants negotiate behind closed doors, \n     determining when and how regulators must act.\n       Public participation and transparency in the regulatory \n     process is a universal principle of sound rulemaking. H.R. \n     712 would enhance the regulatory process by increasing public \n     participation in shaping rules before they are proposed. The \n     bill would require agencies to provide timely and more \n     relevant information to the public of lawsuits attempting to \n     force regulatory action and to publish proposed consent \n     decrees or regulatory settlements. Importantly, H.R. 712 \n     would require agencies to consider public comments prior to \n     entry of consent decrees or settlement agreements with the \n     court.\n       Agency actions to develop significant regulations without \n     public participation contradict the sound regulatory \n     principles that are the foundation of our regulatory system \n     and ensure fairness and due process for all affected \n     entities. H.R. 712 would provide necessary transparency to \n     the rulemaking process and preserve the ability of the public \n     to engage with their government.\n       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that \n     votes on H.R. 712, including procedural motions, may be \n     considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the \n     114th Congress.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Aric Newhouse,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                  Policy and Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly), my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished ranking member, \nmy friend from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).\n  I join the ranking member in opposing the so-called Sunshine for \nRegulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. Specifically, we take exception \nto the inclusion of the so-called All Economic Regulations are \nTransparent Act that would unnecessarily require agencies to provide \nmonthly status updates on their plans to propose and finalize rules \nwhen they are already required to report twice a year.\n  Further, this legislation would prohibit agency rules from taking \neffect until the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has \nposted certain information online for at least 6 months. So an agency \nmight post, on its own, information about the cost of a proposed rule \nfor a year, but if OIRA doesn't post the information for at least 6 \nmonths, the agency would be prohibited from moving forward.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings and I have an amendment that \nwill be considered shortly to strike the 6-month online posting \nrequirement. Striking that provision would keep important agency rules \nprotecting public health and safety from being needlessly delayed.\n  We have a Second Amendment that would exempt independent agencies. \nThe bill as currently drafted would require agencies, such as the SEC \nand the\n\n[[Page H128]]\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, to abide by these new reporting \nrequirements. Of course, these and other related agencies are not \nrequired to submit their rules for such reviews precisely because they \nare independent agencies and are intended as such.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Cummings-Connolly amendments, as \nwell as the amendment offered by Mr. Lynch that would require Federal \nagencies to provide an estimate of the benefits, as well as the costs, \nof proposed regulations.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill may be couched in the guise of improving \ntransparency, but let's be honest, its real intent is to erect barriers \nand significantly delay the regulatory process that protects the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Last Congress, the ALERT Act--which is part of this bill now--passed \nthe House twice with bipartisan support. Put simply, the ALERT Act \nprovides regulatory transparency requiring Federal agencies to provide \nmonthly updates on regulation expected to be implemented in the next \nyear.\n  That shouldn't be controversial. As the bill's author, Mr. Ratcliffe, \nindicated, transparency should not be a heavy lift. That is what we are \ntrying to provide. But that transparency is lacking. If you talk to \nsmall businesses and large businesses, you talk to citizens, you talk \nto advocacy groups, they will all tell you to one degree or another \nthat this is not necessarily crystal clear. They have had this problem \nand challenge. The Obama administration has shown a troubling tendency \nto minimize the amount of public attention.\n  The Fall 2015 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations, a document \ndisclosing regulations currently under consideration by Federal \nagencies, now contains more than 2,000 new regulations--2,000. By the \nadministration's own estimates, 144 of those regulations are expected \nto cost the public more than $100 million each--each. Not just one--\neach. You have got a universe of 2,000 regulations coming your way, \nAmerica--144 of those are going to cost you about $100 million apiece, \nand you don't even know what they are. We don't necessarily know what \nthey are.\n  That is why we think there should be disclosure. That is why they \ncall it the ALERT Act. It keeps the public informed about what Federal \nregulators are doing in their name and how much the regulations cost.\n  The bill requires the heads of Federal agencies to provide a monthly \nupdate, which is new. That seems reasonable. A monthly update to the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs with clear information \nabout each rule. OIRA is then required to publicly disclose on the \nInternet both the monthly updates and the annual review identifying the \ncosts of each regulation. That seems fair. It seems balanced. It seems \neasy to me.\n  I appreciate Mr. Ratcliffe and the good work that he has done \nbringing this to our attention and fighting for it.\n  I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time \nremains?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland has 4 minutes remaining. The \ngentleman from Utah has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is the second antiregulation bill the Republicans \nhave brought to the floor in 2 days.\n  Yesterday, we debated a bill that purported to cut bureaucracy by \ncreating a $30 million commission.\n  Today, we are debating a bill that purports to provide transparency \nbut, in fact, decreases transparency.\n  The bill directs the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to \npublish the total cost of all rules proposed or finalized without \ncounting any of the offsetting benefits. That is not transparency. That \nis misinformation.\n  The proponents of this bill want to focus exclusively on the costs of \nregulations because information about the benefits undercuts their \nnarrative. The bill's focus on the costs alone ignores the enormous \nbenefits that regulations can have. These benefits can be measured in \nterms of lives saved, injuries reduced, and even dollars gained.\n  In fact, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reported in \nOctober that the net annual benefits of major rules issued during the \nObama administration from 2009 to 2014 is some $215 billion. Agency \nrules save lives, improve health and safety, and protect our financial \nmarkets.\n  The provisions in this bill that would prevent rules from taking \neffect until certain information has been made available on the \nInternet for 6 months are an unnecessary and potentially dangerous \nroadblock. We don't need an arbitrary 6-month delay in putting in place \nrules--like high chair and crib safety standards--that protect our \nchildren.\n  This bill is also unnecessarily burdensome. For example, this bill \nwould require OIRA to provide a report on the number of rules and a \nlist of each rule for which a resolution of disapproval was introduced \nin either the House or Senate under section 802 of the Congressional \nReview Act. Under this requirement, the legislative branch would be \nrequiring the executive branch to report on the activities of the \nlegislative branch. That is not transparency. That is a waste of agency \nresources.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to vote against this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In conclusion, with all due respect, to suggest that it would be \noverwhelming to produce cost estimates and put them up on the Internet \non a monthly basis, we are asking for transparency, but imagine the \nburden that is also put on the American people. Some of these may be \nreally good ones. They may be really good regulations. But there may be \nsome that they haven't quite researched and that other companies, \norganizations, individuals, nonprofits, suddenly have to reconfigure \nfor. That takes some time. They need to know that things are coming. \nThat I think is a reasonable thing to do.\n  I, again, appreciate what Mr. Ratcliffe has been championing. I would \nurge the passage of this bill and the underlying bill as well.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  It has been years since Federal officials declared that the Great \nRecession had ended and recovery had begun. It has been years since the \nObama administration took office, promising to deliver prosperity and \nsecurity once more to our Nation.\n  We are now approaching American voters' next choice of leadership for \nthe United States. The Obama administration seeks to assure us that \ntimes are better and times are safer.\n  Workers, small-business owners, and Main Street families across our \nNation know better. America is still struggling to create enough new \njobs and economic growth to produce the prosperity and security \nAmericans need and deserve.\n  Unless Washington relents from adding unnecessarily to the nearly $2 \ntrillion in annual costs that Federal regulation imposes on our \neconomy, America's job creators and innovators will not be able to \ncreate the jobs and growth needed to produce a true new morning in \nAmerica.\n  Today's bill contains three measures sure to help remedy this \nsituation.\n  First, the bill offers strong reforms to attack a problem that lies \nbehind many of the costliest new regulations Washington issues each \nyear. That is the problem of sue and settle regulation.\n  Time and again, new, high-cost regulations are issued under consent \ndecrees and settlement agreements that force Federal agencies to issue \nnew rules. These decrees and settlements stem from deals between \nregulatory agencies and pro-regulatory plaintiffs. The plaintiffs \nseeking regulations sue and the agencies seeking help to regulate \nsettle, gaining the force of a judge's gavel to impose their will on \nthe economy.\n  Those to be regulated--our Nation's job creators--often do not know \nabout these deals until the plaintiffs' complaints and the proposed \ndecrees or settlements are filed in court. By then it is too late. \nRegulated businesses, state regulators, and other interested entities \nare unlikely to be able to intervene in the litigation. The court can\n\n[[Page H129]]\n\napprove the deals before regulated parties even have an opportunity to \ndetermine whether new regulatory costs will be imposed on them.\n  Title I of today's legislation, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees \nand Settlements Act, brings this abusive practice to an end. It assures \nthat those to be regulated have a fair opportunity to participate in \nthe resolution of litigation that affects them. It ensures that courts \nhave all of the information they need before they approve proposed \ndecrees and settlements. And it provides needed transparency on the \nways agencies conduct their business.\n  Title II of the bill rests on the same principle of transparency. \nEven when new regulations are not forced upon them by judicial decree, \nAmericans deserve to know what new regulations agencies plan to send \ntheir way. They deserve to know earlier and better what those new rules \nwill look like, how much they will cost, and when they may be imposed.\n  Armed with this information, America's small businesses and families \nwill be in a better position to respond to agency plans with better and \nmore timely comments on proposed regulations, and they will be better \nand more timely able to bring to Congress' attention concerns about \nplanned regulation they believe is unnecessary, too costly, or \nineffective.\n  Title II of the bill, the ALERT Act, accomplishes just that. It \nreforms disclosure requirements for upcoming rules by requiring more \ndetails to be disclosed and by requiring the publication of monthly, \nonline updates of information on the rules' schedules, costs, and \neconomic effects, including jobs impacts.\n  Finally, title III of the bill, the Providing Accountability Through \nTransparency Act, helps to fix one of the most maddening things Main \nStreet Americans and small-business owners across the Nation confront. \nNot only do Federal regulators issue too many regulations that cost too \nmuch, too often those regulations are impossible for an ordinary \ncitizen to understand.\n  Title III offers a welcome remedy by requiring each agency to publish \nan online, 100-word summary of any new proposed regulation.\n  What a concept--state in clear, simple, and short terms for the \nAmerican people just what Federal regulators propose to do. State it in \nterms that don't require help from a lawyer to understand. And state it \nonline every time a new regulation is proposed.\n  All of the legislation in this bill is sure to help Americans who are \nbesieged and bewildered by the flood of new regulations flowing every \nday from Washington's regulatory bureaucracy.\n  I thank Representatives Collins, Ratcliffe, and Luetkemeyer for \nintroducing each piece of legislation the bill contains. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. CONYERS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 712, \nthe Sunshine in Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act.\n  This measure is comprised of three bills, each of which, from my \nperspective, is thoroughly flawed.\n  To begin with, title I of this bill, consisting of the text of the \nSunshine and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015, has a \nsimple goal: to discourage the use of settlement agreements and consent \ndecrees and to thereby prevent critical Federal regulatory actions from \nbeing implemented.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Title I accomplishes this goal by giving opponents of regulation \nmultiple opportunities to stifle rulemaking. With respect to a civil \naction enforcing an agency's responsibility to undertake a regulatory \naction, such as to promulgate a rulemaking, title I essentially \nauthorizes any third party who is affected by such regulatory action to \nintervene in that civil action, subject to rebuttal; to participate in \nsettlement negotiations; and to submit public comments about a proposed \nconsent decree or settlement agreement that agencies would then be \nrequired to respond to.\n  In addition, title I mandates that agencies provide for public \ncomment on a proposed consent decree, and it requires agencies to \nrespond to all such comments before the consent decree can be entered \nin court.\n  As a result, an agency would be forced to go through two public \ncomment periods, one for the consent decree and one for the rulemaking \nthat results from the consent decree, doubling the agency's effort and \ntime before a regulation could be finalized.\n  Like nearly all of the anti-regulatory bills we have considered to \ndate over the last two Congresses, this measure piles on procedural \nrequirements for agencies and courts.\n  By delaying regulatory protections, title I jeopardizes public health \nand safety. This explains why a broad consortium of more than 150 \norganizations strenuously opposes this measure. These organizations \ninclude the Natural Resources Defense Council, the American Civil \nLiberties Union, the NAACP, the Sierra Club, and Earthjustice, among \nother groups.\n  Title II of H.R. 712 consists of the text of H.R. 1759, the All \nEconomic Regulations are Transparent Act of 2015, or the ALERT Act of \n2015. This measure would impose an arbitrary 6-month delay before \nvirtually any new rule could go into effect with only limited \nexceptions.\n  Clearly, the bill fails to take into account a vast array of time-\nsensitive rules, ranging from the mundane, such as the many United \nStates Coast Guard bridge closing regulations, to particularly critical \nregulations that protect public health and safety.\n  Another troubling aspect of title II is that it specifically \nprohibits the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs--the \nexecutive branch agency charged with policymaking for Federal \nregulatory agencies--from taking into account the benefits of \nregulations when providing total cost estimates for proposed and final \nrules. Thus, a regulation that costs only $1 but that results in $1 \nbillion in benefits would only be reported as costing $1. Such a \nmisleading and unbalanced report could hardly promote transparency.\n  Finally, title III, consisting of H.R. 690, the Providing \nAccountability Through Transparency Act of 2015, would require a notice \nof proposed rulemaking that is published in the Federal Register to \ninclude an Internet link to a plain language, 100-word summary of the \nrule.\n  As with the other provisions in H.R. 712, title III creates a further \nopportunity for opponents of regulation to slow down a proposed \nrulemaking, and rather than promoting transparency, title III could \nengender confusion about the substance of such rulemaking.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nRegulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, on multiple occasions before, I have \ndiscussed the overwhelming burden of the regulatory state on American \nworkers and employers. For the past year, it has been my primary \nobjective, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial and Antitrust Law, to bring to light these burdens and their \ntrue costs on the lives of all Americans.\n  The burden of Federal regulations already amounts to 21 percent of \nthe average company's payroll. How can employers plan for the future \nwhen the specter of new regulations, meaning additional costs, hangs \nover their planning? The regulatory process itself and some current \ngovernment practices make this more difficult.\n  These bills are critical as we work to improve the regulatory process \nand to prevent misguided and damaging regulatory overreach. These \npieces of legislation grant clarity and transparency to the regulatory \nprocess.\n  I spent the first part of my life working my way up the chain in \nmanufacturing. I worked in a factory. When I became a manager, I saw \nthe complex considerations that went into hiring, expansion, and \nwhether we could keep the lights on.\n  We did not have a crystal ball to help us there. We had to look at \nour revenues and at our costs and make assumptions for the future. And, \nyes, current and future regulations played a role there, too.\n\n[[Page H130]]\n\n  That was over 30 years ago. Now the regulatory state and the burdens \non business operators and on those who try to go into business have \ngrown by frightening magnitudes.\n  This bill's sue and settle legislation will ensure that regulators \nand outside groups can no longer conspire to change or to implement \nregulations in secret or through judicial decree.\n  The transparency provisions of the ALERT Act reinforce these measures \nby mandating more frequent and detailed disclosures that will allow \nbusinesses to anticipate the hurdles they will face down the road.\n  To those Members who introduced these pieces of legislation, I thank \nthem for their attention and effort in lessening the regulatory burdens \non all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015.\n  Rather than bringing sunshine into the rulemaking process, it throws \nan after-midnight shade on this process. In fact, the Sunshine for \nRegulatory Decrees and Settlements Act pulls the plug on regulations \nthat are in place to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the \npeople.\n  This misnomered legislation should be renamed the ``Bedtime for \nConsent Decrees and Settlements Act.'' Another great name is the \n``Leave Volkswagen Alone Act.''\n  Title I of H.R. 712 imposes numerous burdensome procedural \nrequirements on agencies and courts, requirements that are designed to \nhamstring and to ultimately prevent the use of consent decrees and \nsettlements that ensure the enforcement of the law.\n  Proponents of this provision argue that it is necessary because \nFederal agencies collude with pro-regulatory plaintiffs to advance a \nmutually agreed-upon regulatory agenda through the use of consent \ndecrees and settlement agreements.\n  According to my Republican colleagues, this so-called sue and settle \nlitigation specifically allows agencies to skirt the requirements of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act to dictate the contents of an agency \nrulemaking or to bind agency action. Sadly, however, the majority has \nnot put forth a single dust particle of credible evidence to support \nthis claim.\n  To the contrary, consent decrees and settlement agreements are \nimportant tools in ensuring the timely compliance with statutory \ndeadlines that have been put in place by Congress to protect the \nenvironment and the public's health and safety.\n  In fact, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, reported in \nDecember of 2014 that there is zero evidence indicating that agencies \ncollude with public interest groups in bringing these consent decrees, \nas the majority has often alleged.\n  In its report, the GAO referred to these lawsuits as ``deadline \nsuits'' because they simply compel agencies to take statutorily \nrequired actions within a designated timeframe.\n  The GAO also found little evidence that deadline suits determine the \nsubstantive outcome of agency action because agency officials stated \nthat they have not and would never agree to settlements in a deadline \nsuit that finalize the substantive outcome of the rulemaking or declare \nthe substance of the final rule.\n  Earlier this year, Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate for \nPublic Citizen, also clarified during the legislative hearing on H.R. \n712: ``All of the settlements scrutinized by GAO pursuant to the EPA's \nrulemaking authority under the Clean Air Act went through the public \nnotice and comment process, allowing all members of the public an \nopportunity to comment on the rule before it is finalized.''\n  This finding confirms that there is no credible evidence supporting \nthe proposition that Federal agencies engage in backroom deals with \npro-regulatory groups in order to circumvent the EPA or to \nsubstantively bind the Agency in a subsequent rulemaking.\n  In the absence of actual evidence of collusion between Federal \nagencies and plaintiffs, H.R. 712 addresses a nonexistent problem \nthrough a series of requirements that are designed to undermine the \nrule of law by preventing the enforcement of statutes that have been \npassed by Congress to protect the public and that are designed to slow \ndown agency action and bust the door wide open to almost anyone who \nwants to impede agency action by intervening in these actions.\n  Now, is it the working people, small-business owners, or retirees who \nare asking for this kind of relief from regulations that protect the \nhealth, safety, and well-being of them? No. It is not the people. It is \nthe big corporations that want this legislation to pass.\n  For example, H.R. 712 would allow for nearly any private party to \nintervene in a consent decree, revealing the legislation's true \npurpose, which is to stack the deck in the industry's favor in order to \navoid the enforcement of the law.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the only reason for the \nunprecedented delay in agency rulemaking--the so-called diminishing \ntransparency of the regulatory process--is that my Republican \ncolleagues have argued that regulatory transparency is not important \nwith regard to public participation in the rulemaking process.\n  In a recent rulemaking process, millions of Americans commented on a \nsingle proposed rulemaking. It represented the largest public response \nin history to any request for public comment in a Federal rulemaking. \nJust last year alone, this extensive activity hardly suggests an agency \nprocess that is shrouded in secrecy and in need of reform.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  So with there being no evidence that consent decrees and settlements \nare collusion between Federal agencies and pro-human interest groups, \nthere simply is no need for this legislation.\n  I would ask my colleagues to vote against this, to vote it down.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who is one of the chief sponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for working \nwith us on this piece of legislation.\n  If there is one thing that I hear most often from my constituents, it \nis the onslaught of Federal regulations to keep up, let alone \ninterpret. Our constituents should not need a law degree or employ an \narmy of consultants and accountants to understand the rules they are \nrequired to follow. Unfortunately, they do, which is why I am pleased \nthe legislation we consider today addresses the lack of regulatory \ntransparency and accountability.\n  Title III of H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and \nSettlements Act of 2015, includes language from a bill that I \nintroduced earlier this Congress. That bill, the Providing \nAccountability Through Transparency Act, provides a bipartisan and \ncommonsense reform to afford the American people straightforward and \ncomprehensive access to rules proposed by our executive branch.\n  Since enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946, Federal \nagencies have been required to keep the public informed of proposed \nrules and regulations. This law has provided an avenue for the public \nto access rules and regulations drafted across government agencies. \nNevertheless, given their technical nature, it can be extremely \ndifficult to fully understand proposals unless one is an expert in that \nfield.\n  To help address this issue and promote government transparency and \naccessibility, title III of the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and \nSettlements Act of 2015 will require each Federal agency, when \nproviding notice of a proposed rulemaking, to produce a Web link to a \n100-word, plain-language summary of the proposal. Accordingly, this \nrequirement will provide access to regulations in a more clear and \nconsistent manner.\n  Moreover, this reasonable proposal has already proven its \neffectiveness in my home State of Missouri. After hearing from local \nschool districts and administrators struggling to implement State \nregulations for Common Core, the State enacted a measure requiring\n\n[[Page H131]]\n\neach agency to provide online-accessible, plain-language summaries of \nproposed State regulations. Since enactment, the statute has been an \nexceptional resource for Missouri localities, schools, organizations, \nand citizens. I think it would be just the same here for us here at the \nFederal level as well.\n  Just by looking at the daily copy of the Federal Register, which I \njust happen to have here from Monday, December 28, it is a 519-page \ncopy.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Dold). The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. MARINO. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I thank the gentleman for the additional time.\n  Basically, we have got 518 rules in one day, 18 pages of rules in one \nday. I think it is important that our citizens have access to these \nrules in a way that they can understand and a form they can access.\n  I certainly urge its support. I thank the good chairman for his hard \nwork on H.R. 712.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, my main concern with this bill is the \nprovision that would prevent a new regulation from taking effect until \nit has been available online for at least 6 months after the already \nexhaustive public notice and comment period that is required of new \nregulations. This may be a well-intended procedure, but it could \npotentially harm the very people that are in need of protection under \nsome of the rules being promulgated.\n  I know there is an exemption that may relate to health and safety \nthat could include a Presidential action, but it requires us to know of \nan impending threat in order for that procedure to be utilized.\n  I am thinking about what happened in my own hometown of Flint, \nMichigan, where people cannot wait 6 months for the Lead and Copper \nRule, for example, which is under review right now, to be modified. Due \nto mismanagement by the State government and the weakness in the Safe \nDrinking Water Act's Lead and Copper Rule, thousands of children in \nFlint, Michigan, have been exposed to dangerous lead. Lead exposure is \nnot good for anyone, but it is particularly dangerous for young \nchildren.\n  According to the CDC, lead exposure is one of the most dangerous \nneurotoxins. It has wide-ranging impacts affecting IQ. There are \nbehavioral implications. There are developmental implications for the \ncentral nervous system.\n  It is heartbreaking, then, to see, as a result of the failure to \nadequately supply support in regulation to drinking water programs, \nthat levels of lead in my own hometown have poisoned children. Changes \nto the Lead and Copper Rule, which I have participated in and are \nunderway right now, could have prevented this. Right now, as a matter \nof fact, those changes are pending.\n  If this legislation is passed, basically what we are saying to the \npeople of Flint and other potential communities that could have lead \nexposure is that we have to wait another 6 months for that protection, \n6 more months potentially of dangerous lead leaching into the pipes, \ngoing into the bodies of young children.\n  This notion that regulation is always wrong and always bad--I know \nthat is not the position that is taken--but the effect of this \nlegislation would be to slow down the regulatory process, very often \nregulations that need to be changed, need to be adjusted to provide \nessential protections to public health.\n  The notion that we are supposed to somehow know that an imminent \nthreat is present and allow this expedited process that is anticipated \nin this legislation belies logic. They didn't know, until after blood \nlevels showed increased lead levels in children, that such a problem \nexisted.\n  When we know that there are necessary changes, when the EPA, through \nits process, as they have done with the Lead and Copper Rule, know that \nthere are ways to improve the protection to kids, we ought to implement \nthose regulations as soon as we possibly can.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, right now there is probably a group \nof folks down the street at a large oak table in a marble palace, \nnibbling on their $16 Federal muffins, drinking their lattes, typing on \ntheir new iPads regulations. They are the regulators. The very term \nbrings fear and trepidation into the hearts of people who work for a \nliving.\n  Meanwhile, 14 million Americans are sitting at their old kitchen \ntable, drinking coffee from their Mr. Coffee pot with no job on the \nhorizon.\n  Small-business owners constantly say that complying with government \nregulations is the biggest economic problem they face, even more so \nthan the Federal income tax. Bear in mind that we have the highest \ncorporate income tax in the world.\n  Some businesses pack up their bags and even move to places like \nChina. Meanwhile, the U.S. regulators are putting businesses out of \nbusiness.\n  Now, Congress created the regulators, so Congress needs to fix the \nproblem with the regulators. H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory \nDecrees and Settlements Act of 2015, takes a number of commonsense \napproaches and puts a check on the regulators.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are 175,000 pages of regulations. Do you really \nthink we need that many regulations?\n  One of the most important provisions of this bill is it will require \nthe executive branch to make semiannual and annual disclosures about \nplanned regulations.\n  A lot of times, the regulators don't have any idea of the economic \ncosts of their decisions and what they will have on the American \neconomy. Many of them have never worked in private industry. They have \nnever been to the States that they are trying to regulate. This bill \nwill force the regulators to determine the cost of their actions before \nthey take action.\n  These disclosures will help American job creators so they can plan \nfor the impacts of the new regulations on their budgets, hiring, and \noperations.\n  I urge support of this logical piece of legislation. Congress needs \nto rein in and regulate the regulators.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot), a member of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of \nthe Small Business Subcommittee.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this bill \nand commend my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for his leadership \non this very important issue.\n  We all know that small businesses are the foundation of our economy, \ncreating 7 out of every 10 new jobs in the American economy. That is \nhow many jobs are created by small businesses\n  Mr. Chairman, we also hear from small businesses from all over \nAmerica, from our own congressional districts, that new and old \nregulatory burdens continue to make it more difficult for them to \nexpand, grow, and create more jobs.\n  The Constitution gives us the duty in the House of Representatives to \nprovide for the general welfare. If we allow this scheme of sue and \nsettle litigation to continue suppressing economic and job growth, we \nare not doing our duty.\n  What is this sue and settle that we are talking about? Well, very \nquickly, it refers to when a Federal agency agrees to a settlement \nagreement in a lawsuit from special interest groups, oftentimes groups \non the left, to create priorities and rules outside of the normal \nrulemaking process. The agency intentionally relinquishes statutory \ndiscretion by committing to timelines and priorities that often realign \nagency duties.\n  Now, when agencies enter into consent decrees or settlement \nagreements and agree to issue new regulations, the rulemaking process \nis shortchanged. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I am \nparticularly concerned that agencies are not adequately analyzing the \nimpacts of new rules on small businesses, as is required by the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act. That is existing law. This results in \nunnecessary and costly regulatory burdens and disproportionately \nimpacts small businesses, the job generators of this country.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n\n[[Page H132]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, when mankind first came upon \nthis planet, I guess we were in caves and cavemen didn't have many \nrules. It was only the strong who survived. It was every man for \nhimself. There were no morals about things, whether or not it is right \nor wrong. It is just a matter of your own personal survival. That was \ncaveman thinking, and, unfortunately, we still have caveman thinking in \nthe 21st century because we have a crowd that says that we should not \nhave any rules of human conduct.\n  Isn't it a fact that America is what it is now because of the rules \nthat have been put in place to foster prosperity and freedom? That is \nwhat our government has done. It has been government of, by, and for \nthe people.\n  There has been a movement over the last 30, 40 years to turn people \nagainst government. This mantra is that government is too big, we don't \nneed any rules to govern human conduct, let everything work itself out, \nand the free market system will make it rain for everybody.\n  Well, we have seen, after 30, 40 years of practicing that free market \nway of thinking, that it doesn't work. Here we are still trying to cut \nthe rules that guarantee the health, safety, and well-being of working \npeople, of small business, of elderly people, and children.\n  This is what this legislation is about, is gutting the rulemaking \nprocess. This is one of many attempts, incessant attempts, by my \nfriends on the other side to try to cut government so that their \nfriends in big business on Wall Street can make it rain for the rest of \nus. They don't make it rain for anybody but themselves. They put all of \nthe profits in their pockets. They become billionaires. We have had a \nshift of wealth away from the middle class and working people in this \ncountry. Let's stop it from happening.\n  Oppose this misguided legislation, H.R. 712.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert), a member of the Judiciary Committee\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and also the committee I am on, Natural Resources. This has \nbeen an ongoing issue, particularly in Natural Resources, when we come \nto the sue and settle situation.\n  I appreciate my friend from Georgia pointing out that there are \ngroups that don't want rules, that are just out for themselves. I, too, \nwas against the Occupy Wall Street anarchy that was attempted.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  I have never stood here in support of Wall Street. I fought the Wall \nStreet bailout tooth and nail when friends on the other side of the \naisle, many of them, were supporting it. Both sides of the aisle \nsupported it. I am not standing here for Wall Street. I am standing \nhere for fairness for American citizens across the country. That is \nwhat most people in both parties want. They want fairness.\n  Here is a report that the tactic of sue and settle ``reached a zenith \nin Fish and Wildlife's 2011 mega-settlement with the Center for \nBiological Diversity, WildEarth Guardians, and other green groups over \nthe species act. That agreement allowed Fish and Wildlife to claim it \nmust take action on some 750 species covered by 85 legal actions. The \ndeal's immediate effect was to tee up 250 species for full protection, \nincluding sweeping `critical habitat' designations that will restrict \ncommercial or other use of millions of acres of private property.''\n  The problem is, when the judicial system is abused, and as a former \nlitigator, judge, and chief justice, I know when litigants come before \nthe court and they say, ``We have reached an agreement, and here it \nis,'' then the judge's hands are normally tied, sign off on the \nagreement; but when it is a sympathetic group wanting to take away \nprivate property rights from private property owners, when they \nthemselves have done nothing to produce or make that land profitable, \nto do so unfairly without proper notice by going behind the landowner's \nback, filing a suit with a sympathetic agency like Fish and Wildlife, \nhaving the agreed judgment signed, and then all of a sudden the most \naffected people were not given notice, they have their property rights \ntaken away.\n  I realize there were groups like Occupy Wall Street that don't want \nanybody having private property rights. Look, the Pilgrims tried it. It \ndoesn't work when you just have a socialist system, share and share \nalike, because when you pay people the same thing to work and not work, \nthen eventually people quit working.\n  This bill is about fairness. What is wrong with giving notice to all \nof the people involved and letting them participate? That is the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I am ready to close, and I yield myself \nthe balance of my time.\n  Members, H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and \nSettlements Act, would establish a 6-month moratorium on new \nregulations, with limited exception, significantly delaying the \nrulemaking process by which agencies ensure that Americans are \nprotected from serious harm, such as dirty air and water and unsafe \nproducts and reckless behavior by large financial institutions.\n  Not surprisingly, the White House has already issued a strong veto \nthreat. The administration warns that H.R. 712 would undermine critical \npublic health and safety protections, introduce needless complexity and \nuncertainty in agency decisionmaking, and interfere with agency \nperformance statutory mandates.\n  There is simply no basis to support this ill-conceived legislation. \nAccordingly, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in opposing H.R. 712.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that \nthis bill will make it too hard for Washington bureaucrats to regulate \nand too cumbersome for Washington agencies to tell the American people \nwhat the agencies are up to. You might say they are claiming that this \nbill creates so much sunshine on our new regulations that Washington's \nregulators will get sunburned if the bill is enacted.\n  In the Obama administration's pen and phone era of encroaching on \nAmericans' liberties, that much new sunshine is a good thing. In the \nObama administration's era of regulatory dictates that crush new jobs \nand prevent higher wages, the new sunshine is desperately needed.\n  A central reason why the Obama administration has failed to deliver \nprosperity and security to our Nation is the administration's \nunprecedented avalanche of new and costly regulations. This regulatory \nonslaught is the big reason why we have just concluded 8 years of zero \nreal wage growth for America's workers and families. It is a critical \nreason why 94 million Americans above the age of 16 are out of the \nworkforce. It is an unmistakable reason why we are still missing the \nalmost 6 million more new jobs Americans would have had if the so-\ncalled Obama recovery had just been as strong as the average recovery \nsince World War II.\n  This bill combats the Obama administration's regulatory assault on \njobs and wages with commonsense measures we all should support. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in voting for this bill to help deliver new \njobs and better wages to America's workers and families.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition \nto H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. \nRather than a good-faith effort to improve our regulatory process, this \nbill would add unworkable new requirements on federal agencies that \ncould impede critical efforts to safeguard public health, the \nenvironment, and other national priorities.\n  I was pleased, however, that this bill includes provisions from the \nProviding Accountability Through Transparency Act (H.R. 690), which I \nintroduced with my colleague Rep. Luetkemeyer. This bipartisan proposal \nwould ensure that new federal rules include a brief, plain-language \nsummary so that the public can better understand the proposed action. \nWhile I cannot support H.R. 712, I hope that we can continue to work \nacross the aisle on this commonsense initiative that will enhance \npublic understanding of important federal efforts in public health, \nconsumer rights, environmental protection, and other areas.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n\n[[Page H133]]\n\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of the Rules Committee Print 114-37. \nThat amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as \nread.\n  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as \nfollows:\n\n                                H.R. 712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1.

In \n     the case of such a rule, consent decree, or settlement \n     agreement, the provisions of law amended by this Act shall \n     apply as though such amendments had not been made.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity \nto speak in support of my amendment to H.R. 712.\n  H.R. 712 would significantly delay and possibly stop the Federal \nrulemaking process by making it easier for regulated industries and \nwell-funded\n\n[[Page H136]]\n\nantiregulatory entities to delay or prevent agency action and \nprohibiting any rule from being finalized until certain information is \nposted online for 6 months.\n  This assault on the regulations is based on the false premise that \nFederal regulation stifles economic growth and job creation. My \namendment confronts this fallacious assumption by excepting from H.R. \n712 all rules that the Office of Management and Budget determines would \nresult in net job creation.\n  As with many other deregulatory bills we have considered this \nCongress, the proponents of H.R. 712 argue that it will grow the \neconomy, create jobs, and increase America's competitiveness \ninternationally, but we cannot pretend that this politicized \nlegislation is about economic growth or American prosperity.\n  As I have noted during the consideration of each of the \nantiregulatory bills that we have considered in the 114th Congress, \nthere is simply no credible evidence in support of the reiteration of \nso-called job-killing regulations undermining economic growth. Zero. \nThe latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that \nunemployment has fallen to 5 percent despite Republican obstruction of \neverything that Democrats have put forward that would grow the economy.\n  While there is more work to do to grow the economy and help our \nNation's middle class, there have been 69 straight months of private \nsector job growth. That is 13.7 million private sector jobs created \namidst a regulatory system that is pro-worker, pro-environment, pro-\npublic health, and pro-innovation.\n  And to those who would brush aside these strong employment figures, \nthe Department of Labor has also reported that claims for unemployment \nbenefits have dropped to the lowest levels in over 40 years.\n  While I would submit that regulations passed during the Obama \nadministration have had a largely positive effect on sustainable \neconomic growth, the reality is that there is little correlation \nbetween regulations and the economy.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Take the word of the San Francisco \nand New York Federal Reserve Banks, which found zero correlation \nbetween employment and regulation. Take the word of The Washington \nPost, which gave two Pinocchios to industry estimates of the cost of \nregulations earlier this year. Take the word of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service, which has debunked claims that \nregulations have a trillion-dollar cost to the economy.\n  Mr. Chairman, we need real solutions to help real people, not another \nthinly veiled handout to large corporations. I ask that my colleagues \nsupport my amendment to protect jobs.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I share the gentleman's concerns about the \nimpact of regulations on jobs, but I submit that the right way to \naddress that concern is to join me in supporting the bill.\n  The bill includes transparency requirements sure to increase public \npressure on agencies to make sure that contemplated new regulations do \nnot have unnecessary, adverse impacts on job creation. To exempt \nregulations from that pressure would make our regulatory system less \nprotective of jobs, not more. Indeed, the gentleman's amendment would \ngive the executive branch a powerful incentive to manipulate its jobs \nimpact and cost-benefit analyses to give false impressions that avoid \nthe requirements of the bill.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  The amendment also puts the cart before the horse. It offers carve-\nouts from the bill based on factors that cannot be determined \nadequately before important analytical requirements in existing \nstatutes and executive orders governing the rulemaking process are \napplied in the first place.\n  Specific provisions in the bill--for example, judicial review \nprovisions in title I for proposed consent decrees and settlement \nagreements--are designed to protect the proper application of those \nanalytical requirements.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, they talk about all of the \nregulations that have been promulgated during the Obama administration \nas if the Obama administration is the only administration that has \npromulgated rules of conduct.\n  Certainly we have had rules associated with the unveiling of the very \nsuccessful Affordable Care Act. There were a lot of rules put into \nplace to prevent insurance companies from taking advantage of people.\n  Preexisting conditions are outlawed. All of these are regulations \nthat were associated with the Affordable Care Act. We have parents \nbeing able to keep their kids on their insurance up to the age of 26 \nand no discrimination between men and women.\n  Those were rules that have stimulated jobs in America because 22 \nmillion people who did not have access to the healthcare system now \nhave access to it. More jobs have arisen because of that. That is a \ndirect result of regulations.\n  The same thing with Dodd-Frank, which protects people from Wall \nStreet overreach. Those rules have created opportunities for small \nbusinesses to come in and start creating real jobs in America.\n  So rules are good for our society. This legislation cuts that ability \nto create wealth for everyone else. So I would ask that this amendment \nbe approved by my colleagues.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the arguments on both sides have been \ncreative, at the very least, but I would like to bring to everyone's \nattention an article by the National Association of Manufacturers, \nwhich is in very simple figures.\n  This is a survey of manufacturers: ``What would you do with funds \ncurrently allocated to Federal regulatory compliance?'' Sixty-three \npercent said they would invest. 22 percent said they would invest in \nemployee initiatives, creating jobs.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Cummings\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 16, strike the table of sections for chapter 6A of \n     title 5, United States Code, as inserted by section 202(a) of \n     the bill, and insert the following:\n\n``651.

Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My amendment, cosponsored by Government Operations Subcommittee \nRanking Member Gerry Connolly, would strike the 6-month moratorium on \nrules imposed by the bill.\n  Title II of this bill prohibits an agency rule from taking effect \nuntil 6\n\n[[Page H137]]\n\nmonths after agencies submit information the bill requires to the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs and that office posts this \ninformation on the Internet.\n  Under the bill, if the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nfails to post any of the required information, a rule would be \nprohibited from taking effect. This is an arbitrary moratorium.\n  The bill allows for only two exceptions. One exception is if the \nagency exempts a rule from the notice and comment requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. The other exception is if the President \nissues an executive order requiring a rule to take effect.\n  This bill covers all agency rulemakings, including rules needed to \nprotect our health, safety, and our environment. For example, this bill \nwould cover rules like the one recently published by the Department of \nJustice that clarifies who is responsible for reporting to law \nenforcement that a gun has been lost or stolen in transit.\n  Our country doesn't need an unnecessary 6-month delay in putting in \nplace a commonsense safety rule like this one. The bill's 6-month \nmoratorium exposes this bill for what it really is, which is a way to \ndelay agency rules. My amendment would remove this provision in the \nunderlying bill.\n  I urge all Members to adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, as Federal regulatory agencies attempt to \npile more and more regulatory burdens on America's struggling workers, \nfamilies, and small businesses, the least we can ask is that they be \ntransparent about it.\n  What could be more transparent than requiring them on a monthly \nbasis, online, to update the public with realtime information about \nwhat new regulations are coming and how much they will cost?\n  Once they have that information, affected individuals and job \ncreators will be able to plan and budget meaningfully for new costs \nthey may have to absorb. If they are denied that information, they will \nonly be blindsided. That is not fair.\n  Title II of the bill makes sure this information is provided to the \npublic. To provide a strong incentive to agencies to honor its \nrequirements, title II prohibits new regulations from becoming \neffective unless agencies provide transparent information online for 6 \nmonths preceding the regulation's issuance.\n  The amendment seeks to eliminate that incentive. Without an incentive \nlike that in existing law, what have we seen from the Obama \nadministration? Repeated failures to make disclosures required by \nstatute and executive order, including the administration's year-long \nhiding of the ball on new regulations during the 2012 election cycle.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, again, I would urge Members to vote in \nfavor of this amendment. Again, we have a situation here where this 6-\nmonth moratorium is another way of blocking the rulemaking process.\n  I think it is very unfortunate in this time. I think, if we are \ntalking about transparency, we need to be transparent about why we have \nthis moratorium. The fact is that it is an effort to stop important \nrulemakings from taking place.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I have some information I would like to \nbring to the attention of the Members. It is a document from Investor's \nBusiness Daily. It is a very simple statement, but it is a very large \nfact: If we had a Reagan-paced job recovery, we would today have at \nleast 12 million more Americans working.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Lynch\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 12, strike ``and''.\n       Page 18, line 21, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 18, after line 21, insert the following:\n       ``(D) any estimate of the benefits of the rule.\n       Page 20, after line 21, insert the following:\n       ``(E) The total benefits of all rules proposed or \n     finalized, and the number of rules for which an estimate of \n     the benefits of the rule was not available.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My amendment would improve title II of H.R. 712 to ensure that the \neffectiveness of agency regulations are not solely evaluated by the \nbasis of the cost to industry.\n  Rather, the primary importance of agency rulemaking to the improved \nhealth, safety, and security of the American people demands that we \nalso consider the significant benefits of agency regulations in \nanalyzing whether or not they contribute to protecting the public and \npromoting the general welfare.\n  In particular, my amendment would require Federal agencies to provide \nan estimate of the individual benefits of a proposed regulation, just \nas H.R. 712 currently requires them to report individual regulatory \ncosts.\n  This amendment would also require the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs to include the total benefits of proposed and final \nagency rules in the annual report that it would be required to issue \nunder H.R. 712.\n  In its current form, the underlying bill expressly provides that the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs must publish only the \ntotal cost of all proposed and finalized agency rules without reducing \nthe cost by any offsetting benefits in its calculation of the \ncumulative cost of agency regulations.\n  Not surprisingly, the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards has issued a \nformal opposition letter to the language that is included as title II \nof H.R. 712. The Coalition is an alliance of over 150 businesses, \nconsumer protection, labor, environmental, and good government groups \nthat includes the American Sustainable Business Council and its 200,000 \nmember businesses.\n  According to the Coalition: ``This bill's one-sided focus on \nregulatory costs provides a highly distorted picture of the value of \ncritical safeguards that all Americans depend on . . . By focusing \nexclusively on regulatory costs, this bill gives the misleading \nimpression that regulations are an inescapable drain on the American \neconomy.''\n  The recent draft report of the costs and benefits of major Federal \nregulations issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nin October 2015 serves to further illustrate the transparency that is \nlacking when we only consider the costs associated with an agency \nregulation.\n  Among its principal findings, the report provides that, from October \n2004 through September 2014, spanning both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, Federal agencies estimated the aggregate benefits of \nmajor Federal regulations to range between $216 billion and $812 \nbillion. In stark contrast, the approximate annual cost of major \nFederal regulations ranges between $57 billion and $85 billion.\n  Importantly, several Clean Air rules promulgated by the Environmental \nProtection Agency's Office of Air and Radiation have significantly high \nestimated benefits that are attributable to the reduction in public \nexposure to air pollutants.\n\n[[Page H138]]\n\n  According to the report, the Clean Air Fine Particle Rule of 2007 had \nbenefits ranging from $19 billion to $167 billion per year. These \nregulatory benefits would not be considered under H.R. 712.\n  Other health and safety rules were similarly identified as having a \nsizable benefit on the American people. Patient safety rules that \naddress dietary supplement oversight, medical error, and safety \nrequirements for long-term care facilities had estimated benefits \nbetween $13 billion and $17 billion per year.\n  Transportation-related safety rules designed to reduce the risk of \ninjury and death associated with airplane, vehicle, and train travel \nhad estimated benefits of between $16 billion and $28 billion per year. \nThese regulatory benefits would not be considered under H.R. 712, as \ncurrently drafted.\n  Mr. Chairman, if our goal is to maximize transparency in the \nregulatory process, we can't simply give the American people and this \nCongress one side of the story.\n  Rather, full transparency and informed decisionmaking require that \nour analysis does not only include the regulatory costs, but also the \nextent to which an agency bill improves and protects the health, \nsafety, and security of the American people. My amendment would ensure \nthat this was the case.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. Chairman, it is the primary mission of every Federal agency to \nprotect the American public from harmful and developing situations, \nwhether we are talking about a new prescription painkiller on the \nmarket that the FDA finds to be highly addictive, or an emerging \nfinancial practice that the Securities and Exchange Commission \ndetermines is predatory on American consumers, or dangerous materials \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency deems to be an imminent public \nhazard.\n  That public mission is severely undermined if the merits of an agency \nregulation are evaluated solely on the basis of costs to the industry \nand at the expense of the significant benefits to the American people.\n  Again, in closing, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. I welcome the gentleman's belief that new regulations can \nactually create benefits. I also share the gentleman's interest in \nensuring that the public ultimately knows what those benefits are.\n  The bill, however, does nothing to restrict or prevent the \npublication of information about the benefits of new rules. It is \nintended to address what has been lacking in administration \npublications about new rules: accurate, real-time information about the \ntrue nature, timing, and cost of new rules.\n  That information is essential to those who must bear the burden of \nthe rules so that they can plan, hire, and budget consistent with \nimpending new legal requirements.\n  Furthermore, the gentleman's amendment would needlessly expose new \nregulations to the bill's enforcement provisions, delaying promulgation \nof beneficial rules simply because pre-promulgation statements and \nexpected benefits were lacking.\n  Mr. Chairman, I constantly spend time in my district in factories \nbecause I came from manufacturing, talking to small-business people, \nand the number one issue concerning their livelihoods and others is \noverregulation crushing jobs for middle class Americans.\n  As a result, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nMassachusetts will be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Foxx\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-388.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 18, line 14, insert after ``including'' the following: \n     ``the imposition of unfunded mandates and''.\n       Page 20, line 19, insert after ``or finalized,'' the \n     following: ``the total cost of any unfunded mandates imposed \n     by all such rules,''.\n       Page 22, line 24, insert after ``section 551'' the \n     following: ``, and the term `unfunded mandate' has the \n     meaning given the term `Federal mandate' in section 421(6) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 658(6)).''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, this amendment to title II, the ALERT Act, \nensures that agencies and OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs, OIRA, report the cost of unfunded mandates imposed through the \nregulatory process.\n  Federal agencies can advance government initiatives without using \nFederal taxpayer dollars by issuing regulations that pass compliance \ndown to State and local governments and to private businesses. These \ncostly mandates make it harder for companies to hire and for cash-\nstrapped States, counties, and cities to keep streets safe and parks \nclean.\n  My amendment requires agencies to include in their monthly reports to \nOIRA whether rules in the pipeline impose unfunded mandates, and \nrequires OIRA to include in its annual cumulative assessment of new \nregulations the total cost of unfunded mandates imposed by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This amendment will not unduly burden agencies' regulatory work, as \nit requires only that they be transparent in their imposition of \nunfunded mandates on State and local governments and private \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would further \nincrease the duplication and burden of the underlying bill.\n  Agencies are already required to perform an analysis, under the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act, of whether a proposed rule imposes an \nunfunded mandate on State, local, or tribal governments, or the private \nsector.\n  This amendment would require agencies to report to the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs every month on any unfunded mandate \nestimates for proposed rules. This amendment would be a backdoor way to \nget the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to review unfunded \nmandate assessments by independent agencies.\n  Currently, independent agencies are exempt from the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act. This amendment would require independent agencies to \nconduct unfunded mandate assessments and submit them to OIRA. This \nwould jeopardize the independence of these agencies, which is so very \nimportant.\n  I oppose the underlying bill, and I oppose this amendment, which does \nnot improve the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, \nand I strongly support her amendment.\n  Over the past several decades, the accumulation of unfunded mandates \nissued by the Federal Government to State and local governments, \ntribes, and the private sector has become an alarming concern.\n  This amendment will throw an early and needed spotlight on proposed \nnew unfunded mandates as Federal agencies\n\n[[Page H139]]\n\nbegin the process of considering them. Hopefully, once they are \ninformed of them in time, by the amendment, those who would otherwise \nhave to bear the burden of unfunded mandates will be better armed to \nfend off their unjust imposition.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time with the \nright to close.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned in the debate last night on a \nsimilar amendment, unfunded mandates are frequently overlooked in the \ndebates about regulatory reform. However, these decisions have real \ncosts and real effects on the individuals, families, and communities we \neach represent.\n  While my amendment is a small change, it ensures that costs passed \ndown to businesses, State and local governments are reported.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration and ask for their \nsupport.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, again, I think I have stated very clearly \nwhy we oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the \nJackson Lee amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 22, line 14, strike ``an imminent'' and insert ``a''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 712 imposes a 6-month \nmoratorium before a rule can take effect, unless the rule either:\n  (1) qualifies under the Administrative Procedure Act's exception for \nnotice and comment, which applies ``when the agency for good cause \nfinds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of the \nreasons therefore in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure \nthereon are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to public interest;'' \nor\n  (2) if the President issues an executive order determining that the \nrule is necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or \nother emergency, necessary for the enforcement of the criminal laws, \nnecessary for national security, or issued pursuant to any statute \nimplementing an international trade agreement.\n  The amendment simply strikes ``imminent'' from H.R. 712, so that a \nrule that prevents a threat to health or safety or other emergency \nwould qualify under the bill's exception.\n  As the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards--an organization \nrepresenting more than 150 labor, scientific, research, good \ngovernment, faith, community, health, environmental, and public \ninterest groups--observes, the bill's moratorium will put on hold for 6 \nmonths ``the benefits of critically needed regulations, whether \nmeasured in lives saved, environmental damage averted, or money \nsaved.''\n  This 6-month delay would be in addition to the already time-consuming \nprocess by which rules are promulgated.\n  Why should a rule intended to protect public health and safety be \nheld up for 6 months simply because the anticipated harm the rule \naddresses is not imminent? Shouldn't we look to try to foresee what is \ngoing to happen?\n  That is what this amendment will enable, if this legislation passes. \nI will ask my colleagues to support this very much commonsense \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Title II of the bill contains transparency requirements that are long \noverdue. To make sure that agencies comply and conduct their business \nin the sunshine, it prohibits an agency from entering a new regulation \ninto effect unless the agency makes the disclosures the bill requires \nfor at least 6 months before the regulation's published effective date.\n  Nevertheless, to provide flexibility where it is needed, the bill \nallows exceptions to the prohibition. For example, it grants a general \nexception for rules that do not require notice and public comment \npursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act's ``good cause'' \nexception. By statute, this exception includes situations where taking \nthe time for notice and comment would be ``contrary to the public \ninterest.''\n  In addition, the bill provides for a specific exception when a rule \nis needed to respond to an imminent threat.\n  The amendment seeks to widen the latter exception, but it goes too \nfar. It would allow any health or safety rule, including environmental \nrules, that an agency self-styles as responsive to an emergency, to \nevade the title's reasonable disclosure requirements with ease.\n  A mere 6 months of disclosure to the public is not unreasonable in \nthe absence of an imminent emergency. The courts, moreover, can be \nrelied upon to interpret the imminency requirement so as not to delay \nunduly the effective dates of needed, true emergency rules.\n  And, in any event, the bill's exception for rules qualifying for the \nAPA's ``good cause'' exception to notice and comment is adequate to \nprovide for any remaining need. So I urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, opposition is premised upon the \nnotion that we just can't trust a Federal employee who is charged with \noverseeing the protection of Americans through the rule process. We \ndon't believe, on the other side, that a person can be conscientious \nand dutiful about trying to help people.\n  Instead, they want to make it such that you can't issue a rule. You \nwill gum up the process by extending it out for so long--another 6 \nmonths--despite the fact that the rule, as foreseen by a Federal \nemployee--and it has gone through the notice and comments part of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, which has worked for decades. You just \nsimply don't want government to issue a rule that can protect people.\n  Why? Because it gets in the way of some big corporations' profits. \nThat is what this is really all about, protecting profits at the \nexpense of the health, safety, and well-being of the people. We don't \ntrust a government worker to be able to provide good service to the \npeople by promulgating rules that protect people.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  It is crazy, but that is what we are dealing with.\n  I would ask that the very reasonable Jackson Lee amendment be favored \nby my colleagues in this body.\n  Please vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume just to say to the gentleman from Georgia that it is entirely \nreasonable that regulations proposed to protect the people, as he \nnotes, should be known by the people before they are put into effect \nbecause they may decide it is not the way they want to be protected. \nAll this legislation does is make sure that they have adequate notice \nof proposed regulations that could have an impact on their jobs, on \ntheir family, on their health, and on their safety.\n  Government bureaucrats don't always get it right. We have learned \nthat the hard way. I think it is very important that this amendment be \ndefeated and that the underlying notice requirement in the bill that \nwill benefit the general public be preserved. I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H140]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Cummings\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 22, line 24, insert before the period the following: \n     ``, except that the term `agency' does not include an \n     independent establishment as defined in section 104''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Government Operations Subcommittee \nRanking Member Gerry Connolly. Our amendment would exempt independent \nagencies from the unnecessary, burdensome, and potentially dangerous \nprovisions of this legislation.\n  This bill would prohibit an agency rule from taking effect until the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs posts certain information \non proposed and final rules on the Internet for at least 6 months. The \nbill only allows for two exceptions. One exception is if the agency \nexempts a rule from the notice and comment requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. The other exception is if the President \nissues an executive order requiring a rule to take effect.\n  This bill covers all agency rulemakings, no matter how important. \nWhen applied to independent agencies, it is particularly dangerous. \nIndependent agencies are supposed to regulate industries without the \nrisk of political interference on their rulemaking. They are not \nrequired to obtain approval for their rules from the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs.\n  Under this bill, a rule issued by an independent agency could be \ndelayed if the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs fails to \ncomply with the requirements of the bill. That means this bill would \ngive the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs the ability to \ndelay a rule issued by an independent agency. That may be an unintended \nconsequence, but it is a serious one that could affect our Nation's \nfinancial markets, health, and safety.\n  One independent agency that would be affected by this rule is the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSC recently proposed a safety \nstandard for high chairs. The CPSC reports that over a 4-year period, \nan estimated 10,000 injuries occurred that were related to high chairs. \nH.R. 712 could delay rules like these high chair standards. That is \nsimply unacceptable. Our amendment would exempt independent agencies \nlike the Consumer Product Safety Commission from the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt our amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Title II of the bill, the ALERT Act, contains needed transparency \nrequirements so that hardworking Americans who bear the cost of new \nregulation at least know in realtime what is coming and what it will \ncost them to comply. Just like ordinary executive agencies, independent \nagencies should provide this level of transparency about the new \nregulations they are preparing.\n  Why should the public not have the right to know as much about what \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to impose as it \nknows about what the Environmental Protection Agency plans? Why \nshouldn't the public know as much about how the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau plans to regulate new car loans as it knows about how \nthe Department of Transportation plans to regulate new car designs?\n  The bill strengthens and protects the public's right to know. The \namendment would allow independent agencies to hide the ball at the \npublic's expense, and so I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

No delay of any rule, consent decree, or settlement agreement \n              that prevents gun violence.\n\n       Add, at the end of the bill, the following:\n\n                   TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 401. NO DELAY OF ANY RULE, CONSENT DECREE, OR SETTLEMENT \n                   AGREEMENT THAT PREVENTS GUN VIOLENCE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not \n     apply in the case of any rule, consent decree, or settlement \n     agreement that pertains to protecting Americans from gun \n     violence, particularly in school zones or other sensitive \n     areas.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to \nthe bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If \nadopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as \namended.\n  Mr. Speaker, my amendment is a simple, straightforward, commonsense \nimprovement that I believe both sides of the aisle can agree would help \nprotect American children from the threat of violence.\n  If my amendment passes, it would ensure that men and women that we \nrepresent and their children will have the peace of mind of knowing \nthat this Congress can cast aside partisan differences to vote to \nprotect families and communities from senseless gun violence.\n  That is because my amendment would exempt this bill to any regulation \nthat would protect Americans, particularly young children, from gun \nviolence in school zones and other sensitive areas.\n  If an agency proposes a solution that would improve the health, \nsafety, and well-being of Americans, especially children, by limiting \ngun violence, it is simply unconscionable to throw obstacles in the way \nto stymie that solution.\n  I don't see how this Congress, whose Members were entrusted by \nfamilies in our home districts to defend their right to life, liberty, \nand happiness, can argue that we did all we could to defend these \nrights, yet vote against responsible proposals that aim to protect life \nand preserve liberty and promote happiness.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  How can we in good conscience allow this body to pass this bill as \nis? How can we allow good community safety solutions to get bogged down \nwhen we can amend this bill to keep gun violence from ringing out in \nour classrooms and playgrounds? How can we turn a blind eye to \nregulations that charge us to act now to keep our children from being \nvictimized by violence and say that the responsible thing to do is to \nsideline it for 6 months for additional review?\n  We cannot allow our children to be sitting ducks for half a year. Far \ntoo many times we hear about a child the same age as your son, your \ndaughter, or grandchild falling victim to a stray bullet fired by a \ncriminal, someone who should not have been able to purchase a gun but \nfound a way through loopholes in our laws.\n  Or we hear about young women who are victims of domestic violence and \nare killed by their former partner who, despite a violent past, was \nable to legally purchase a firearm.\n  On Tuesday, President Obama announced a number of executive actions\n\n[[Page H144]]\n\nto address our Nation's gun violence epidemic. Specifically, the \nPresident's actions expand Federal background checks and improve mental \nhealthcare reporting to ensure guns stay out of the hands of dangerous \nindividuals.\n  I am not asking for you to vote based on your feelings for the \nPresident, but I want to pose this to you: If there were a 6-month \nwaiting period before a regulation ensuring that the dangerously \nmentally ill are unable to purchase a firearm went into effect, how \nmany innocent lives would be lost? How many men, women, and children \nwould be killed? How many more Newtowns, how many more Auroras, and how \nmany more Charlestons would occur? How many more of my young \nconstituents in Chicago and Riverdale would I lose to gun violence \nafter being shot by a stray bullet on their way home from school?\n  I support policies that are thorough and measured, but I cannot \nsupport policies that prevent health and safety regulations, especially \nthose that ensure the well-being of children from immediately being \nenforceable.\n  I have come to this floor countless times to advocate for commonsense \ngun legislation. We must act. My amendment will improve the bill by \nputting the health, safety, and well-being of our Nation's children \nfirst. It will ensure that Congress works with President Obama and \nallows his executive actions to start saving lives immediately. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, the American people have waited too long \nfor relief for us to delay in the face of this procedural motion. Now \nis the time for action, not parliamentary gimmicks.\n  We are 7 years into the Obama administration. Real unemployment is \nstill a massive problem. America's labor force participation is still \nnear record lows, yet instead of helping by getting out of the way, the \nObama administration and Washington's entrenched regulatory bureaucracy \nday after day pile new burden after new burden on the backs of workers, \nAmerican families, and small-business owners.\n  The total cost of Federal regulations is poised to zoom past $2 \ntrillion per year as the Obama administration furiously works to get \nout the door all the regulations it can in its last year in office. If \nthat $2 trillion were a nation's economy, it would be one of the top 10 \neconomies in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Investor's Business Daily reports that we have just \nconcluded 8 years of zero real wage growth for America's workers and \nfamilies. That means zero wage growth for the entire Obama \nadministration.\n  What about jobs? We would have created almost 6 million more jobs if \nthe so-called Obama recovery had just been as strong as the average \nrecovery since World War II.\n  America's workers and families cannot afford for Washington to \ncontinue to sacrifice the Nation's prosperity and ability to generate \njobs so the regulatory bureaucracy can expand into every nook and \ncranny of our lives. Nothing in this bill prevents emergency \nregulations or otherwise unduly delays needed regulations.\n  Vote against this motion to recommit. Vote for this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Other efforts to hold the vote open are not similarly protected.\n  As a point of courtesy to each of your colleagues, voting within the \nallotted time would help with the maintenance of the institution.\n  The Chair appreciates the Members' attention to this matter.\n  Without objection, 5-minute voting will continue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER.

Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nFleischmann) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1155) to \nprovide for the establishment of a process for the\n\n[[Page H150]]\n\nreview of rules and sets of rules, and for other purposes, pursuant to \nHouse Resolution 580, he reported the bill back to the House with \nsundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the \nCommittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The question is on the amendments.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I am opposed to the bill in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Cicilline moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 1155, to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Page 29, line 21, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``, \n     except for a special rule''.\n       Page 29, insert after line 24 the following:\n       (6) Special rule.--The term ``special rule'' means a rule \n     that pertains to prohibiting discrimination by Federal \n     contractors or subcontractors on the basis of sex, sexual \n     orientation, or gender identity, and requires such \n     contractors or subcontractors to take affirmative measures to \n     prevent discrimination on those bases from occurring.\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. \nIt will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthis bill will immediately proceed to final passage here on the floor, \nas amended.\n  This amendment is very simple. It would exempt from the requirements \nof the underlying bill a rule prohibiting discrimination by Federal \ncontractors or subcontractors on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, \nor gender identity, and require such contractors to take affirmative \nmeasures to prevent discrimination on those bases from occurring.\n  This amendment is consistent with the executive order signed by \nPresident Obama on July 21, 2014, that added sexual orientation and \ngender identity to the list of protected categories covered by Federal \ncontractors--protections that were originally put in place by President \nLyndon Johnson, a leader who did so much to advance equality in our \ncountry.\n  Today, while we have made great strides in terms of marriage \nequality, members of the LGBT community still face significant \ndiscrimination in employment as well as a variety of other important \nareas of life.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, it is still legal in most States \nto fire a qualified person from a job that they are performing well \nsimply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  Today, in many places across the country, a gay couple can get \nmarried on Saturday, post pictures online on Sunday, and get fired from \ntheir jobs or kicked out of their apartments on Monday. This is \ncontrary to everything this country stands for, including the principle \nof equality upon which our country was founded.\n  I would like to point out, contrary to the sentiments of the American \npeople, a majority of Americans, nearly 70 percent, support \nantidiscrimination laws to protect LGBT individuals. Unfortunately, \nthere are those who would continue to stand in the way of full equality \nfor all Americans, who think that it is okay that hardworking men and \nwomen simply trying to support their families suffer discrimination \nbecause of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  That is why it is important to support the President in his effort to \nprotect the LGBT community from discrimination in Federal contracting.\n  Just as businesses should not be able to discriminate based on race, \nethnicity, gender, or disability, no entity that benefits from \ngovernment money should be able to discriminate based on sexual \norientation or gender identity.\n  The underlying bill we are discussing today would hinder the \nimplementation of these nondiscrimination efforts, putting everyday \nAmericans at risk of losing their jobs based on nothing more than who \nthey are.\n  I am reminded of the story of Carter Brown, a young man from Texas \nwho had built a thriving career in real estate in Dallas, Texas. Carter \nhad received three promotions in 2 years, was earning a great salary \nand loved his job. But when he was outed as transgender by a colleague, \nCarter found himself harassed, ostracized, and ultimately fired from \nhis job, and there was absolutely nothing he could do, because he was \nnot protected under the law.\n  Carter bravely told his story earlier this year in the Lyndon Johnson \nRoom of the Capitol Building as we announced the introduction of the \nEquality Act, which would place important protections for the LGBT \ncommunity throughout our Federal Code.\n  The Equality Act would ensure that members of the LGBT community are \nprotected from discrimination in areas of employment, credit, housing, \neducation, Federal funding, jury service, and public accommodations. I \nam very proud that 171 of my colleagues in the House have joined in \nthis effort and cosponsored this bill, and I urge the rest of my \ncolleagues to sign on as well.\n  But until full equality is passed into Federal law, at the minimum, \nwe should ensure that Federal money is not being used to discriminate \nagainst LGBT Americans by companies who receive Federal contracts. That \nis why I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit and \nensure equality in our Federal contracting. Our Federal Government \nshould not be used to promote or tolerate discrimination. It is \ncontrary to the founding principles of our great country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge you to vote in support of this motion to \nrecommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. \nCicilline) is one of my favorite people. We get to serve on a committee \ntogether, and we have done other things together. He is a genuine human \nbeing who puts forth his heart, and I personally appreciate it, as I \nknow he cares deeply and passionately about this body and the work that \nhe does.\n  I also want to thank Mr. Jason Smith, who has put forward a very \nimportant bill, something that I think is a reasonable, commonsense \napproach to deal with regulations of the past. There is no prohibition \nabout putting regulations forward, but going back and looking, taking a \nscrub, if you will, and looking at past regulations, what this bill \ndoes is it simply creates a bipartisan commission--bipartisan--to go \nback and look at these, and they produce a report. That report comes to \nCongress, it has to pass both bodies, and it has to get the signature \nof the President. That is a very reasonable thing to do. So I urge \n``no'' on this motion to recommit, ``yes'' on the passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-\nminute\n\n[[Page H151]]\n\nvotes on passage of the bill, if ordered; ordering the previous \nquestion on House Resolution 581; and adopting House Resolution 581, if \nordered.\n  This is a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 178, \nnoes

Mr. Speaker, I am joined today by \nCongressmen Thompson, Harper, and Palazzo, all from Mississippi.\n  We rise to mourn the 11 lives that were lost in Mississippi due to \nsevere weather over the Christmas holiday. We had 11 deaths and 57 \ninjuries reported in Benton, Coahoma, Marshall, and Tippah Counties, \nwhich are two of our four districts.\n  On Governor Bryant's request, President Obama issued a major disaster \ndeclaration for the State of Mississippi. The Presidential disaster \ndeclaration makes Federal assistance available to eligible individuals \nand business owners in designated areas.\n  As I visited the impacted areas, I was saddened by the amount of \ndestruction, of the loss of property, and, most importantly, of the \nloss of life; but I was uplifted by neighbors helping neighbors, by \nfriends helping friends, and by strangers helping strangers. That is \nthe strength of Mississippi: The people who come together to help each \nother in times of need.\n  I cannot begin to imagine the sense of loss felt by the families who \nwere affected. We ask our colleagues to join us in continuing to lift \nthem up in prayer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H153-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MOURNING THE 11 LIVES LOST IN MISSISSIPPI'S DISASTROUS WINTER STORM\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Kelly) indicated, Mississippi was hit very hard with \ntornadoes. There were 11 deaths, and there was significant damage. We \nhave received a disaster declaration.\n  I want to pay a special tribute to our system of disaster response, \nwhich worked. Federal, State, and local officials came together and \nresponded just like the textbook said they should. Nowhere have we \nreceived any complaints about help not being available.\n  So if there is any good that we can talk about coming from such a \ndisaster, it is this: The system that Congress put together for \ngovernment to respond to its citizens in the time of disaster worked \nduring this particular disaster in Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H153-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H153-H154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1730\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Oliver \nKelley, who was born on this day in 1826. Kelley, a native Bostonian, \nrealized that Minnesota was a land of great opportunity and moved there \nin 1849.\n  Although he had no experience farming, Kelley became a ``book \nfarmer'' and everything that he first learned about agriculture, he got \nfrom reading. Kelley's thirst for knowledge, great intuition, and \nprogressive methods allowed his farm in Elk River to thrive.\n  In 1864, Kelley became a clerk for the U.S. Bureau of Agriculture. \nThrough his work, he recognized the importance of agriculture to our \nNation and, in 1867, helped found the National Grange, a society and \nadvocacy group for rural America.\n  Oliver Kelley's role in agriculture led to his induction into the \nNational Agricultural Center and Hall of Fame in 2006.\n  The Kelley farm remains an important part of our community. Today, it \nis a historical property that teaches thousands of Minnesota school \nkids about agriculture.\n  Minnesotans are certainly grateful for Kelley's efforts, which have \nlargely contributed to agricultural success in our country, and we are \nproud to have his legacy maintained in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional \nDistrict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H154-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING WILLIAM ``BILL'' RAY\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to \ncelebrate the life of an extraordinary man, William ``Bill'' Ray.\n  Bill laughed often, and he loved much. His charm and gentlemanly \ncharacter won the respect of many people in my community.\n  Bill worked in my district office as a community liaison and \ncaseworker for 13 years. You know what? He made a difference in \npeople's lives. He was genuinely interested in people and things, from \nthe Boy Scouts to Native Americans and to veterans. He knew how to find \nthe best in others, and he gave the best of himself.\n  Bill loved his wife, Rhonda, and their son, Jeffrey, with all of his \nheart and soul. He loved his country and our military. He was a true \npatriot. Bill was noble in character, genuine in spirit, and very kind \nof heart.\n  Rhonda, Jeffrey, you have my deepest condolences on the passing of \nyour husband and father.

Mr. Speaker, 54 million, that is the number of lives \nthat have been cut short in our Nation by abortion over the 43 years \nsince the Supreme Court's infamous Roe v. Wade decision. That is 54 \nmillion children who were never given the chance to experience the \nworld around them, and 54 million human beings who were denied the \nnatural and inalienable right to life that our Founding Fathers \nenshrined in the Declaration of Independence.\n  As a father, I have watched my son grow from his first sonogram to a \nvery active 2-year-old. He looks to me for protection, for guidance, \nfor comfort. So too do society's most innocent and vulnerable count on \nus to defend them.\n  During his visit to the U.S. in 1987, now-Saint Pope John Paul II \nremarked: ``The ultimate test of your greatness is the way you treat \nevery human being, but especially the weakest and most defenseless \nones.''\n  I believe we must reach out to mothers in distress, as well as the \nchild that they are bearing. There are few more vulnerable and \ndefenseless than the unborn.\n  On the 22nd of this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans will \narrive here in our Nation's Capital for the annual March for Life. I \nlook forward to joining them as we work toward that day when our great \nNation will recognize the right to life for all Americans, especially \nour unborn children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H154-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS.

We were told that violent criminals \nwould be targeted. Yet, mothers and children are being deported. Not \nonly do these raids tear families and neighborhoods apart, they waste \ntaxpayer dollars that should be used on other priorities.\n  We spend $14,000 per mom and $14,000 per child when they are chased \ndown and deported.

Mr. Speaker, for those who haven't been in the House \nChamber, surrounding the inside of this beautiful building are effigies \nof great philosophers and lawgivers that have influenced the founding \nof our Nation. One of those, to my right, is that of Sir William \nBlackstone.\n  Now, Blackstone had great influence upon our Founders, especially \nthat of Thomas Jefferson. In fact, it was Blackstone who influenced the \nthree enumerated rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me read from Blackstone's Commentary, the very \ndocument which influenced Thomas Jefferson to make life the very first \nright that is given by government.\n  Blackstone said: ``Life is the immediate gift of God, a right \ninherent by nature in every individual; and it begins in contemplation \nof law as soon as an infant is able to stir in the mother's womb.''\n  That is one of the foundations of this Nation, that life begins at \nconception.\n\n[[Page H155]]\n\nAnd our Founding Fathers understood that it was a great philosophy and \nthat is when the protection of law begins.\n  On January 22, 1973, we departed from that philosophy with the \ndecision of Roe v. Wade. Since then, over 57 million American lives \nhave been taken because of that decision. Mr. Speaker, that number is \nequivalent to the population of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, \nKentucky, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Tennessee. That one decision, \nMr. Speaker, has not only figuratively, but literally changed the \nlandscape of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H155-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EAST NICOLAUS HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, before the holiday break, I rose to \ncongratulate the East Nicolaus High School Spartans from Sutter County \nfor advancing to the CIF Division VI-AA football championship game. At \nthat time, they were about to make a 500-mile trip to San Diego to face \nCoronado, a school four times their size.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that the Spartans may have \nbeen the underdogs in the game, but that didn't matter to them. On \nDecember 28, they won the championship game 16-6. Quarterback S.J. \nBrown threw for a touchdown and rushed for another. Donovan Switalski \nhad 25 carries for 135 yards. On defense, quarterback Eddie Herrera \nintercepted two passes.\n  Those are great individual efforts.

It also \nremoves all Federal taxpayer funding from Planned Parenthood, the \nlargest abortion provider in the country, which receives over half a \nbillion taxpayer dollars a year and does 330,000 abortions a year. In \nfact, it is the largest abortion provider in America. Instead of \nfunding the largest abortion provider in America, we direct those funds \nto over 10,000 community health centers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope the President agrees and saves hardworking \nAmerican taxpayers billions of dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H155-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEFENDING THE SECOND AMENDMENT\n\n  (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROKITA.

Instead, for example, he \nlets prisoners out of jail to contribute to the violence.\n  Mr. Speaker, the right to self-defense is God-given. It is vital in \norder to protect people and property against criminals, and it is a \nhedge against tyrants, and it shall not be infringed.\n  To those who would challenge these rights, Mr. Speaker, I leave you \nwith these words: ``A well-regulated militia necessary to the security \nof a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall \nnot be infringed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H155-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BORN ALIVE SURVIVORS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  (Mr. FRANKS of Arizona asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.

Wade remains one of the most heinous acts of judicial activism \nin the history of the United States.\n  As a father of five and a grandfather of three, I know that every \nchild is a wonderful gift from God.

Mr. Speaker, last week the State of Arkansas lost a \ngiant in the political world. Dale Bumpers, a former Governor and \nSenator, had served the State of Arkansas for many decades.\n  As an intern for Arkansas' junior Senator at the time, David Pryor, I \nfirst met Senator Bumpers in 1986. His service to his fellow Arkansans \nbegan in the Fourth Congressional District, where he returned home to \nCharleston to serve as city attorney after the Marines and law school.\n  He went on to serve on the local school board before mounting \nmultiple successful bids for statewide office. Charleston Public School \nDistrict is not only known for producing stellar graduates and for the \nTigers' powerhouse football program, but for heeding Dale Bumpers' \nadvice in 1954 and becoming the first public school in the former \nConfederate States to desegregate.\n  His decades of public service were about serving others, not prestige \nor power. In his autobiography, Dale said it was his father who \nencouraged him to enter public service, calling it a noble profession.\n  As we remember Senator Bumpers, I can think of no nobler act than \nserving others.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Boy Scout \nTroop 3 in Corpus Christi, Texas, that is celebrating 100 years of \nScouting.\n  The Scouts is a wonderful organization for our youth. It teaches them \nnew things. It helps them build self-esteem, learn teamwork, self-\nsufficiency, and the importance of helping others.\n  From the beginning of Troop 3 in 1916, the Scouts have always been of \nservice to our community and the country. During World War I, members \nof the troop sold war bonds. After the devastating 1919 hurricane, the \nScouts of Troop 3, along with National Guard units, went door to door \nto compile an accurate list of casualties.\n  The Scouts have contributed many hours of service throughout our \ncommunity. During the hurricane, they did mosquito control and \ndistributed foods and blankets.\n  Today Troop 3 continues to be active in community service projects \ncompleted and many have benefited from the service projects completed \nby Eagle Scout candidates in the troop.\n  On this upcoming 100th anniversary, Troop 3 can take pride in its \ntraditions and contributions to our community.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of our \nSpecial Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, since 1973, at least 58 million \nunborn children have been killed by abortion, a staggering loss of \nchildren's precious lives, a death toll that equates with the entire \npopulation of England.\n  Despite this staggering loss of children's lives and the sad fact \nthat President Obama is using stealth, deception, and coercive power of \nthe State to promote abortion violence, including the massive public \nfunding of abortion on demand in ObamaCare, the pro-life movement is \nalive and well and making serious, significant, and sustained progress.\n  Yesterday Congress passed landmark legislation to end taxpayer \nsubsidies for Planned Parenthood, and special thanks go to Speaker \nRyan, Majority Leader McCarthy, Chairman Price, and others in \nleadership for crafting this lifesaving legislation.\n  In this Congress alone, powerful pro-life measures have passed, \nincluding the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the Pain-Capable \nUnborn Child Protection Act, and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors \nProtection Act.\n  On the State level, 282 pro-life laws have been enacted since 2010, \nincluding laws to stop dismemberment abortions, require a 72-hour \nwaiting period, and to provide informed consent.\n  With the March for Life only a couple days away, pro-lifers are more \ndetermined, faith-filled, and hope-filled than ever.\n  Millennials are overwhelmingly pro-life. As the former head of the \npro-abortion group NARAL observed, after witnessing a recent pro-life \nmarch, the March for Life, she said: I just thought, my gosh, they are \nso young. There are so many of them, and they are so young.\n  Public opinion polls concur that more Americans, especially women and \nyoung people, are pro-life. Seventy-one percent of the millennials \nopposed taxpayer funding for abortion, 69 percent of the women. Fifty-\nnine percent of women favor a limit on abortion at at least 20 weeks \nwhen the unborn child is capable of feeling pain. The Gallup Poll has \nfound that Planned Parenthood's favorability rating among women has \ndropped 24 points in the last two decades alone.\n  A few minutes ago, Mr. Speaker, Speaker Paul Ryan enrolled H.R. 3762, \nsponsored by Dr. Price, a bill to roll back much of ObamaCare and to \ndefund Planned Parenthood. Yes, the President, President Obama, the \nabortion President, is all but certain to veto that bill to defund \nPlanned Parenthood, and I just have to say, Mr. Speaker, How sad is \nthat? The President has everything, but, sadly, there is no room, no \nempathy for the babies who will be exterminated. That is tragic. \nHopefully he will have a change of heart at some point in his career, \nand hopefully it will be within weeks.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, 43 years ago the Roe v. Wade \ndecision resulted in the death of 57 million Americans; 57 million \nunborn children lost their lives, over a million children per year. It \nis an amazing statistic.\n  Louisiana has traditionally ranked as one of the most pro-life States \nin the Nation. We have some amazing organizations that are doing great \nwork to educate our citizens about the pro-life movement, organizations \nlike Louisiana Right to Life and Louisiana Family Forum. The head of \nthe Family Research Council is a constituent of our district.\n  There is one particular pro-life advocate that I would like to call \nout, Dr. Al Krotoski, who recently passed away, in fact, just on \nJanuary 1 of this year. He literally gave his life to advocating for \npro-life causes. His knowledge, his scientific background with his \nPh.D., his M.D., and his master's in public health shaped him and \nhelped him to shape pro-life policy in the State of Louisiana. He was a \nphenomenal example of pro-life advocates for our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to make note that Dr. Al set an \namazing example for our State, an amazing example on the sanctity of \nlife and respecting life. But it is important that, as we move forward, \nwe also respect life after birth. We respect life in terms of some of \nthe initiatives that we are going to be working on this year: criminal \njustice reform and the War on Poverty.\n  I really appreciate the opportunity to participate in this Special \nOrder tonight. I want to thank you for organizing this. I want to \nremind folks, over a million lives a year lost as a result of this \ndecision.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his \nvery eloquent comments.\n\n[[Page H157]]\n\n  I would like to now yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nShuster), the chair of the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and also \nthank him for setting up this Special Order tonight and his leadership \nin his years in Congress and the pro-life movement.\n  Life is the most precious gift we are given. The youngest and most \nvulnerable among us are a blessing. We must never stop working to \nprotect them.\n  Unfortunately, 2015 brought renewed attacks on life, and horrific new \nevents came to light that showed us just how important this fight is. \nVideos were released exposing Planned Parenthood's barbaric practices. \nThe things we saw being discussed and done in these videos were \nappalling. They underscore why we must continue to do everything we can \nto uphold the sanctity of life.\n  I am proud that today we are sending down to the President a piece of \nlegislation that will defund Planned Parenthood. I am proud of the work \nthis House has done to bring attention to this issue and advance the \ncause of life.\n  I have been honored to count myself among those who are in this \nfight, but we can never rest on our work to protect the unborn. \nTogether, we must work to ensure that the terrible practices of Planned \nParenthood come to an end and that life is valued, cherished, and \nalways protected.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank Chairman Shuster for those excellent \ncomments.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I want to thank my friend and colleague \nfor his great leadership in this cause of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join with my others here with deep concern as we are \nnow at 43 years since the Supreme Court determined, unimaginably, that \nthere exists in our country some broad right for the abortion of a \nchild in the womb.\n  That decision literally came after 21 States had already enacted laws \nlimiting abortion for over 100 years. In fact, the first of these laws \nwas adopted in Connecticut in 1847, 21 years before the ratification of \nthe 14th Amendment, which is the very amendment on which Roe v. Wade is \nbased. In his dissent, Justice Rehnquist noted that, due to this \nhistory, the High Court was forced to create a right that was unknown \nto the Framers of the 14th Amendment.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time that we correct this wrong-headed decision \nmade by the court 43 years ago. It is for this reason that I personally \nintroduced the Sanctity of Human Life bill, H.R. 426, which defines \nlife beginning at conception.\n  I would certainly ask my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this bill \nso that 43 years from now we are celebrating the right to life rather \nthan another 57 million unborn Americans lost to abortion.\n  I thank the gentleman for his stance on this.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for his leadership and \nfor his bill.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), the co-chair \nof the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. I thank him for his leadership \nand for standing up so courageously for life.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank Representative Smith for all of his work and \nleadership on the issues of life and protecting people at all stages of \nlife.\n  As the Democratic co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus, I stand here as a \nDemocrat who believes that we need to have laws in our Nation to \nprotect the vulnerable, those who can't protect themselves. No one is \nmore vulnerable in America today than a child in the mother's womb. No \none is in more need of protection. We must continue to fight to provide \nthat protection.\n  We do have our young men and women who are our new pro-life \ngeneration. They understand the dangers that they faced to their own \nlives when they were in their mother's womb.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with all of them and with my \ncolleagues here in the House to bring us to the day where all life in \nour Nation is protected by our laws, from conception to death. Only \nthen will our Nation truly stand up for life and all that our Nation \nwas founded upon.\n  I thank all my colleagues for their work on this issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank Mr. Lipinski for those very fine \ncomments.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. I thank Congressman Smith and Congressman Lipinski for \ntheir leadership in the Pro-Life Caucus. I thank Congressman Smith for \nhis active involvement in promoting life not only here in America, but \nall over the world.\n  Someone once said: Tell a lie long enough and it becomes the truth. \nThat statement, sadly, is often true, but the lie is still a lie. Roe \nv. Wade was such a lie. It didn't offer freedom. It didn't offer \nopportunity or choice. It offered death and a diminished life, to boot.\n  I will never forget the conversation with my wife over 40 years now \nin the hospital recovery room when she had just given birth to our \nfirst child. She said to me in that recovery room, with tears in her \neyes: ``Wow, I have just added a life to the world.\n  That is why pro-life and pro-women go hand in hand. She is the only \nbeing designed and capable to bring new life into the world. It is a \nGod-given gift. We honor and celebrate that gift. We who are pro-life \nhonor her for that.\n  Let's give all that we can to honor and encourage our citizens to \nknow the truth of the Psalmist who said: ``Behold, children are a gift \nof the Lord; the fruit of the womb is a reward.'' And that is the \ntruth.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank Mr. Walberg for his very excellent \nremarks, but also for that very personal story. That is very, very \ntouching.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).\n  Mr. LATTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Again, I want to add my admiration to Mr. Smith for all his years of \nhard work for the pro-life movement here in this country and around the \nworld and for holding this Special Order tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the right to life for every \nunborn child. During my tenure in the Ohio General Assembly and now as \na Member of Congress, I have consistently supported pro-life \nlegislation and I have been unwavering in my belief that we must be \nvigilant in protecting the sanctity of human life.\n  Over the past year, we have seen an unprecedented and callous \ndisregard for life through the series of undercover videos that \nillustrate Planned Parenthood's involvement in the sale of fetal \ntissue. That is why I have supported legislative measures to end such \nunspeakable acts and to prevent any Federal funds going to any entity \nthat performs abortions.\n  At a time when pro-life values are often marginalized, I want to \nreassure my constituents that I will remain steadfast in my support for \nlegislation that defends the sanctity of life and that I will continue \nto stand for those without a voice.\n  I also want to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to those who \nwork tirelessly day after day, year after year, to defend the right of \nlife, and to the hundreds of thousands who will be here for the Right \nto Life March this month. I applaud them and thank them.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for all of his years of \nhard work.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for his leadership on \nthis most important human rights issue of our time.\n  I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n  Mr. ROUZER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank \nhim for his leadership on this very important issue.\n  As we near the 43rd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court \ndecision, there is a sad truth to be told: More than 57 million \ninnocent lives have been terminated through abortion since that \nlandmark ruling.\n  To put that in perspective, that is more than five times the \npopulation of my home State of North Carolina. Again, that is more than \nfive times the population of North Carolina. That is a sobering number.\n  In God's word, it is written that life begins at conception. Recent \nadvances in science support that fact. It is our moral obligation to \nfight for and protect the lives of those who cannot\n\n[[Page H158]]\n\nspeak for themselves, the lives of those who are no different than our \nown.\n  As millions of Americans prepare to travel here to Washington, D.C., \nto participate in the annual March for Life, my prayers are with them. \nI am proud to stand with them in their commitment and dedication to the \npro-life cause.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a very strong \nand outspoken supporter of the right to life.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I, too, would like to add my thanks for the passion and the \ncommitment he has made to the right-to-life movement and the protection \nof the unborn--both he and his wife--not just here in the United \nStates, but around the world. I have seen that happen.\n  But we are here tonight. It is hard to stand in America's House and \nthink that we have to debate an issue that is so basic to who we are \nnot as Republicans or Democrats, but as human beings.\n  In the district that I represent, the biggest county is Erie County. \nIn Erie County, there are 278,443 people, human beings. In 2014, \nabortions performed by Planned Parenthood ended the potential lives of \n324,000 human beings.\n  It is stunning here in America's House and in the United States of \nAmerica, where we recoil at any action around the world where there is \nloss of life, especially when it happens violently and at the hands of \npeople who have absolutely no regard for human life. We still shudder \nthat Adolph Hitler was able to eliminate 7 million Jews.\n  We have ended the lives of 57 million Americans that could be here \ntoday. We lost their lives. We lost their potential. We lost their \nvalue. The hypocrisy that drips from the people's House--America's \nHouse--when we have to stand and debate the right to life, the right of \nthe unborn, and think that somehow this is an argument that we must \nwin. This is something that never ever should have happened, not in \nAmerica, not on our watch, not in our time.\n  On January 22, hundreds of thousands of pro-life Americans will come \nto the Nation's capital. They will be little noted by the media, but \nthey will be here. They come every year. They come here every year with \none purpose and one purpose only, and that is to protect the lives of \nthe unborn.\n  When, America, will we stand up and take the responsibility for the \nheinous activity that we have allowed to happen on our watch?\n  I thank my colleagues and I thank the gentleman for his passion and \ndedication to the lives of the unborn. We will never ever walk away \nfrom this responsibility to right a horrible wrong in the chapter of \nhuman history.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank Mr. Kelly for his very strong \nstatement.\n  More people now recognize, especially through ultrasound, that birth \nis an event, not the beginning of life. Increasingly, because the \nmethods of abortion are so horrific--literal dismemberment of the baby, \nchemical poisoning--people are waking up. Abortion is violence against \nchildren and injurious to women.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman for his commitment to life.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year's March for Life marks the 43rd anniversary of \nRoe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that invented a constitutional \nright to abortion on demand. Justice Byron White dissented in the case, \ncalling what the majority had done an ``exercise in raw judicial \npower.''\n  The March for Life draws thousands of people from across the Nation \nevery year. The marchers come by foot, by car, by train, by plane.\n  Why, Mr. Speaker, does this issue refuse to go away? I suggest \nbecause it goes to the heart of who we are and whether we will live up \nto the principles of our Nation's founding documents.\n  Mr. Speaker, this issue touches the conscience of everyone. It can be \ndifficult to discuss and it is painful to be reminded of it.\n  Everyone in this Chamber, everyone listening to this talk, was at one \npoint in his or her life an unborn child. The March for Life speaks to \nthis truth and speaks to the obligation of society to defend the \ndefenseless. May this Nation rediscover the value of everyone, and may \nwe continue to work for the day when all are protected.\n  Mr. Speaker, if I might take a moment to recognize the work of my \ncolleague, Mr. Smith, who came to this House in 1980--35 years ago--and \nfrom that day has been fighting this fight.\n  I am reminded, Mr. Speaker, of another statesman two centuries ago, \nWilliam Wilberforce, who served in the Parliament of Britain. He was \nfirst elected there in 1780 and came to the cause to fight for the \nabolition of slavery in 1787, when he took on the cause with his \ncolleagues of conscience.\n  It took them 20 years, Mr. Speaker, to abolish the slave trade in the \nBritish Empire with the Slave Trade Act in 1807, and their work did not \nend. He continued his work for decades.\n  He had to retire from Parliament in 1826, but consider that time that \nhe put in to fighting the slave trade. They finally abolished slavery \nin the British Empire in 1833, and William Wilberforce learned that \nParliament had the votes to pass that just days before his death.\n  This is a fight that goes on. Sometimes justice takes time.\n  In 1896, the Supreme Court ruled separate, but equal, is okay. It \ntook 58 years, Mr. Speaker, for them to correct that injustice in Brown \nv. Board of Education. Fifty-eight years.\n  It has been 43 years since the injustice of Roe v. Wade, but this \nfight will continue. We will continue to work for the protection of all \nhuman life, for justice will not sleep forever.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank Mr. Rothfus very much for his \nleadership and for his very eloquent remarks.\n  William Wilberforce reminds us all that, through prayer, fasting, \ntenacity, and the pursuit of justice, he really was able to stop the \nslave trade.\n  Thankfully, in this Congress, we have so many leaders--men and women \non the pro-life side--who stand up boldly and effectively, and we will \nwin this.\n  I thank the gentleman for his leadership.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson), my good friend and \ncolleague.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. OLSON. I thank my friend from the Garden State for allowing me to \njoin this very important Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, 43 years ago, an activist, liberal Supreme Court decided \nRoe v. Wade and turned a penumbra, a shadow in our Constitution, into \nthe legal right to privacy, which became the right to terminate \ninnocent life.\n  Since then, we have seen a decline in the value of human life in \nAmerica. There is increased violence in our streets. Planned Parenthood \nstaff discuss the harvesting of baby parts. There is an erosion of \nmoral fabric that stems from a lack of respect for life. It stems from \nRoe v. Wade.\n  Americans expect instant gratification with no consequences for their \nown actions.\n  The Catholic Church's newest saint, Mother Teresa, once said: ``It is \na poverty to decide that a child must die so you may live as you \nwish.'' I stand with Mother Teresa and all who value the sanctity of \nlife, and will fight, continue to fight every effort to give a voice to \nthe voiceless before their lives are taken.\n  All life is precious. All life is precious.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you so very much, Pete, for those very \nmoving remarks.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Fleming), who is the \nprime sponsor of the Health Care Conscience Rights Act, along with \nDiane Black and Jeff Fortenberry.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Chris \nSmith, for all of the years of service in this area of pro-life and \npro-family, not just domestically, but around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for everything he does, and the \nblessings that he has provided to us.\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, children are a joy to every mother and father. My \nwife and I share this joy, both as parents and as grandparents.\n  As a matter of fact, I have seen all three of my grandchildren \nthrough ultrasound, before they were born, very\n\n[[Page H159]]\n\nearly in gestation, watched them move, watched them suck their thumbs. \nI fell in love with each and every one of them right there before they \nwere born. Certainly, if I can love them before they are born, God \nloves them and knows them before they are born.\n  As a matter of fact, in Jeremiah 1:5, it says that God knows us \nbefore we are formed in our own mother's womb.\n  The value of human life, however, isn't quantified through parental \nsentimentality. Children, including developing babies, the nascent life \nwithin a mother, are endowed by our Creator with the same unalienable \nrights as you and I have, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. \nGood public policy will reflect this understanding and protect the \nlives of the unborn, those who are today's children and tomorrow's \nleaders.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we approach the anniversary of the devastating 1973 \nU.S. Supreme Court decision that sanctioned the genocide--yes, the \ngenocide--of 57 million children, I implore my colleagues and my fellow \ncountrymen to stand for life.\n  America's children, born and yet unborn, are our heritage and our \nfuture.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you, Dr. Fleming. Thank you for your \nleadership on so many issues, including the conscience rights issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp).\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Thank you, Congressman Smith. It is an honor, as \nalways, to join you this evening on this Special Order. I have told you \nbefore and I will tell you again, thank you for your leadership. I \nbelieve our efforts, though not fully successful, your efforts have \nsaved many lives in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House voted to stop Federal funding from \ngoing to the evil abortion provider Planned Parenthood. It was another \ncommonsense step in the many that our pro-life movement has made in our \nlong, 43-year fight following the barbaric ruling of Roe v. Wade by an \nunelected, unaccountable U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Tragically, it has been said 57 million innocent babies have lost \ntheir lives to abortion since that woeful, woeful decision.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again, I am eternally \ngrateful that the birth mothers of my wife and I's four adopted \nchildren chose life.\n  On January 21, one of those children, my daughter Rebecca, will \narrive on a bus in Washington, D.C., along with dozens of her \nclassmates from Benedictine College, in Atchison, Kansas, to again \nparticipate in the National March for Life the following day.\n  On that day, I will be joining thousand of Kansans in Topeka as we \nmarch, pray, speak, and celebrate the gift of our life in our State's \ncapital. I am proud of our efforts, and I hope my colleagues will join \nme in demonstrating their dedication to the sanctity of all human life, \nwhether it be in the home State or here in our Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his \nexemplary leadership on this fundamental issue.\n  I rise today on the 43rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade to remember the \nmore than 50 million unborn lives we have lost in the decades since \nthis Supreme Court decision was handed down.\n  As a father of four young children, I can speak for millions of \nparents I know when I say that Jenny and I, we really fell in love with \nour children before they were born. It is this unwavering love for my \nown children and for others' children that led me to the pro-life \nmovement.\n  Each year, thousands of fellow Hoosiers travel to our Nation's \nCapital to peacefully march for life and to celebrate the sanctity of \nlife at all stages.\n  My experience working at the Crisis Pregnancy Center in Bloomington, \nIndiana, provided, I think, unique insight into some of the steps we \ncan take to bring our love to bear, so that we might bring about \nchanges in the law and restore, in this country, a culture of life.\n  This year, we work with renewed purpose, with the force of public \nopinion firmly behind us. We know what happened last year. It will be \nhard to ever forget. We witnessed an outpouring of rage when Planned \nParenthood's activities were uncovered. For the first time, millions \nhad to confront, in living color, the callous disregard for human life \nexhibited by Planned Parenthood's employees and its procedures, \nunimaginable procedures, procedures that shocked the public conscience.\n  I heard from folks back home, countless Hoosiers, and they responded \nwith complete clarity. No one, they said, should be forced to violate \ntheir conscience so abortion providers like Planned Parenthood can \ncontinue to operate. That just won't stand.\n  It is why our first order of business this year was to cut off \ntaxpayer funding that involves every single American taxpayer and the \npractices of the Nation's largest abortion provider. As promised, we \nsent the President a bill defunding Planned Parenthood.\n  Now, to the Hoosiers who join me this year in marching for life, know \nthat we will remain vigilant in our efforts to protect innocent life \nand the rights of conscience of the American people.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you so much, Mr. Young, and thank you, \nas a new and very rising star leader in our efforts to defend life. \nYour eloquence is greatly appreciated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to honor the memory of \nthe millions of babies that have been killed by abortion in the 43 \nyears since the Supreme Court's poorly reasoned, and I wrote down here \nappalling, but I heard one of my colleagues use the word barbaric, and \nI think that is the right word, barbaric ruling in Roe v. Wade.\n  There are those who argue that life begins at birth. They are wrong. \nLife begins at conception. Anyone who has seen a precious baby in the \nwomb on a sonogram cannot help but agree with me on this.\n  One of the most moving events of my life was when I went with my wife \nand saw the first sonogram picture of my first daughter, Morgan. I \nstill have the videotape of that. A printout is in my memory box in \nCorpus Christi. It was one of the most moving experiences.\n  You know, I know lots of Members of Congress, a lot of them are here \ntoday, and they feel the same way as I do, that human life is something \nspecial, something sacred, and it begins at conception.\n  But, unfortunately, there are not enough of us to override a \nPresidential veto of the legislation like we passed in this House \ndefunding Planned Parenthood. There are not enough of us to get a \nconstitutional amendment to the States saying that life begins at \nconception.\n  But we have got to continue to fight. It is our duty, it is our moral \nduty, to defend the unborn.\n  It has been 43 years since Roe v. Wade. It is my prayer it is not \nanother 43 years before America comes to its senses and respect for \nlife, all life, becomes the law of the land again.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Texas for, again, \na very eloquent statement, and my hope is that people are listening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, not only for \nyielding, but also for the many decades you have spent of trying to \nprotect the lives of our Nation's and, indeed, the world's most \nvulnerable.\n  Mr. Speaker, soon we will mark the 43rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a \ndecision that has irreparably damaged our Nation for generations and \nwill continue to do so until it is reversed.\n  Since the Supreme Court decision, as you have heard earlier, America \nhas lost 57 million defenseless and innocent lives, while millions more \nhave been deeply hurt.\n  Fortunately, the movement to protect and defend life has made \nmeaningful progress in the last year. The U.S. House of Representatives \nrecently passed protections for unborn children, after 20 weeks, which \nis something the majority of Americans support.\n  Yesterday, the House passed landmark pro-life legislation that paves \nthe way to transfer Federal funds from those who would kill children, \nunborn children, to thousands of community healthcare centers that \nprovide true comprehensive health care for women.\n\n[[Page H160]]\n\nLater this month, thousands from across the country will stand in front \nof this building to support life in our Nation's largest peaceful \nprotest.\n  We will continue to work and pray with hope and resilience, to give a \nvoice to the voiceless, to advocate for those who cannot advocate for \nthemselves, and to protect our Nation's most vulnerable.\n  As I close, I would ask all Americans to continue to pray for our \ncountry, and for our unborn children, and for those who reach out and \ntry to protect those unborn children.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  And I want to thank Mr. Flores again for another very moving speech \non behalf of the most basic human right, the right to life.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 24 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. LaMalfa), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Smith, thank you for yielding, and also thank you \nfor your amazing leadership on year after year putting this in front of \nthe people and highlighting--or lowlighting--just what this has been.\n  It is probably very mind-boggling for many Americans to contemplate \nthat this has been going on for 43 years, since the Supreme Court \nruling, out of whole cloth, Roe v. Wade. And it must be very mind-\nboggling when we remind Americans that at this time over 57 million \nabortions have been performed since that.\n  We know that over 7 million have been performed by Planned \nParenthood--7 million--making them the largest abortion provider in the \ncountry.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Yet you will hear Planned Parenthood argue that it is a tiny part of \nwhat they provide as far as what they might deem to be women's health \nservices. If it is such a minor part of what they do, then maybe they \nought not be demanding and asking for government funding. Indeed, that \nwas taken care of this week in the measure that was sent to the \nPresident's desk. We will see what the President decides to do with \nthat.\n  With Planned Parenthood providing 323,000 abortions just in 2014 and \nreceiving $550 million in taxpayer funding, we see that this is a wrong \nthat is mind-boggling to most Americans as well.\n  With the sending of that bill to the President, it is going to make a \nstrong statement that this House and this Senate can take action on \nsomething that many people, when they pay attention, find to be quite \nabhorrent. Instead, there are alternatives out there that this \nlegislation has provided that will allow women's health to be funded \nand taken care of at many other centers. Even Planned Parenthood can \nparticipate if they choose at some point to not be an abortion \nprovider.\n  The key here is that women's health will be served and that with the \ninformation and with the decisions they made being fully informed on \nthat, we can see many less abortions happen in this country as well as \nthe moral fiber and integrity of this country held up by not doing such \nan abhorrent thing in so many cases.\n  So I commend Mr. Smith and all those fellow warriors out there who \nwill be marching for life not only coming up soon this year, but they \nare out there every year battling for the cause to turn America back \naround into a place that is a little more moral and actually does care \nabout women, their health, and their mental well-being when this \ndecision has been put upon them.\n  So, to my colleague, thank you once again for allowing me here \ntonight with this because it is very important that we remember just \nhow heinous this is and how people need to be informed about that, \npause, and take time to see what this really means for America and our \nown well-being. Thank you.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Doug, thank you very much for your excellent \nremarks reminding us that Planned Parenthood alone is directly \nresponsible for killing 7 million unborn babies. That is a staggering \nloss of lives killed by one organization. So thank you for your \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin, Sean Duffy.\n  Sean offered legislation late last year that would have protected \nStates that decided to defund Planned Parenthood. It passed \noverwhelmingly, and I want to thank him for his leadership as well.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey yielding. I am \ngrateful for his powerful advocacy for the unborn in his whole tenure \nhere in Congress. You have been a true leader and an inspiration for \nsome of us who have come after you.\n  I have been in this institution for 5 years. Over the course of that \n5 years, I have heard many of my liberal friends and a lot of friends \nfrom the Congressional Black Caucus talk about how there is targeting \nand unfair treatment of African Americans in the criminal justice \nsystem. I have heard them.\n  In Financial Services, I hear them talk about how big financial \ncorporations target African Americans and minorities. As I turn on my \nTV, I listen to Black Lives Matter talk about how police and law \nenforcement are targeting African Americans and minority communities.\n  I hear a lot in this institution from minority leaders about how \ntheir communities are targeted. But what I don't hear them talk about \nis how their communities are targeted in abortion.\n  Here are some stunning facts. The African American community is 15 \npercent of the country as a whole but accounts for 40 percent of the \nabortions. Fifteen percent of Americans, 40 percent of the abortions. \nIn New York City, the most recent statistic is that African American \nwomen had more abortions than live births.\n  There is a targeting going on in a lot of spaces and a lot of places, \nand it is going on in the abortion industry. And my liberal friends, \nCongressional Black Caucus Members, talk about fighting for the \ndefenseless, the hopeless, and the downtrodden. There is no one more \nhopeless and voiceless than an unborn baby, but their silence is \ndeafening. I can't hear them. Where are they standing up for their \ncommunities, advocating and fighting for their right to life?\n  Black lives matter. They do. Indian, Asian, Hispanic, and White, all \nthose lives matter. We should fight for all life, including the life of \nthe unborn.\n  We have talked about this a lot of times. In 2 weeks, there is going \nto be an amazing march that takes place right here at the Capitol, and \nyou are going to see tens of thousands of people come out and support \nlife. You are not going to see the national media cover this. They are \ngoing to ignore tens of thousands of people.\n  Just think how powerful that rally is going to be when you have \nReverend Al Sharpton standing on the stage talking about how he is \ngoing to fight for his community and his unborn babies and all the \nCongressional Black Caucus standing behind him saying: Do you know \nwhat? We are going to fight for these defenseless and voiceless little \nbabies in our community that are being targeted.\n  And just think if our President who sheds a tear for violence goes to \nthe West Wing and sheds a tear for the unborn. I can only hope and \npray.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Martin Luther King's niece Alveda King has \nhad two abortions. She made one of the most passionate comments and \nspeeches I have ever heard when she said: How can my uncle's dream \nsurvive if we murder the children? She is now pro-life. She says: The \nother co-victim in every abortion besides the baby is the mom. And she \nis a victim herself.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Illinois, Peter Roskam, a great leader \non pro-life, first in the legislature in Illinois, and now here in \nWashington.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Thank you, Mr. Smith, for your leadership.\n  I just want to paint a picture for you and take you to a scene about \na year ago now. It was a Sunday in Chicago. I was invited to be a \nspeaker at the March for Life in downtown Chicago. I got to the speech \na little bit early and nobody was there. I was looking around, and all \nI saw was a small gaggle of pro-abortion protesters. They looked quite \npathetic, actually. There were not very many of them. They looked \nangry. They had signs that were quite ugly. I won't repeat the phrases \nthat were on the signs. It was quite a pathetic sight. I was observing \nthem,\n\n[[Page H161]]\n\nand I was kind of waiting for the event to happen.\n  Then I heard something. I started to hear music, and it was a really \ngood sound. I heard the music, and the music grew, and it became more \ndynamic and louder and louder and louder and more exciting. Then \nthousands of pro-lifers came around the corner. It was a sight to \nbehold. These were young people. They had balloons. They had yellow and \nwhite balloons. They had beautiful posters of little babies. There was \na joy to them.\n  I looked at the contrast between these two images. You have got \nyoung, dynamic, vibrant, and joyful--and pathetic on the other side. I \nthought to myself that if I needed any convincing--I don't--I am \nconvinced by the witness of these people. I choose to be with the \njoyful people.\n\n  So now where are we in history? We are 43 years into this. We are 43 \nyears into the scandal of Roe v. Wade, and yet we were told, the \ncountry was told, in 1973 when this decision came down, that this was \nall settled, that this was all done, and that there is nothing more to \nbe done about it. It is Supreme Court doctrine, and those of you who \nare opponents, you need to get over your opposition and just move \nalong, thank you.\n  But there was something that was unsettling, not just about the juris \nprudence, but about the underlying moral claim upon which Roe v. Wade \nwas built, and that was that it was built on a lie. The lie was that \nthere is nothing significant in a mother's womb when she is pregnant. \nThat, of course, is not just a lie, it is an absurdity.\n  So what has happened over the past 43 years? Science is our friend. \nMore people are coming to understand--even nonscientific people. They \nsee the ultrasounds. You have heard testimony from people who say: That \nis a life; that is a baby; that is a person; that is a boy; that is a \ngirl; and that is worthy of my defending that little child.\n  So the scandal of the Planned Parenthood videos are actually a \nseminal moment, I think, in this great debate that is underway, because \nwhat you have noticed is there are not very many people that were \ndefending the Planned Parenthood videos. Even people that purport to be \npro-choice basically said: I didn't sign up for that.\n  But yet that is exactly what abortion is. The Planned Parenthood \nvideos took the mask off of the scandal of abortion and said that when \nyou dehumanize, when you say something doesn't matter, then you can do \nanything you want to it. That is the scandal of the Planned Parenthood \nvideos.\n  So what is happening now is that there is a growing recognition among \nAmericans--many of whom probably haven't thought much about this \nquestion for a long, long time--but now the provocative nature of those \nvideos forces them to have to deal with this and reconciling their own \nunderstanding of science, their own deep feelings, and their humanity \nwith the recognition of what is the nature of this thing that is going \non? They say: Do you know what? I think I am leaning toward the pro-\nlife side.\n  We clearly see this in the data. Younger voters are much more pro-\nlife. Why is that? They recognize the truth of the science, and they \nunderstand the nature of the humanity, and they understand spiritually, \nactually, what is going on.\n  I was sent to Congress by a lot of pro-life people. I was sent to \nCongress by pro-life people that placed their confidence in me. I am \nhere to thank them, to bear witness, and to encourage them as they go \nout for the March for Life in Chicago or the March for Life in \nWashington or the March for Life anywhere. I say thanks be to God for \nthese people who have been faithful and true regardless of what the \nworld has said about them. History will exonerate the pro-life \nmovement.\n  Mr. Smith, I thank you for your time and your faithfulness.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you very much, Peter. Those were \noutstanding comments about right to life and history as well, and we \nwill prevail over time. So I want to thank you.\n  I would like to now yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Austin \nScott.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Chris, I too want to thank you for your \nwork on this issue. You are certainly one of the most passionate people \nI have seen on this issue in my years.\n  I was thinking about what I might say, and my wife sent me a text. To \nfollow up on what Mr. Roskam was saying, she asked me if I could \nFaceTime. So I stepped into the room, and I FaceTimed with my wife and \nour beautiful little 10-month-old daughter.\n  In 1973, the state-of-the-art technology was the walkie-talkie. I \ncan't help but believe that the Court ruling would be totally different \nif a 3-D ultrasound picture like I got to see of my baby when she was \n20 weeks old were put on the screen and a judge got the opportunity to \nsay, ``What do you call that?''\n  Five fingers, five toes, eyes, ears, lips, nose--you can see them. \nYou can see the hair. The technology is continuing to prove what many \nof us in this country have known all along, and that is that life \nbegins at conception and that God has given value to each and every \nsingle life.\n  I just want to take 1 more minute to say thank you to the men and \nwomen that get up every morning and that work at our pregnancy care \ncenters and help encourage those young mothers and those young families \nto have the child, to love that child, and to understand that it is a \ngift from God. There is no telling how many men and women have been \nsaved because of those volunteers at our pregnancy care centers \nthroughout this country. So I want to say thank you to them.\n  I want to say thank you to the people at the National Right to Life \nand, in my State, Georgia Right to Life and Georgia Life Alliance for \nthe work that they have done to continue to educate people on that.\n  I want you to know this fight continues. This is a stain on our \ncountry. It is a sin that God is not going to allow us to get away \nwith. We as a nation need to accept that life begins at conception, and \nwe as Congress have a responsibility to do everything that we can to \nprotect it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you so much for those comments. I \ncouldn't agree more that the megatrend in society is to embrace the \nunborn. It is the ultrasound technology--the window to the womb--that \nhas made the difference. So thank you for your outstanding comments.\n  I would like to now yield to the gentleman from Ohio, Steve Chabot, \nthe prime sponsor of the partial-birth abortion ban. It is one of the \nmost hideous methods of abortion and has awakened many Americans to the \nviolence that is inherent in every abortion. Steve Chabot is the man \nwho wrote that law.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his \nleadership. Chris Smith has been in a leadership position on this issue \nsince before Henry Hyde. He took up the mantle for Henry. So thank you \nfor doing that, Chris. We appreciate that greatly.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  I have got a birthday coming up in a couple of weeks. It happens to \nbe on January 22, which is the day that that horrific decision--the Roe \nv. Wade decision--was issued by the United States Supreme Court.\n  On my birthday now, I can't help but think about all those who are \nnot among us because their mother made a different decision than my mom \nmade almost 63 years ago. Because of that decision, those little \ninnocent unborn children aren't with us.\n  My district is Cincinnati. We have had some of the original founding \nleaders of the pro-life movement there, especially Dr. Jack and Barb \nWillke, who passed away within the last couple of years. But they were \nthe leaders. The torch has been taken up by people like Paula Westwood, \nwho now heads up Cincinnati's Right to Life.\n  As Mr. Smith mentioned, we have made some progress. I was honored to \nhave been able to play a role in passing the ban on partial birth \nabortion, which is now the law of the land, as well as the Born-Alive \nInfants Protection Act.\n  When we consider the reprehensible practices of organizations like \nPlanned Parenthood and what goes on there in their facilities all \nacross America, it shows that we have a long way to go. As discouraging \nas it can get sometimes, we must never give up, never give up in our \nfight to protect the most innocent among us, the unborn.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you very much, Chairman Chabot.\n  Chairman Chabot also is the full committee chairman of the Small\n\n[[Page H162]]\n\nBusiness Committee and has done yeoman's work on behalf of the unborn \nsince he has been here, which is for a very long time.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend, Mr. Smith, for all his work on this \nissue.\n  When I was a young boy unable to read and my mother would read \nstories from the Bible, it was so enlightening. As I began to read in \nelementary school and read the Bible for myself, I was always so \nperplexed to read that there were generations thousands of years ago \nthat devolved and degenerated to the point that they would sacrifice \ntheir own children on the alter to avail other idols.\n  It appeared clear that there is not much that is more despicable to \nGod, and it makes sense for anyone who believes there could be a God \nthat there could be nothing more despicable than the taking of innocent \nlife.\n  That is what you find in the Bible. It may have been allowed to go on \nfor generations for years. But when the wrath came, it was judgment \nthat was truly ungodly.\n  Since 1973, the realization that here in America we have been \nsacrificing the most innocent--before they could even be capable of \nsaying a lie, stealing, any wrong whatsoever, their lives are taken \naway from them.\n  And then to further realize that you have some legislators that have \nfought to prevent children that were attempted to be aborted, that were \nborn alive--they fought to let them die even after they are born alive. \nThen you realize one such legislator now has been voted into the White \nHouse. It is a bit scary, where we are in America.\n  I know there are some that say: You are a man. You can't complain \nabout the sacrifice of unborn children on the alter of inconvenience.\n  I am not a slave, never have been, but I would hope that, if I were \nalive 200 years ago, I would have stood with John Quincy Adams, I would \nhave stood with the abolitionists, to say: How can we expect God to \nkeep blessing America when we are treating our brothers and sisters \nwith chains and bondage?\n  Well, I am alive today. We need to stop the sacrifice of the most \ninnocent and the most helpless among us. Our judgment will be coming \none way or another.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my friend for his eloquent remarks.\n  I just want to conclude, Mr. Speaker.\n  Some day future generations will look back on America and wonder how \nand why such a seemingly enlightened society so blessed and endowed \nwith education, advanced science, information, wealth, and opportunity \ncould have failed to protect the most innocent and the most \ninconvenient.\n  History will not look favorably on today's abortion culture. I do \nbelieve we must replace it and work tirelessly to replace it with a \nculture of life.\n  Modern medicine and scientific breakthroughs, especially the \nwidespread use of ultrasound, has shattered the pernicious myth that \nunborn children are mere blobs of tissue and that abortion is anything \nbut an act of violence.\n  A few years ago I met with Linda Shrewsbury, an academic and African \nAmerican with a degree from Harvard, who spoke and said:\n  ``The lies that brought me to that day and its sorrowful aftermath \nare crystal clear in my mind--falsehoods and deceptions that concealed \nthe truth about abortion. Lies planted in my thinking by clever \nmarketing, media campaigns and endless repetition led to a tragic \nirreversible decision--the death of my first child.''\n  ``At age 20, I had no inkling of the mental and emotional darkness I \nwas about to enter.''\n  ``After spending many years in denial, I did eventually find healing. \nWhen I understood and rejected distortions about fetal development, \ndoublespeak about choice, rights, planned and wanted children, I \nunderstood the reality and victimhood of my aborted child. I understood \nthe absence of moral bases for choosing to 'dis-entitle' an innocent \nhuman being of life. When I embraced truth, truth set me free and I \nfinally gained inner peace.''\n  We believe that there are two victims in every abortion: the unborn \nbaby and the mother. Linda Shrewsbury found peace. We need to protect \nwomen from the violence of abortion, as well as babies.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H162-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H162-H167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CHILD CARE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, a couple of decades ago support for \nchild care fell under conservative attack. At the time, the argument \nwent that offering low cost or free child care to working families \nwould create an incentive for women to leave their homes and their \ntraditional roles as caretakers.\n  That argument attempted to capitalize on panic about the collapse of \nthe so-called traditional families. But to be honest, I don't think it \never had teeth in the first place.\n  The reason most women left home to enter the workforce, the real \nreason that countless women work today, is to make ends meet. In an \neconomy that is built to work for corporations and their CEOs, working \nfamilies have found themselves trying to stretch every dollar.\n  The leadership of this House seems content to keep that struggle \ngoing. It is time to take a second look at policies that will help our \nmiddle class. It is time to stand up for high-quality child care, \naccessible and affordable for every family, and a childcare workforce \nthat earns the pay they deserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to make something very clear. This is neither an \nisolated problem, nor is it one with limited impact. This is the new \nnormal. In addition to outrageous costs, limited access to quality \nchild care and pre-K means stunted development for children and further \ndivision between those with means and those without.\n  If you have got the resources, child care that costs more than the \nmedian rent isn't a big deal. If you have got the resources, child care \nthat costs more than tuition at a public college across more than half \nof the country isn't a big deal.\n  If you have got the resources, you can give your child a leg up with \npre-K and child care that sets them up for academic success, higher \nwages, and better jobs and careers.\n  If you don't have these resources because you are working minimum-\nwage jobs or your wages have been flat for years or you are one of the \nhundreds of thousands of Americans still unemployed, leaders in \nCongress say: Well, too bad about that. That is unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, the average cost of child care for a family with an \ninfant and a 4-year-old is $17,755. In my State of New Jersey, the \naverage cost for the same family would be $21,000.\n  That price tag is outrageous, and it probably has quite a bit to do \nwith why only 35 percent of pre-school-age children are currently \nenrolled in pre-K programs despite the benefits that pre-K offers.\n  Ninety percent of brain development happens before the age of 5. \nEvery dollar invested in early childhood education returns in public \nbenefits. There are few better ways we can spend our money.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is one more reason we are making this a priority. \nThe teachers responsible for our youngest minds earn salaries that \ncannot cover the expenses of their own families. While first grade \nteachers earn roughly $45,000 annually, pre-K teachers earn only \n$27,000.\n  These men and women hold one of the most important roles in our \nsociety and make some of the greatest impacts on our kids. They deserve \npay that matches the value they offer.\n  This issue has waited long enough for attention from this Nation's \nleaders. It is time for Congress to make sure that every family has \naccess to child care and early childhood education.\n\n[[Page H163]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in calling \nfor our fellow Members of Congress to come together to assist \nhardworking families and children.\n  We need to act together to provide parents and caregivers with the \nresources necessary to ensure that every family has access to safe and \naffordable child care.\n  Specifically today, I am speaking out for the over 157,000 children \nin the foster care system who are 5 years old or younger.\n  Congress must face two important facts. The cost of child care is \nhaving a detrimental impact on working families, and it is our children \nwho suffer as a result.\n  In my home city of Los Angeles, it is estimated that an annual income \nof nearly $74,000 is necessary to secure a modest, yet adequate, \nstandard of living for a two-parent, two-child family.\n  In reality, some of the neighborhoods I represent have a median \nhousehold income of less than $28,000 a year, which translates to more \nthan $45,000 below what is needed for a modest standard of living.\n  To make up this difference, far too many working families, especially \nsingle-parent families, are forced to put their children into \ninadequate child care, which is often what they can afford.\n  After a baby is born, too many mothers and fathers must immediately \nreturn to work in order to pay bills, and one of those bills becomes \nskyrocketing childcare costs.\n  In fact, there are many children who wind up in the foster care \nsystem because their parents have left them unsupervised because they \nhad to make a choice: stay home because they didn't have child care or \ngo to work and leave those children unattended. When parents make that \ndecision, they can wind up then losing custody of their children to the \nfoster care system.\n  Last January President Obama took a bold step to support children and \nworking families by proposing to expand access to high-quality child \ncare for low-income families.\n  In partnership with States, this investment will help over 1 million \nadditional young children over the next decade by supporting States' \nefforts to build up the supply of quality child care available to low-\nincome families.\n  One way to solve the childcare needs of working families is to \narrange for someone other than parents to care for children. My home \nState of California has taken a different approach.\n  For over a decade, California has offered paid family leave to help \nworking families stay at home to take care of a new child. This law is \nnot only helping mothers bond with their newborn children, but it is \nalso enabling more and more men to take time off work when a child is \nborn, ensuring that more fathers stay involved with their children's \nlives.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  We can say we support families, but to truly put families first, \nCongress needs to come together to provide effective paid family leave \nto mothers and fathers when a baby is born.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from California for all \nof the advocacy she represents for those young people, those children, \nwho are most vulnerable to us.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from \nOregon (Ms. Bonamici), who is the sponsor of the Progressive Caucus' \nuniversal childcare resolution.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I also thank the gentlewoman from California for her wise remarks and \nfor her leadership, especially on issues facing foster children in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss a very important issue \nthat affects many families across the country, and that is the need for \naffordable, quality child care and to encourage all of my colleagues to \ncosponsor House Resolution 386. This resolution, which I introduced in \nJuly, with the support of 27 original cosponsors, affirms the \ncommitment of Congress to put high-quality child care within the reach \nof every hardworking family, regardless of how much one earns.\n  Mr. Speaker, access to high-quality child care is essential to the \nwell-being of children and families. Really, when we think about our \neconomic future and about the quality of life in our communities, these \nare such important issues. I will share with you a real story.\n  Deondre is a 9-year-old boy in Oregon who understands this issue \nwell. He shared this experience with his childcare provider, Ms. Renee, \nwho takes care of him and his brother while his mother goes to school \nand works.\n  Deondre said: ``My mom works and goes to school. Sometimes she is \ndone by 6:30, but, other days, she is not done until midnight... Ms. \nRenee,'' he says, ``picks both of us up from school, makes us dinner, \nhelps us with homework, and puts us to bed.''\n  Mr. Speaker, Deondre's story is just one example, but it illustrates \nthe critical role that childcare providers play in children's lives, \nand it emphasizes the value of high-quality child care for working \nparents.\n  It is pretty clear, though, that our policies have not kept pace with \nour changing family structure and with our evolving workforce. In more \nthan 60 percent of the married couples with children in the United \nStates, both parents are working. In more than 40 percent of \nhouseholds, mothers are the sole or primary breadwinners for the \nfamilies, and 34 percent of children are living with an unmarried \nparent. Access to affordable, quality child care is critical to the \nstability of families and to the communities across the country.\n  Childcare costs also affect children's well-being and the local \neconomy. In Washington, D.C., for example, families pay more than \n$20,000 each year, on average, for a child's care; and in many States, \nincluding in my home State of Oregon, the cost of child care exceeds \nin-State tuition at public universities. We hear a lot about how rising \ntuition costs create barriers to accessing postsecondary education, and \nthis, too, is a critical issue. I know many of my colleagues in both \nthe House and the Senate--frankly, on both sides of the aisle--are \neager to curb the cost of college to enable more students to get a \nhigher education. Yet, in many places, the cost of caring for our \ninfants often outpaces the cost of earning a university diploma.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to be addressing the soaring costs of child care \nwith the same urgency with which we seek to rein in college costs. Just \nas shutting students out of college has tremendous economic \nconsequences, the fact that families must spend a growing share of \ntheir incomes on child care also comes with consequences. This is going \nto require some long-term thinking, and we have to really look into our \nfuture as to what this investment means for our families.\n  Sadly, but not surprisingly, low-income families tend to be the \nhardest hit by the rising costs of child care. Some families with \nlimited means spend about 40 percent of their household incomes on \nchild care, and some estimates suggest that the inability of employees \nto find reliable child care costs companies billions of dollars in lost \noutput. We see some companies now having on-site child care--and that \nis great--but they are few and far between.\n  The high cost of child care is truly an issue of equity. When \nfamilies are forced to make sacrifices to care for young children, \nthese sacrifices disproportionately fall upon women and people of \ncolor. A recent Pew Research study found that, over the last 15 years, \nthe cost of child care has likely contributed to an increasing number \nof mothers who have to put their careers on hold. Of course, there is \nnothing wrong with parents who choose to stay home with their \nchildren--absolutely not, when that is their choice--but for many \nparents in low-income households, leaving jobs to care for children is \nnot a choice. These parents cannot afford to work and pay for child \ncare.\n  What do they do?\n  Before childcare costs became unaffordable, more mothers were joining \nthe workforce, were pursuing careers, and were contributing to the \nfinancial stability of families. Additionally, the childcare field \nprimarily employs women, many of whom are underpaid--probably most of \nwhom are underpaid. In fact, a new Economic Policy Institute study \nfound that childcare workers are approximately twice as likely as other \nworkers to live below the poverty line.\n\n[[Page H164]]\n\n  When I went to college years ago, I had a friend who ran the \nchildcare center at the university. He made a comment to me once that \nreally stuck with me. He said that people pay more per hour to park \ntheir cars in the parking garage than they do to have them look after \ntheir children. Now, that is unacceptable. It is important to pay \nchildcare workers well so we can recruit and retain great people to \ntake care of our children, who are the next generation. Very few \nworkers receive healthcare coverage or pension plans or any kind of \nretirement security. For many childcare workers who have children \nthemselves, the cost of child care for their own children is truly out \nof reach.\n  For many of our country's minority households, affordable child care \nis not only expensive, it is hard to find. The gap in wealth between \nWhite and Black households is the largest it has been in several \ndecades. To exacerbate these challenges, low-wage jobs frequently have \nnontraditional schedules, which makes accessing high-quality child care \nespecially difficult.\n  Mr. Speaker, many families are caught in this financial trap of \nworking parents who are struggling and who are doing their best. They \nare trying to make ends meet in the face of rising costs and stagnant \nwages, but they are forced to choose between leaving the workforce to \ncare for their children, which can push their families closer to \npoverty, and handing over their paychecks to cover the cost of child \ncare, which has a similar result on their household finances.\n  In reality, there is no easy solution for these distressed families--\ndistressed and stressed, I might add. More than 60 percent of young \nchildren attend child care so that their working parents can earn a \nliving. At the same time, child care costs more than $10,000 a year in \nmany places--here in D.C., it is even more--and it too often rises \nfaster than household incomes; but the problems caused by unaffordable \nchild care extend beyond family finances.\n\n  High-quality early childhood education produces many benefits for \nchildren that continue well into the future, and this is that long-term \ninvestment that I am talking about. Children who access these programs \nsee long-term benefits, including success in school, improved \nemployment outcomes, and good health. When families can't access those \nhigh-quality childcare programs, their children may lose access to some \nof the benefits of early learning, like developing literacy and \nteamwork skills.\n  Congress does have a role to play in addressing these problems, and \nthis is one of the most important investments we can make in our \nfuture. We must advance these existing programs that are effective at \nsupporting working families and that are preparing children for success \ndown the road.\n  Head Start is an example of one such program. It serves, roughly, a \nmillion low-income people--more than 12,000 in my home State of Oregon. \nFor each of these children and families, Head Start provides a quality \nearly childhood education and increases access to health insurance, \nhousing assistance, and job training. If you have never visited one of \nyour Head Start facilities in your district, I encourage you to do so. \nThey are really working hard to engage the families and to really get \nthat early learning.\n  The benefits of Head Start for families and children are well-\ndocumented. Last year, more than 200,000 families in Head Start \nreceived job training and adult education services, and studies show \nthat children in Head Start are better prepared for kindergarten and \nthat they make gains in learning and in social-emotional development. \nPreschool Development Grants, including a new program that just passed \nrecently as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act, will help States to \nimprove access to early childhood education programs.\n  Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to do its part to promote \nuniversal prekindergarten programs. On a related note, my State of \nOregon is instituting full-day kindergarten next year, and Congress \nshould consider how it can support similar efforts in other States.\n  Also, Federal child nutrition programs, including the Child and Adult \nCare Food Program, increase children's access to nutritious meals. We \nexpect children to learn and to do well and to thrive, but if they are \nhungry, they can't do that, Mr. Speaker. The Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram can help to deflect some of the childcare costs that are passed \ndown to parents while also encouraging healthy eating habits and \nsupporting children's development.\n  I have introduced the Early Childhood Nutrition Improvement Act. This \nis a bipartisan bill that makes commonsense, positive changes to the \nChild and Adult Care Food Program. This bill will encourage more \nchildcare providers to participate in the program, which, in turn, \nmeans that more American children will receive nutritious meals and \nthat more childcare providers will receive support to provide those \nmeals--again, getting a good, healthy start for those kids in our \ncommunities.\n  The Early Childhood Nutrition Improvement Act also authorizes \nchildcare providers to offer additional healthy meals or snacks. Many \nworking families rely on full-day care, but the Child and Adult Care \nFood Program only supports two meals a day. A child who is in care all \nday--sometimes until 8 p.m. or even later--needs to get a nutritious \nmeal in the evening. That is good for kids, it is good for families, \nand it is good for our future.\n  Prekindergarten and child nutrition programs are examples of how the \nFederal Government and we in Congress are playing an important and \neffective role in supporting working families and in investing in \nbetter outcomes for those families in the future; but, Mr. Speaker, we \ncertainly could be doing more. Congress should promote fair work \nschedules, paid time off for parents and caregivers, which my State \njust did at the State level, and higher wages for working families, \nincluding for people who work in the childcare field.\n  I want to add, Mr. Speaker--and my colleague from California \nmentioned this--that many moms now go back to work within 2 weeks of \ngiving birth. For those women here who are listening and who have given \nbirth, you know how challenging that is for families. Twenty-five \npercent of women in this country go back to work 2 weeks after giving \nbirth. We are the only industrialized country in the world that does \nnot offer paid leave for women who have children. We need to change \nthat and get a better start for our kids, for our moms, and we need to \nrespect those working families.\n  As we continue to pursue efforts to make child care affordable for \nall families, I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor H. Res. 386. Let's \nshow our support for our country's childcare workforce, its children, \nits hardworking families, and the future of our families and our \ncountry.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from Oregon very much \nfor her work, for her resolution, and for her advocacy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nFattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. Let me thank the gentlewoman who has organized this \nSpecial Order.\n  There is no greater cause that could be the focus of our attention in \nthis august body than that of future generations of Americans. Too much \ntime is focused on the next election, so I want to thank the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey for focusing the House today on the next \ngeneration.\n  Mr. Speaker, with certainty, we know that early childhood, quality \ndaycare, and early education are the fundamental building blocks. We as \na nation are competing with countries like China and India, which have \nvery populated nations. We need to make sure that every single American \nchild has the ability to rise up to his potential so that our Nation \ncan remain number one in the world.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies. In the last couple of weeks, \nwe have done our work and have passed the appropriations bill, and, \nthis year, we have made some progress. I first want to talk about the \ngood news.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  We did appropriate $2.7 billion for the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant, and we increased it over last year, FY15, by $326 million. \nNow, that is the good news. The problem, of\n\n[[Page H165]]\n\ncourse, is that we still are a far cry away from providing for every \nfamily that will be eligible opportunities at affordable child care.\n  Let me give you a ``for instance'' closer to home. I represent the \nbirthplace of our democracy, Philadelphia. I think it is one of the \ngreatest cities in the world. We spent about $300 million this year on \nHead Start and childcare activities, almost all of it Federal money; \n$190 million are coming out of the Child Care Block Grant I referenced \nearlier, some $300 million. We are only providing for 33 percent of the \nfamilies in Philadelphia who would be eligible for child care through \nthis effort. So we need to do more.\n  Hopefully, the city and the State will be partners in this effort, \nbut our Nation has to see this, as President Nixon once said, as a \nnational imperative, that is, that we have a national interest in every \none of these children living up to their potential.\n  Now, 2 years ago, in a series done by WHYY and NewsWorks, they \nfocused on child care. They told this story on one occasion about a \nyoung lady by the name of Queen Muse who was getting her degree from La \nSalle University, taking graduate courses. She was working very, very \nhard. She was rising at a very early hour to drop off her young \ndaughter at a family member's home because she couldn't afford \nappropriate child care and affordable child care.\n  Now, here is someone doing what we want them to do, getting a college \neducation, getting a graduate degree. We need to be doing more to \nprovide those early rungs on the ladder of opportunity for those who \nare in the early stages of family formulation and, in some cases, who \nare raising children as single parents. So there is much more that we \ncan do.\n  In Philadelphia, we have a system that, even though not perfect, is \nworking very well. I know through CCIS out on Greene Street in \nnorthwest Philadelphia, there is an opportunity where families and \nparents can get access to quality child care, federally funded as a \ncontractor with the Urban League. Again, we need to do more, and that \nis why I came here to the floor this evening.\n  Now, I know that the Nation is preparing for the President's town \nmeeting on guns tonight, and that is another issue related to families \nand family safety. We totally support the President's efforts in that \nregard, and I am going to work with the administration as a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee to help fund those gun safety activities.\n  In terms of child care, this is about families also, and making sure \nthat the youngest among us have every opportunity to learn and to grow. \nIn fact, we know through the work we have done on brain science now \nthat, as the Congresswoman from New Jersey says, this is the period of \ntime in which the brain is like a sponge. It can learn almost anything. \nWe should be doing so much more in our early childhood efforts, in our \nchildcare efforts to develop the language skills and the reading skills \nfor these young people as the basic building blocks for their lifelong \neducation\n  So I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and much more importantly, I \nthank her for her extraordinary leadership on the most important issue \nin our Nation, and that is the preparation of future generations of \nAmerican leaders.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for his wise words and the wisdom that has come with this \nexperience.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman \nfrom New Jersey for her continued leadership as she brings those of us \nin the Congressional Progressive Caucus to the floor to speak on issues \nof concern for the American people.\n  Let me also thank the gentlewoman from Oregon for her leadership. I \nam delighted to be an original cosponsor of her very important \nlegislation that is championed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus \nthat is really demanding and calling for high quality, guaranteed, \naffordable, and accessible child care for every American family and a \nstrong childcare workforce that is paid a living wage, at least $15 an \nhour, and has a voice on their job.\n  I have alongside of me just a picture of children that may be any \nchild here in America, happy and smiling. Mr. Speaker, that is why we \nare standing on the floor of the House today, because as Americans and \nas Members of the United States Congress it is our responsibility to be \nable to provide for the happiness and smiling of our children.\n  So I tell a story, as I begin my remarks, on the importance of this \nSpecial Order and the importance of child care. Just a few years ago in \nmy area in Houston, parents got a call that no parent wants to receive. \nThese were parents of little children, and they got a call to come \nrushing to their daycare center. They were rushing because their \ndaycare center was on fire.\n  The tragedy is a young woman who had this business, whose family gave \nher this business so that she could have something to do and an income, \nhad stepped away and went to a store and left little children under the \nage of 5 alone by themselves while a boiling pot of some form of food \nwas on the stove. What happened was obviously that the pot caught fire \nand babies lost their lives, babies who could not move or help each \nother. She came rushing back with great remorse and emotion, but those \nbabies were gone.\n  That is the story of child care, Mr. Speaker. It is so very important \nthat every child has the potential for greatness, and that is why child \ncare is so important. In today's economy, the need for child care is a \nreality for the vast majority of families, but most working parents \ncan't afford it, even while childcare teachers are not even paid \nenough. Childcare teachers are struggling themselves and can't provide \nfor their own children. Low wages and a lack of benefits lead in the \nhigh turnover.\n  In the instance of childcare centers across America, many of them are \nunregulated. Additionally, parents are struggling. On average, center-\nbased child care for two children can cost more than rent or mortgage \nin every State. No one who works hard should have the downside as they \ncare for other's children to not be able to care for theirs.\n  In 2011, 49 percent of children ages zero to 4 with employed mothers \nwere primarily cared for by a relative, their father, grandparents, \nsibling, other relative, or mother, primarily because they could not \nafford other sources. Center-based care was 26 percent. Grandparents \nwas 21 percent. Other relatives was 6 percent.\n  Over 8 million children live in a single-parent household. Seventy-\nsix percent of these single-parent households were employed. Sixty-\nseven percent of women in the workforce had a child under the age of 6. \nThirty percent of women work at night and have a child under the age of \n5. Twenty-nine percent of children in need of child care have multiple \narrangements for child care that can include relatives or skilled \nchildcare services. Sixteen percent of children in need of childcare \nservices live in poverty.\n  The high cost of child care, the cost of full-time infant care across \nthe United States in 2012 ranged from $4,600 to $20,000. Mr. Speaker, \nthat is more sometimes than a part-time worker makes or even a full-\ntime worker makes. That is saying to the American people, to women, to \nfathers, and to grandparents that we do not care about your children. \nThe cost of full-time care for a 4-year-old ranged from $3,900 to \n$15,000, and the cost of before- and afterschool programs ranged from \n$1,950 to $10,000.\n  It is important, as we stand on the floor today, to make this \nstatement: that guaranteed child care is really a necessity. It is a \nright. Why? Because I remember the Declaration of Independence, though \nnot the Constitution, that talks about the pursuit of happiness. What \nmore pursuit of happiness is there than to ensure that the children who \nare pictured here on this poster board have the right and opportunity \nto quality child care and for parents to not have that very devastating \ncall, the call a parent who is doing everything they can to provide for \nthe family to rush away from their job because their babies had died in \na raging fire because an unregulated childcare provider left to go \nshopping while a food pot was burning on the stove?\n  Recently, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services \nbegan\n\n[[Page H166]]\n\na ``Don't Be in the Dark Campaign'' to educate the parents about the \ndangers of placing children in unregulated child care in Texas. The \nimportance of regulated child care becomes unavoidably clear when one \nconsiders the fact that 13 children died in unregulated care. In 2006, \n18 children died in unregulated care in the State of Texas.\n  In order to stop deaths like this, we need universal care, we need \nquality care, we need teachers and workers who love what they are doing \nas they do, but are paid a livable wage, $15, so they too can provide \nfor their families.\n  Unfortunately, safe and affordable child care is not available as \nmuch as it should be in the State of Texas. Many working parents rely \non State-subsidized care to meet their needs. In 2007, the Statewide \nwaiting list for subsidized care was 17,000 in January, and it moved to \n46,000 in October.\n  So it is important to note, for example, in Austin, it costs about \n$43 a day to provide for full daycare for a toddler. However, the State \nwill only pay a small amount.\n  So this is a very important Special Order. It is to reinforce the \nfact that our obligation is to safely secure our children and to \ninclude our children in the constitutional rights, if you will, of \nproviding for them the sense of a quality of life that is worthy of \nthem as the future of our Nation.\n  I join with my colleagues in speaking about and supporting this \nresolution, but I also join with them to support the full funding of \nHead Start. Many times we will see that those who were a part of Head \nStart, in fact, Head Start was very important to their growth and their \nprogress.\n  I also want to include these agencies in my community, AVANCE and \nNeighborhood Centers, and say that if we had the universal access to \nchild care, many faith institutions and others could be part of \nregulated, certified, clean child care that could be made more \nreasonable for those working parents who work very odd hours and work \ninto the night and early morning and need the kind of around-the-clock \nchild care that is so necessary.\n  So I want to thank Congresswoman Watson Coleman for her leadership, \nand I leave this podium again by saying every child in America is \nprecious. Even as we hear those discussing issues of choice and issues \nthat sometimes women have to make, we know that we love our children. \nWhy don't we, as the children are here, as they are toddlers and \ninfants and growing up, make sure that no child goes longing for love, \nfor food, for resources, and no child goes longing for quality child \ncare.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas \nfor her leadership and her commitment to every child in this country.\n  I yield to my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Scott), who is ever \nvigilant and diligent as it relates to preparing, educating, and \nensuring our better generations to come.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Watson Coleman for \nher leadership on all of these issues, particularly education.\n  There is a growing bipartisan understanding that in order for our \nNation's children, especially those in low-income communities, to \nfulfill their potential and succeed in college and career, that we must \nexpand access to affordable, high-quality, early learning \nopportunities.\n  Decades of research shows that properly nurturing children in early \nyears of life supports enhanced brain development, cognitive \nfunctioning, and emotional and physical health. Research has also shown \nthat one investment that leads to better educational outcomes, stronger \njob earnings, and lower crime rates is quality early learning programs. \nThese programs help prevent and reduce achievement gaps for low-income \nstudents and create long-term benefits for our Nation, such as lower \ncrime rates, lower teen pregnancy rates, and higher high school \ngraduation rates.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Yesterday I attended a screening of the documentary ``The Raising of \nAmerica,'' which explained the challenges working families have in \nraising children and helping them succeed. Even though there is nearly \nuniversal understanding of the importance of high-quality, early-\nlearning opportunities, many families are not able to afford or access \nthese opportunities. As the documentary clearly explained, working \nfamilies are more productive than ever, but our Nation lacks the \nFederal policies that these families need in order to better balance \ntheir work and family responsibilities.\n  For example, unpredictable, unstable schedules place an undue burden \non working families, impacting their ability to maintain child care. We \nare among the richest nations in the world. The United States is the \nonly such nation that does not provide paid leave to families to invest \ntime in early development of their children. The United States doesn't \neven provide universal access to quality, affordable child care. This \nis simply unacceptable.\n  The Democrats on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce \nhave been working with our colleagues in the Democratic Caucus on a \nworking families agenda. This agenda supports families by giving them \nthe tools that they need to better balance work and family.\n  The working families agenda calls for commonsense policies, such as \npaid sick leave, paid family leave, and access to universal, high-\nquality child care to help balance work and family responsibilities. In \naddition, it supports increased wages by calling for an increased \nminimum wage and legislation to reduce discrimination in the workforce.\n  But access to high-quality child care is an integral part of the \nworking family's agenda. In the recently passed spending bill, we \nincreased funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grants by \n$326 million. This increase is a strong, positive step in the right \ndirection, but we must build on this effort.\n  That is because over 20 States cannot serve all of the eligible \nfamilies, and some States aren't even accepting eligible participants \nto sign up on their wait list. Now, we are not talking about whether \nthe child is eligible or not or whether they receive it, but whether a \nchild can even be placed on a wait list to hope for funding.\n  If we want parents to work and we want children to be able to \ndetermine their futures, if we want strong and stable families, we must \nprovide these families with access to high-quality child care and other \nearly-learning opportunities. These efforts are a national priority, \nand all children deserve the opportunity to reach their full potential.\n  Again, I want to thank you for your leadership for bringing this \nissue to a Special Order.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Congressman, thank you for taking your time and \nsharing with us.\n  We are all familiar with the phrase, ``putting your money where your \nmouth is.'' Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago we voted for a bill to fund \ngovernment programs and extend tax cuts. While that bill was an \nimportant step forward compromise, it was far from perfect. It put our \nenvironment at risk by selling petroleum overseas and made countless \ntax breaks for multinational corporations and special interests \npermanent. Although it did extend programs like the child tax credit, \nit didn't do nearly enough to protect working families or ensure a \nbright future for our Nation. We are in a new year, and we have got a \nchance for a fresh start, so let's make affordable child care part of \nthat new start.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to switch gears now and discuss an equally \nimportant topic that those in control of this House have tried to \nignore, a topic that the President took action on this week.\n  Gun violence is one of the greatest challenges this Nation faces. \nOver the past 10 years, we have lost more than 100,000 people to guns. \nMillions more have been victims of assaults, of robberies, and of other \ncrimes where a gun was involved, and many of the individuals in \npossession of these weapons shouldn't have had them in the first place.\n  Three years since Newtown, just over a month since San Bernardino and \nColorado Springs, and with the dark memories of shootings of every \nscale in every city hovering over us constantly, it is time for change. \nGun violence in the United States runs the gamut of motivations--from \nmental illness, to religious extremism, to political extremism, to \ndisastrous accidents--but they all involve a firearm.\n\n[[Page H167]]\n\n  Many of these incidents are suicide, but they are all linked by the \nsimple fact that they involve a firearm because in the United States of \nAmerica a group of ideologues have hidden behind misguided readings of \nthe Constitution and make guns available to everyone imaginable, even \nfolks on the terrorist watch list.\n  The reality is that gun violence is an epidemic, and the NRA, along \nwith those who blindly follow it, are deeply out of touch. When another \ntragedy strikes, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle reliably \ncall for moments of silence right here on the floor. While I support \nremembering victims, I cannot support silence where action is needed. \nSilence, Mr. Speaker, is what keeps weapons on our streets. Silence is \nthe reason we have lost friends, sons, daughters, brothers, and \nsisters. Silence is why we are the only developed nation in the world \nwith this problem.\n  The President has put forward a set of executive actions that make \nsense at the most basic level, from strengthening background checks and \nbolstering enforcement to improving mental health services and research \non gun safety. The simple, commonsense measures President Obama \nannounced this week will save countless lives.\n  It is now up to us here in Congress to take the baton. Mr. Speaker, \nit is common sense that someone who is not allowed to fly because they \nare a suspected terrorist shouldn't be able to get a gun. It is common \nsense to ensure a standard uniform background check before someone can \npurchase a weapon. It is common sense that you should have to present \nidentification to buy bullets, and it is time for our colleagues to \nstand up for common sense.\n  As the President said, we need to do it with the fierce urgency of \nnow.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H167-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H167-H170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN CONTROL IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) \nis recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nminority leader.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New \nJersey, and I thank her for guiding us over the past couple of minutes \ndealing with an important issue.\n  Let me quickly move us forward because, in just a few minutes, the \nPresident of the United States will join with a number of Americans on \na very important townhall meeting dealing with the question of this \nvery important issue of gun violence.\n  Today I rise as the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity, and Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on the \nJudiciary, but I rise also, as my colleague, as a member of the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus that has been at the leadership. I \nthank both Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Ellison for their leadership \nand the opportunity for this time.\n  Again, much was made of the fact that the President, in his last \nterm, or his last year, sought to take on this very complicated issue. \nMuch was made of the fact that the President chose gun violence as \nsomething that he took a personal and emotional interest in.\n  Let me be very clear. There is never a time that is too short a time \nto confront the horrors of gun violence in this country. Let me give \nyou simply an example of what we face not with adults who have \nconfronted each other with a gun, but toddlers who are getting shot on \na weekly basis. For example, a 2-year-old in South Carolina found a gun \nin the backseat of the car he was riding in and accidentally shot his \ngrandmother, who was sitting in the passenger's seat.\n  I found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a \ntoddler 3 or younger. In 31 of these 43 cases, a toddler found a gun \nand shot himself or herself. These stories are emotional and they are \nreal. In one instance, a 3-year-old managed to wound both of his \nparents with a single gunshot at an Albuquerque motel. Shootings by \ntoddlers have happened in 24 States so far this year.\n  There is a story that comes to mind dealing with a little boy, a \nloving little boy in Kentucky who accidentally shot his 2-year-old \nsister to death. Why? Because someone gave him a gun made by a \nmanufacturer who made guns for children.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to make moral judgments. That is \nsomething that I would not do, give a child that is 5 years old a gun. \nBut what I am here to speak to is how we can come together, those who \nadvocate and use guns, those who believe in open carry, those who \nbelieve in concealed weapons, those who believe in rifle shooting and \ndeer hunting. All of that is part of the American way. There is no \nangst with that.\n  What I am saying and what the President is saying with a tearful, \nemotional plea that he made just a few days ago is that we in America \ncan do better. The Constitution says we can do better. The Declaration \nof Independence says we can do better. The First Amendment clearly \nprovides us the access and the rights of free speech and movement, and \nthe Second Amendment is clear that we do have a right to bear arms.\n  Many of us historically believe that that was, of course, an \namendment put in place to protect the beginning Founding Fathers and \nMothers, if you will, in these early Colonies and to make sure that \nthey were not overrun by the British. But it is still a standing \namendment, and it takes a procedure for it to be undermined, which is \nthe argument that I make for those who continuously raise the fact that \nthe President and those of us who believe in gun safety or gun \nregulation--which is not controlled--are, in fact, trying to diminish \nthe Second Amendment. We are not.\n  But what we are trying to do is to do as the President has suggested: \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands through background checks. For \nexample, unfortunately, the tragedy in South Carolina, Charleston, \nSouth Carolina, where a crazed individual wanted to provoke a race war, \nworshipped with nine parishioners at Mother Emanuel Church, sat and \nprayed with the pastor, a distinguished senator, and those other loving \nsaints, then sprayed bullets and killed nine of them, that individual \nhad items in his background that should have warranted him not getting \na gun.\n  But what happened under law? The storekeeper, the gunshop owner, \nafter 3 days when that particular affirmation or approval had not come, \nhe gave the gun anyway. Foolish. It is so very foolish. There should be \nan extensive requirement that there is a background check when you are \nbuying a gun on the Internet or other places we are exchanging guns.\n  The President recognizes those kind of loopholes and wishes to avoid \nthose kind of loopholes. The ATF is making clear that it doesn't matter \nwhere you conduct business--from a store, at a gun show, or over the \nInternet--if you are in the business of selling firearms, you must get \na license and conduct background checks. It baffles me why some people \nhave said that won't make any difference. Yes, it will, because a lot \nof times in gun shows people who are here to do wrong are, in fact, \ngoing to be taking any easy way to get guns.\n  Let me cite you an example. I always hear that those cities who have \nrigid gun laws, it doesn't matter. This is the argument I get from my \nfriends in the NRA, and I call them my friends because I hope one day \nwe will sit down at the table of engagement and collaboration because \nthat is the American way.\n  Let me give you the statistics that make sense. New York has strong \ngun laws, and Governor Cuomo implemented some stronger gun laws after \ncertain tragedies occurred in his State. But here are the statistics \nthat argue and refute and extinguish the argument of the NRA: 70 \npercent of the guns recovered by police in New York State in 2013 \noriginated out of the State. The gun laws in New York are working, but \nbecause of their neighbors, they are suffering. That is why we need to \nhave a regulated system that doesn't take people's guns away, but \nprovides the safety and security that the American people determine.\n  I didn't say, Mr. Speaker, that 70 percent of the guns found in the \nhands of law-abiding citizens were from out of State. I said 70 percent \nof the guns that the New York City, NYPD, that has a\n\n[[Page H168]]\n\ngreat deal of respect across this Nation as one of the top accredited \nlaw enforcement agencies, 70 percent of those that they found were \nblack-market guns coming into that State from elsewhere. That is a \ntragedy.\n  I will tell you for sure that some of those guns were used to maim \nand kill and to fight in gun battles in the streets because we allow \nthe kind of selling of guns without background checks and people going \noff and getting gun sales in the back of cars. We know that that has \nhappened.\n  ATF has finalized a rule to require background checks for people \ntrying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items \nthrough a trust corporation or other legal entity. Whatever we might \nsay, I don't believe that it is relevant for us to have the AK-47s just \nwalking up and down the street, even if you want to say you believe in \nopen carry.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Also, overhauling the background check system to make it more \neffective and efficient. It is worth noting how many background checks \nare done. Make this 24 hours, 7 days a week. Maybe that would have \nprevented, I think, the tragedy in South Carolina. Make our communities \nsafe from guns. Call on U.S. Attorneys to explain to people about gun \nsafety.\n  When I was on the Houston City Council, I introduced the first gun \nordinance in a city--that gun safety ordinance is in place today--which \nwas to hold parents responsible for children getting guns and shooting \nsomeone. Why? Because those guns should have been secured. There is \nnothing unconstitutional about regulating and saving the lives of \nchildren.\n  Also, introducing 200 new ATF agents. I am very proud that \nCongresswoman Robin Kelly and myself--and we invite my colleagues to \njoin in this legislation--introduced legislation that would, in fact, \nprovide for 200 additional Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearm and \nExplosive agents and investigators to enforce gun laws. This is the \nvery same thing that Republicans have been talking about. It is H.R. \n4316. I invite my colleagues to join in that legislation to make a \ndifference in the lives of so many.\n  Let me say that, in addition, we want to make sure that we are \nhighlighting the importance of receiving complete criminal history \nrecords and criminal dispositions. We want our States to be \ncollaborative. Send to us the accurate records of those who perpetrate \na crime in your community. That is making this particular background \ncheck more effective. We are going to do the heavy lifting 24 hours, 7 \ndays a week with better technology.\n  Make our communities safe, as I said. Teach about gun safety. \nIncrease mental health treatment and reporting. We are talking about \n$500 million. The President needs our collaboration.\n  I am very glad that we have also introduced, along with Congresswoman \nBass, the authority to authorize funding to increase access to mental \nhealth care treatment in order to reduce gun violence.\n  In the aftermath of the President's speech, I heard all of this talk \nabout how we should be getting involved in gun violence and we should \nbe talking about gun violence. I heard one Presidential candidate \nsaying that we should be looking for the criminally ill. Well, what do \nyou think this is?\n  The President is asking for help from the ATF, and now he is asking \nfor grants and the resources to deal with the criminally ill or those \nwho are suffering from mental health issues and to stop them from \ncommitting gun violence, the very circumstance that occurred with \nrespect to the horrificness of Sandy Hook.\n  And as I hold up this poster board--the individual ultimately took \nhis life and the life of his mother--can we imagine these babies that \nlost their lives? In fact, we understand that some of those law \nenforcement officers could barely stand up as they went in and looked \nat the carnage. Certainly, that individual was known to have suffered \nfrom some form of mental illness. There should have been an \nintervention there.\n  The President is asking for resources to help us with those who are \nsuffering from mental health issues. He wants the Social Security \nAdministration, as indicated, to begin a rulemaking process to include \ninformation about beneficiaries who are, in fact, suffering from mental \nhealth needs.\n  This is not an invasion of privacy. This is information. This is not \nknocking on the door of those who are suffering from mental health \nconcerns. But it is helping us be more effective if that individual \nseeks to purchase a gun.\n  We want to shape the future of gun safety technology. The President \ndirected the Departments of Homeland Security--which I am on--Defense, \nand Justice to conduct or sponsor research. Guns can be more safe. If a \nchild gets a gun in their hand, there can be more detail to pulling \nthat trigger.\n  The little boy that shot his sister, there was one bullet left in \nthat gun. The parents didn't know it. It was left in a corner. He \npicked it up. It was his toy gun. He is a child.\n  We need to be able to be responsive and start boxing each other and \nget around the same circle of improvement. Keeping guns out of the \nwrong hands through background checks is what the President has \noffered.\n  Then, of course, we need to work to make our communities safe from \ngun violence by hiring 230 additional NICS examiners and other staff to \nassist with processing mandatory background checks.\n  I think I mentioned the mental health resources that I think are so \nvery important. I would also suggest that we ensure federally that \npeople keep their guns safe. It is very crucial that we insist that \nguns are safe.\n  Let me also indicate that Mr. Clyburn has a very important \ninitiative--he represents the district where the tragedy occurred in \nSouth Carolina--to get rid of this 3-day check and to make sure that \neveryone has a background check, no matter what is occurring.\n  Let me finish, Mr. Speaker, with indicating the gun-related homicides \nin this country. The rate of gun-related homicides in the U.S. is far \nhigher than that of other large and affluent countries. Are they any \nless stronger than we are? We have the highest number of homicides done \nby guns.\n  We have Italy, Taiwan, Canada, Spain, Germany, Australia, the United \nKingdom, France, South Korea, and Japan. Even with the terrorist \nactivities, they are way below America. And you can see here the 353 \nmass shootings in America in 2015. All of those are by guns.\n  If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun \nin America. I have the no-fly for foreign terrorists. But, more \nimportantly, we had legislation that Mr. King sponsored, I believe, and \nothers that just simply said: If you are on the no-fly list, you can't \nhave a gun.\n  I want to find common ground, but most of all, I want to save lives. \nHere today I am saying to my colleagues that we are not saving lives if \nwe are not sitting at the table of involvement.\n  I will include in the Record a whole list of legislative initiatives \nabout gun storage and safety devices and firearms transfer reporting, \nwhich is similar to what happened in South Carolina, where this \ngentleman got a gun--effectively, he would not have been approved--\nalso, one on establishing a select committee on gun violence and gun \nviolence research--these are by other Members--also, recognizing gun \nviolence is a public health emergency, and coming back to allow the \nCenters for Disease Control to finally do research on the impact of gun \nviolence.\n\n\n       gun violence prevention legislation & legislative support\n\n       1.

If we don't stand together, then the long litany of \nchildren that have died by gun violence, Mr. Speaker, will continue.\n  The only thing that will stop this is for us to recognize that we \nhave gun deaths, gun deaths by justified homicide and criminal \nhomicide, mass shootings, mental health shootings with guns, and \nsuicide, guns and domestic violence.\n  The only thing that will happen is that it will continue. Does anyone \nwant this kind of massacre to continue at the hands of someone using a \ngun?\n  Some of the aspects of what the President has presented--background \nchecks, mental health resources, ATF, FBI--200 more--if we join \ntogether, I can assure you America can find her comfortable place in \nthe sun with a wonderful Constitution and democracy, where all of us, \nno matter what our philosophy, what our political party, can come \naround the issue of saving lives.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional Progressive \nCaucus in this important Special Order on universal child care and gun \nviolence in America.\n  I would like to thank Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for \nconvening this evening's Special Order and for her dedicated leadership \non critical issues impacting children and working families, including \nthis evening's topic of universal childcare and gun safety.\n  As we turn to the topic of gun violence in America, I would also like \nto thank President Obama for his leadership and for helping to bring \nthis issue to the forefront of our national priorities.\n  Gun violence in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored \nor irrationally justified.\n  We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act.\n  Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: \nto protect and defend the American people.\n  This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to \nhonor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem gun \nviolence in our nation.\n  Yet, after another mass shooting and countless acts of gun violence \nin communities across our country every day, House Republicans are \nstill unwilling to act to stop gun violence and save lives in American \ncommunities.\n  The Democrats have been calling for an immediate vote on the \nbipartisan King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights \nProtection Act to strengthen the life-saving background checks that \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands.\n  This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the gun \nviolence epidemic.\n   Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the \nlives of Americans by taking common sense steps to save lives.\n  The Administration has announced two new executive actions that will \nhelp strengthen the federal background check system and keep guns out \nof the wrong hands.\n  I have introduced two bills that will hopefully enhance these \nexecutive actions and support the President's recently announced action \non gun violence.\n  H.R. 4315--Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act--\nauthorizes $500 million for mental health treatment access and to \nassist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health \ninformation to the FBI's background check system NICS.\n   H.R. 4316--Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act--authorizes the \nhiring of 200 additional ATF agents and investigators for enforcement \nof existing gun laws. The President included these specific requests in \nyesterday's announcements and these bills respond to those requests.\n  Additionally, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is proposing a \nregulation to clarify who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under \nfederal law for reasons related to mental health.\n  And the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a \nproposed regulation to address barriers preventing states from \nsubmitting limited information on those persons to the federal \nbackground check system.\n  Ending gun violence in America requires a comprehensive approach--we \nmust come together and work towards this common goal.\n  Too many Americans have been severely injured or lost their lives as \na result of gun violence.\n  While the vast majority of Americans who experience a mental illness \nare not violent.\n  However, in some cases when persons with a mental illness does not \nreceive the treatment they need, the result can be tragedies such as \nhomicide or suicide.\n  We must continue to address mental health issues by:\n  Supporting expanded coverage of mental health services and enhanced \ntraining and hiring of mental health professionals; and\n  Continuing the national conversation on mental health to reduce \nstigma associated with having a mental illness and getting help; and\n  We must also continue to do everything we can to making sure that \nanyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others does not have \naccess to a gun.\n  The federal background check system is one of the most effective ways \nof assuring that\n\n[[Page H170]]\n\nsuch individuals are not able to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun \ndealer.\n  To date, background checks have prevented over two million guns from \nfalling into the wrong hands.\n  The Administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that \nbetter and more reliable information makes its way into the background \ncheck system.\n  The Administration, however, has acknowledged the need for collective \naction and continues to call upon Members of Congress to pass common-\nsense gun safety legislation and to expand funding to increase access \nto mental health services.\n  I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation \nthat will help stop the loss of innocent lives.\n  While we have made some progress in strengthening the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to run \nbackground checks on those who buy guns from federally licensed gun \ndealers to make sure they are not prohibited by law from owning a \nfirearm, we must do more.\n  I am a strong supporter of a right of privacy and I am particularly \nsensitive and protective of patient privacy rights.\n  I support the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \nthat was passed by Congress in 1996, and includes privacy protection \nfor medical records, which includes mental healthcare information.\n  However, there are specific areas under federal law that allow the \ndisclosure of medical information to authorities, and in these \ninstances there should be an agreement that when a person poses a \nthreat to themselves or others (as determined by a court or \nadjudicative authority with the medical and legal knowledge and \nauthority to make a determination that a person poses a threat to \nthemselves or to others) should not be allowed to purchase a fire arm.\n  Technology that could be deployed to access court records and arrest \nrecords as they relate to mental health and violent behavior should not \nrely upon a list that may become outdated or could be used in ways that \nare not consistent with the intent of enhancing gun safety.\n  The ability to access information that is accurate and available for \nthe limited purpose of affirming or rejecting a request to purchase a \nfirearm without indicating the source of the decision or the reason for \nthe rejection would still protect privacy rights while also protecting \nthe public.\n  The president's proposal on mental health and gun violence is to \nenforce the laws already in place.\n  Under a federal law enacted in 1968, an individual is prohibited from \nbuying or possessing firearms for life if he/she has been ``adjudicated \nas a mental defective'' or ``committed to a mental institution.''\n  A person is ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' if a court--or \nother entity having legal authority to make adjudications--has made a \ndetermination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is \na danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to \ncontract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a \ncriminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason \nof lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice.\n  A person is ``committed to a mental institution'' if that person has \nbeen involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or \nother lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment.\n  It should be noted, however, that federal law currently allows states \nto establish procedures for mentally ill individuals to restore their \nright to possess and purchase firearms (many states have done so at the \nbehest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results).\n  It is undoubtedly true that people who are a danger to self and/or \nothers because of mental illness should be prohibited from owning \nfirearms.\n  It is less clear, however, how to tailor new policies to better \nprotect the American public while at the same time avoiding the \nstigmatization of Americans with mental illness.\n  Any strategy to address the lethal intersection between guns and \nmental illness should focus of the key facts:\n  On average, more than 100,000 people in America are shot in murders, \nassaults, and other crimes.\n  More than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including \n2,677 children under the age of eighteen years old.\n  Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America.\n  60 percent of deaths by guns in America are the result of individuals \nusing these weapons as a means to commit suicide.\n  Some of these deaths might have been prevented if there were adequate \nbackground checks.\n  Each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives to \ngun violence been shot to death protecting their communities.\n  Millions of guns are sold every year in ``no questions asked'' \ntransactions and experts estimate that 40 percent of guns now sold in \nAmerica are done so without a background check.\n  National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was created \nin 1998 to require potential gun buyers to pass an instant screening at \nthe point of purchase.\n  Ensures that purchasers are not felons, domestic abusers, mentally \nill, etc.\n  NICS has blocked sales to more than 2 million prohibited people.\n  NICS stops 170 felons and 53 domestic abusers from purchasing guns \nevery day.\n  The most serious issue facing NICS is the ``private sale loophole''.\n  This allows anyone who is not a federally-licensed dealer to sell \nguns without a background checks.\n  An estimated 40% of gun transfers--6.6 million transfers--are \nconducted without a background check.\n  Armslist.com is the largest online seller of firearms.\n  66,000 gun ads are posted by private sellers on a given day, 750,000 \nper year.\n  Nearly 1/3rd of gun ads on Armslist.com are posted by high-volume \nunlicensed sellers (approx. 4,218 people).\n  High-volume sellers posted 29% of the gun ads.\n  High-volume sellers posted 36,069 gun ads over 2 months.\n  This would equate to around 243,800 guns each year by unlicensed \nsellers.\n  50% were familiar with federal laws but decided they didn't apply to \nthem.\n  1/3rd of ``want-to-buy'' ads are posted by people with a criminal \nrecord.\n  More than 4 times the rate at which prohibited gun buyers try to buy \nguns in stores.\n  Approximately 25,000 guns are in illegal hands.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H170-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H170-H171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AUTONOMY VERSUS RELATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. \nFortenberry) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I was listening to a talk show one day \nwhen a 13-year-old girl called in. She was confused. At that tender \nage, to put it mildly, she talked about how she had been walked all \nover by her peers and subjected to the exploitation of an older man. \nShe had no sufficient sense of self-possession to know that she had \nbeen used. She had no community support, no adult around her to protect \nher.\n  The radio commentator was aghast. But, sadly, Mr. Speaker, this was \nanother troubling example of a culture of exploitation that is raging \nall around us today.\n  However, Mr. Speaker, there is a bit of light on the horizon. In a \nfew weeks, tens of thousands of young people from around the country \nwill assemble around this Capitol to deliver a simple message.\n  These young people are saying this: They will no longer tolerate the \nindifference. They will no longer tolerate a culture of exploitation. \nThey will no longer tolerate the darkness of the abortion industry.\n  They are members of the generation that have witnessed firsthand the \ndevastating consequences when wrong ideas take hold in a society, when \nthe smartest people in the land--the Supreme Court Justices--are \nmisguided and do not value all lives, when certain industries profit \nfrom pain.\n  These young people are saying that women deserve better than \nabortion. They are saying that children should be welcome, no matter \nhow hard the circumstances. They are saying that no one should be \nabandoned. There should be no choice between a child and that child's \nmother.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is understandable that many people are reluctant to \nenter into arguments about abortion. It is difficult. It is painful. So \nmany people have experienced this individually or with family members. \nBut we have to be honest.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you look behind me at the dais here, you can see the \nwords ``peace,'' ``liberty,'' and ``justice.'' We have these words all \naround our Nation's capital, our Nation's monuments.\n  But, in truth, we cannot find peace in a society that does not \nprotect its most innocent lives. We cannot find liberty when we are \nindifferent to one another and simply turn away when a woman\n\n[[Page H171]]\n\nfaces difficulty. We cannot claim justice for all when we throw away \nthe innocent unborn life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to delve for a moment into the deeper reasons for \nthese divisions over abortion and the deeper reasons why we have such a \ncaustic debate.\n  For those of us who are pro-life, it can be hard, frankly, to \nunderstand why everyone just doesn't see our perspective. But I believe \nthat much of the ugliness surrounding the abortion debate hinges upon \nthe competing values of personal autonomy versus relational \nresponsibility, once again, personal autonomy versus relational \nresponsibility.\n  Of course, working hard, making something of yourself, refusing to \nlet difficult circumstances overcome you, are all hallmarks of a well-\nordered life essential to an individual's progress as a person.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, rugged individualism can lead to rugged \nisolationism, crushing the vitality of the human heart and leading to \nloneliness, hopelessness, and ultimately despair.\n  And could it be, Mr. Speaker, that the confusion surrounding abortion \nis the loss of an understanding of the dignity of each person as they \nare set in the environment of a community?\n  On this deeply painful topic of abortion, the primary community in \nquestion is, first and foremost, the unique bond between a mother and \nher child, followed by the bond of the extended family and extended \ncommunity.\n  All politics--all life--Mr. Speaker, is ultimately founded on \nrelationships. Happiness depends upon social life, on interdependency. \nA healthy society depends upon stable and healthy relationships for \npromoting sustainable values and our greater ideals.\n  But because of cultural confusion, we establish a false choice. Is it \na woman's right to choose or is it a child's right to life? This should \nnot be a consideration in the broader community that is committed to \nbonds of solidarity.\n  Sadly, I believe, we have lost sight of the degree to which the logic \nof radical autonomy, severed from foundational principles that order \nhuman relations, namely, in charity, have created the circumstances in \nwhich we now find ourselves.\n  Individuals who are alone so often become disassociated from \nmutuality and community. Decades upon decades of this cultural \nconditioning leaves us with an aggregate understanding that our \nstrength is only found in ourselves. No wonder a young woman, scared, \nalone, or abandoned feels such pressure to abort.\n  Mr. Speaker, during last year's historic papal visit to the United \nStates, Pope Francis highlighted the need for what I call social \nconservation.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  At its root, social conservation is the answer to the widespread \nlonging in all of our hearts, that longing for a culture of meaning, of \npurposefulness.\n  Pope Francis promoted universal human values, the importance of \nsociety, the primacy of the family, the dignity of work, the \nresponsibility of people to properly steward the natural environment, \nand the sanctity of all life, especially the poor, the elderly, those \nwho are marginalized, and the unborn.\n  This holistic approach of Pope Francis does not fit our political \nclass distinctions, which rage all around us in this body. So this is \nnot a Democrat or Republican issue, it is about the protection of \npersons and how we build a truly healthy society.\n  Children in the womb are vulnerable, precious members of their \nfamilies. We must defend them, not in isolation, but as a part of the \nsocial fabric upon which our shared future as a people depends.\n  Now, some abortion advocates charge that defenders of the unborn are \npro-life only until birth of the child; that the pro-life position is a \npart of a grotesque fiction called the war on women. That is a very \npainful accusation.\n  In the end, I wish we could rise above this, because I believe \neveryone should agree that the choice between radical autonomy as a \njustification for abortion, versus relational responsibility, is a \nfalse choice. To be pro-life is to be genuinely pro-child, pro-woman, \nand pro-family.\n  No matter how hard the circumstances, we should all be loving enough, \ncaring enough, and we certainly have resources enough to protect both \nthe mother and her child.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to look for ways to reframe this \nentire debate, to look for some light. Maybe there will continue to be \ndeep philosophical differences over the question, but maybe there is \nsome common ground.\n  A spectrum of policy proposals could more effectively build wider \ncoalitions, I believe, in the pro-life debate, advancing cultural \nconversion instead of cultural war. Initiatives could include an \nassault on the scourge of coercion, which forces many women, including \nyoung girls, to have an abortion at the hands of an uncaring boyfriend \nor unscrupulous doctor.\n  Can't we find it in ourselves to attack this injustice? I would like \nto believe we can.\n  What about incentives for businesses to provide better pregnancy and \nnew parenthood assistance, including maternity and paternity leave? \nSome of my colleagues speaking before me mentioned some of these \nproposals. No woman should be forced to choose between a paycheck and \nher child.\n  Other ideas could be adoption, enhanced adoption facilities, \ncountermeasures against workplace pregnancy discrimination, classifying \npregnancy as a qualifying event for health insurance, initiatives for \nresponsible fatherhood.\n  That is not my idea, that is President Obama's idea. In fact, I \ncommended him for that because he raised it in the State of the Union, \nas I recall, about 2 years ago.\n  Finally, I think we should channel money from the abortion facilities \nwhich are receiving America's taxpayer dollars, which most Americans \ndisagree with, by the way, toward nurturing pregnancy health centers, \nand there are many beautiful examples of this all around the country.\n  By pursuing these policy proposals, maybe we shift the cultural \nunderstanding that it is not a choice between radical autonomy--I can \nonly find strength in myself, me, as an individual, I am alone, \nabandoned, no matter how much I need others--and a relational \nresponsibility that we all have for one another.\n  Let's elevate this idea of that relational responsibility of \ninterdependency within community because we are living in a shattered \nsociety.\n  Nothing else is working, Mr. Speaker. We are in an age of anxiety and \na time of growing threat to the family, the very basis of the strength \nof this great Nation.\n  Now, more than ever, compassion should be our first principle.\n  Abortion is violence. Abortion is not health care. Abortion is a \nfalse choice that no one should ever be forced to make.\n  Let's elevate the ideal of motherhood, protect it, nurture it, \nrespect it, provide for it, celebrate it, the genius of the feminine, \nand the beauty of all life.\n  Mr. Speaker, in a few short weeks, these young people who will, by \nthe thousands, tens of thousands, crowd around this Capitol, they are \nreally telling us one simple truth: Love them both, just love them \nboth.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H171-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H171-H173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PROTECTING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nRussell) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, it was New Year's Eve in Blanchard, \nOklahoma. Eighteen-year-old mother Sarah McKinley, alone with her 3-\nmonth-old son, heard a ruckus at the door. Two men were outside trying \nto break it down. Grabbing her baby and barricading the door with her \nsofa, she immediately called 911.\n  In the frantic and desperate situation that followed, it became clear \nthat law enforcement would not arrive in time to prevent the assault by \narmed intruders. She informed the dispatcher that she had a shotgun, \nand asked if it was all right to shoot the intruders, should they make \ntheir way inside.\n  Wisely, the dispatcher told Sarah: ``I can't tell you to do that, but \nyou do what you have to do to protect that baby.''\n  Sarah already knew what she might have to do, and hoped against hope\n\n[[Page H172]]\n\nthat law enforcement, while responding quickly, would arrive in time.\n  When the armed intruders broke down the door, 24-year-old Justin \nMartin climbed over the couch and was greeted with a shotgun blast to \nthe chest. While his accomplice ran for his life, Sarah had saved hers \nand her baby's.\n  Eight weeks ago, 88-year-old Arlene Orms was at home alone in Miami, \nFlorida, when an intruder kicked in her door. Orms responded by \nretrieving a .25-caliber pistol, but fired it at the home invader, \nprompting the criminal to flee.\n  Following the incident, Orms' neighbors expressed absolute support \nfor her actions, with one telling a local media outlet: ``You have to \ndo something. You have to protect yourself.''\n  Arlene Orms, like most Americans, inherently understands that you \nhave the right to defend your life, your property, and your liberty.\n  The right to keep and bear arms is as fundamental to our freedom as \nany other inalienable right we enjoy as Americans. This right is God-\ngiven, as much as the freedom of religion, and to exercise worship, the \nfreedom to assemble and express, the freedom to own property, and to \nprotect our privacy.\n  As such, serious-minded individuals must have serious deliberation on \nany attempt to alter these fundamental American rights that are \nembodied in the Bill of Rights, inalienable, not granted by government.\n  In a time where Americans face uncertain threats from terrorists at \nhome, most Americans clearly understand why we must preserve the right \nto defend ourselves, our families, and our property.\n  For those who would refuse their right to defend themselves, they \nhave the freedom to do so. They do not have the freedom to make that \ndecision for others.\n  In terms of human behavior, our survival instincts are inherent. The \nCreator of the universe did not make human beings with fangs, claws, \nquills, or odors for their self-defense. Instead, he gave them their \nintelligence and, by extension, their hands, to fashion implements to \nprotect their lives.\n  While the President is certainly welcome to choose not to defend \nhimself, as is his right, it is not his right to prohibit others from \nprotecting their lives and property.\n  The President has histrionically compared his gun control agenda with \nthe advancement of women's suffrage rights and the elimination of \nslavery, chiding Republicans for their lack of advancement of the human \nrace.\n  If we look historically, rather than histrionically, it was \nRepublicans who eliminated slavery and embraced Republican activist \nSusan B. Anthony, the women's suffragist, to get voting rights for all \nwomen, where his party had stood in the way.\n  The President can no more rewrite history than he can rewrite the \nConstitution. While he may be a constitutional scholar, he needs to be \nschooled on constitutional history. From Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson, \nand Adams, all the way to the Supreme Court decisions with Heller and \nMcDonald, this inalienable right has been affirmed in defense of its \narticulation in the Bill of Rights.\n  While the President complains of congressional inaction on the right \nto keep and bear arms, it can no more take action to deny this right \nthan it could deny a free press, a free religious expression, or \nproperty rights to individuals.\n  Congress will not act to destroy the Bill of Rights, and we will \nstand in the way of any executive who will not uphold the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Still, the administration presses forward with passion and \nconviction, convincing Americans that the threat is so grievous, the \ninjury is so great, that Americans must act to inhibit our liberty. We \nare told that mass shootings are on the rise and gun deaths are out of \ncontrol and the worst among developed nations.\n  But before America signs up to eliminate one of her inalienable \nrights, let's deliberate with a sober mind. The President and his party \nwould report outrage if conservatives suggested that the First \nAmendment must be scrapped because of such abuses as libel, hate \nspeech, religious bigotry and sit-ins, warranted necessary commonsense \nreforms to the first of our enumerated freedoms embodied in the Bill of \nRights.\n  Americans recognize that we must face the unpleasantness of abuse of \nthese rights on occasion to secure its inviolable status.\n  Not the same, some may say. We are talking about outrageous loss of \nlife and injury and it must stop, they claim.\n  Since when did our security become substitute for our liberty? \nAmericans for 240 years, rather, have sacrificed to secure it.\n  And the simple truth is, the facts supporting this liberal gun \ncontrol call to give up an essential American liberty have been widely \nand unfairly distorted. According to the Centers for Disease Control, \n199,756 people lost their lives to firearms in 2014. But on \nexamination, only 15,000 of that number were homicide. That is only 8 \npercent of the total. The vast majority, over 68 percent, were \naccident-related, and even that has steadily declined in recent years.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Suicides accounted, sadly, for most of the remainder at 21 percent\n  But the truth about gun homicides is that you are as likely to die \nfrom malignant neoplasm of the esophagus as you are to violent homicide \nwith a firearm. You are twice as likely to die from the result of a \nfall. You are 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to die by accidental poisoning.\n  Still, while these incidents are tragic, and many beyond the scope of \ncivilized thinking, we cannot substitute emotion for examination. \nContrary to those most vocal--and most funded--voices on this issue, we \nare not the most violent civilized country on the planet. In fact, \naccording to data compiled from the United Nations Office on Drugs and \nCrime, the United States ranks in the bottom half of homicides \nworldwide among civilized or uncivilized nations.\n  Still, the President often touts Europe as a commonsense model for \nbetter policy and security. A remarkable seven European countries have \nhigher overall per capita homicide rates than the United States. Where \nis that news flash? Disarming law-abiding citizens as a solution to \ncurtail those that break the law does not necessarily make people \nsafer, but it certainly makes them more defenseless. On our own shores, \nwe can find an example of this line of thinking by examining the most \nviolent cities in America. They are most likely to be ones with the \nstrictest gun laws.\n  If gun control advocates ignore this body of evidence, as they are \nwont to do, they will explore ways to eliminate this essential right in \nAmerica through other means. We often see them turn to the false \nassertion that the Second Amendment was never intended for \nindividuals--remarkable, considering that James Madison insisted on \nenumerating inalienable individual rights into the body of the \nConstitution before he accepted the compromise to secure them through \nan amending process known as the Bill of Rights. Like all of our \nFramers and Founders, he understood common or natural law and its roots \nin the English Bill of Rights of 1689, and it guaranteed the individual \nright to bear arms.\n  All of our constitutional Framers would have relied heavily on Sir \nWilliam Blackstone's thought on law and liberty. This brilliant jurist \nsecured complete influence among every colonial attorney and all of our \nFounding Fathers with his Commentaries on the Law published in 1765. He \nwas explicit in his assertion that to secure individual life, liberty, \nand property, it was necessary ``to the right of having and using arms \nfor self-preservation and defense.''\n  It comes as no surprise then, in the language of common and natural \nlaw so clearly understood in the context of the time that the Second \nAmendment would be so highly placed in the order of individual rights \nat number two.\n  Gun control advocates argue the amendment was only for militias, not \nindividual people. Despite that argument being struck down for 225 \nyears in Supreme Court rulings to include the most recent cases of \nHeller and McDonald in 2008 and 2010, it is instructive to see what the \nFramers said themselves about the meaning of people and militias.\n  Richard Henry Lee wrote in Federalist Number 18, that brilliant group\n\n[[Page H173]]\n\nof papers known as the Federalist Papers that argued for our \nConstitution: ``A militia when properly formed are in fact the people \nthemselves. To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of \nthe people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when \nyoung, how to use them.''\n  In fact, when one examines the First and Third through the 10th \noriginal amendments, it is difficult to interpret any other meaning \nthan that they apply to individuals. The Second Amendment is no \nexception. The Supreme Court has always agreed.\n  The famous 14th Amendment, during Reconstruction after Black \nAmericans were freed from slavery--you know, that famous amendment that \nis the most referred to--guarantees equal protection under the law for \nall American citizens. It started out, and most Americans are not aware \nof this, as a Second and Fourth Amendment issue.\n  The Southern Democratic Party lawmakers were nullifying individual \nliberty with their State Black Code laws which deprived Black Americans \nof their right to liberty, property, and to keep and bear arms as they \nattempted to defend their homes. Republicans fought back against these \nlawmakers and then led the fight to pass legislation addressing the \nissue in 1868. Democratic President Andrew Johnson vetoed the bill. \nCongress overrode it and then secured their rights forever in the 14th \nAmendment to the Constitution.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court has determined with clarity that the \nconstitutional individual right of Americans to bear arms is guaranteed \non Federal enclaves such as Washington, D.C., with the Heller v. \nDistrict of Columbia decision. In McDonald v. Chicago, the Supreme \nCourt in 2010 held that the individual right extends to keeping and \nbearing arms to all States and territorial jurisdictions.\n  Okay. Fine, you say. But there is no reason why people need military-\nstyle firearms. Those need to be banned. The Framers of the \nConstitution and the Supreme Court, strangely, to those who would have \nthis way of thinking, would disagree.\n  In 1939, United States v. Miller, Justice Holmes speaking for the \nCourt in the case where one Mr. Miller asserted he had a constitutional \nright to bear a sawed-off shotgun without paying a special exemption \ntax of $200, the Supreme Court held that no such right existed on the \ngrounds that sawed-off shotguns of the very short length Mr. Miller \npossessed were not suitable as a military-type firearm if needed for \ncommon defense--a paraphrase, not a quote.\n  1997, Printz v. United States, Justice Clarence Thomas, our most \nrecent treatment of the Second Amendment prior to the late Supreme \nCourt decisions, stated that they reversed the District of Columbia's \ninvalidation of the National Firearms Act enacted in 1934. In Miller, \nwe determined the Second Amendment did not guarantee a citizen's right \nto possess a sawed-off shotgun because the weapon had not been shown to \nbe of ``ordinary military equipment'' that could ``contribute to the \ncommon defense.''\n  Ban military rifles you say? Throughout our history, they have been \nguaranteed as an essential portion of the defense of our liberty, our \nhomes, and our lives.\n  What about the terrorist watch list? Nobody on the terrorist watch \nlist ought to be able to own a firearm. The terrorist watch list is \nonly on suspicion--no court, no rule of law, no jury of your peers. It \nis on suspicion for surveillance, and it can be done bureaucratically \nand administratively. In fact, we have had several Members of Congress, \nsuch as my colleague from Alaska, Don Young, who was falsely and \ninadvertently put on the terrorist watch list. Under this line of \nthinking, his Second Amendment rights would be removed.\n  Well, we can't have these terrorists coming here and then being able \nto buy a firearm. They can't. People do not understand 18 U.S. Code. \nThey don't understand the law. If you are a nonresident legal alien, \nyou cannot possess, purchase, or receive a firearm. It is the law. \nThere are only very small rare exceptions for that, such as if you were \napproved for a specialized hunting trip or maybe you were armed \nsecurity for a head of state, for example.\n\n  Well, what about that gun show loophole? Businesses shouldn't be able \nto sell firearms without a background check. News flash: You cannot \nsell a firearm under a business license without a background check. If \nyou do so, whether you are on your property or off your property at a \ngun show, you are committing a felony and with strict sentencing laws \noften that are minimum sentences of 10 years or more.\n  Well, what about Internet sales? You can go online and you can just \norder a rifle, and they will ship it to your home--again, false. People \ndo not understand the law.\n  The United States Postal Service and our commercial carriers do not \nallow shipping of firearms except under licensed dealers. The only \nexception to that would be if you had an original manufacturer's \nwarranty and you ship it directly back to the manufacturer under their \nlicense, and they will receive it and send it only directly back.\n  As the only Member of Congress who owns a firearms manufacturing \nbusiness, I know about what I speak. If someone in another State were \nto try to order a firearm off of our Web site, it would never get \nshipped to their home or I would go to prison. Instead, we tell that \nperson: You need to get the local firearms licensee in your area to \nsend a certified copy of your license to us, and they are in a form \nwhere we can recognize what is a real license. When we receive that, we \nwill ship it to him, they will do the check, and you will fill out \nforms and you can receive your firearm. That is the way the law works.\n  So all of this outrage from my colleagues on the liberal left of \ntrying to fix things, the law already exists. It is like saying that we \nneed to do something about murder. We need to make some laws to stop \nmurder. Maybe they will quit doing that. Oh, we already have those \nlaws, and people still commit crime.\n  Therein is where we need to focus. Target the abusers, not the law-\nabiding American citizen, and do not target the Republic of the most \nincredible constitutional form of law the world has ever known.\n  Serious people decline to trivialize any right expressly addressed in \nthe Bill of Rights. A government that abrogates any of the Bill of \nRights with or without majority approval forever acts illegitimately \nand loses the moral right to govern the Republic. This is the \nuncompromising understanding reflected in the warning that America's \ngun owners will not go gently into these utopian woods.\n  While liberals and gun control advocates will take such a statement \nas evidence of their belief in the backwater, violent, and \nuntrustworthy nature of the armed American citizens, we gun owners hope \nthat liberals hold equally strong conviction about their printing \npresses, their Internet blogs, and their television cameras. The \nRepublic depends upon the fervent devotion to all of our fundamental \nrights. That is the oath that we take, and no President's tears will \never shake us from the defense of that Constitution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H173-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Rush (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nattending to family member's medical procedure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/07/house-section/article/H173-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
