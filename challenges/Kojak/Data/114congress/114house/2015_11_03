The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Doughnuts to Go is a small, family-\nowned shop in California managed by Lee Ky. Like any small business, \nits success depends on the hard work and grit of the folks who own it.\n  Lee's success was threatened in 2012 when Doughnuts to Go was sued by \nADA trolls for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. The lawsuit alleged minute violations, including--get this--a \nmislabeled table, door handles that were off by a few centimeters, and \nthe trash can in the bathroom was in the wrong place.\n  Lee was surprised by this lawsuit, especially because she is disabled \nherself. Lee is confined to a wheelchair and runs her store that she \nbelieves is ADA compliant. Lee was targeted by a serial plaintiff who \nnever set foot in the store and who also sued nearly 80 other \nbusinesses in the area.\n  Unfortunately, Lee's not alone. Mr. Speaker, there is a whole \nindustry made up of people who prey on and strong-arm small businesses \nin order to make money off of ADA lawsuits. To these trolls, it is \nabout making money, not helping the disabled get access to businesses.\n  In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law. \nNow, after 25 years of progress and advancement, the integrity of this \nlandmark legislation is being threatened by a handful of lawyers and \nplaintiffs.\n  The vast majority of businesses strive to serve their customers to \nthe best of their ability, relying on the ADA as another tool to help \nensure that customers with disabilities can enjoy the services they \nprovide. Most of these businessowners believe they are compliant with \nthe ADA. Their businesses have even passed local and State inspections. \nHowever, despite their best attempts, certain attorneys and their pool \nof serial plaintiffs look for minor, easily correctible ADA infractions \nso they can file a lawsuit and make some cash off, I believe, the \ndisabled.\n  Faced with the threat of a lawsuit for minor infractions, small-\nbusiness owners find themselves in a dilemma. They have few choices: \nsettle out of court or spend time and money to go through the legal \nprocess. This becomes a lose-lose situation.\n  At face value, these drive-by lawsuits are an easy way for both \ngreedy plaintiffs and attorneys to make a quick buck. In many cases, a \nsingle plaintiff signs onto multiple cases, alleging violations at \nbusinesses and properties where the plaintiff has never set foot. In \nCalifornia, for example, one serial plaintiff filed over 250 separate \nlawsuits. Another individual filed more than 800, and a third nearly \n1,000. Some of these lawsuits are filed by plaintiffs that never have \nbeen in the business or even live in the State. The abuse is obvious.\n  Unfortunately, these lawsuits are on the rise nationwide. In 2014 \nalone, there was a 63 percent increase in ADA lawsuits for businesses \nopen to the public, with more than 4,000 individual cases making their \nway to Federal courts.\n  What's more is that local and State courts across the country are \nfinding themselves inundated by these drive-by lawsuits, and some have \ncreated special rules to deal with the sheer volume of these cases. \nBecause of this, State legislatures have begun to take action.\n  The Texas State Legislature has already filed steps to curtail these \npractices. The ADA, however, is Federal law, and as such, Congress must \nremedy this harmful practice of drive-by lawsuits targeting small \nbusinesses.\n  This is why I am introducing the ADA Education and Reform Act of \n2015, H.R. 3765. This legislation will provide businessowners with an \nopportunity to remedy the alleged ADA infractions before being saddled \nwith legal fees. Businessowners will have a 120-day window when given \nnotice by the plaintiff to make any necessary public accommodation \ncorrections and update their business. If the businessowner fails to \ncorrect the infractions, the plaintiff retains all of their rights to \npursue legal action under ADA. This legislation restores the purpose of \nthe ADA, which is to provide access and accommodation to disabled \nAmericans, not to fatten the wallets of ADA trolls.\n  So I recommend to the House of Representatives that they sign onto \nthis\n\n[[Page H7394]]\n\nlegislation, because the goal of this legislation is to make all \nbusinesses comply with the ADA, Mr. Speaker, not to be a cash cow for \nlitigants that have never set foot in a Doughnuts to Go.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7394-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRANSPORTATION BILL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I started last week in Dallas, Texas, \nworking with people across the country, but especially from Texas, \ndealing with transportation needs and their requirements for balanced \ntransportation by pedestrians, streetcar, and especially light rail. \nDallas has the most extensive light-rail system in the country. I ended \nmy week in New York City, in Brooklyn, where this vast sprawling \neconomic engine, home to 20 million people in the metropolitan area, \nwas dealing with their transportation needs.\n  Virtually all of these people, whether from Brooklyn, Texas, or \naround the country, are in agreement with what they need going forward, \nan important part of which is a renewal and strengthening of the \nFederal transportation partnership.\n  I was pleased to see that we are moving ahead with discussion of the \nbasic framework produced by our friends on the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee. I commend Mr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio for \nproducing a bill that is quite strong under these difficult \ncircumstances. It does preserve the basic framework and continue to \nmake improvements not just around the edges. There are potential \nbreakthrough provisions in technology in transportation that could \ntruly be transformational.\n  It is disappointing, however, that the bill flatlines important bike \nand pedestrian funding, something that is vitally needed in Houston, \nIndianapolis, Seattle, here in our Nation's Capital, in suburban \nMaryland, and communities all across the country.\n  The lack of balance in this transportation funding is unfortunate. \nBut I am hoping, through the amendment process and the work between the \ntwo Chambers, if it proceeds, that we will be able to correct it.\n  The basic problem is, of course, we continue to tiptoe around the \nobvious solution to our transportation funding crisis. Our \ntransportation partnership is compromised with our State, local, and \nprivate sector partners because we pretend that we can meet 2015 \ntransportation needs with 1993 dollars, the last time we raised the gas \ntax. The refusal to do what Ronald Reagan did in 1982 and the refusal \nto do what six red Republican States have already done this year--\nIdaho, Utah, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Georgia--raising the gas \ntax, creates unnecessary difficulties.\n  The majority of States have raised their revenues over the last 4 \nyears for transportation, and a review of the politicians involved with \nmaking these decisions found that those who voted for the revenue \nincreases were actually reelected at a higher percentage than those who \nvoted ``no.''\n  This bill is a well-intended statement with good structure and \ninnovation; but until we have meaningful, long-term, predictable \nfunding, it is only a well-intended statement. We continue the \nuncertainty that bedevils people at the State and local levels; and the \nbig projects--multistate, multimodal, multiyear projects--need \ncertainty.\n  The minor cost increase of a few cents per day for families would be \noffset by the dramatic plunge in gasoline prices and offset even more \nthrough the cost to families for damage to their vehicles of over $500 \na year now because of poor road conditions and almost $1,000 a year \nlost due to congestion. These are real costs that we are inflicting on \nAmerican families every day unnecessarily.\n  Raising the gas tax and providing stable, meaningful funding for \ntransportation will create millions of family-wage jobs all across the \ncountry while we get America unstuck and strengthen communities large \nand small.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the positive elements in this bill that we are \ndiscussing is Vision Zero, which asks us to plan for a world where \nthere are no traffic fatalities, a goal that is so important to strive \nfor as we continue to kill 32,000 people a year on our highways and \ncountless more who are injured.\n  Setting our goal high with Vision Zero is the sort of bold step we \nneed, but we should not have a Vision Zero for new revenue. That is not \nbold. That is not courageous. That doesn't get the job done.\n  I look forward to this debate over the next couple of days. I look \nforward to having Members of Congress consider their alternatives. What \nare they going to do to make sure we can rebuild and renew this great \ncountry?\n  This used to be an area of tremendous bipartisan cooperation, \nleadership, and accomplishment for Congress. I hope it can be so again \nas we turn to transportation this week. The American public would \nwelcome such a development, and certainly they deserve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7394-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7394-H7395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to be amazed and disappointed that \nthe Republican Party wants to keep putting money in a black hole. The \nblack hole is known as Afghanistan.\n  The story broke yesterday that the Pentagon spent $43 million on a \nsingle natural gas station in Afghanistan when it should have cost no \nmore than $300,000. The Pentagon spent over $30 million in overhead \ncosts to build this one gas station, and the gas station was set up to \nservice a kind of car that a huge majority of Afghans cannot afford. \nThe Pentagon also will not answer any questions about this ridiculous \nwaste of money.\n  The $43 million gas station is one of the hundreds of examples of the \nwaste of the taxpayers' money in Afghanistan. John Sopko has repeatedly \nwritten about the waste in Afghanistan. I don't know why Congress has \ncontinued to fund the waste and fraud in Afghanistan.\n  Instead, last week, Congress passed a budget deal that increased \ndefense spending over the next 2 years by over $80 billion a year. I \ndid not vote for this bill. We already have a national debt of over $18 \ntrillion, and I cannot, in good conscience, vote to add $1.5 trillion \nto the debt.\n  The budget deal also puts $59 million into the Overseas Contingency \nOperation fund, which is a slush fund for spending money in \nunauthorized wars in the Middle East. I am for rebuilding our military, \nbut I am not in favor of the waste in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. President Obama signed us up for 9 \nmore years in Afghanistan when he signed the bilateral security \nagreement last year. On Friday, he announced that he is putting \nAmerican troops on the ground in Syria in an open-ended mission. This \nis a waste of money and a waste of lives. It needs to stop, and \nCongress has the power to stop it; but we will not use our \nconstitutional authority to even debate what he is doing in the Middle \nEast.\n  Mr. Speaker, I bring with me posters from time to time. I look at the \ndeaths of so many men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan who serve our \nNation, and it breaks my heart.\n  So to make my point before I close, Mr. Speaker, we still have \nAmericans dying in Afghanistan, but it doesn't make the papers anymore. \nWe had a soldier from Fort Bragg--which is not in my district, but it \nis in North Carolina--who was killed in Iraq last week.\n  Mr. Speaker, I bring this poster today because it tells the story \nmuch better than my words could ever tell the story about war. It is a \nlady holding her little girl's hand. The little girl has her finger in \nher mouth, and she is wondering why her daddy is in a flag-draped \ncoffin. I don't know what to tell that little girl. All I can tell that \nlittle girl is that Congress is indifferent to sending our young men \nand women to die in the Middle East.\n  It is time for Congress to meet its constitutional responsibility and \nhave a debate and a vote on the floor of the House.\n\n[[Page H7395]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7395-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n               HONDURAS MUST END CORRUPTION AND IMPUNITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, in September I visited Honduras as part of \na delegation organized by the Washington Office on Latin America. Last \nmonth I spoke about the violence and extreme poverty that force \nfamilies and young people to flee the country. Today I want to focus on \nanother urgent issue, namely, how to confront the pervasive corruption \nin Honduras.\n  We heard about the problem of corruption everywhere, from the U.N., \nthe President of Honduras, and the U.S. Ambassador, to community \nleaders and NGOs with expertise in justice and human rights. Everyone \nwanted to talk about the seemingly intractable problem of endemic \ncorruption in Honduras.\n  The roots of corruption in Honduras are deep and longstanding. They \nencompass state actors, criminal networks, and powerful political and \neconomic interests. But after a scandal revealed that government \nofficials had stolen more than $350 million from the country's Social \nSecurity fund, which provides public health services as well as old age \npensions, and that some of the money had gone to the electoral campaign \nof the President's political party, there has been a huge public \noutcry, demanding action to end widespread corruption.\n  Tens of thousands of Hondurans have marched in the streets over the \npast months, calling for an international independent commission to \ninvestigate corruption and impunity, based on the model of the CICIG in \nGuatemala, but tailored to Honduran reality. This unprecedented \nmovement is led by young people, organized on social media, and called \nthe Indignados.\n  Our delegation met with some of these young leaders. They are \nthoughtful, politically diverse, and united in their desire to see \ntheir country rid of corruption. They now face threats for what they \nare doing, and I hope that the Honduran Government is doing all it can \nto ensure their safety and their freedom of association and not turning \na blind eye to the threats targeting them and their families.\n  When we met with President Hernandez, he argued that he had taken \nsignificant steps to go after corruption. I take the President \nseriously, and I look forward to seeing concrete results from the \nactions he has already announced. I also met with NGOs, including the \nAssociation of Judges for Democracy, that work on judicial, legal, and \ntransparency issues, who unanimously felt much more must be done.\n  At the height of the protest movement, President Hernandez called for \na national dialogue on how to address the problem of corruption, asking \nthe United Nations and the Organization of American States to help \nfacilitate the process and develop a consensus of what needed to be \ndone.\n  So I was disappointed to learn that the dialogue process was not as \ninclusive as it could have been. The U.N. was sidelined, while the OAS \ncarried out a quick series of discussions before developing a proposal \nfor the President. Many were concerned not only that the OAS hadn't \nconsulted widely enough, but that its actions fell short of the \nthoughtful and impartial mediation needed to generate confidence in any \nforthcoming proposal.\n  On September 28, the OAS presented its proposal to President \nHernandez. After studying this proposal, I have concluded that it is \nwoefully inadequate to addressing corruption and impunity, and \nreforming the weak judicial institutions of Honduras. This is not just \nmy opinion.\n  Last week, on October 28, a broad coalition of Honduran civil \nsociety, the Coalition Against Impunity, issued a statement declaring \nthat the mission proposed by the OAS and the government is, itself, an \nobstacle to creating a genuine independent commission that can truly \ntackle the rampant corruption and impunity in Honduras.\n  Earlier, on October 4, the Indignados issued a similar critique, \npointing out the weaknesses of the OAS proposal to independently \ninvestigate crimes of corruption and ensure their prosecution.\n  It is clear from my discussions in Honduras and recent statements by \nHonduran civil society that any such commission must be wholly \nindependent from the government politically and financially, that it \nmust have the mandate and staffing to carry out investigations of \ncrimes of corruption and impunity and the freedom to pursue those \ninvestigations wherever the evidence warrants. It must also have the \nmandate and ability to work independently with state prosecutors and \ninvestigators to bring such crimes to justice.\n  Honduras does not need one more round of judicial studies and \ntechnical assistance or a board of international mentors, as proposed \nby the OAS. Such a limited proposal not only lacks the broad support \nand confidence of Honduran civil society, but it also falls far short \nof what is required to break the culture of impunity in Honduras.\n  I hope the OAS proposal can be modified and strengthened and its \nmandate expanded to establish an effective and truly independent \nmechanism that can fully investigate corruption and have a role in \nprosecutions or an alternative advanced that can meet these \nrequirements. I hope that a new proposal includes close cooperation \nwith the U.N.\n  I further believe that U.S. and international aid needs to be \ncarefully calibrated to link assistance to progress on human rights and \nending corruption, including a truly independent commission with the \nfull power of investigation into corruption and impunity and the \nability to be part of the prosecution of those charged with such \ncrimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7395-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7395-H7396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share a \ngrowing concern in our country, which is that one of our founding \nprinciples, our freedom of religion, is being taken away.\n  I have here a beautiful picture of the Constitutional Convention, the \nsigning of the Constitution at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on \nSeptember 17, 1787. The very First Amendment to that Constitution, the \nvery first one, our Founding Fathers solidified our citizens' right to \nfreedom of religion.\n  The amendment says: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \nabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the \npeople peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a \nredress of grievances.''\n  Despite this freedom being explicitly laid out in our Constitution, \nwe have seen Federal, State, and local governments continue to violate \nour founding principles.\n  One of the most notorious violations of religious liberty was \nrecently rehighlighted by His Eminence Pope Francis. The Little Sisters \nof the Poor have been fighting an ongoing battle against ObamaCare's \ncontraception mandate. These Catholic nuns are forced under ObamaCare \nto provide contraception to their employees, even though their faith \ntells them that this is morally wrong.\n  It is outrageous and offensive to force these nuns to violate their \nreligious liberties to comply with the will of the President and his \nallies. These are Catholic nuns trying to take care of poor people, and \nthe government is getting in their way and imposing on their religious \nvalues.\n  Another example is Kelvin Cochran, a resident of the city of Atlanta. \nChief Cochran was appointed by President Obama in 2009 as the U.S. Fire \nAdministrator for the United States Fire Administration before \nreturning to become the fire chief of Atlanta. He came under attack for \nhis Christian beliefs.\n  Chief Cochran is also a deacon at Elizabeth Baptist Church, where he \nleads a men's Bible study. His faith inspired him to write the book \ncalled ``Who Told You That You Were Naked?'', a book that explains and \nexamines the state of man since the fall of Adam.\n  In his book, Chief Cochran briefly discusses the clear biblical \nteaching that sex is reserved for marriage between a man and a woman. \nKelvin had 30 years of distinguished service, including under the Obama \nadministration, when he was fired for sharing his faith.\n\n[[Page H7396]]\n\n  Sadly, these types of religious freedom violations are happening in \nmy own district in the State of West Virginia.\n  Almost a year ago, a high school student who is a Christian, in \nBuckhannon, West Virginia, was forced by his teachers in his public \nhigh school to attend a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender club, and \nthen he was punished for expressing that he did not want to attend the \nclub on the grounds that it went against his religious beliefs.\n  The hypocrisy of those who claim to promote tolerance, yet display \nsuch an intolerance towards those with traditional religious values, is \nstunning. These are just a few examples. These attacks know no \nboundaries. They are not based on political party, race, sex, or \nethnicity. These attacks go after everyone in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to let the citizens of our great country know \nthat we disapprove of these continued infringements on our religious \nfreedom.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in signing on to my \nresolution, which I plan to introduce tomorrow, to express the sense of \nthe House of Representatives that Federal, State, and local governments \nshould not infringe on the ability of citizens to act in accordance \nwith their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7396-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CELEBRATING VETERANS DAY AND VETERANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, next week Americans throughout the country \nwill celebrate Veterans Day. In cities and towns and hamlets, which all \nof us come from, we will take the time to thank and to honor those men \nand women who have served our Nation so nobly, to protect our freedoms \nand to keep this country safe, safe from all harm, foreign and \ndomestic.\n  Americans take a great deal of pride in their service to our country, \nand we must also remember those men and women who are today serving in \nActive Duty in harm's way throughout the world.\n  I want to take this opportunity to honor two veterans who passed away \nthis last September, who I worked with closely and who were community \nleaders, Charlie Waters and Earl Watson, both gentlemen who exemplified \nwhat is the best and the brightest our Nation has to offer.\n  Earl Watson, or as many like to call him, ``Earl, the Pearl,'' was a \nWorld War II veteran. After the war, he moved to Los Angeles, where he \nworked as a doorman in the famous Hotel Knickerbocker. During a \ndifficult time in our Nation's history, during World War II, when \nsegregation was still in many places the law of the land, Earl was most \nproud that he could serve his Nation. He wrote a biography titled \n``Earl `The Pearl' Watson: Doorman to the Stars.'' But what he was most \nproud of was his service to our Nation.\n  Earl loved people. He had a big smile, a friendly demeanor, and an \neagerness to help those in need. Anytime a veteran ever came to him or \na veterans organization had a problem, he was there to be helpful. Earl \ntold me, when we were able to retrieve his medals that he had earned \nduring his service to our country, that the proudest moment of all the \nmany things he had done in his life was his service to our country.\n  Earl is survived by his wife of 71 years, Melba; his children, Alan \nand Coleen; and grandchildren, Eric, Ashley, and Jonathan, who he was \nso, so very proud of.\n  Another veterans' advocate who we all miss in the San Joaquin Valley \nis Charlie Waters, who served in the United States Marine Corps during \nthe Korean war. Charlie, as he was affectionately known by all, never \never stopped fighting on behalf of veterans. I worked closely with him \nfor many years, from working to get recognition for Hmong veterans to \nadvocating for the funding of the opening of the veterans home that we \nsuccessfully did that provides residence to those who deserve it. As a \nmatter of fact, in Charlie's last days, he was able to stay there.\n  He was a true champion of veterans not only throughout the Valley, \nbut the Nation. But he did not stop there: supporting the Veterans \nAdministration Hospital in Fresno and providing support for their \nefforts; organizing and helping continue the Veterans Day parade, which \nis one of the largest veterans parades in the entire nation that is \nshown on Armed Services Television; and individuals. No problem was too \nbig or too small, as long as a veteran was there who needed Charlie's \nhelp.\n  Therefore, we miss both Charlie and Earl very much for all that they \nhave done and all that they exemplified in terms of honor, duty, and \nservice to country. Charlie is survived by his wife, Cathy; and \nchildren, Charlie Waters, III, Karen, and Jennifer.\n  Mr. Speaker, we want to take this time to recognize those leaders, \nthose leaders who made a difference during their lives in serving our \ncountry. They are both shining examples of those who always--always--\ncared first and foremost for our Nation.\n  As we celebrate Veterans Day next week around the country, in towns \nand hamlets and cities throughout the Nation, we should think about all \nthese veterans. We should think about the men and women who have served \nour Nation today in Active Duty. Never ever forget to say thank you for \ntheir service to a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7396-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7396-H7397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n          COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF MINERAL RIGHTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, since first being elected \nto serve the citizens of Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, I \nhave had the honor to represent both the Allegheny National Forest and \nPennsylvania's historic Oil Region, where the commercial oil industry \nbegan in 1859. This region of north central Pennsylvania was built on \nour natural resources, and this legacy remains a deep part of our \nheritage.\n  The Oil Region designation came about because of the city of \nTitusville, which has been aptly nicknamed ``the valley that changed \nthe world.'' It was there in 1859 that Colonel Edwin Drake drilled the \nworld's first commercial oil well, which set the wheels in motion for \nthe worldwide commercial use of petroleum. Some 60 years following \nColonel Drake's historic well, the Allegheny National Forest was \ncreated in nearby Warren, Elk, Forest, and McKean Counties.\n  Like so many areas of the West, this national forest is intrinsically \nconnected to the prosperity of our communities. A mixed use of oil and \ngas production, timbering, hardwood research, recreation, and tourism \nmake the Allegheny National Forest unique to the East Coast and truly a \ntreasure for the mid-Atlantic region.\n  In the Allegheny, more than 90 percent of the mineral rights are \nowned by the private sector. With the long history in oil and gas \ndevelopment in the region, private landowners had the foresight to \nreserve their mineral rights when the Federal Government acquired these \nsurface lands.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, there is not a national government-run oil \ncompany. There has long been an understanding in our great country \nthat, when it comes to resources, and specifically energy development, \nthe private sector does it better. For generations, this arrangement \nsuccessfully operated with oil and gas development taking place in the \nAllegheny National Forest.\n  Unfortunately, over the past decade, some opponents of production \nmade attempts to mandate new regulations or limit access to the private \nmineral rights through numerous lawsuits. After years of litigation, a \nFederal court rightfully ruled in favor of the private landowners \nmaintaining reasonable access to their property.\n  Federal courts have consistently ruled that the United States Forest \nService lacks regulatory authority over these private mineral rights. \nSimilar rulings and new regulations that would seek to limit production \nhave also been issued.\n  Today, I am introducing the Cooperative Management of Mineral Rights \nAct of 2015, and I ask my colleagues who believe in the importance of \nprivate property and private property rights to join me as cosponsors. \nWe need to provide clarity and continue to respect the longstanding \nimportance of\n\n[[Page H7397]]\n\nprivate property rights in our country. This legislation will set the \ntone for addressing other cases dealing with these rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting private property and \nprivate property rights by cosponsoring the Cooperative Management of \nMineral Rights Act of 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7397-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LONG RANGE STRIKE BOMBER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Knight) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to address an issue of \ncritical importance to our Nation's security: the Long Range Strike \nBomber.\n  Since World War II, our defense has relied on the ability to respond \nquickly to any threats to our national security anywhere in the world. \nThe bedrock of this strategy has always been the strategic bomber.\n  This past week, it was announced that Northrop Grumman would be \nproducing our next strategic bomber for future generations. Potential \nadversaries are deterred because only the United States possesses the \ncapability to strike any target in the world with precision weapons \nwithin 24 hours.\n  Last week, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Air \nForce made the announcement that Northrop Grumman won the contract to \nbuild the Long Range Strike Bomber. This bomber will be produced in my \ndistrict. The B-1, the B-2, and now the Long Range Strike Bomber will \nall follow in the same role of being built in the Antelope Valley in \nsouthern California.\n  Congratulations to the Air Force and the men and women of Northrop \nGrumman on this contract. I have seen firsthand the work that Northrop \nGrumman employees do in support of our men and women in uniform at \nPlant 42 in my district. I am here to congratulate them on the \nopportunity to bring the expertise and commitment to the Long Range \nStrike Bomber.\n  This means thousands of jobs to this country. It means thousands of \njobs to southern California, in a much-needed area in my district where \njobs are very scarce. Both Plant 42 and the many surrounding small \nbusinesses Northrop Grumman will have a contract with will have support \nin this area.\n  The road that led to Tuesday's announcement was a long one paved with \nhard work by many people in our community and State. The Antelope \nValley has long since been the home to the aerospace industry and has \nbuilt B-1s, B-2s, all of the space shuttles, and currently builds the \nF-35. Naturally, it would be a good selection for the next bomber being \nbuilt there.\n  On any given day, the F-22, F-35, the F-16, B-1, or B-2 will be \nflying over the Antelope Valley in their test missions. I am confident \nthat the Long Range Strike Bomber will help us continue this legacy, \nand I thank everyone who has helped bring its production to our \ncommunity.\n  The Air Force has called the Long Range Strike Bomber a top \nmodernization priority, and there are sobering facts behind that. \nToday, only 10 percent of our Nation's bomber force is capable of \npenetrating sophisticated adversary air defense systems. The average \nage of our bomber fleet is 32 years old, with most of our bombers more \nthan 45 years old. Only the B-2 stealth bomber, proudly built, \nmaintained, and modernized in my district, can penetrate advanced air \ndefenses; however, we only have 20 B-2s.\n  Given Northrop Grumman's 35 years of expertise designing, building, \ndelivering, and modernizing the B-2 stealth bomber at Plant 42, I know \nthe men and women who work there are incredibly qualified to build our \nNation's next long-range strike aircraft.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7397-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7397-H7398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, after a wave of strong bipartisan \nopposition, after being stayed by two Federal courts, the \nadministration is still pushing its flawed waters of the United States \nregulatory expansion. However, this week, the Senate will finally \nconsider rejecting this regulatory overreach.\n  While the administration describes their plan as a minor \nclarification, it is, in fact, the most sweeping expansion of Federal \nregulatory authority in our Nation's history.\n  Mr. Speaker, this map of my home State of California demonstrates \nexactly how far the EPA's proposal would reach. Fully 95 percent of \nCalifornia, depicted in black, would fall under EPA's jurisdiction, \nthough you will notice that the city of San Francisco, in white, does \nnot. That is because San Francisco, the source of so much of this \nexcessive regulatory mindset, long ago paved over every waterway in the \ncity, and who knows what is in the runoff rainwater flowing off the \nstreets of that city.\n  It isn't just farms that would be hurt by the EPA's plan. Virtually \nevery business and homeowner in the State would be faced with \nregulation at the whim of Federal bureaucrats under a rule written to \nensure that the EPA has any jurisdiction anytime it wants.\n  Do we really believe the Federal Government should play a role in \nlocal land use decisions, even down to whether individual homes could \nbe expanded? This is exactly the power the EPA claims that it needs. \nDry streambeds, manmade ditches, even temporary puddles which exist \nonly during rainstorms are all locations over which the EPA wishes to \nclaim jurisdiction. Even Imperial County, a desert with virtually no \nnatural waterways, would fall under the EPA's control with this plan.\n  Perhaps the most concerning isn't just that the EPA is seeking to \nexpand its authority. That is the nature of any bureaucracy, and it is \nto be expected from this administration. Most concerning is that we \ncan't even trust the EPA with authority to regulate navigable waterways \nit already has or to respect exemptions included in the Clean Water \nAct.\n  In my northern California district, residents have experienced \nregulatory actions so ludicrous that we can't make them up. In Tehama \nCounty, a farmer was fined for planting wheat in a manner that the \ngovernment claimed damaged so-called navigable waters, which begs the \nquestion anyway: What is or what should be determined to be a navigable \nwaterway? Is it a puddle or is it something you can actually run a boat \nup and down?\n  Never mind that the farm I mentioned has been recognized as a wheat \nallotment by the USDA for decades or that the farmer had simply been \ncontinuing to farm the land exactly as it has been farmed for \ngenerations. Instead, government bureaucrats wanted this activity \nstopped, and they used their power to prevent this farming activity.\n  In another instance, the government used the Clean Water Act to \nattack a family farm for shifting to a more efficient irrigation \nsystem--yes, for shifting to more efficient irrigation system. One \nmight think that is a laudable goal, especially during a drought period \nin California in the West, but the government claimed this activity \nwould negatively impact the Sacramento River, which is a full 7 miles \naway from this farm and unconnected to that farm by any waterway.\n  Of course, in both of these instances, the government sanctioned \nfarmers for activities that are clearly exempt under the Clean Water \nAct as specified by Congress, who makes the laws. Even in the EPA's \nonly early draft, they exempted mud puddles, but they just couldn't \nquite leave them out. They had to include them as well in their \nregulation.\n  The ongoing efforts of the administration to ignore exemptions for \nnormal farming activities like planting crops and maintaining \nirrigation systems are in clear violation of the Clean Water Act, as \nwritten by Congress. In fact, language I sponsored to defund this sort \nof regulation of exempt activities was passed by both Houses last year \nand signed into law in December, yet the EPA persists in its illegal \nactivities.\n  Mr. Speaker, when Congress can't trust Federal agencies to \njudiciously use authority they already hold, when we can't trust \nagencies to follow clear congressional direction, how can we possibly \nconsider granting or allowing them even more power?\n  It is time the Senate joined the House in rolling back this proposal \nand remind this administration that Congress writes the law, not \nbureaucrats.\n\n[[Page H7398]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7398-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MAJOR JUSTIN FITCH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Duffy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember Major Justin Fitch.\n  A son of Hayward, Wisconsin, and a decorated Army officer, colon \ncancer took Justin's life far too soon, but not before he made an \nincredible mark on his community and his fellow veterans.\n  While serving in Iraq in 2007, Justin suffered thoughts of suicide. \nHe actually went so far as to put an M-4 rifle in his mouth. But, thank \nGod, he never pulled the trigger.\n  When he returned home, he claimed victory over his suicidal thoughts, \nbut another battle was just beginning for Justin. He was diagnosed with \ncolon cancer. He waged a 3-year battle fighting that disease. Despite a \ngrim prognosis, he used his attention to shed light on a mounting issue \nthat he knew all too well. At the time, on average, 22 veterans were \ncommitting suicide a day. That is about 8,000 a year.\n  Justin knew that something had to be done. And so in between his \nchemotherapy treatments and surgeries, he took part in long ruck \nmarches. He teamed up with veteran prevention organizations and freely \ngave out his number to any soldier who approached him who also had \nthoughts of suicide. Major Fitch, fighting the battle of his life with \ncancer, was also giving his time to help save other veterans who were \nsuffering with suicidal thoughts.\n  Major Fitch passed away in his hometown of Pleasant Prairie, \nWisconsin, on October 3. He was 33 years old. His personal battle may \nbe over, but his fight marches on. As Justin would say: ``It's okay to \nseek help. You can get help. Look at me.''\n  And so, to Major Fitch, on behalf of a grateful Nation, we are \nthankful for your service and your sacrifice and your commitment to our \nveterans. May God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7398-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          GREATER MIAMI JEWISH FEDERATION KRISTALLNACHT EVENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, this Monday, November 9, marks the \n77th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass.\n  The Greater Miami Jewish Federation will be commemorating this tragic \nand horrible event with a community rally on Sunday, November 15, at 4 \np.m., at the Holocaust Memorial Miami Beach.\n  Kristallnacht marked the beginning of one of humanity's darkest \nperiods: the Holocaust. It serves as a solemn reminder of what can \nhappen when people allow anti-Semitism, incitement to violence, and \nhatred to carry on unabated.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  What happened on Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass? 267 \nsynagogues were destroyed. 7,500 Jewish-opened businesses were looted \nand were vandalized. Up to 30,000 Jews were arrested. Almost 100 Jews \nwere killed, not to mention the untold number of violent attacks that \ntook place that night.\n  And the brutality and inhumanity only got worse from there, as Nazis \nwould go on to murder 6 million Jews over the next few years because \nthey were members of the Jewish faith.\n  I plan on joining the Greater Miami Jewish Federation on Sunday, \nNovember 15, to stand united with our community to vow never again.\n\n\n  Honoring the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance of Kendall and \n                              Coral Gables\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the \nDepression and Bipolar Support Alliance of Kendall and Coral Gables for \nsupporting individuals who are suffering from these diseases in South \nFlorida.\n  The stigma that surrounds depression and bipolar disorder is not only \nunfair, but it discourages people from seeking the help that they so \ndesperately need.\n  In the United States alone, depression impacts 21 million adults. It \ncosts $23 billion in lost work productivity. Depression impacts our \nfamilies, our coworkers, our neighbors, our friends.\n  The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance of Kendall and Coral \nGables is a unique, peer-directed organization that pairs those \nafflicted with depression with role models who have been down that road \nbefore to help them regain stability and focus.\n  I want to thank everyone involved with the Depression and Bipolar \nSupport Alliance of Kendall and Coral Gables for being valuable members \nof our community and for the important and inspiring work that each \nstaff member and professional does.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7398-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last week the House finally came to its \nsenses and overwhelmingly passed the reauthorization of the Export-\nImport Bank. I am encouraged to see that it has been included in the \nlong-term highway bill we will be considering this week.\n  We know the Ex-Im Bank helps American businesses gain access to \ncritical markets overseas and is a vital piece of our export strategy. \nBut thanks to the vocal minority, the Bank's charter expired for the \nfirst time in its history on July 1.\n  This doesn't just hurt the likes of Boeing or GE. It hurts small \nbusinesses, many of which are minority-and women-owned.\n  Last year nearly 90 percent of the Ex-Im transactions directly \nsupported small businesses without costing taxpayers a penny. That is \nwhy I urge all 313 Members who voted for Ex-Im reauthorization to \noppose any attempts in the highway bill that significantly weaken or \neliminate the Bank.\n  Now is the time for supporters to stop standing on the sidelines and \nstart standing up for American workers and exporters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7399-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOVEMBER IS DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD.

Mr. Speaker, next Wednesday is Veterans Day, and we \nwill recognize and thank the millions of men and women who have put \ntheir lives on the line for our freedom.\n  One way to honor those who have served is to make certain that our \nveterans--and all Americans--are protected from predatory payday \nlenders, who leave them saddled with insurmountable debt. That is why I \nam speaking out today to urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nto pass strong rules that protect veterans and all Americans from these \nharmful practices.\n  In Oregon and around the country, predatory lenders prey on consumers \nwho have fallen on hard times. When consumers cannot pay back the \nloans, with fees and interest rates that can dwarf the amount of the \nunderlying loan, they find themselves in financial ruin.\n  The CFPB must act quickly to develop rules to protect veterans and \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7399-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THANK YOU TO THE FRANKLIN FAMILY\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

The family has given \n50 acres of land to develop the Northeast Louisiana Veterans Cemetery.\n  George Franklin, the patriarch of the family, was a veteran himself, \na member of the Greatest Generation. In World War II, George served in \nthe Eighth Air Force, European Theater. He was a tail gunner. He flew \nover 35 missions in a B-17. He earned six air medals, four battle \nstars, and a Presidential citation.\n  The Franklin family represents a true American commitment to serve, \nand this gift from their family to the veterans is yet just another \nexample of that service. The cemetery will officially open next week--\non time--with the first internment on Veterans Day.\n  The Franklin family has given so much to Louisiana.

Despite multiple reports to officials at the Army base \nin Hawaii where Talia and her father lived, the system failed to \nprotect her.\n  Talia's tragic story is just one of over 29,000 cases of child abuse \nand neglect in military homes over the last decade. This is a problem \nthat demands better protections for our children in military families \nwho are being abused and better support for military families facing \nthe stresses of war, multiple deployments, and economic hardship.\n  I have introduced Talia's Law today, joined by Representative Mark \nTakai, which requires military officials to immediately report \nsuspected cases of abuse to State child protective services. We owe it \nto our servicemembers, their families, and thousands of children like \nTalia to disrupt the status quo and stop another decade of preventable \nchild abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7399-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEWNAN-COWETA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n  (Mr. WESTMORELAND asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND.

These pledges cover 86 \npercent of global emissions.\n  We have seen major commitments from the United States, the European \nUnion, China, and other major developing nations. We have also seen \nincredible support from the private sector.\n  Many companies, including dozens of Fortune 500 companies, have made \ncommitments to the American Business Act on Climate Pledge. Many \nbusinesses recognize that acting on climate change is not only the \nmorally right thing to do, but the economically right thing to do, \nalso.\n  An agreement in Paris would be an incredible first step that could be \nbuilt upon with even more ambitious goals in the coming years because \nthe bottom line in climate change is too big to tackle alone.\n  We need global cooperation from governments and businesses, and the \nUnited States must be a leader, demanding bold action to take on the \nvery real threats we face.\n  An agreement in Paris is good for our national security, our economy, \nand our environment.

Mr. Starr saw some things that he shared with us that I will \nnever forget.\n  After he completed his education at Texas College in Tyler, he got \nhis master's degree at Texas Southern University. He worked in the Fort \nWorth schools. He became known as a civil rights activist that was \npassionate about issues in the community. Mr. Starr was also employed \nat the FAA as a diversity manager, worked for the City of Fort Worth as \nan affirmative action manager, and worked as an investigator for the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission.

Mr. Speaker, next week, Americans will celebrate Veterans \nDay and honor the sacrifices of the men and women who have served this \nNation, but one group of veterans has gone unrecognized far too long.\n  In World War II, more than 200,000 merchant mariners braved troubled \nseas to deliver supplies to the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific. \nThey faced enemy attack and suffered a casualty rate higher than any \nother uniformed service.\n  Unfortunately, the World War II Merchant Marine veterans were never \neligible for benefits under the GI Bill and were long excluded even \nfrom Veterans Day celebrations. Many of these merchant mariners are now \nwell into their eighties and nineties and have yet to receive the honor \nand appreciation they deserve.\n  As Veterans Day approaches, I am calling once again on my colleagues \nto pass H.R. 563, legislation that will provide the fewer than 5,000 \nsurviving World War II Merchant Marine veterans with a one-time $25,000 \npayment as a token of this Nation's appreciation.\n  When my colleagues are home in their districts celebrating Veterans \nDay, I hope that what I have said today will prick their conscience. \nDespite their sacrifice, despite their patriotism, one group of \nveterans has not been celebrated. Our merchant mariners deserve so much \nmore. It is time to pass H.R. 563.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7401-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF FRED THOMPSON\n\n  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN.

To my family and to many in middle Tennessee, Fred Thompson \nwas a neighbor, a friend, and a trusted political voice.\n  His passing brings great sadness to all, especially those in his \nhometown of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, a town he never forgot, a town and \nher people that he credited with teaching him life lessons and giving \nhim the perspective he carried with him throughout life. Those small-\ntown Tennessee lessons helped mold him into the incredible man that he \nwas, with a legacy that will never be forgotten.

My mother is a breast cancer survivor. Her \ncourageous battle is my inspiration in Congress.\n  I joined more than 180 Members to cosponsor legislation that would \nencourage the government and private sector to work together to find a \ncure.

I also \nrise in recognition of National Apprenticeship Week, which runs through \nthis Saturday.\n  Training and support for those looking to enter vocational fields is \nsomething that is very important to me, as co-chairman of the \nbipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus. It is essential that \nwe give our workers the training and resources that they need to secure \nfamily-supporting jobs.\n  Apprenticeships are a vital part of this effort to help workers \nprepare for the jobs of tomorrow, along with the in-demand positions \nthat are currently going unfilled. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, the industries which rely on apprenticeship training are in \ndemand, including a huge need for certified electricians, construction \nworkers, and those in the health technology fields. More than 430,000 \nAmericans are currently participating in an apprenticeship program, \ngaining the knowledge to rise to the demands of today's workforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, these programs give workers hands-on experience and lead \nto much higher lifetime earnings for those that participate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7401-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7401-H7402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT\n\n  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1\n\n[[Page H7402]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, the right to cast an unfettered vote is \ncentral to our democracy.\n  When the United States Supreme Court invalidated key provisions of \nthe 1965 Voting Rights Act, it invited Congress to update the formula \nthat determines which jurisdictions should be covered. Unfortunately, \nwhile Congress has failed to act, we have seen jurisdiction after \njurisdiction all across this country attempting to erect impediments to \nthe right to vote.\n  The Voting Rights Advancement Act, introduced in this body and the \nbody across the Hall, responds to the Supreme Court's invitation. That \nis why we have labeled our legislative outreach strategy \n#restorethevote; and because elections are held on Tuesdays, today we \nare launching #restorationtuesday to organize Member activities online, \non the House floor, and throughout our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7402-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n                     HONORING OUR NATION'S VETERANS\n\n  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. MARCHANT.

That is why I introduced the Veterans \nBenefits Network Act. In the coming days, I will also be introducing \nlegislation to help veterans get closer to achieving the American Dream \nof entrepreneurship.\n  Our veterans risk their lives to protect our freedom and our \ndemocracy, and we must all remain committed to make sure that they have \nthe resources needed to make a successful transition into civilian \nlife.\n  Access to quality health care, affordable education, and good-paying \njobs should be guaranteed to all who serve honorably in our Armed \nForces.\n  This Veterans Day and every day, we honor the selfless service and \nsacrifices made by our veterans.

Res. 507\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the State of the Union for consideration of \n     the Senate amendment to the text of the bill (H.R. 22) to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt employees \n     with health coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans \n     Administration from being taken into account for purposes of \n     determining the employers to which the employer mandate \n     applies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \n     All points of order against consideration of the Senate \n     amendment are waived.

The \n     amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on \n     Rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered as \n     adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole.\n       Sec. 2.

The gentleman from \nGeorgia is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 507 is a structured rule \nfor the consideration of H.R. 22. It provides an hour of general \ndebate, and it makes in order 29 amendments.\n  Now, you might say, Mr. Speaker, that 29 amendments seems like that \nought to be the end of the conversation. But my friend from \nMassachusetts and I are not done with 29 amendments. There have been \nwell over 250 amendments submitted for this legislation. We have \nincluded 29 in this base text, and we are going to come back and \ninclude more.\n  This is the very first rule to come out of Paul Ryan, Speaker, U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  When Speaker Ryan was speaking to the House last week, when he took \nthe Speaker's gavel into his hands, he said, ``We need to let every \nMember contribute--not once they have earned their stripes, but right \nnow.''\n  He said, ``I come at this job as a two-time committee chair. The \ncommittees should retake the lead in drafting all major legislation. If \nyou know the issue, you should write the bill. We must open up the \nprocess. Let people participate. In other words, we need to return to \nregular order.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I won't tell it to you any way but straight. I am not \nsure what folks mean when they say a return to regular order in this \nHouse.\n  I love a free and spirited debate process. We are going to go deep \ninto the night tonight, deep into the night tomorrow night, and well \ninto the late hours on Thursday. I hope my colleagues are still going \nto be as enthusiastic about regular order when we are done as they are \nbefore we get started.\n  But regular order doesn't necessarily mean that you can use dilatory \ntactics to slow the House down. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to \nsee the same amendment 25 different times.\n  What my friend from Massachusetts and I are doing in the Rules \nCommittee, Mr. Speaker, is going through those amendments to make sure \nthat the ideas and the recommendations brought by individual Members of \nthis House have a chance to be heard, but heard once, not heard six \ndifferent times.\n  We are going to have a robust debate in the spirit of regular order \nover these next 3 days. But that will be from a pot of more than 260 \namendments winnowed down into those issues that need to be discussed, \nhave an opportunity to be discussed, on the floor of this House.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the transportation system in this country is over 4 \nmillion miles, 600,000 bridges, and 270,000 public transit route miles. \nThe scope of the transportation system in this country is vast, and its \nimportance is even more so. There is not a mayor in this country, Mr. \nSpeaker, who doesn't know that as goes their education infrastructure \nand as goes their transportation infrastructure, so goes the economy of \ntheir community.\n  Now, we are working on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nReauthorization Act, Mr. Speaker, but that is not for today. Today is \nnot education day. Today is transportation day, where we are bringing \nforward the first 6-year transportation reauthorization that this \ncountry has seen in more than a decade. We have been trying. It is not \nfrom a lack of trying, Mr. Speaker.\n  The ranking member, Mr. DeFazio, on the Transportation Committee and \nthe chairman, Mr. Shuster, on the Transportation Committee have been \nworking diligently not for days, not for weeks, and not for months, but \nfor years to try to bring this piece of legislation to the floor. This \nrule today gives us that opportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are those items in the U.S. Constitution that are \nput upon the United States Government as responsibilities that we must \nachieve together. Postal roads are among those responsibilities. There \nare those who say that Republicans are the party of\n\n[[Page H7404]]\n\nno government. I say nonsense. I say Republicans are the party of good \ngovernment. In fact, I don't even think that should be a partisan \nissue. I think that should be a nonpartisan issue, something that we \ncan all agree on, as Americans, as this body.\n  This bill doesn't just allocate the necessary dollars to the \nprojects; it changes the process that allocates those dollars so that \nwe get more value out of each and every one.\n  I will tell you a story from back home, Mr. Speaker. In fact, it is \ngoing on this week. This week a year ago would have been election week. \nI represent only two counties in the great State of Georgia. One of \nthem is the single most conservative county in the State.\n  They turned out on election day last year, Mr. Speaker; and while \nthey had rejected Federal tax increases in the past and while they had \nrejected State tax increases in the past, they got together a year ago \nthis week and voted to tax themselves--this small county in the great \nState of Georgia--to the tune of $200 million so they could expand the \nmajor highway going through that county. They didn't trust the \ngovernment here in Washington to get a dollar's worth of value out of a \ndollar's worth of taxes. They didn't trust the State government to get \na dollar's worth of value out of a dollar's worth of taxes. They \ntrusted the locality to get a dollar's worth of value out of a dollar's \nworth of taxes. And here, this week, it will have been 1 year from \nelection day and groundbreaking begins.\n  Groundbreaking begins this week, just 1 year after the decision to \nmove forward on a project. That is unheard of in Federal circles, Mr. \nSpeaker, but this bill takes not bipartisan steps, but nonpartisan \nsteps to improve upon that process.\n  Mr. Speaker, I happen to serve on both the Rules Committee and the \nTransportation Committee. I am very proud of the base product that the \nTransportation Committee in this House reported. We didn't just \nconsider that bill for a day or for a week. We worked on that bill for \nmonths as well. We passed it out of committee on a voice vote, Mr. \nSpeaker. We passed it out of committee unanimously. In fact, we passed \nthe rule out of the Rules Committee last night on a voice vote to bring \nthis resolution to the floor.\n  This is an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to show the American people what \nis best about this House. What is best about this House is not that we \nall agree on everything, because we don't. What is best about this \nHouse is not that we all represent the same kinds of values and \nconstituencies back home, because we don't. What is best about this \nHouse is that we have an opportunity to come together, express all of \nthose issues, and let the chips fall where they may.\n  If you look in these 29 amendments, Mr. Speaker, you will see most of \nthem are bipartisan or nonpartisan amendments. But we have amendments \nmade in order that are just brought by Republicans, and we have \namendments made in order that are just brought by Democrats. The Rules \nCommittee has the power to do whatever the Rules Committee would like \nto do. We are not using that power today to shut the voices out, Mr. \nSpeaker. We are using the power today to bring the voices together.\n  I am very proud to bring this rule. I think it is worthy of all the \nMembers' support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nWoodall) for the customary 30 minutes.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before I get into the subject matter that \nwe are here to discuss, I do want to respond to my friend from Georgia \nabout Speaker Ryan's call for regular order, which I think many on our \nside welcome. But we are not going to get too excited yet because that \nsame pledge was made when Speaker Boehner became Speaker of the House, \nand that pledge was broken over and over and over again. In fact, he \npresided over the most closed Congress in the history of our country, \nmore closed rules than any other Congress in history.\n  When my friend asked the question, ``What does regular order mean?'' \nwell, it means that we don't bypass committees of jurisdiction. We let \nthem do their work, and then we bring that bill to the Rules Committee, \nas opposed to having some committee staff write a bill in the back room \nsomeplace in the Capitol, present it, and then have the Rules Committee \ngive it a closed rule. It means allowing for all sides to be heard.\n  The Rules Committee has routinely blocked out amendments on \nlegitimate issues because the Republican leadership didn't want to deal \nwith it. They didn't want to have that debate.\n  So it means a more open and transparent process. It means a process \nthat is more fair and more respectful of all Members, not just \nDemocrats, but to Republicans as well. I hope that when Speaker Ryan \nmade that pledge, it is more than just words; that we will see, in the \ncoming weeks and months, something different around here.\n  I would also just say that I don't mean to pick on Speaker Boehner \nbecause we do have people on the Rules Committee on the Republican side \nwho have routinely voted to shut this process down. I hope that there \nis a change of attitude in the Rules Committee, as well, for a more \nopen and a more transparent process.\n  So having said that, Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the \nconsideration of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform \nAct, a 6-year highway bill. After 35 short-term extensions--35 short-\nterm extensions--this is a welcome step to providing the kind of \ncertainty that our State and our local officials need. In fact, they \nhave been clamoring for this for a very, very long time.\n  Of the 284 amendments submitted to the Rules Committee for \nconsideration, the rule we are talking about right now makes in order \n29. We expect the committee to meet later today to consider the \nremaining amendments.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and \nSubcommittee on Highways and Transit Chairman Sam Graves and Ranking \nMember Eleanor Holmes Norton for all of their hard work to get us to \nthis point.\n  This isn't the highway bill that I would have written, but the bottom \nline is that we need a long-term surface transportation authorization \nbill. States need to be able to count on Federal funding for more than \na month at a time. Large-scale infrastructure projects take years to \ncomplete. States need certainty, and this bill is a step forward in \nthat direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, our roads and our bridges are already in need of massive \nrepairs. I tell my colleagues all the time that we have bridges in \nMassachusetts that are older than most of your States. The underlying \nbill provides $325 billion in contract authority from the highway trust \nfund over 6 years for highway, transit, and safety programs. It would \nallow for automatic adjustments if more money comes into the highway \ntrust fund.\n  I am pleased to see that among the provisions in this bill is a \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which is the same language \nthat the House passed with strong bipartisan support last week, \nnotwithstanding the fact that we had to use a discharge petition \nbecause the way this place operates, the will of the majority was not \nrespected. But we should vote against any amendments--any and all \namendments--that would jeopardize this provision.\n  Not only will a long-term highway bill help our economy, but it will \ncreate and sustain thousands of American jobs, particularly in the \nconstruction and manufacturing industries that were hardest hit by the \nGreat Recession.\n  In all candor, I can't say that I am enamored with everything in this \nbill. I wish that it provided more robust funding levels. I am sorry to \nsee that we are continuing to use guarantee fees as a pay-for on an \nunrelated transportation bill. G-fees should be used to protect \ntaxpayers from mortgage losses, not as an offset on a highway bill.\n  I also have serious concerns about the use of private debt collection \nas an offset in this bill. Instead of raising money, if history is any \nindication, it\n\n[[Page H7405]]\n\nis likely the use of private debt collection agencies would result in \nthe Federal Government losing revenue. We know that because that has \nhappened in the past.\n  Moving forward, I would strongly, strongly caution against loading \nthis bill up with controversial provisions. This rule makes in order an \namendment by Congressman Ribble of Wisconsin to permit States to allow \nbigger and heavier trucks on our interstate highways, and I understand \nthat several other amendments have been offered to increase truck size \nand truck weights. I think passing these kinds of amendments is one of \nthe most dangerous things that we can do, and I believe it would \nseriously threaten this carefully crafted compromise.\n  Despite what some in the trucking industry might have you believe, \nbigger trucks have never resulted in fewer trucks on our road. Since \n1982, when Congress last increased the gross vehicle weight limit, \ntruck registrations have increased 90 percent.\n  Now, some say if we allow bigger and heavier trucks on our Federal \nInterstate Highway System, we can somehow alleviate their presence on \nlocal roads. That is a false argument because trucks still need to make \ndeliveries and pickups at warehouses and businesses, and local roads \nare the way they get there. So all the Ribble amendment would do is \nmake more of our roads less safe.\n  By the way, on the Interstate Highway System, these bigger and \nheavier trucks can drive faster, thereby endangering more and more of \nthe others who are driving on these highways. Bigger truck crashes kill \nnearly 4,000 people every year, and the reality is that most of those \nfatalities are those in passenger vehicles, not the trucker. Big trucks \npay only a fraction of the true cost of the wear and tear they cause on \nour roads and bridges. State budgets are stretched to the brink as it \nis and can't afford to make up for the multibillion-dollar \nunderpayments.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans have said loud and clear over and over again \nthat they don't want bigger trucks. A January 2015 nationwide survey by \nHarper Polling found that 76 percent of respondents oppose longer, \nheavier trucks, and a May 2013 public opinion poll by Lake Research \nPartners found that 68 percent of Americans opposed heavier trucks. \nThat should be enough to give people who want to put bigger and heavier \ntrucks on our roads some pause. But as I have learned serving in this \nCongress, usually this place does the opposite of what the American \npeople want.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that in MAP-21, the most recent long-term \nhighway bill, Congress directed the Department of Transportation to \nconduct a comprehensive study on truck size and weight laws. After 2 \nyears of careful study, DOT concluded that the current data limitations \nwere so profound that no changes in truck size and weight laws in \nregulations should be considered until these data limitations could be \novercome. So we asked DOT to do a study, and that is their \nrecommendation. Yet there are all these amendments to try to get around \nthat.\n  I would just say to my friends who are thinking of voting for some of \nthese amendments to allow bigger, heavier, and more dangerous trucks on \nthe road and on our Interstate Highway System to talk to some of the \nfamilies of the victims. I have, on a regular basis, talked to people \nwho have lost their husbands, their wives, their kids, and their best \nfriends to these senseless crashes. Think about them before you just go \nalong with whatever particular special interest asks you to do.\n  By the way, those who drive these trucks are opposed to this. They \nare opposed to this. Yet here we are with an attempt to try to kind of \nmake our roads less safe.\n  So loading this bill up with all kinds of exemptions to truck size \nand weight laws I think would be a huge mistake and would jeopardize \nthe passage of the underlying bill. I urge my colleagues to reject the \nRibble amendment and all these other amendments that may be made in \norder to put bigger, heavier, and more dangerous trucks on the road.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the return to regular order and all \nof the amendments that we are going to consider today, it is not lost \non me that just here in the Rules Committee debate, my friend from \nMassachusetts was able to talk about truck size and weight for longer \nthan regular order would have allowed the proponent of an amendment to \ntalk about that. Under the 5-minute rule, which is what we have here to \nconduct these issues, it is hard to grapple with some of these big \nissues in an amendment process.\n  Some of these issues, as my friend from Massachusetts suggested, \nshould be hashed out in committee, where there is no time limit, where \nwe can work on these, where we can consider all of the studies, where \nwe can go through all of the work.\n  There is a role for the Rules Committee to pick and choose \namendments, those that have been considered enough, those that can be \nconsidered in a short period of time, and those that need to remain in \ncommittee and be hashed out there.\n  As we grapple with what regular order means, I hope my colleagues \nwill come down on the side of reserving the biggest of these issues for \ncommittee work and the more minor changes for here on the floor of the \nHouse.\n  While I prefer to agree with my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. \nSpeaker, I have to disagree with him about the track record we put \ntogether in this body over the last 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  I came to Congress at the exact same time that John Boehner became \nSpeaker of the House. My first experience here in this Chamber, Mr. \nSpeaker, was when John Boehner brought H.R. 1 to the floor. It turns \nout the Democratic Congress had not finished the budgeting process the \nyear before.\n  So here we were. We were in the middle of the fiscal year. No budget \nhad been passed. No appropriations bills had been passed. This brand-\nnew Congress comes in, the biggest freshman class in American history. \nIt was an exciting, exciting time, Mr. Speaker, as you will recall.\n  One of the first bills out of the gate was a bill to fund $3.5 \ntrillion worth of Federal Government. All these new Members here have \nall been sent with a mandate from their constituents back home.\n  While history would have suggested that a Speaker would have closed \ndown that process, said this is too important to put before the entire \nHouse, what Speaker John Boehner said is: Bring the bill to the floor \nand we will debate it for as long as it takes.\n  Mr. Speaker, do you remember that? It was all night long, day in, day \nout, until we finished the job. Every Member on this floor had their \nvoice.\n  We can't always do that, Mr. Speaker. There is not enough daylight or \ndarkness in the year to do that with every bill that comes to the floor \nof the House. But I cannot let it be said that Speaker Boehner presided \nover the most closed Congress in history. In fact, the opposite is \ntrue.\n  If you track down my Democratic friends, they will tell you they \noffered more amendments in a John Boehner Speakership than they ever \nhad a chance to offer in a Speaker Pelosi Speakership. I am not \nfaulting the previous Speaker, Mr. Speaker. I am only saying that \nopenness is something you have to believe because it is hard. It is \ncomplicated.\n  I listened to my friend from Massachusetts. He said: I want an open \nprocess. I just want to defeat all the amendments I don't like that \ncome to the floor of the House.\n  Sometimes that is just the way it is. Sometimes you have to come down \nhere to the floor of the House, you have to have the difficult debate, \nand you have to win on the merits.\n  Mr. Speaker, we did ask the Department of Transportation to consider \ntruck weights. We absolutely did. And we passed it in a bipartisan way. \nIt was signed by the President of the United States. The date the \nreport was due back to this Congress was last year.\n  Last year is when this body spoke and said: You have to have this \nstudy back to us by the winter of 2014.\n  The Department of Transportation said: Whatever. Whatever. We are \nworking on it. It is really hard. I know Congress told us to. I know \nthey are the boss. But whatever. We will get there.\n  Here we are a year later and we still don't have the report, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n\n[[Page H7406]]\n\nDon't let it be said that we are succeeding here at the Federal level.\n  What does my friend from Wisconsin (Mr. Ribble) do? This is radical. \nI want to redescribe the radical amendment that my friend from \nMassachusetts just spoke about. The radical idea that my friend from \nWisconsin has is: Let's let the State governments decide for themselves \nabout what the truck weights should be on Federal highways in their \nsystem.\n  I don't dispute for a moment that there are going to be States that \nsay: This is too dangerous. We don't want heavier trucks on our road. I \ndon't doubt that for a minute.\n  But don't you doubt for a minute, Mr. Speaker, that there will be \nStates that say: Today we allow those heavier trucks on our small two-\nlane curvy roads through north Georgia.\n  If you really care about families that have been harmed by truck \naccidents, then you want those trucks off of those dangerous two-lane \nroads and you want them on the finest highway system known to man: the \nUnited States interstate system.\n  I trust States to make those decisions, Mr. Speaker. Don't think for \na moment--don't think for a moment--that the collective wisdom of 435 \npeople in this body is a good substitute for folks who sit back home in \nthe great State of Georgia. I promise you, our judgment, the way we \nlove on one another in Georgia is superior to anything this body could \ncraft.\n  That is the radical idea from my friend from Wisconsin (Mr. Ribble). \nLet States decide. Let the local people who have to deal with the \nconsequences of action or inaction--let them decide.\n  It feels right to me, Mr. Speaker. That is what is wonderful about \nthis body. We are going to make these amendments in order. We are going \nto bring them to the floor of the House. We are going to have the \ndebate. And then, lo and behold, at the end of the process, you are \ngoing to have to stick your card in the slot and vote ``yes'' or \n``no.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the way it is supposed to be. I don't want a \nbody where we all agree on everything all the time. I want a body where \nwe are able to talk about those things that divide us and where we are \nable to unite around those things that unite us.\n  One of those things, Mr. Speaker, is what my friend from \nMassachusetts said. We have been in a short-term extension process for \nfar too long. It has been a short-term extension process that has gone \nthrough both Republican and Democratic leaderships, Mr. Speaker. This \nis not a partisan problem. This is an American problem.\n  Today the Transportation Committee has crafted an American solution \nthat, if we pass this rule, we will be able to consider.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am now really worried about what Speaker Ryan meant \nwhen he said that we were going to return to regular order, based on \nwhat my colleague, Mr. Woodall, just said as he defended the Boehner \nCongress, which, by the way, is the most closed Congress in the history \nof our Congress--more closed rules, over 180 closed rules. If you want \nto defend that process, fine.\n  Not only the closed rules, but on major amendments, important issues \nwere not even allowed to be brought up. We tried to debate the war--we \nare at war--and the Rules Committee, with the blessing of the \nleadership, wouldn't even allow us to bring that to the House floor. \nImportant issues are routinely denied here.\n  If your idea of regular order is still ``your way or the highway,'' \nthen I don't think that much is going to be changed, just maybe the \nsame menu, a different waiter, I guess. That is about what we can \nexpect. I hope that is not the case.\n  I think the record, not only how the Republicans have treated the \nminority with regard to important bills, but also to a lot of people on \nyour own side, has been lousy. It has been a bad record.\n  I am hoping that the new Speaker understands that and believes that \nthis place could be better served if we have a more inclusive process, \nmore regular order, and we respected our committees.\n  By the way, speaking of committees, the Transportation Committee \ndidn't see fit to put in a provision for bigger truck sizes and heavier \ntrucks. That is the committee of jurisdiction. They didn't do that.\n  Mr. Ribble has the right to bring his amendment. These other people \nhave the right to bring their amendment. Members will have a whole 10 \nminutes to debate this.\n  I would also say that not all amendments are created equally. Some \nare more important than others. I think this is an amendment that is \nmore important than some of the sense of Congress language that we are \ngoing to be debating in terms of amendments later.\n  But a whole 10 minutes and we are going to let the States decide. \nThat is the retort from my colleague from Georgia. I get it.\n  There are people in this House, especially on the Republican side, \nwho think the States should control everything; that when it comes to \ncivil rights or voting rights, let the States decide, and the Federal \nGovernment should have no role in guaranteeing that everybody in this \ncountry has their voting rights protected or their civil rights \nprotected. I disagree with that.\n  On this issue, it is an issue of safety. When the gentleman says that \nwe are just trying to take these big trucks off these side roads, that \nis not true. These trucks still have to go on those small roads to do \ntheir deliveries.\n  That is not going to change. They will still have to utilize those \nroads. On those side roads, I wish there weren't these big trucks, but \nat least they are going slower than they will on an interstate highway.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Andrew Matthews, \nchairman of the National Troopers Coalition, representing 45,000 \nmembers, asking us to oppose any amendment forcing States to allow \nheavier and longer trucks on our Nation's highway.\n  Every one of us here is saying please don't do this, please don't do \nthis. We will have a whole 5 minutes to make the case against that \namendment.\n\n                                  National Troopers Coalition,\n\n                                               September 23, 2015.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Peter DeFazio,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio: On behalf \n     of the National Troopers Coalition's 45,000 members, we ask \n     that you oppose any amendment forcing states to allow heavier \n     and longer trucks on our nation's highways when you consider \n     the transportation reauthorization. Specifically, we urge you \n     to vote against any amendments allowing the operation of \n     91,000 pound single tractor-trailers or double 33-foot \n     tractor-trailers, replacing the twin 28-foot trailers in \n     operation today.\n       Troopers, every day, see the dangers these longer and \n     heavier rigs pose to the motoring public and our officers. \n     With heavier trucks, stopping distances increase threatening \n     the motoring public and our Trooper members. And if ``Twin \n     33s'' become legal, this could ultimately replace 53-foot \n     singles as one of the most commonly used configurations, \n     adding a dangerous 17 feet in length to our already crowded \n     highways.\n       The transportation reauthorization bill should not include \n     such a far-reaching policy change, especially following the \n     release of the long-awaited USDOT truck size and weight \n     study, which largely concluded that not enough data exists to \n     make a clear recommendation on changing any existing truck \n     size and weight laws.\n       The bottom line is bigger and heavier trucks make our roads \n     and highways are unsafe due to, among other things, greater \n     stopping distances and higher risk of rollover. The National \n     Troopers Coalition opposes any changes to current truck size \n     and weight laws and urges you to do the same. Should you have \n     any questions or need any additional information, I can be \n     reached.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Andrew Matthews, Esq.,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the Teamsters Union, which most of these \ntruck drivers are Teamsters, sent us a letter strongly urging us to \noppose the Ribble amendment. Law enforcement, the drivers, all these \nsafety coalitions say no; but a special interest comes in here and says \nthey would like an exemption, and everybody Clambers to try to help \nthem out. Know what you are voting for before you vote for this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to call attention to an important safety \nprovision in the\n\n[[Page H7407]]\n\nSenate-passed DRIVE Act being considered by the House this week.\n  I am pleased the House is working in a bipartisan manner to fix our \nNation's critical highway infrastructure needs. I want to bring \nattention to a key provision which is included in the DRIVE Act that \npassed the Senate earlier this year.\n  In 2004, two young sisters, Raechel and Jacqueline Houck, were killed \njust outside my district when their rented Chrysler PT Cruiser caught \nfire and crashed due to a defective steering component. The vehicle was \nnot grounded or fixed before it was rented to the Houck sisters, \ndespite having a safety recall notice issued a month before the tragic \naccident.\n  While today Federal law prohibits car dealers from selling new cars \nsubject to a recall, there is no similar law prohibiting rental car \ncompanies from renting out vehicles under a safety recall.\n  That is why I am so pleased the Senate included the text of my bill, \nH.R. 2198, the Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act, into \nthe DRIVE Act.\n  This legislation is nothing more than a commonsense fix. It modifies \nexisting law to prohibit rental car companies from renting a vehicle \nunder recall until it has been fixed. Pure and simple, consumers must \nbe protected from renting cars that are subject to a safety recall.\n  This key provision does not only have bipartisan support in the \nHouse, but it is also supported by the rental car industry, consumer \nsafety groups, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nGeneral Motors, and Honda.\n  Furthermore, a change.org petition calling for passage of this bill \nwas started by Raechel and Jacqueline's mother, Cally Houck. It has \nreceived signatures from over 180,000 consumers nationwide.\n  I am disappointed that there may be attempts to strike this critical \nvehicle safety language from this final highway bill. I believe such \nactions are misguided and would seriously undermine the tireless effort \nby Cally Houck and the families who have lost loved ones due to this \nclear defect in our safety laws.\n  Therefore, as the House debates the highway bill this week, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose any amendments to weaken or undermine this \nimportant bipartisan language.\n  Let us honor the lives of Raechel and Jacqueline Houck by working \ntogether to enact a simple, yet meaningful solution that will surely \nsave lives in the future.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I certainly agree with my friend from Massachusetts that folks ought \nto know what they are talking about before they come and vote on \namendments. In fact, I think folks ought to know what they talk about \nwhen they even come down and talk about amendments. I think that ought \nto be part of the thing. There is no point of order to stipulate that, \nbut I believe it is an important provision.\n  I serve on the Transportation Committee, Mr. Speaker. So I have a \nvested interest in this. I have kind of a pride of authorship. We \nworked very hard on this.\n  In my friend from Massachusetts' opening statement, he thanked the \nchairman and the ranking member of the full committee and of the \nsubcommittee. They call them the Big Four on that committee, Mr. \nSpeaker, the Big Four.\n  If you can get the Big Four to have an agreement, then you feel like \nyou can get your amendment across the finish line because being a \ncommittee chairman means something.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Among the many amendments that we considered in committee were truck \nweight amendments, Mr. Speaker. I know this because I serve on that \ncommittee.\n  Did you know, today, Mr. Speaker, that we have first responder \nvehicles--fire trucks, for example--that are prohibited from getting on \nFederal highways because of this system? If you are in a crisis--if you \nare in a first responder crisis--because of the wisdom of the Federal \nGovernment, the wisdom of this body, we have said: Do you know what? \nYou probably shouldn't get on the fastest and most direct route to \nrespond to the crisis. We really need you to stay on the local roads. \nNo interstate travel for you.\n  That is just nonsense. That is absolute nonsense.\n  Good news, Mr. Speaker. We have folks here in this body who care \nabout ferreting out the nonsense and putting a stop to it. So we \nconsidered that amendment in committee, and we passed that amendment in \ncommittee. If we pass this rule today, Mr. Speaker, we can change the \nlaw of the land to make that difference for people.\n  This is a new day in terms of House leadership, Mr. Speaker. It is a \nnew day. I am going to be interested to see whether we spend more time \nlitigating the past or planning for the future. I am about looking \nforward. I am optimistic about tomorrow. I know it is going to be \nbetter than yesterday no matter how good yesterday was. This is the \nopportunity we have here together.\n  Unanimous out of committee. Voiced out of the Rules Committee. This \nis the bill. I don't want anybody to be confused. There is no civil \nrights legislation in this bill today. This is a transportation bill. I \ndon't want anybody to be confused. We are not rolling back anything for \nanyone here today. This is a bipartisan--even better, nonpartisan--\ntransportation funding bill. I don't want anybody to be confused today. \nThis is something that Democrats failed to get done when they ran the \nshow, and it is something Republicans failed to get done when they ran \nthe show. Now we are all here together, getting it done. I think that \nis worth celebrating.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to pass this rule so we can get to it and \nthen support the underlying bill as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do, I \nwill offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation that will \nrestore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  We need to recommit ourselves to voter equality. This legislation \nwould require Federal approval in some States for changes to voting \npractices that could be discriminatory.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, you will notice many of us are wearing \n``Restore the Vote'' pins here today because we are, quite frankly, \nappalled by what is going on in certain States in terms of taking away \npeople's right to vote. We find that offensive, and we think that there \nis a Federal obligation to guarantee that right, that we just can't \nleave it up to the States. All of us in this country should have equal \nprotections under the law when it comes to voting.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell).\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of voting \nrights for all Americans. I was proud to stand alongside my fellow \ncolleagues this morning to launch the Restore the Vote legislative \nstrategy.\n  This national effort will help mobilize support for H.R. 2867, the \nVoting Rights Advancement Act of 2015, a bill that I sponsored with \nRepresentatives Judy Chu and Linda Sanchez in order to restore critical \nFederal oversight to jurisdictions which have a recent history of voter \ndiscrimination.\n  Since elections are held on Tuesdays, every Tuesday that Congress is \nin session, we will declare it to be ``Restoration Tuesday.'' Members \nof Congress will wear a ``Restore the Vote'' ribbon pin and will speak \non the House floor about the importance of restoring and protecting \nvoting rights for all Americans. Today is the first Restoration \nTuesday, and I am honored to speak on behalf of H.R. 2867, the Voting \nRights Advancement Act.\n  Two years ago, Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court in the Shelby case \nstruck down the Federal preclearance. The Supreme Court issued a \nchallenge to Congress to develop a modern-day coverage\n\n[[Page H7408]]\n\nformula that looks at current discriminatory acts by States and \npolitical jurisdiction. The Voting Rights Advancement Act answers that \nchallenge.\n  The bill restores and advances the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by \nlooking at recent voter discrimination practices since 1990. An entire \nState can be covered by preclearance if 15 or more voting violations \noccur in a State in the most recent 25-year period. This updated \ncoverage formula ensures that 13 States, including my home State of \nAlabama, are required to obtain preclearance for changes in voting \npractices and laws. The 13 States that will be covered under this new \nformula include Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, \nSouth Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Arizona, Texas, New York, \nCalifornia, and Virginia. The bill also provides greater transparency \nin Federal elections by ensuring that voters get notice of changes in \nlocations and of changes in voting practices.\n  Put simply, the Voting Rights Advancement Act offers more voter \nprotection to more people in more States.\n  Mr. Speaker, old battles have become new again. Since the Shelby \ndecision, 33 States across this Nation have issued photo I.D. laws that \nhave made it harder for vulnerable communities to vote, like our senior \ncitizens, our young people, and the disabled.\n  As a daughter of Selma, I am painfully aware that the injustices \nsuffered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge 50 years ago have not been fully \nvindicated. Just recently, my constituents were dealt a very \ndevastating blow when Alabama closed 31 DMVs--that's right, driver's \nlicense offices--a State that had recently adopted one of the Nation's \nharsher photo I.D. laws. This decision is completely unacceptable. \nThese closures render it almost impossible for so many of my \nconstituents to get the most popular form of photo I.D., which is a \ndriver's license.\n  This DMV closure decision is just one example of modern-day barriers \nto voting. While we no longer have to count marbles in a jar or recite \nthe names of all of the counties, there are still laws and decisions \nthat make it harder for people to vote. ``Injustice anywhere is a \nthreat to justice everywhere,'' Martin Luther King once said.\n  On March 7, 2015, I welcomed President and Mrs. Obama as well as \nPresident Bush and Mrs. Bush, along with 100 Members of the House and \nthe Senate, to my hometown of Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery. Mr. \nSpeaker, it was a ``kumbaya'' moment when Republicans and Democrats \ngathered together in recognition of how far our Nation had come in \nliving up to its ideals of justice and equality for all.\n\n  The 50th commemoration of the marches from Selma to Montgomery must \nbe so much more than just one day of reflection, Mr. Speaker. A single \nmoment filled with colorful language and wonderful speeches is nice, \nand walking hand in hand across the Edmund Pettus Bridge is nice; but \ngone should be the days of ``feel good'' moments that, in and of \nthemselves, lead to no clear path to action. The Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act is that action.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, we are asking our colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to join with us in supporting the Voting \nRights Advancement Act as Congress must act now to protect the rights \nof all Americans.\n  The fate of our democracy depends upon its citizens having the \nunfettered right to vote. Our vote is our voice, and no voices should \nbe silenced. We are asking everyone to join us in our efforts to make \nsure that we restore the vote to the voices of the excluded. To \nrestrict the ability of any American to vote is an assault on all \nAmericans' rights to participate equally in the electoral process.\n  I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2867, the Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  It is easy on a big bill like this to get confused about what is in \nit and what is not in it. I would refer folks to transport.house.gov. \nThat is not just for Members of Congress, Mr. Speaker. Anybody across \nthe country can access that.\n  What you are going to find--and, again, what is an extraordinary \nsuccess story that we have on the floor today--are all of these \nnational priorities that we share. The bill refocuses funding on \nnational priorities. It gets us back to the core of the original \nhighway trust fund. It reforms the program, again, in a bipartisan--\neven nonpartisan--way to get the dollars on the ground faster to make a \ndifference in people's lives.\n  Time is money, Mr. Speaker, whether you are shipping goods or whether \nyou are sitting in traffic. It promotes innovation to bring some new \nideas into the transportation infrastructure. We are getting ready for \nnext generation roads, and that language is here: roads and bridges, \npublic transportation, driver safety, truck and bus safety, hazardous \nmaterials. It is all in here.\n  There are those bills in Congress where the more you read them, the \nmore you think: ``Man, what were those guys thinking?'' This is one of \nthose bills where the more you read it, you think: ``How in the world \ndid those guys get it done?'' This is a success story, Mr. Speaker. It \nis worthy of all of my colleagues' support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We need to pursue this in the manner we are doing it because, again, \nimportant issues like this don't ever see the light of day in this \nHouse. We can't talk about voting rights or vote on a bill to protect \nvoting rights. We can't vote on immigration reform because my friends \nare slaves to this majority rule on their side of the aisle. These are \nimportant issues, and we shouldn't just leave them to the States in \nwhich people's voting rights are being denied.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina \n(Ms. Adams).\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, August 6 marked the 50th anniversary of the \npassage of the bipartisan Voting Rights Act of 1965, historic \nlegislation that prevented State and local governments from denying any \ncitizen the right to vote based on his race, ensuring equal voting \nrights for all.\n  In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a major provision of this law, \nseverely limiting the Federal oversight of State voting laws. My home \nState of North Carolina passed the most egregious voting law in the \nNation immediately after that decision, which slashed early voting, \nimplemented strict voter I.D. requirements, and ended pre voter \nregistration programs. Other States across the country followed suit \nand also implemented election laws that disenfranchised voters.\n  All voters should be able to make their voices heard and elect \nleaders of their choice, and I am proud to join my colleagues today in \nrenewing our call to repair America's broken election system.\n  I cosponsored the Voting Rights Advancement Act to help restore \nFederal oversight to jurisdictions which have a recent history of voter \ndiscrimination. This bill updates the coverage formula to ensure that \nStates like North Carolina are required to obtain preclearance for \nchanges to voting practices and procedures. It reaffirms our commitment \nto voter equality, and it creates additional pathways for voter access. \nSimply put, this bill protects the right to vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation \nbecause every American deserves to have his voice heard. Every American \ndeserves equal access to the ballot box, and every American deserves \nthe right to vote.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Mrs. Beatty).\n  Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is election day in Ohio. Right now, my constituents \nare casting ballots to decide their next local, State, and judicial \nelected officials. Participating in our democratic process is not only \na right, but it is a duty. Unfortunately, again, for many Americans, \nvoting recently became more difficult in 2013.\n  As you have heard my colleagues mention, Mr. Speaker, that is when \nthe Supreme Court struck down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965\n\n[[Page H7409]]\n\nin its Shelby v. Holder decision, making it easier for States and \nlocalities to disenfranchise voters in areas that have a history of \nvoter suppression.\n  We shouldn't roll back voting rights protections. Instead, we should \nhonor the progress our country has made to ensure equal rights and \nequal treatment.\n  Congress should immediately bring H.R. 2867, the Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act of 2015, to the floor so all Americans may cast ballots \nto choose their leaders and their public servants. I am a cosponsor--\nno. Let me say I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, and it enjoys \nbipartisan support and leadership support in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  Mr. Speaker, voting rights restoration should happen now. On \nTuesdays, I will proudly wear my pin for restoring the vote. Mr. \nSpeaker, again, that is restoring the vote.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleague if he has any \nfurther speakers remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I am ready to close for our side.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in a few moments, I am going to offer an amendment to \nthe rule. It has been worked out collaboratively with the minority. I \nsaid when I began that we were making almost 30 amendments in order, \nbut we were nowhere close to done. In fact, this amendment wants to \nmake another 16 amendments in order right now.\n  We are still going to go back to the Rules Committee and meet at 3 \np.m. We are still going to make even more amendments in order, but this \namendment will make an additional 16 amendments in order under this \nrule. It will make more time available for debate, Mr. Speaker.\n  We want to make a technical fix to dispense with the reading of the \nSenate bill so that we can get directly into amendments. That is a \nstandard procedure, but it was not in the base rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is only going to make this rule better. I look \nforward to offering that amendment here in just a few moments.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. How much time do I have left, Mr. Speaker?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by reiterating our call for Members to vote \n``no'' on the previous question so that we can restore the vote.\n  Only in this Republican-controlled House of Representatives is the \nnotion of protecting everybody's right to vote a radical idea. We see \nvoter suppression efforts all across this country, and it is a Federal \nresponsibility. It is a Federal responsibility, and we have got to live \nup to that responsibility. So I hope that my colleagues will vote \n``no,'' so we can have this debate and we can have an up-or-down vote \non this.\n  Quite frankly, the committees of jurisdiction should have ruled this \nbill to the floor, and we should be having that debate. But I guess for \npolitical reasons my colleagues don't see the benefit in moving this \nimportant legislation to the floor. We have an opportunity to do that \ntoday.\n  Secondly, Mr. Speaker, I again want to commend Chairman Shuster, \nRanking Member DeFazio, and their entire team for bringing us here \ntoday with a carefully crafted compromise, 6-year highway bill, which, \nI think, is absolutely imperative. Our States, our cities, and our \ntowns have been demanding this for a long, long time, and we are very \nclose to making some progress.\n  I would urge, like I did in my opening statement, we ought not to \nscrew it up with a whole bunch of controversial amendments because some \nspecial interest PAC thinks it is a good idea.\n  I will again reiterate my strong opposition, not only to the Ribble \namendment, but to a whole bunch of other amendments that will allow \nbigger and heavier trucks on our Federal Interstate Highway System. \nThese are Federal highways. Yes, it is a Federal responsibility. It is \na Federal responsibility.\n  I would just remind my colleagues that the people who agree with me \non this include the National Troopers Association, the National \nSheriffs' Association, the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the National Association of Police Organizations, AAA, the \nNational League of Cities, the National Association of Towns and \nTownships, the American Public Works Association, The U.S. Conference \nof Mayors, Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, Road Safe America, \nBrain Injury Association of America, Parents Against Tired Truckers, \nAdvocates for Auto Safety, Trucking Alliance, the Teamsters, and the \nAFL-CIO. I can go on and on and on.\n  The overwhelming opinion on this is that we should not go down the \nroad of bigger and heavier trucks; yet we have got a special interest \nout there that says we should do it, and so all of a sudden Members are \nclamoring to do it. It would be a mistake. It would make our roads more \ndangerous. It will threaten the safety of passengers on our highways. \nIt is a bad idea.\n  Certainly, people ought to pay attention to what they are voting on \nbefore they come here and vote for this. Unfortunately, we are not \ngoing to have the time to debate it because it is going to be 5 minutes \non each side. I think it would be a threat to this bill, and I think \nthat would be a huge mistake.\n  Let us respect the great work that has been done by the \nTransportation Committee. Let's not load it up with a bunch of \ncontroversial provisions. This is about safety on our highways, first \nand foremost. If my colleagues don't believe that, they ought to talk \nto the families who have lost loved ones in accidents due to bigger and \nheavier trucks. They ought to talk to the drivers. They ought to talk \nto people who know what they are talking about and not rely on a \nparticular special interest.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the \nprevious question so we can have this debate and a vote on protecting \nvoting rights in this country to restore the vote.\n  Let's respect the work that the committee of jurisdiction has done \nhere, but let's vote ``no'' on these efforts to allow bigger and \nheavier trucks on our roads. For the sake of our constituents, for \ntheir safety, let us do the right thing and vote ``no'' on those \namendments.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is one of those days where I don't think it is a \nrare moment of agreement; I think it is a typical moment of agreement. \nThere are issues that divide us, and there are issues that unite us. \nFocusing on America's infrastructure is one of those issues that unites \nus.\n  I agreed with my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker, when he said \nhe hoped in the new administration here in this House that we focused \non fairness and respect. I think that is absolutely right. I think that \nis what the American people ask of us back home.\n  I don't particularly think that suggesting that there are folks in \nthis body who are moving amendments to the floor based on the bidding \nof special interests moves us in the direction of respect. In fact, I \nthink it moves us in the opposite direction, Mr. Speaker. I don't think \nsuggesting there are those in this body who care about the individual \nsafety of families in our district and those who don't moves us in the \ndirection of fairness or respect, Mr. Speaker. I think it moves us in \nthe opposite direction. That is the challenge that our new Speaker has. \nWe are trying to get to regular order, trying to have all the voices \nheard, Mr. Speaker, but you have seen the complexity of that just here \ntoday.\n  On the one hand, you have heard a passionate speech for why we \nshouldn't be considering trucking amendments in a trucking bill; that \nthere couldn't possibly be enough time to discuss trucking while \ndealing with trucks, why we shouldn't possibly have an opportunity to \nbring experts together who have just passed a trucking bill to deal \nwith more trucking issues. On the other hand, you heard a very \npassionate plea of why we should bring a Judiciary Committee \nlegislative bill into the transportation bill.\n\n  This bipartisan bill, this bill that has been worked out, this bill \nthat has succeeded where Congress after Congress after Congress has \nfailed, you have\n\n[[Page H7410]]\n\nheard a very passionate pitch to say, you know what, let's take that \ntransportation bill and let's drop in a giant judiciary issue on top of \nit because that is regular order. It is not regular order.\n  I don't dispute that there is frustration in this body for the pace \nat which legislation moves. I share it. Mr. Speaker, I instigate it for \nPete's sake. I came here in the class of 2010. I want to get things \ndone. As soon as we come together and get this done, by golly, we can \ngo back to poking or kicking or talking or whatever it is that folks \nneed to get done, but that is not this bill.\n  This bill is a success. This process is a success. The openness of \nthis process is something that we can all be proud of. It doesn't just \nhappen because Chairman Sessions and Ranking Member Slaughter come \ntogether in the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker. It happens because \nChairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio came together in the \nTransportation Committee. This is one of those moments that brings us \ntogether, not as a body, but as a nation, getting about the business \nthat our constituents sent us here to do.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Woodall\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer an amendment to the \nresolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 11, insert after the period: ``The first \n     reading of the Senate amendment shall be dispensed with.''.\n       At the end of the first section, add the following: ``The \n     Senate amendment, as amended, shall be considered as read.''.\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following:\n       ``Sec. 7. The amendments specified in Rules Committee Print \n     114-33 shall be considered as though printed in part B of \n     House Report 114-325.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, that is 35 amendments now. There are 35 \namendments made in order by this rule. We will still go back at 3 \no'clock this afternoon to find even more. That is the collaborative \nprocess that I am representing on the floor here today.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the amendment, I \nurge strong support for the rule, and I urge strong support for the \nunderlying resolution.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 507 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     2867) to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the \n     criteria for determining which States and political \n     subdivisions are subject to section 4 of the Act, and for \n     other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 2867.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion on the amendment and on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on:\n  Adoption of the amendment to House Resolution 507, if ordered;\n  Adoption of House Resolution 507, if ordered; and\n  The motion to suspend the rules on House Resolution 354.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 241, \nnays

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the House amendment to the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 22.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 507 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 22.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1429\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the \nSenate amendments to the bill (H.R. 22) to amend the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to exempt employees with health coverage under TRICARE or \nthe Veterans Administration from being taken into account for purposes \nof determining the employers to which the employer mandate applies \nunder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with Mr. Simpson \nin the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today is an exciting day for me because when I became chairman almost\n\n[[Page H7413]]\n\n3 years ago of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, one of \nmy highest priorities was passing a multiyear bill to improve our \nNation's road, bridges, and transit systems. So I am very pleased that \ntoday the House is considering the Surface Transportation \nReauthorization and Reform Act of 2015, the STRR Act.\n  I want to thank Chairman Sam Graves and our Democratic counterparts, \nRanking Members DeFazio and Norton, for helping to develop this \nbipartisan bill. Thanks in part to their hard work and willingness to \nwork together, our committee unanimously approved the STRR Act 2 weeks \nago.\n  This bill is absolutely critical to America and our economy. \nTransportation, in particular our surface transportation system, has a \ndirect impact on our day-to-day quality of life. It affects how we get \nto work, how we get our kids home from school, and how much time we can \nspend with our families and friends instead of sitting in traffic. \nTransportation allows our country and our businesses to be competitive. \nTransportation is about supply chain, raw materials getting to the \nfactories, products getting to markets, and what we pay for goods; and \nit is fundamentally what the STRR Act is all about.\n  To help put this legislation together, Mr. Chairman, our committee \ntraveled to communities across this country and talked to \ntransportation and business leaders about the need for this bill. What \nwe heard is that our States and communities all have a variety of needs \nand that certainty over multiple years is necessary to address those \nneeds. The STRR Act is a multiyear bill that provides that certainty \nfor States and local governments. This bill helps improve our Nation's \ninfrastructure and maintains a strong commitment to safety, but it also \nprovides important reforms that will help us continue to do the job \nmore effectively.\n  Key provisions in this bill will refocus--and that is important--our \ntransportation programs on national priorities, promote innovation to \nmake our surface transportation system and programs work better, \nprovide greater flexibility for State and local governments to address \ntheir needs, streamline the Federal bureaucracy, accelerate the project \napproval process, and facilitate the flow of freight and commerce. The \nSTRR Act continues the Federal role in providing a strong national \ntransportation system, enables our country to remain economically \ncompetitive, and helps ensure our quality of life.\n  This bill has widespread support. We have received nearly 300 letters \nof support from throughout the stakeholder community, including \nGovernors, mayors, cities, counties, AASHTO, Chamber of Commerce, \nNational Association of Manufacturers, agriculture, construction \nindustry, shippers, and many, many others.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and look forward to working with the Senate to get a final \nmeasure to the President.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Well, this has been a long time coming, and I congratulate the full \ncommittee chairman, the subcommittee chair, my ranking member, Eleanor \nHolmes Norton, and all the members of the committee for moving forward \na good, bipartisan product. None of us got everything we wanted in that \nbill, but there is a lot of good policy in there. The funding still \nleaves a lot to be desired.\n  It will begin to address the infrastructure crisis in America. Mr. \nChairman, 140,000 bridges need substantial repair or replacement, and \n40 percent of the road surface on the National Highway System has \ndeteriorated to the point where you have to dig up the roadbed and \nrebuild the road, not just resurface it, and on our major transit \nsystems, our legacy transit systems, $84 billion to bring them up to a \nstate of good repair--$84 billion. It is so bad that they are actually \nkilling people here in Washington, D.C., because of the decrepit nature \nof the mass transit system.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill will begin to deal with those issues. It will \ngive the States a 6-year planning horizon so they can plan longer term \nprojects. Longer term projects mean more bang for the buck and more \njobs will be created.\n  The bill also increases the percentage for Buy America so we will \ncreate more jobs here in America in the area of transit. In fact, the \nstrongest Buy America requirements for all Federal procurement--much \nstronger than the Pentagon--are in transportation. So these dollars \nrecirculate in our economy. They employ Americans, and they subcontract \nwith American small businesses. Those moneys recirculate in our \ncommunities and can create real growth and wealth.\n  But as I mentioned earlier, we are still not certain whether there \nwill be amendments allowed, and a number of Members have contributed to \nthe Rules Committee proposals to increase funding with one form or \nanother of user fee. User fee has been the tradition since Dwight David \nEisenhower said that this will be a self-funded program funded by gas \ntax. The Federal gas tax hasn't gone up since 1993--18.3 cents a \ngallon. There are many meritorious proposals to change that in \ndifferent ways, to index it, to have a temporary increase with a \ncommission, a barrel tax, and a straight-up increase in the gas tax to \nhave it catch up with inflation. There is a myriad of them out there, \nand I hope that some are allowed and that this body is allowed to work \nits will.\n  Eight all-red States have raised their gas tax in the last year, and \nnot a single State representative or senator has been recalled or lost \ntheir election because of it. The American people get it. If they don't \nwant to blow out their tires and break their rims in potholes, we need \nto invest. If they don't want to be detoured around closed or weight-\nlimited bridges, we need to invest. If they wonder whether they are \ngoing to get there alive or get there at all when they get on a mass \ntransit system, we need to invest at every level.\n  The investment is not what it should be in this bill, but there are \nmany good policies. There are new, national, first-time-ever major \nfreight and highway projects of national and regional importance. We \nneed a focus on moving our freight more efficiently in this country. As \nI mentioned earlier, we are getting an increase in Buy America. We also \nreform the workforce retraining programs which will create career \npathways for minorities, women, veterans, individuals with \ndisabilities, and low-income workers.\n  It boosts funding for railway-highway grade crossings to save lives \nand improve safety, motor carrier safety grants, and National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration grants. It ensures higher standards for \ntransit safety, protects bus driver safety, and encourages States to \nprovide mental health and substance abuse treatment for DUI offenders.\n  It improves safety for the transport of hazardous materials and \nprovides critical protections for crude-by-rail shipments. It will \nprovide more information for State emergency responders, and it will \nrequire comprehensive--it is amazing we don't have that now--oil spill \nresponse plans, and it will increase the safety of oil tank cars by \nrequiring thermal blankets and other improvements.\n\n  All in all, there is much, much to commend in this bill. It also \nlooks to the future, and it would put in $115 million to allow States \nto test new ways of raising the money necessary to rebuild, maintain, \nand improve the efficiency of our national transportation system, \nwhether it would be vehicle miles traveled or other, new innovative \nideas, and that is what we have got to look toward in the future. We \ncannot continue just on a gas and diesel tax forever.\n  So I, again, applaud the chairman, the subcommittee chairman, and my \ncolleagues on the committee. I look forward to a long, robust, and open \ndebate over amendments. Hopefully the bill will come out of that \nprocess improved and not damaged and will get broad support here on the \nfloor of the House.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham), the subcommittee chairman on Railroads, \nPipelines, and Hazardous Materials.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. DeFazio and Mr. Capuano for \nworking with us on title VII of this\n\n[[Page H7414]]\n\nbill, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Improvement Act of \n2015.\n  Hazardous materials are the backbone of our industrial society, and \nthese products are transported by all modes, used in every State, and \ndistributed worldwide. This title will significantly enhance the safety \nof moving these products.\n  First, the title will significantly strengthen the safety of crude-\nby-rail shipments. After pushing DOT for years to update their \nregulations to make these train movements safer, DOT finally issued \nfinal regulations in May. However, the rule fell short in several \nareas, and, therefore, we have included several provisions to fix their \nshortcomings.\n  We require all new tank cars carrying flammable liquids to have a \nthermal blanket, something DOT failed to do, something that is new in \nthis bill. We also require the railroads to create oil spill emergency \nresponse plans similar to what pipeline operators are required to do. \nAdditionally, we ensure that railroads continue to provide States and \nlocal emergency responders with information on crude-by-rail shipments \nwithin their States.\n  Further, we included a provision at markup that fixes a loophole that \nwould allow more than 35,000 legacy DOT-111 tank cars to remain in \nservice in perpetuity. This provision will require those cars be \nupgraded to increase the safety of our railroads. I believe it will \nsignificantly improve the safety of hazardous materials transportation, \nparticularly the crude-by-rail shipments.\n  Improving safety of crude-by-rail has been one of my top priorities \nas chairman of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials \nSubcommittee, and I am pleased to be moving these provisions forward.\n  We also make significant improvements to DOT's hazardous materials \nsafety and grant programs. We streamline and speed up the special \npermits and approvals process to give industry more certainty. We also \nreform an underutilized grant program to help States train more \nemergency responders and better plan for incidents.\n  Separately, this bill includes reforms that I have long championed \nand is based on legislation I authored, the NEPA Reciprocity Act.\n  Local governments in States with environmental laws equal to or more \nstringent than NEPA will have the ability to complete one comprehensive \nenvironmental review. This will eliminate duplicative environmental \nreviews and save millions of dollars and years in project delivery time \nwhile still ensuring appropriate steps are taken to mitigate the \nenvironmental impact. This reform is bipartisan and supported by the \nNational Association of Counties.\n  Finally, an amendment I offered in committee is included in this. It \nencourages the development of pollinator habitat along roadsides and \nrights-of-way. Pollinators are essential to a vibrant and productive \nfarm industry and for the health and welfare of our Nation's food \nsupply.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the good, bipartisan reforms in this \nlegislation. Again, I want to thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member \nDeFazio, and Ranking Member Capuano for the many improvements to this \nbill.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the ranking member.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend and--in this \nenterprise--my partner, along with the informal partnership we made \nwith our Republican chairs. And that is what it has been: an informal \npartnership with Members and also with staff.\n  I want to recognize the countless hours of staff time that went into \nwhat is really, in many ways, a complicated bill. The four of us are \ncosponsors, original cosponsors, of this bill, indicating its \nbipartisan nature.\n  Because Ranking Member DeFazio has gone down many of the important \nparts of the bill, I want to speak to three or four that I think are of \nparticular significance.\n  Let's start with funding. We understand that funding is at the core \nof any transportation, transit, and infrastructure bill. We also \nunderstand that there may be barely enough funding to get through 2\\1/\n2\\ years and that this is a 6-year bill in name and intent only, but it \ndoes amount to a 6-year promise, and we must keep that promise.\n  I appreciate that this bill is on the floor this week because States \nhave so little money that they have virtually ceased beginning major \nprojects, and those are the projects that they most need. The States \nwill be disappointed that the funding is essentially the same as it was \nin the prior bill, MAP-21, except for inflation, which, of course, has \nbeen virtually nonexistent. But they will be grateful for what this \nbill provides for the immediate future, unlike our short-term \nreauthorizations.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  The shortcomings of this bill should not obscure what makes this bill \nunique. It is genuinely bipartisan. It was approved unanimously in \ncommittee. When does that happen in this Congress? Democrats and \nRepublicans put aside their many differences, giving up much of what \nthey believe they need. I hope this bill will be a model for how to \nproceed in the future.\n  Let me say a word about major projects. The administration had a \n``Projects of National Significance'' section in its bill. We have a \ndifferent major projects section, but it is somewhat comparable. It is \nmeant for transformational investments of the kind that are solely \nneeded throughout the United States: megaprojects. Now States will \ncompete for the funding.\n  What is also important in this program of national significance is \nthat it includes freight. For the first time, I think, this bill \nrecognizes that whatever we do with transportation and infrastructure, \nwe should have in mind its intermodal connections, and freight is a \nvery important part of those connections.\n  I want to mention a 21st-century approach to the highway trust fund, \na provision I especially pressed for. I regard this provision as a \nprovision of overriding importance. When I say a 21st-century highway \ntrust fund, I mean a trust fund that lasts or can last for 6 years. We \nare still in the throes of a 1950s highway trust fund. In the last \nauthorization bill, we did nothing to move forward to update the trust \nfund.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend for yielding.\n  The States have done spade work, however, Oregon, Washington, \nCalifornia. So there is $20 million to encourage them to do more. We \nknow what some of these experiments are, vehicle miles, et cetera. \nThink of new ways. We need to encourage this experiment if we are to \nfund the trust fund in the future.\n  Another one of my priorities which is relevant to every State is in \nthis bill, and that is the takeover of the DC-MD-VA Metrorail by the \nDepartment of Transportation. That was envisioned in MAP-21. It is not \nvery unusual.\n  In addition, this bill authorizes the so-called minority business \ncontract DBE Program, which is available to racial and ethnic \nminorities, women and service-disabled veterans. They are the only \ngroups which under the Constitution may obtain this special \nrecognition. The bill enhances Buy America. It has workforce \ndevelopment. It enhances the safety of bus riders and of bus drivers.\n  There is $40 million here to encourage State-based efforts to combat \nracial profiling and we have seen people in the streets for that one. I \nam so pleased that there was bipartisan support for that and other \nprovisions.\n  I look forward to the continuation of the bipartisan partnership we \nhave had as we go forward to the Senate to produce a comprehensive \nbipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan), the vice chairman of the full committee and the \nchair of two critical panels, the P3 panel and the freight movement \npanel, that developed a lot of what is in this bill. I appreciate his \nwork on that.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for \nyielding me this time. I want to congratulate and thank Chairman \nShuster for his great leadership of our committee and especially his \nhard work on this legislation. I also want to thank my friend, Ranking \nMember DeFazio, for his great work on this bill.\n\n[[Page H7415]]\n\n  I rise, Mr. Chairman, in strong support of this very important \nlegislation, this major legislation, that will reauthorize our highway \nand transit programs.\n  We have spent megabillions rebuilding the Middle East over the last \n15 years, and I am so pleased that we are now doing major legislation \nto help rebuild America.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for including a \nnumber of provisions in this bill that I have requested and I think are \nvery important.\n  First, I want to thank them for the environmental streamlining \nprovisions that we have worked on for so long on our committee to try \nto speed up major projects and bring down their costs so that we can do \nmore good things for this country.\n  Secondly, I am very pleased that many of the recommendations from the \nspecial panels on freight transportation and on public-private \npartnerships, the panels that the chairman just mentioned that he gave \nme the privilege of chairing, were included in this bill.\n  Third, I am pleased that this bill extends the current provisions of \nlaw that prevent the use of Federal funds for red light cameras. Many \nlocal governments have used these cameras simply as revenue measures \nwithout actually making any improvements in safety.\n  Fourth, this bill directs the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration to conduct a study on the waiting times for skills \ntesting for truck drivers after going through truck driving courses.\n  In some States, these wait times have become very long, and most \ngraduates cannot afford to wait a long time to take these tests. We \nalready have a shortage of truck drivers.\n  This part of the legislation will help improve or do something about \nthat shortage that the trucking companies have so much difficulty with \nat this time finding adequate personnel.\n  Finally, this bill includes provisions of legislation that I have \nintroduced that clarifies hiring standards for freight brokers. I will \nhave a technical amendment to this section later to make sure that \nsmall trucking companies are not hurt and that they also will be helped \nby this provision.\n  I simply want to close by saying that I support this legislation \nwhich will improve the safety of our highways, create thousands of jobs \nin this country, and help reduce congestion all across this Nation.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Nadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Surface Transportation \nReauthorization bill.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for \ndeveloping a bipartisan bill that is generally balanced and makes \nsignificant improvements in some key areas.\n  I am concerned that the funding levels in the bill are simply not \nhigh enough. We have an almost $1 trillion backlog on our highways, \nbridges, rail, and transit system, yet this bill provides flat funding \nof just $325 billion over 6 years. Finding bipartisan consensus on \nrevenue is challenging, but I am confident that a majority in Congress \nwould support funding higher-than-baseline levels with small increases \nfor inflation.\n  Despite the funding challenges, the bill makes a major improvement by \ncreating the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects \nprogram, which will provide guaranteed dedicated funding for large-\nscale multimodal projects critical to our regional and national \neconomy.\n  This was a key recommendation of the freight panel on which I was \nranking member with Mr. Duncan as chairman. It is essential that we \nassist projects that are too big or complex for States to address on \ntheir own.\n  We made some progress in SAFETEA-LU and MAP-21, but this bill finally \ngets it right and corrects decades of neglect by providing guaranteed \nfunding for multimodal freight projects.\n  There is an aggregate cap of $500 million on non-highway projects, \nwhich equals about 11 percent of the program. This seems arbitrarily \nlow, given that 25 to 30 percent of the bill is funded through general \nrevenue.\n  We should let all projects compete and not dilute the selection \nprocess with caps and set-asides. But the freight program created in \nthis bill is a groundbreaking achievement. I thank Chairman Shuster and \nRanking Member DeFazio for their commitment.\n  On transit, there are good provisions in the bill on transit worker \nsafety and workforce development. I oppose dropping the New Starts \nFederal share from 80 percent to 50 percent. There is a similar \nprovision dropping the Federal share to 50 percent in the freight grant \nprogram.\n  This is a developing trend that is shifting the burden to States and \nlocalities and punishing them for our failure to adequately invest in \ninfrastructure. There are provisions restricting the use for various \ntransportation programs for transit projects, which we hope to correct \nthrough the amendment process later today.\n  There are some objectionable provisions regarding environmental \nstreamlining and motor carrier safety, but I am pleased that the bill \ndoes not broadly increase truck size or weights. I will oppose any \namendments to add such dangerous poison pills.\n  Overall, this bill is balanced, and I support moving it forward. I \nthank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for working with us \nto defend and improve the bill as it moves through the process.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Graves), the subcommittee chairman on Highways and \nTransit.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the chairman \nand ranking member for their ability and, for that matter, all my \ncolleagues on the committee for our ability to be able to work together \nand come up with what I think is a truly good bill.\n  I rise in support of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and \nReform Act.\n  The bill reauthorizes programs within the Federal Highway \nAdministration and provides much-needed investments in our Nation's \nhighways and bridges.\n  It also focuses existing funding to create a Nationally Significant \nFreight and Highway Projects program for large-scale projects while \nmaking a large number of reforms that will ensure our transportation \ndollars are put to good use.\n  These include streamlining the environmental review and permitting \nprocess, converting the Surface Transportation Program to a block grant \nprogram, maximizing the flexibility for States and local governments, \nincreasing the amount of funding that is distributed to local \ngovernments, expanding funding for rural bridges or those bridges that \nare off the National Highway System, increasing transparency regarding \nhow Federal highway dollars are being spent, increasing the focus on \nsafety programs particularly of rural roads, and encouraging the \ninstallation of vehicle-to-infrastructure equipment designed to reduce \ncongestion and improve safety on our roads.\n  This legislation also reauthorizes Federal public transportation \nprograms and implements reforms that are going to ensure transit \nsystems are safer and more efficient.\n  The safety of our transportation system must always be at the top of \nour priority list. By giving States the flexibility to focus on the \nsafety needs unique to each community, we can allow them to take \nadvantage of new technologies that are going to reduce accidents and \nroadway fatalities across this country. We can maintain a focus on \nsafety without imposing undue and duplicative regulatory burdens on \nStates.\n  This bill requires the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to \nreview regulations every 5 years to ensure they are current, \nconsistent, and uniformly enforced, allowing us to focus on policies \nthat save lives and abandon those that do not. It also requires FMCSA \nto look into the effects of raising minimum insurance standards for \ntruck and bus drivers.\n  I am proud to have been a part of the development of this bipartisan \nbill. I look forward to moving forward and going to conference with the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Brown).\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank the\n\n[[Page H7416]]\n\ncommittee leadership for developing a fair bill that addresses many of \nthe most pressing needs of our country. Particularly, I want to thank \nMr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio.\n  This important legislation includes a critical freight grant program, \nbut we need to ensure that all modes of transportation are treated \nequally in the program and should remove any caps on funding for these \nentities.\n  It also continues the Transportation Alternatives Program, TAP, and \ncreates a new non-motorized safety grant program, which is critical to \nmy home State of Florida, where several cities have the highest \npedestrian fatality rates in the Nation.\n  Transportation is the backbone of our country. Unfortunately, without \ncritically needed additional funding, we are robbing Peter to pay Paul \nand forcing our State and local transportation agencies to pay more.\n  Like most Members and stakeholders, I miss the past when our \ncommittee developed long-term bills with dedicated funding that gave \nStates, local governments, and other transportation stakeholders some \nstability to plan for future transportation needs and make the \ninvestment in equipment and manpower needed to implement these \nprojects.\n  Transportation and infrastructure funding is absolutely critical to \nour Nation and, if properly funded, serves as a tremendous economic \nboost and job creator. In fact, Department of Transportation statistics \nshow that for every billion dollars invested in transportation, it \ngenerates 44,000 permanent jobs and $6.2 billion in economic activity.\n  We are no longer competing, as States; we are competing with China, \nJapan, and the European Union, all of whom are spending much more on \ntransportation and infrastructure than the United States. We are the \ncaboose, and they don't even use cabooses anymore.\n  Sadly, the Republican leadership lacks real vision. Without vision, \nthe people perish. The traveling public is pleading with Congress to \nmake transportation and infrastructure a priority. When this happens, \nwe can put millions of hardworking Americans back to work fixing our \nNation's crumbling infrastructure and preparing our country for the \nfuture.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Hanna), who, I believe, still has his CDL or \nOperating Engineering License.\n  Mr. HANNA. I thank the chairman.\n  And I still have my union card.\n  Mr. Chairman, this long-term bill represents years of work from the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee, and it is a credit to the \nleadership of both Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to highlight two provisions:\n  First, this bill restores the ability of States to use up to 10 \npercent of their funds to capitalize State Infrastructure Banks. These \nbanks free up capital to invest in projects in smaller communities \nwhere funding and resources are otherwise unavailable;\n  Second, it authorizes a pilot program to allow younger CDL holders to \ndrive across State lines.\n  Every State but Hawaii allows 18-year-olds to obtain a CDL and drive \na truck, but Federal law prevents them from crossing State borders. In \nNew York, an 18-year-old can drive nearly 500 miles from Buffalo to \nLong Island, yet cannot drive the 15 miles across the border from \nBinghamton to Pennsylvania.\n  This provision will create opportunities for good-paying jobs, and it \nsupports local economies while keeping our roads safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Nevada (Mr. Hardy).\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I stand to address the importance of long-\nterm funding within the transportation sector of our economy.\n  As a former general contractor who built roads, bridges, and dams, I \nunderstand how uncertainty can derail the ability to plan and design.\n  Transportation planning decisions are not made that cover the \ntimeframe of a month, and transportation planning decisions are not \nmade for the timeframe that cover a year. Transportation and \ninfrastructure planning decisions are made to stretch out over years. I \nam talking about master planning. These are decisions that reach out to \n5, 10, and even 15 years.\n  This bill addresses the long-term needs of our country. It speaks to \nthe multiyear planners--the States that are planning years in advance \nfor major infrastructure projects. We can't operate on short-term \nfixes. We can't continue to kick these important decisions down the \nroad. We can't operate on short-term patches. Jobs are not created \nthrough interim and stopgap bills. Our country needs this certainty. \nOur citizens deserve this certainty.\n  This bill does just that: it plans for the future, and it provides \nfor certainty. It contains many great provisions: from the crucial \nextension of Interstate 11 from the city of Las Vegas north to I-80 in \nnorthern Nevada, to returning flexibility to all States.\n  This bill demonstrates the bipartisan nature of this body in \nCongress. This committee worked across the aisle to form solid language \non issues that are, in nature, bipartisan. I hope we can continue this \nmomentum well beyond the debate and bring certainty to this House, to \nour States, and to our country.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate my colleague's courtesy in permitting me \nto speak on this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate what the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee is doing. I feel a bit empty in no longer \nbeing on the committee. That is why I try and show up as often as I can \nwhen you have things on the floor. There is a soft spot in my heart for \nthe committee, and it is nice to see a Shuster again chairing the \ncommittee.\n  I appreciate your moving forward to try and call the question. Yours \nhas been a difficult task because the committee on which I sit, the \nWays and Means Committee, has yet to address, in a comprehensive way, \nthe long-term funding. Your job is made much more difficult because you \nare forced to deal with paying for 2015 infrastructure through 2021 \nwith 1993 dollars, and it doesn't much work.\n  In a few minutes, I will be offering to the Rules Committee \nlegislation that I have introduced that is supported by the AFL-CIO, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, truckers, AAA, bicyclists, engineers, \nlocal government--the widest array of alliances supporting a major \npiece of legislation here on Capitol Hill. I am not extremely confident \nthat it will be made in order, but I think it is something that should.\n  Unless and until we deal with adjusting the user fee, we are going to \ncontinue dealing with cats and dogs, short-term fixes, having \nuncertainty, and destroying the principle of user pays, which has been \nundergirding transportation finance in this country since Oregon gave \nyou the first gas tax dedicated to transportation in 1919.\n  I must say that I appreciate the committee looking at transportation \nfor the future. At a time when the number one area of employment for \nAmerican men is as drivers, we are about to see dramatic changes in \ntechnology, in utilization that is going to change the landscape.\n  I appreciate the committee exploring areas of technological \ninnovation. These are areas in which we must accelerate our work lest \nwe be overcome by circumstances. It is a tremendous opportunity for us \nto get more value out of the transportation system with more safety, to \nget more efficient, and to be able to open up a whole array of economic \nopportunities. If we don't get ahead of it, it is going to be very \ndisruptive.\n  I must say I am a little dismayed that the bill proposes flat funding \nfor something near and dear, I think, to the hearts of a number of us \nin dealing with pedestrian and cycling activities. We can do better \nthan that, and I hope, through the amendment process and the give-and-\ntake between the House and the Senate, particularly if we are able to \ngive you the funding you need, we can remedy that.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n\n[[Page H7417]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. In the meantime, I appreciate what has been done, the \nmanner in which it has been approached, and the effort to try and bring \npeople together.\n  Historically, infrastructure was something that was bipartisan in \nnature, that made people feel good about the process; and it is, of \ncourse, the fastest way to put millions of Americans to work at family-\nwage jobs while they improve communities from coast to coast. I look \nforward to working with the committee as it works its way through the \nprocess to make it the best that we can for the multiple objectives \nthat we all share.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nupstate New York (Mr. Katko), a new member of the committee and one of \nour hardest working members.\n  Mr. KATKO. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to support the Surface Transportation Reform \nand Reauthorization Act.\n  This legislation is a product of hard work, done in a bipartisan \nmanner, and it will give State and local governments some funding \ncertainty for the first time in a long time.\n  The bill makes important reforms that will speed up planning and \npermitting, that will give State and local governments increased \ncontrol over transportation funds, that will help deal with freight \nbottlenecks, and that will provide new avenues to finance projects. \nAfter 35 short-term extensions to transportation programs since 2009, \nthis long-term bill is exactly what we need.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for the \nhard work they have put in to building a bipartisan consensus around \nthis bill on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I \nhope the full House will join with us today to move this very important \nlegislation forward.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nsouthern California (Mrs. Mimi Walters), another new and hardworking \nMember.\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in \nsupport of H.R. 22.\n  As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \nI have had the pleasure of working with Chairman Shuster to put forth a \nfiscally responsible, long-term bill that will fund our Nation's \ntransportation and infrastructure needs.\n  This bill includes provisions which would make our highway system \nmore efficient, direct more power and flexibility to States and local \ngovernments, cut through bureaucratic red tape, and maintain a strong \ncommitment to safety.\n  The importance of our surface transportation system cannot be \noverstated. It is an integral part of our economic engine, and it is \nvital to our Nation's movement of goods. In fact, a significant number \nof consumer goods move through my congressional district, which \nprovides transportation connectivity between the Ports of Los Angeles \nand Long Beach and other cities throughout the region. This bill will \nensure the safe and efficient movement of freight throughout southern \nCalifornia and the rest of the country.\n  I am pleased to stand before you today in support of this bill, which \nwill ultimately improve the overall quality of life for all Americans.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nnorthern Virginia (Mrs. Comstock).\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the chairman.\n  I would like to reiterate my thanks to the chairman and to everyone \non the committee for working with so many Members on this bipartisan \nsurface transportation reauthorization, which is very important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, included in this bill is a provision that is vital not \nonly to the entire national capital region but also to my district. It \ncontains the text of the Protect Riders of Metrorail Public \nTransportation Act, which is the product of collaborative efforts \nbetween Ms. Norton, Ms. Edwards of Maryland, and me.\n  The language facilitates a necessary change to the safety oversight \nstructure of the Washington Metrorail system in the wake of recent \naccidents and incidents, safety problems, and problems in the \nreliability of the system. It does so by reinforcing and expanding the \nauthority of the Secretary to use the Federal Transit Administration to \ndirectly oversee Metro and to provide safety and reliability to our \ncommuters.\n  Our Metro is the second busiest transit system in the country, and it \nmust be the gold standard in safety as well as in reliability because \nit serves our entire Federal workforce as well as our many visitors to \nthis important national capital region.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Again, I thank the chairman, and I thank everyone \ninvolved in this important legislation, of which I am happy to rise in \nsupport.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  Mr. ROKITA. I thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and the \nchairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees for their excellent \nwork on this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the certainty, flexibility, and power this \nlegislation gives back to our States, and I look forward to supporting \nit.\n  I would like to focus on a voluntary, multiple-use program that is in \nthis bill. It is an innovative way to give States more flexibility that \nis commensurate with the design of this bill.\n  Critical commerce corridors, otherwise known as CCCs, use our \nexisting interstate system to provide for the physical separation of \npassenger vehicles from commercial motor vehicles, dedicated on-and-off \nramps, and freight exchange centers for the movement of freight between \nand among modes of transportation. These lanes are constructed with a \nphysical separation of passenger and commercial motor freight, and they \nwould be structurally enhanced to handle dedicated freight traffic. \nThis promotes a greater level of safety while making the movement of \nfreight traffic more efficient.\n  Unfortunately, this very definition of ``CCC'' isn't in the bill's \nlanguage, although committee staff have been working on it in a very \nbipartisan manner, and I thank them for it.\n  Mr. Chairman, you have heard on multiple occasions what CCCs are. Is \nthis program something that you and other leaders who have worked on \nthis bill can support?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I look forward to working with the gentleman on this \nlanguage and moving it to conference.\n  It sounds to me like you have put a lot of work into it, and I look \nforward to continuing that work in Congress.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.\n  It is important for Congress to give the term ``critical commerce \ncorridor'' meaning. We have seen the dangers of leaving terms undefined \nand of relying on the agency to create a definition that could be \nnowhere near what Congress intended.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for all of their \nhard work.\n  Indiana is known as the Crossroads of America, and the CCC concept \nactually comes from Indiana and, in part, Purdue Universities. I thank \nthe chairman for his commitment that the critical commerce corridor \nconcept is defined appropriately in the legislation as we go through \nthe process.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Hultgren).\n  Mr. HULTGREN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to acknowledge the difficult and \nchallenging job Chairman Shuster and the committee have had in crafting \nthis bill. I commend his leadership and hard work on this critically \nimportant bill.\n  This bill dedicates grant funding to freight and highway projects of \nnational significance. Though this program is of vital importance to \nprojects in our districts, there appears to be a bias on how the vast \nmajority of funds\n\n[[Page H7418]]\n\nhave been awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation, and \nsuburban projects appear to often be ignored.\n  For instance, H.R. 3763 converts the Surface Transportation Program, \nor STP, to a grant program with the intention of allowing States added \nflexibility in receiving funding for local projects. I ask the chairman \nto be mindful of the distribution of such funding levels as it pertains \nto suburban projects.\n  Understanding the difficult choices the chairman has had to make to \nget this bill through the House, I would ask that, as this bill moves \nto conference, we work together to find some level of equitable \ndistribution of Federal funds to suburban areas.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I will continue to work with the gentleman on this issue \nas it moves to conference.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Reclaiming my time, I thank the chairman for his \nresponse and for his leadership on the committee, and I look forward to \nworking with him on this important issue.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I don't believe we have any more speakers \nleft.\n  How many minutes do we each have?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 9 minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from Oregon has 10\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I am ready to close. So I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, as I said earlier, this bill at this point is \nan excellent product policy-wise. We will vigorously debate \nimprovements and potentially problematic amendments over the next 2 \ndays and, hopefully, have a similar or an improved product in the end. \nWhether or not we will be allowed to attempt to augment the funding \nremains to be seen.\n  With that, we are off to a good start. I look forward to the coming \ndebate.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I am sure I can count on the gentleman \nfrom Oregon to continue his vigorous debate on the issues we have had \nfor months.\n  Again, the STRR Act is absolutely critical to America and to our \neconomy. It is a good bipartisan bill that has widespread support.\n  Mr. Chairman, I encourage all Members to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the Senate amendment shall be considered for \namendment under the 5-minute rule.\n  The amendment printed in part A of House Report 114-325 is adopted. \nThe Senate amendment, as amended, shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the Senate amendment, as amended, is as follows:\n\nStrike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Swalwell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise to offer a bipartisan amendment with the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) that would make it easier for public \nentities to better utilize the benefits of new and innovative \ntechnologies to deliver more and better transportation outcomes.\n  I thank my friend, Congressman Schweikert, for cosponsoring this \nimportant amendment. I also thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nRokita) for his work in the subcommittee on a similar issue.\n  In recent years, the Internet, new technologies, and shared-use \nprograms have revolutionized the way we travel. Our Federal \ntransportation policies, however, must take advantage of these new \ntechnologies and shared programs to help reduce traffic congestion, \nhelp improve air quality, and better connect users with mass \ntransportation options.\n  My amendment is simple. It would make eligible projects and programs \nthat utilize innovative mobility technologies to provide alternatives \nto driving alone under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nImprovement Program, also known as CMAQ, and the associated transit \nimprovement program to better connect users to mass transit systems.\n  Allowing States and cities to have the flexibility to choose how to \nbetter improve transportation outcomes under CMAQ and associated \ntransit improvement programs can help spur innovation to create better \nresults for\n\n[[Page H7580]]\n\ntransit users, ultimately allowing people to spend less time in their \ncar and more time at home with their families.\n  I know from driving in my district, California's 15th Congressional \nDistrict, the East Bay, where traffic congestion is among the worst in \nour country, we need to give our States and local governments every \nopportunity to utilize new technologies and shared programs to reduce \ntraffic.\n  Under both CMAQ and associated transit improvement programs, State \nand local entities are already able to partner with private companies. \nWhy not include these new technologies and shared programs to achieve \nthese goals?\n  Let me be clear, Mr. Chair. This amendment does not mandate that any \nfunding go to any entity, and this amendment does not increase Federal \nspending by a dime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, while this amendment is well intended, the \namendment would dilute the eligibilities currently available to States \nto combat congestion and air.\n  We have not had adequate time to determine if there are any \nunintended consequences of providing eligibility for broadly expanding \nthe eligibilities to include things like car share, bike share, and \ntransportation network companies.\n  Additionally, this amendment includes these new eligibilities in the \nassociated transit improvement mandate. The mandate hurts local \nflexibility and could have serious unintended consequences.\n  Our bill worked to reform this mandate. So I reluctantly urge all \nMembers to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  My amendment also would allow States and local governments to partner \nwith innovative technologies that best serve transit systems. For \nexample, by explicitly including car-sharing and bike-sharing \ncompanies, like Lyft, a California-based company, we can both reduce \ncongestion and improve air quality while ensuring people have access to \nmass transportation.\n  According to a research done by UC Berkeley, there are 32 car-sharing \noperators in the United States with over 1.1 million members and 16,754 \nvehicles. These car-sharing and bike-sharing examples are just a few of \nthe many opportunities that would be explicitly available to States and \nlocal governments.\n  Thirty cities have bike-sharing systems with over 17,000 bikes \navailable. In 2013, a survey of Capital Bikeshare here in the Capital \nCity found that users drove 4.4 million fewer miles to access this \nprogram.\n  Also, it is important to note that these technologies and shared \nprograms are already being implemented by cities across the country. \nCompanies like Lyft and Uber are working in coordination with city \ngovernments to better connect workers to transit options. Lyft, for \none, is now integrated in the Dallas Area Rapid Transit app, offering \nriders another option to start or end their transit trips.\n  This amendment makes an important step toward using technology and \nshared programs to create a fully integrated transit system and improve \nits effectiveness.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nSchweikert).\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from California and my \nfellow Members who I just pushed out of the way.\n  Look, I know that we are discussing a transportation bill. But if you \nlook at an amendment like this, the understanding of what is coming at \nus technology-wise, information, its ability to change how we look at \nmoving ourselves, moving people, moving goods, moving freight, the \namendment just basically directs the embracing of the information age \nand the opportunity that provides to actually deal with crowded roads, \ndeal with congestion, and actually provide us some optionality out \nthere.\n  That is one of the reasons I stand behind this microphone and \nactually sort of stand behind my friend's amendment.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Swalwell).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Walden\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I offer my amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 67, strike lines 1 and 2 and insert the following:\n       ``(ii) a highway or bridge project carried out on the \n     National Highway System, including--\n\n       ``(I) a project to add capacity to the Interstate System to \n     improve mobility; and\n       ``(II) a project in a national scenic area;\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Walden) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this bipartisan \namendment, which clarifies the eligibility of projects within national \nscenic areas under the nationally significant freight and highway \nproject section of this legislation.\n  I thank Representatives Jaime Herrera Beutler, Earl Blumenauer, and \nGarret Graves for cosponsoring this important amendment with me. I \nthank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, Chairman Graves, and \nRanking Member Holmes Norton for their support as well.\n  Across the Nation, there are 12 national scenic areas in 8 States, \nincluding the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, which is the \nlargest scenic area in the United States.\n  This Federal overlay consists of 292,500 acres along 85 miles of the \nColumbia River in Oregon and Washington, encompassing 6 counties in 13 \ndifferent communities and subjecting the area to unique land use \ndevelopment restrictions. Ninety percent of the scenic area is subject \nto strict land use and development restrictions, including 114,600 \nacres of special management area and 71,000 acres of national \nforestlands.\n  While scenic areas like the Columbia Gorge provide tourist \nopportunities to thousands of visiting Americans from all across the \ncountry, this unique Federal involvement provides distinct challenges \nin promoting growth of the local economy while conserving natural \nbeauty of the lands within the gorge.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Transportation infrastructure is an essential component to \nefficiently serve the interests of both local residents and visitors to \nthe scenic area.\n  There is a strong need for regional transportation planning and \nimprovement to major transportation elements. That would include things \nsuch as the Hood River interstate bridge and the Bridge of the Gods at \nCascade Locks. Together these amount to 5.2 million bridge crossings \neach year and the transfer of $110 million in goods, but they are \ndeteriorating and deficient, and they are in need of major \nimprovements. In fact, one of the bridges, the Hood River interstate \nbridge, was recently hit by a barge, which has caused some \nconsternation about the damage that may have occurred there.\n  Clarifying the eligibility of the scenic areas throughout the Nation \nfor transportation grant funding would help ensure that these areas are \neligible for meaningful funding opportunities to enhance infrastructure \nwithin these unique federally managed areas.\n\n[[Page H7581]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment to ensure that \nfederally designated scenic areas like the Columbia River Gorge are \neligible for these funds.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the coauthor of \nthis amendment, for his comments.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman \nShuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, Congressman Walden, Congresswoman \nHerrera Beutler, Congressman Blumenauer, and others who worked to get \nto a point where we all could come to common agreement on this.\n  The chairman included in this bill an important program called the \nNationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects program. This \nprogram establishes a competitive grant opportunity for States, for \nmetropolitan planning organizations, and for local governments to the \ntune of over $740 million annually.\n  Mr. Chairman, this recognizes the fact that we have massive needs in \ntransportation infrastructure that remain unaddressed. In my home city \nof Baton Rouge, you can see right here on this poster board, Mr. \nChairman, that, for a midsized city, we have the worst traffic in the \nNation. This is a snapshot of Google Maps taken just a few hours ago \nshowing all the extraordinary traffic.\n  Right here is one place in the Nation where the interstate going from \nCalifornia to Florida drops down to one lane. It shouldn't be a \nsurprise to anyone that it is all red and shows extraordinarily backed-\nup traffic. An average of 47 hours a year folks from this region sit in \ntraffic.\n  What this amendment does is it actually provides criteria for the \nUnited States Department of Transportation to consider when awarding \ngrants under this competitive program. One of the criteria is ensuring \nmobility for addressing bottlenecks like this in substandard interstate \nsystems to ensure the flow of traffic, to give back those 47 hours to \nthe folks from the capital region of Louisiana so they can spend time \nwith their families, so they can spend more time at work, so they can \nbe more productive citizens, and so we can have lower emissions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member \nDeFazio for working with us on this amendment. I urge adoption of this \namendment.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, although I am not opposed to the \namendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition so I \nmay comment.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nOregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment and both \nits objectives, the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway \nProjects, under section 1111 of the rules, and the National Scenic \nAreas. I am quite familiar with the area mentioned by Representative \nWalden and the very scenic $1 tolled one-way Bridge of the Gods. It is \na critical link. If it is not repaired or replaced, it is quite a long \ndrive in either direction. This eligibility is potentially critical to \ngetting Federal partnership in that project. There are other areas \naround the country which suffer from similar problems. I recommend this \namendment to my colleagues.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from southern \nOregon. I appreciate his support and that of my other colleagues in the \nNorthwest and the chairman of the committee. I would urge adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Walden).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-325.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 144, line 6, before the semicolon insert the \n     following: ``(to include, at a minimum, the total number of \n     environmental reviews initiated through a notice of intent, \n     the total average cost for environmental reviews to taxpayers \n     and contractors, and the total average time it takes agencies \n     to get from a notice of intent to publication of a final \n     environmental review)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense \namendment to this transportation bill. This simple amendment requires \nthe Federal Government to start keeping track of costs and time \nrequired for an environmental review undertaken for transportation \nprojects in the new online database established by this bill.\n  Last year GAO released a comprehensive audit of NEPA and found that \nthere is currently no system in place for the Federal Government to \ntrack such information. It defies common sense that the Federal \nGovernment has no idea how long environmental reviews take or how much \nthese reviews actually cost taxpayers and job creators.\n  While scant information on this matter is available, GAO was able to \nidentify that, within the Department of Energy, the average cost paid \nfor a NEPA review was $6.6 million and that, shockingly, some \nenvironmental reviews cost nearly $90 million.\n  In addition to the GAO report, a new report issued by the National \nAssociation of Environmental Professionals released just last week \nfound that:\n\n       It took agencies an average of 1,709 days to get from a \n     notice of intent, the first step in preparing an EIS, to \n     publication of a final EIS. That is 4 days longer than the \n     previous record set in 2013 and up from fewer than 1,200 days \n     in 2000.\n\n  The report found that it takes the National Highway Administration \n6\\1/2\\ years to complete an environmental study, 6\\1/2\\ years before we \ncan start work on construction projects. But the Federal Government \ncan't even verify or dispute that number because they don't even track \nthat information. These unnecessary delays would make Buzz Lightyear \nfrom ``Toy Story'' blush. His time mantra, ``to infinity and beyond,'' \nis inappropriate for NEPA. NEPA studies should not be allowed to linger \nin perpetuity.\n  Contractors and folks in the construction industry are sitting on the \nsidelines losing time and money. Some have reported waiting as long as \n10 years on environmental studies before beginning work. The current \nsystem fails to provide certainty, and the current bureaucracy \nassociated with this process is killing jobs.\n  While the Federal Government doesn't seem to care to track this \ninformation, these reports confirm what exasperated contractors and \nfrustrated taxpayers have known for years: the average time it takes to \nconduct an environmental review is growing. Each year more than a month \nis added to the average time it takes to complete these studies.\n  My amendment will increase transparency for this process by requiring \nthe Federal Government to start keeping track of the time, cost, and \nnumber of environmental studies conducted for transportation projects.\n  This amendment is a responsible, commonsense step that a government \naccountable to the people should take to show proper stewardship of the \npublic's dollar, time, and resources. If you support government \naccountability and transparency, you should support this amendment.\n  I thank the chair and the ranking member for their tireless efforts \nto find a long-term transportation solution. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, we are still in the process of \nimplementing environmental streamlining from MAP-21, and yet this bill \ncontains additional environmental streamlining that I\n\n[[Page H7582]]\n\nthink will yield great results. We already have an accountability \nsection at DOT with the Dashboard, and I would argue, given the fact \nthat another section of this bill does further environmental \nstreamlining on top of that which is still pending to be implemented, \nthat it is unnecessary and, in fact, would be perhaps contradictory to \nthe intent of the gentleman because of the time involved. It would \nessentially be like a billing in the private sector where every 15 \nminutes you are writing down that you had to call this agency to talk \nabout this or you had to review this letter or this document, and that \nis attributable to the environmental review versus some other part of \nthe review. I think it would be problematic.\n  I would urge Members to oppose this amendment and to support the bill \nbecause of the environmental streamlining that is in there. Let that \nenvironmental streamlining take effect; and a year or two down the \nroad, if we feel that there are unaccountable delays, then we can look \nat ways to track that better.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to vote for this \namendment in the fact that transparency doesn't hurt anybody. We need \nto look back at the process, and that should be for everybody--for the \ntaxpayer, for the construction companies, for the States in which this \nis occurring. Transparency will show it all and leave nothing behind. \nIt is great to implement this at the start of the process, not later on \nin the implementation. That is where common sense beleaguers me.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask everybody to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment as it is unnecessary and, actually, time consuming, given the \nenvironmental streamlining in the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO.

Bill Shuster,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Peter DeFazio,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio: The Texas \n     Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is supportive of \n     Congressional action to enhance the highway system in Texas \n     and designate additional portions of that system as high \n     priority corridors and future interstates.\n       TxDOT has facilitated communication with affected \n     communities and interested parties along the Central Texas \n     Corridor and U.S. 190, which is proposed to be a future \n     section of the interstate 14 corridor. The route is important \n     for east-west connectivity within the state and provides an \n     important link to military facilities, to metropolitan areas, \n     and Texas' existing and future interstate system.\n       If I can be of additional assistance, please contact me or \n     your staff may contact Melissa Meyer in the TxDOT Federal \n     Affairs Section.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     LtGen J.F. Weber, USMC (Ret),\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, I am honored to offer on behalf of my State \nof Texas, our military, and all Americans this amendment to designate \nthe central Texas corridor as the first segment of what I truly believe \nwill be America's next great highway, Interstate 14.\n  As Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, General Dwight D. Eisenhower \nunderstood the critical importance of a reliable system of high-speed, \nhigh-capacity roadways to move across great distances the hardware and \npersonnel that a modern military requires.\n  As Commander in Chief, President Eisenhower applied these same \nprinciples to his domestic agenda with his championing of the \nInterstate Highway System. This allows our military to maintain maximum \neffectiveness and readiness, both in times of peace and in times of \ncrisis. But even President Eisenhower could not have foreseen the \nincredible impact that the interstate system has had for almost every \nAmerican family and business on a daily basis.\n  Congress should not be in the business of designating a new \ninterstate just because it can. A new interstate should truly serve the \nnational interests on a number of levels. I am pleased to say, though, \nthat the proposal of I-14 does not just meet these requirements; it far \nexceeds them. There is a reason this interstate already has a nickname, \n``Forts to Ports,'' as it provides either direct or very close access \nfor some of our country's most strategically important military and \nshipping assets.\n  I want to be very clear to my colleagues that this amendment that I \nam offering today only impacts my State of Texas and is just the first \nstep in a long process for establishing a new interstate highway. Even \none that builds upon many roadways that are already interstate grade is \nno small task. It requires buy-in from all the States involved, and the \nInterstate 14 coalition is working to get the consensus and the support \nthat we have in Texas from all of these State DOTs and other \nstakeholders.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nWilliams), my friend and colleague, a strong supporter of this \namendment and former member of the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure whose work in years past on this issue has helped lead \nus to where we are today.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Mr. Babin's \namendment to designate 30 miles of existing freeway from Copperas Cove, \nTexas, to I-35 in Belton as U.S. Interstate 14.\n  As the Texas Department of Transportation has previously \nacknowledged, the route is important for east-west connectivity and \nprovides an important link to military facilities, metropolitan areas, \nand Texas' existing and future interstate systems.\n  This highway will connect two of the Nation's largest military bases: \nFort Bliss and Fort Hood. U.S. 190, the freeway from the front gate of \nFort Hood to I-35 is already at interstate standards.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are seeking Federal statutory designation as a high-\npriority corridor and future interstate highway in order to save travel \ntime, make this route the heart of a connector for freight, and link \nArmy installations and strategic ports.\n  In God we trust.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Massie\n\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Massie) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chair, I am honored to offer this amendment today \nwith my Democrat colleagues from California, Ms. Lofgren and Ms. Eshoo.\n  This amendment would allow the General Services Administration, or \nthe GSA, to construct, install, and operate electric vehicle charging \nstations for private vehicle use at Federal facilities at no cost to \nthe taxpayer.\n  In 2012, Congress passed legislation with broad bipartisan support to \nallow Members of Congress and their staff to access EV charging \nstations on Capitol grounds for a fee. Federal agencies currently lack \nthe authority to install and operate electric vehicle charging \nstations. So Federal employees are unable to charge their electric \nvehicles while at work.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that we are considering this \namendment today. In fact, the genesis of this idea came to me in a \nconstituent letter in February 2014. I was contacted by a constituent \nwho works at a local Federal facility who was surprised and dismayed \nthat he was unable to charge his electric car at work.\n  We found that, due to a quirk in the reading of current law, Federal \nagencies were prevented from providing EV charging facilities for \npersonal use by their employees.\n  Thanks to this constituent's suggestions, I introduced a bill last \nCongress, the EV-COMUTE Act, to allow Federal agencies to provide \ncharging stations for their employees at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues, Mr. Massie and Ms. Eshoo, for joining \nme in this effort, both as cosponsors of the EV-COMUTE and of this \namendment.\n  This story is a great example of democracy at work and the power of \ncitizen participation in generating ideas. After two Congresses of \nintroducing the EV-COMUTE, I am happy to support this amendment here \ntoday.\n  It is a straightforward amendment that will make Federal workplaces \nmore efficient, flexible, and innovative by allowing the GSA to install \nand operate electric car charging stations at Federal facilities for \nuse by employees at no cost to the taxpayer, fully covered by user \nfees.\n  Currently, if Members of Congress and their staff choose to drive an \nelectric vehicle to work at the U.S. Capitol, we have the option to pay \na fee to plug in our vehicle so that it will be fully charged and ready \nto go when we leave. But our constituents that work at Federal agencies \noutside the Capitol don't have the option.\n  My district in Silicon Valley continues to lead in advancing \ninnovation in the EV charging industry. Yet, nearly 5,000 Federal \nemployees in my district do not have access to charging facilities at \nwork.\n  Congress approved electric vehicle recharging at the U.S. Capitol \ncomplex with strong bipartisan support in the House and Senate. This \namendment corrects the disparity and allows Federal employees more \nchoices in how they commute; gives the GSA and agencies flexibility on \nwhether to provide charging, how to provide it, including through \ncontractors; improves air quality while reducing reliance on foreign \noil; and does so at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to expand workplace \ncharging and transportation options. I thank Mr. Massie for being my \npartner in supporting and pursuing this innovation.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chair, American companies are leading the world in \ndevelopment of electric vehicle technology. All we are asking for in \nthis amendment is to enable the infrastructure to be built at no cost \nto the taxpayer.\n  Providing access to electric vehicle charging stations will give \nFederal employees enhanced flexibility in purchasing vehicles and more \noptions in their commute. The construction, installation, and operation \nof the charging stations would be covered by user fees. So taxpayers \nwould incur no cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, this amendment makes a very simple change to \nexisting law that will allow federal employees to plug in their \nelectric vehicles at work.\n  I was surprised to learn last year that my constituents who work and \nvolunteer at federal\n\n[[Page H7584]]\n\nfacilities cannot charge their electric vehicle (EV) at their \nworkplace. As the nation's largest employer, the federal government \nshould lead by example in terms of offering workplace charging. \nHowever, a quirk in existing law prohibits federal agencies from \nconstructing charging stations or even entering into contracts with \nthird parties to build charging infrastructure.\n  This amendment would simply authorize the federal government to \ninstall EV charging stations at federal facilities. It is based on the \ntext of the bipartisan H.R. 3509, which I introduced together with \nRepresentatives Massie, Lofgren, and Woodall, and it was recently \napproved by the Energy and Commerce Committee by voice vote as an \namendment to H.R. 8.\n  This straightforward amendment does not contain any mandates or new \nspending, it simply allows federal agencies to offer EV charging \nstations and charge a fee for their use. The amendment is modeled after \na successful initiative here at the U.S. Capitol. It requires stations \nto be installed and operated with funds collected from the use of the \nstations. This small but commonsense change to the law will ensure the \nU.S. remains a leader in clean energy deployment and would expand \ntransportation options for many of our constituents at no cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this simple, bipartisan amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Massie).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Fleischmann\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end of subtitle D of title I of division A the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC. 1431. USE OF DURABLE, RESILIENT, AND SUSTAINABLE \n                   MATERIALS AND PRACTICES.\n\n       To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall encourage \n     the use of durable, resilient, and sustainable materials and \n     practices, including the use of geosynthetic materials and \n     other innovative technologies, in carrying out the activities \n     of the Federal Highway Administration.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Fleischmann) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, \nwhich will support the geosynthetic materials industry in this country.\n  My amendment encourages the Federal Highway Administration to use \ngeosynthetic material. Similar language, Mr. Chairman, encouraging the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers was in the WRRDA bill and has been passed \ninto law.\n  If I may, Mr. Chairman, geosynthetics are a family of civil \nengineering solutions used in our national infrastructure. Since their \nintroduction in the 1960s, geosynthetics are a proven versatile and \ncost-effective roadway reinforcement solution to our transportation \nneeds.\n  Their use has expanded into nearly all areas of civil and \nenvironmental engineering. This is a complementary material to \ntraditional roadway and provides an alternative to traditional methods.\n  If I may, the cost savings are tremendous. Geosynthetics are less \ncostly to produce, transport, and install than comparable products and \ninvolves cost savings to the United States taxpayer.\n  Reduced maintenance costs over time of the roadway have been proven \nwith geosynthetic use. In addition, they have rapid construction and \ndeployment. It is very flexible and quick to employ, including in \ninclement weather.\n  Most of all, Mr. Chairman, this is an American jobs amendment. Over \n40 manufacturers in North America produce geosynthetic materials. Also, \n13,200 American jobs are involved in this. It is cost-effective, and it \nincreases American jobs. This is something Members from both sides of \nthe aisle support.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this amendment to this \ntransportation bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In the base bill, we have included measures to encourage States to \nbuild smart or right-size projects for practical design, and this \namendment complements those efforts.\n  Specifically, it mentions the use of geosynthetic materials, which \nthe Federal Highway Administration has been promoting to speed up and \nreduce the cost of bridge construction as part of its Every Day Counts \ninitiative.\n  Use of geosynthetic fabrics to reinforce soil can reduce erosion at \nthe point where bridge and road meet, which reduces maintenance costs \nand provides environmental benefits.\n  All of these approaches help ensure that we are able to stretch the \nlimited dollars we have to make meaningful improvements to our roads \nand bridges. It is a meritorious amendment by the gentleman. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. I want to thank my colleague.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Gibbs\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 233, after line 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1431. STUDY ON STATE PROCUREMENT OF CULVERT AND STORM \n                   SEWER MATERIALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall evaluate the methods \n     in which States procure culvert and storm sewer materials and \n     the impact of those methods on project costs, including the \n     extent to which such methods take into account environmental \n     principles, engineering principles, and the varying needs of \n     projects based on geographic location.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House \n     of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works of the Senate a report on the findings of the \n     study conducted under subsection (a).\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Gibbs) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I want to also congratulate Chairman Shuster \nand Ranking Member DeFazio for bringing this important bill to the \nfloor.\n  I am pleased to offer this bipartisan amendment with my colleague \nfrom California (Mrs. Napolitano) to study culvert and storm sewer \nprocurement methods.\n  Culvert and storm sewer materials have been subject to a unique \nprocurement process in recent years. In previous legislation, SAFETEA-\nLU, States were instructed to provide for competition in culvert \nprocurement similar to the process for other construction materials \nused in highway projects. In MAP-21, States were given full autonomy, \naccounting for engineering principles.\n  My simple amendment instructs the Secretary of Transportation to \nstudy methods used by States to procure culvert and storm sewer \nmaterials and report their findings to the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee. This study will enable us to better \nunderstand how costs, environmental and engineering principles, and \nother unique factors impact the States' procurement process.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano) to speak \nin support of the amendment.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to thank my \ncolleague, Mr. Gibbs, for introducing this very important amendment.\n  I do strongly support this amendment that requests a DOT study \nregarding the federally funded materials used by the States for culvert \nand stormwater pipes.\n\n[[Page H7585]]\n\n  This issue was brought to my attention in my area in Los Angeles by \ncompanies that were being forced out of competition for federally \nfunded transportation projects. The States were having a little problem \nand were the local governments that sole-sourced materials.\n  State and local governments should be allowed to have open and fair \ncompetition on the best products available for use in these sewer and \nculvert systems.\n  Mr. Gibbs' amendment, which I am happy to cosponsor, requires the \nDepartment again to study and report to Congress on these materials in \norder to ensure that taxpayer funds are being spent in a most cost-\neffective and efficient way.\n  I am very grateful to my colleague. I thank him for allowing me to \nco-offer this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GIBBS. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

STRATEGY TO ADDRESS STRUCTURALLY DEFICIENT \n                   BRIDGES.\n\n       The Secretary shall develop a comprehensive strategy to \n     address structurally deficient and functionally obsolete \n     bridges, as defined by the National Bridge Inventory, to \n     identify the unique challenges posed by bridges in each of \n     these respective categories, and to address such separate \n     challenges and improve the condition of such bridges. Not \n     later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall transmit a report containing initial \n     recommendations to the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate. Not later than 1 year after such date of enactment, \n     the Secretary shall transmit to such committees the final \n     strategy required by this section.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Gibson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of an amendment I \noffered along with my fellow colleagues from New York, Representative \nSean Patrick Maloney, John Katko, and Jerry Nadler. This amendment will \nimprove the safety of bridges across New York State and, indeed, across \nthe Nation.\n  As you are aware, Mr. Chairman, our national bridges are in desperate \nneed of repair. In New York, this is especially true. In 2015, the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers graded New York's network of \nbridges as a dismal D-plus. New York ranks second worst in the Nation \nin functionally obsolete bridges and 12th worst when it comes to \nstructurally deficient bridges.\n  This is not an issue limited to New York. Across the Nation, more \nthan one in nine bridges are graded as structurally deficient, and more \nthan 84,000 functionally obsolete bridges are still in use.\n  Mr. Chairman, our amendment does something positive and constructive \nabout it by directing the DOT to develop a strategy to address \nstructurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Notably, these two categories require different policy solutions but \ntoo often they are treated the same. By requiring this strategy, we \nwill allow for effective oversight by the people through their \nRepresentatives here in the U.S. House.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their \nstrong work in the committee. I urge support of this amendment so we \ncan develop a strategy to address the quality of bridges across this \nNation which will help keep our people safe and help strengthen our \neconomy.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I really appreciate the gentleman's work here in pointing out the \nproblem with our bridges, not just in New York, but nationwide, 147,000 \ndeficient bridges. In fact, as one of the few Democrats who opposed the \nso-called stimulus bill, I said at the time we would have been better \nserved had we invested that money in projects, real projects, as \nopposed to tax cuts.\n  One thing I suggested was how about a plan to rebuild all of the \ndeficient bridges in America, put a million or so people to work, and \nsolve a long-term problem. That wasn't to be, but this brings new focus \nto the issue, and, hopefully, we will get around to dealing with this \nissue in the near future with the information to be gleaned from this \nreport.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Gibson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Guinta\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1431. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY ON COST OF \n                   COMPLIANCE.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     submit to Congress a report that describes the cost to the \n     Federal Highway Administration of compliance with Federal \n     statutes and regulations as a percentage of the overall \n     spending by such Administration.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman from New \nHampshire (Mr. Guinta) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to \nthe bipartisan Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act.\n  Each year, we authorize funding for highway projects all across \nAmerica. The underlying bill we are discussing today provides both \nmuch-needed Federal funding, but also necessary long-term certainty for \nplanning transportation projects.\n  The funds provided are critical for maintaining our current roads and \nhighways, improving our infrastructure, and creating new infrastructure \nacross the country, something that is especially important for many \nrural areas like those in the Granite State. But like many projects \nthat use taxpayer dollars, burdensome regulations and inefficiencies \noften drive up the cost of projects and cause delays in the final \nproject.\n  My amendment is simple. It would require the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct a study to understand the purchasing \npower of the Federal highway dollars and quantify the things that \nweaken it, such as these burdensome regulations.\n  At a time when we face immense budgetary constraints, we should be \nexamining how each and every dollar is being spent. Granite Staters \nsent me to Washington to shed light on how we spend their tax dollars, \nand this amendment achieves just that.\n  There is no doubt that these highway projects are beneficial and \nnecessary for millions of Americans, but even the necessary and \nimportant projects should have proper oversight. It is just simply \nabout good government.\n  Hardworking Granite Staters know how to stretch a dollar, and it \nshould be no different for the Federal Government. This amendment \nallows us to identify the true cost of infrastructure projects. We \nshould be doing all we can to ensure our tax dollars are being spent \nwisely and efficiently so these projects are completed on time and on \nbudget.\n  I want to thank the chair and the ranking member, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n\n[[Page H7586]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The gentleman from Oregon is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I agree that regulations often need \nscrutiny and revision and sometimes elimination, but this bill \nundertakes a good deal of streamlining, both in the environmental area \nand in other processes.\n  So, if we were to go down the road of a study looking at these \nprograms, I would say a study that is a little broader, which would \nlook at both the costs and benefits of regulation, would be useful. I \ndon't think this one-sided study would be particularly useful.\n  If we want to understand the purchasing power of our highway dollars, \nwe only need to look at the fact that Congress has failed to increase \nthe gas tax since 1993, during which time the purchasing power, due to \ninflation and construction costs, has diminished by a good 40 percent \nor more. Whether or not we will be allowed to take action on \nsignificant revenues under this bill is still being deliberated \nupstairs in the Rules Committee with amendments that might or might not \nbe allowed to be offered.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Hanna\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Nation's engineering \n     industry continues to provide critical technical expertise, \n     innovation, and local knowledge to Federal and State agencies \n     in order to efficiently deliver surface transportation \n     projects to the public, and Congress recognizes the valuable \n     contributions made by the Nation's engineering industry and \n     urges the Secretary to reinforce those partnerships by \n     encouraging State and local agencies to take full advantage \n     of engineering industry capabilities to strengthen project \n     performance, improve domestic competitiveness, and create \n     jobs.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Hanna) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. HANNA. Madam Chairman, this bipartisan amendment presents a \nsimple, nonbinding sense of Congress recognizing the value of private \nsector engineering services in delivering road, bridge, and public \ntransportation projects of all natures. Nearly identical language was \nincluded in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act last year, \nwhich we adopted with overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle.\n  Local engineering firms in each of our districts play an important \nrole in partnering with State and local agencies to deliver \ntransportation projects. Just as States use private contractors to \nbuild roads and bridges, they utilize private engineering companies to \ndesign them.\n  While many DOTs partner well with private engineering firms, some \nStates do not take advantage of the services and expertise available. \nLocal firms are essentially shut out from competing for federally \nfunded projects.\n  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to balancing private and \npublic sector engineering expertise. But let me be clear: This \namendment is not about privatization; it is about options.\n  Private firms will be the first to argue that we must have trained \nand experienced engineers within the DOTs to manage, design, and \noversee the many programs. This is about encouraging States to strike \nthe balance that works best for them. Collaboration between public and \nprivate engineers is essential in delivering the highest quality and \nmost cost-effective projects.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nbecause it does encourage State DOTs to utilize the private sector for \nengineering and design services. The States deserve that flexibility to \ndecide whether it is more cost effective and efficient to utilize their \nown staff or to contract with the private sector to deliver such \ntransportation projects.\n  The adoption of this language will encourage outsourcing and will \nwaste already scarce transportation dollars. Countless studies from \nacross the Nation confirm that outsourcing engineering and design \nservices on transportation projects is more expensive than using \npublicly owned engineers and does not speed up project delivery.\n  In California alone, they spend $237,000 per outsourced engineer per \nyear, compared to $116,000 per State-employed engineer, according to \nthe 2014 State budget.\n  Louisiana spends $197,942 per outsourced engineer per year, compared \nto $82,364 for a State-employed engineer, according to the consulting \nfirm contracted by the State in 2014 to recommend cost-savings \nmeasures.\n  Tennessee DOT found they could save 15 percent if it brought in more \nin-house engineers.\n  Colorado DOT also studied the issue, and they saved 29 percent by \nbringing the engineering and design services in-house.\n  Adding this language into Federal law would be a first step toward \nincentivizing, or even mandating, the use of private sector for \nengineering and design services.\n  States should be allowed to use public engineers if they believe that \nthe public engineers are the most effective at, one, protecting the \npublic interest, and two, ensuring public safety.\n  I would like to mention that the professional engineers in California \nand the Governor are opposed, as are the transportation trades.\n  Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HANNA. Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the full \ncommittee.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman, and I support this bipartisan \namendment.\n  It presents a simple sense of Congress on the value of utilizing \nprivate sector engineering and design services for enhanced project \ndelivery, so I commend Mr. Hanna and Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney from New \nYork.\n  There was identical language in WRRDA last year, so I urge all \nMembers to support this amendment.\n  Mr. HANNA. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Hanna).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Mullin\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

ELIMINATION OF BARRIERS TO IMPROVE AT-RISK BRIDGES.\n\n       (a) Temporary Authorization.--\n       (1) In general.--Until the Secretary of the Interior takes \n     the action described in subsection (b), the take of nesting \n     swallows to facilitate a construction project on a bridge \n     eligible for funding under title 23, United States Code, with \n     any component condition rating of 3 or less (as defined by \n     the National Bridge Inventory General Condition Guidance \n     issued by the Federal Highway Administration) is authorized \n     under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) \n     between April 1 and August 31.\n       (2) Measures to minimize impacts.--\n       (A) Notification before taking.--Prior to the taking of \n     nesting swallows authorized under paragraph (1), any person \n     taking that action shall submit to the Secretary of the \n     Interior a document that contains--\n       (i) the name of the person acting under the authority of \n     paragraph (1) to take nesting swallows;\n\n[[Page H7587]]\n\n       (ii) a list of practicable measures that will be undertaken \n     to minimize or mitigate significant adverse impacts on the \n     population of that species;\n       (iii) the time period during which activities will be \n     carried out that will result in the taking of that species; \n     and\n       (iv) an estimate of the number of birds, by species, to be \n     taken in the proposed action.\n       (B) Notification after taking.--Not later than 60 days \n     after the taking of nesting swallows authorized under \n     paragraph (1), any person taking that action shall submit to \n     the Secretary of the Interior a document that contains the \n     number of birds, by species, taken in the action.\n       (b) Authorization of Take.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior, in \n     consultation with the Secretary, shall promulgate a \n     regulation under the authority of section 3 of the Migratory \n     Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 704) authorizing the take of \n     nesting swallows to facilitate bridge repair, maintenance, or \n     construction--\n       (A) without individual permit requirements; and\n       (B) under terms and conditions determined to be consistent \n     with treaties relating to migratory birds that protect \n     swallow species occurring in the United States.\n       (2) Termination.--On the effective date of a final rule \n     under this subsection by the Secretary of the Interior, \n     subsection (a) shall have no force or effect.\n       (c) Suspension or Withdrawal of Take Authorization.--If the \n     Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the \n     Secretary, determines that taking of nesting swallows carried \n     out under the authority provided in subsection (a)(1) is \n     having a significant adverse impact on swallow populations, \n     the Secretary of the Interior may suspend that authority \n     through publication in the Federal Register.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that is \ncritical to the safety of our traveling public.\n  Over 2 million trips are taken every day across failing bridges in \nthe United States. This is unacceptable. We need to make sure repairs \nare made in a timely and efficient manner so human lives can be \nprotected. We can start by removing unnecessary and overly burdensome \nbarriers to maintenance.\n  Barn or cliff swallows, whichever you want to call them, nest under \nbridges, sometimes in the thousands. Their nesting period can last from \nApril to August, which is prime construction season. These birds are \nnot endangered, but they are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty \nAct. Because of this law, the birds cannot be disturbed, and State \nDepartments of Transportation must develop plans for dealing with the \nbirds in every bridge maintenance, repair, rehab, or replacement \nproject.\n  Because these plans are so burdensome, contractors often delay their \nwork until after the nesting period so they don't have to risk \nviolating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and face Federal prosecution. \nDelaying the work puts the safety of the traveling public at risk.\n  My amendment allows the bridge work to be done, despite the presence \nof swallows, if the bridge has a condition rating of 3 or less until \nthe issue is addressed by the Department of the Interior. A condition \nrating of 3 means that the bridge is in serious need of repair: \nsections can be lost, the primary structural components have been \ndamaged, and there are cracks in the steel or concrete.\n  My amendment also directs the Secretary of the Interior to start the \nprocess for developing a rule to allow for the bridge work under the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act. This amendment has already been negotiated \nand included in the Senate's DRIVE Act.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that puts the safety of the public \nfirst, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).\n  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act, first enacted in 1918, makes it \nunlawful to take, kill, or capture any migratory bird. This landmark \nlegislation is the product of treaties with Canada, with Mexico, and \nwith Japan, and is credited with protecting over 800 species of \nendangered birds.\n  The amendment's supporters claim that it is a waiver of the Migratory \nBird Treaty Act solely for emergency situations. However, the amendment \nis overly broad and would act as a blanket waiver to allow the taking \nof swallows for any bridge construction, any repair, or any maintenance \nwithout a permit if certain conditions are met.\n  Further, the amendment is unnecessary, as section 704(a) of the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act already provides the Secretary of the \nInterior with the authority to allow the taking of migratory birds, \nincluding swallows, if certain conditions are met, and it also directs \nthe Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations allowing the \ntaking in those circumstances.\n  As a waiver process already exists allowing for the taking of the \nmigratory birds in emergency situations, I cannot support this \namendment. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter dated last \nFriday, October 30, from the Federal Highway Administration. This \nletter states that the configuration I am proposing today is compliant \nwith the federal bridge formula.\n  The second letter is from Peter Rogoff, Under Secretary for the \nDepartment of Transportation, to Chairman Shuster.\n\n               U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway \n                                                   Administration,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Reid J. Ribble,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Ribble: I am writing to provide a \n     technical correction to my letter of April 24 (copy enclosed) \n     which responded to your inquiry regarding the Comprehensive \n     Truck Size and Weight Limits Study (CTSWLS) required by \n     Section 32801 of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st \n     Century Act (MAP-21) P.L. 112-141.\n       In your letter, you asked whether the 91,000-pound gross \n     vehicle weight six-axle configuration under analysis as part \n     of the CTSWLS is in compliance with the Federal bridge \n     formula set forth in 23 U.S.C. 127. The Federal Highway \n     Administration recently revisited the question of whether the \n     91,000-pound, six-axle configuration used in the CTSWLS was \n     in compliance with the Federal bridge formula (FBF).\n       Our letter of April 24 confirmed that the configuration met \n     the FBF, which was our understanding at the time of the \n     CTSWLS based on a review of three standard tests of weight \n     and axle spacing. However, we have discovered that the \n     placement of axles and loading of the tridem for the specific \n     type studied in the CTSWLS did not meet a fourth test for \n     compliance. There is more than one way to design and load a \n     six-axle vehicle; the variations can affect whether the \n     vehicle is fully FBF-compliant. In order for a vehicle to \n     meet all tests of the FBF and be designed for safe and \n     practical operation, the maximum tridem axle weight would \n     need to be not more than 45,000 pounds in conjunction with \n     12-foot spacing between the 4th and 6th axles.\n       I have sent similar letters to the cosigners of your \n     original letter. If you have additional questions about the \n     Study, please contact Mr. David Kim of the Federal Highway \n     Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Gregory G. Nadeau,\n                                                    Administrator.\n       Enclosure.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the \n           Secretary of Transportation,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2015.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster: The U.S. Department of \n     Transportation is releasing for public comment and peer \n     review the technical reports of the Federal Highway \n     Administration's (FHWA) comprehensive study of certain \n     safety, infrastructure, and efficiency impacts surrounding \n     potential changes to the Federal truck size and weight (TS) \n     limits. This study is required by the Moving Ahead for \n     Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141, \n     Sec. 32801) which dictated very precise parameters for the \n     study's scope. The FHWA will consider any comments from the \n     peer review of the study to be conducted by the \n     Transportation Research Board (TRB) and the public for the \n     final report that we expect to deliver to Congress later this \n     year.\n       FHWA's technical work was able to employ the latest \n     modeling techniques in the areas of truck stability and \n     control performance as well as in bridge and pavement \n     structural impacts. It also featured the first-ever \n     accounting of violations and citations by truck configuration \n     in a study of this kind. Even so, the research also revealed \n     very significant data limitations that severely hampered \n     FHWA's efforts to conclusively study the effects of the size \n     and weight of various truck configurations. These limitations \n     are discussed below.\n       Among the data issues is the lack of descriptive \n     information in crash reports involving trucks--especially the \n     weight of the vehicle at the time of an incident--which \n     undermines our ability to conduct adequate highway safety and \n     truck crash analyses. So, while FHWA was able to identify \n     significantly higher crash rates in six-axle trucks compared \n     to five-axle trucks in the State of Washington, the lack of \n     available and consistently reported data from other states \n     prevented the Department from drawing national conclusions on \n     the crash rates of this and other truck configurations. We \n     also were constrained in fully accounting for modal shift of \n     freight traffic to short line and regional railroads due to \n     the absence of publicly available data in this area. Our \n     modeling did suggest one potentially important finding: that \n     the expected Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) reductions that \n     might result from heavier or larger trucks would be \n     relatively small, resulting in little noticeable impact to \n     real freight VMT.\n       Other data limitations, which are fully explored in the \n     attached technical studies, include:\n       The profound absence of weight data in crash reporting, \n     which prevents us from knowing whether trucks were fully \n     loaded, at legal capacity for their axle configurations, had \n     unevenly distributed weight, or were running overweight prior \n     to a crash.\n       The lack of acceptable models that can predict bridge deck \n     deterioration over time, which makes it difficult to \n     extrapolate long-term maintenance costs over time.\n       Difficulty separating truck weight enforcement program \n     costs from overall truck safety enforcement costs.\n       These findings were anticipated. The TRB's April 2014 peer \n     review report acknowledged weaknesses in the available \n     methods and data; however and notably, the TRB panel was not \n     able to identify better modeling approaches or data sets that \n     FHWA could employ. Additionally, a 2000 FHWA ``Comprehensive \n     Truck Size and Weight'' report also identified many of these \n     same insufficiencies.\n       The Department sought the input of the public and subject \n     matter experts, including members of academia in an effort to \n     overcome these limitations and provide expertise and \n     objective analysis. We held several public meetings and \n     webinars to solicit feedback on the data, methodology, and \n     prior work, as well as to share the status of the study \n     effort. Additionally, we made information on the project \n     plans available on our website, and invited comments from the \n     public. We used only data available to the public to maximize \n     the transparency of the Department's work. Despite our \n     efforts, these data weaknesses could not be overcome as the \n     study progressed. The study will now be subjected to peer \n     review and public comment. At this time, the Department \n     believes that the current data limitations are so profound \n     that the results cannot accurately be extrapolated to predict \n     national impacts. As such, the Department believes that no \n     changes in the relevant truck size and weight laws and \n     regulations should be considered until these data limitations \n     are overcome.\n       To make a genuine, measurable improvement in the knowledge \n     needed for these study areas, a more robust study effort \n     should start with the design of a research program that can \n     identify the areas, mechanisms and practices needed to \n     establish new data sets and models to advance the state of \n     practice. This research plan could be developed by an expert \n     panel, such as the TRB, and should include a realistic \n     estimation of timelines and costs.\n       As stated above, we are providing the technical reports \n     from the study effort for peer review and public comment. \n     FHWA will provide you with a final report once it \n     incorporates these additional observations into the Study. In \n     addition to the technical reports, attached is a summary \n     sheet of the steps with the findings of this study.\n       Please feel free to contact me should you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter M. Rogoff,\n                                                  Under Secretary.\n\n\n[[Page H7589]]\n\n\n  \n\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Madam Chair, we are facing a capacity crunch in the \nUnited States today. Overall freight tonnage is projected to increase \nby 25 percent over the next decade. Our Federal truck weight policy is \ntwo decades old, and it must be updated if we are going to stay \ncompetitive with our trading partners, especially those in this \nhemisphere.\n  My bipartisan amendment would give States the option of increasing \ntruck weight limits on their interstate highways from 80,000 pounds to \n91,000 pounds if those trucks add a sixth axle. I want to remind \neveryone it is an option, not a mandate, and it does not govern weight \nlimits on State and local roads.\n  Twenty-five of the 50 States, including my home State of Wisconsin, \nalready allow heavier trucks on their State or local roads. So here we \nhave an opportunity to move those trucks over to the interstate system, \nthe safest place for trucks to travel.\n  Under current laws, in many States, heavier trucks are forced to \nshare smaller roads with moms and dads driving to work or taking their \nkids to school rather than on the interstate where they belong.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation found numerous safety and \nefficiency benefits for this configuration in their technical report of \nits truck size and weight study. Four main findings of the DOT report \nare, first, a 91,000-pound, six-axle truck would actually stop faster \nthan trucks currently allowed on the highways; second, this \nconfiguration would reduce life-cycle pavement costs by up to 4 percent \nrelative to trucks currently on the road; third, this configuration \nwould reduce truck vehicle miles traveled and would lead to reduced \nfuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Finally, Madam Chairman, this configuration would result in no \nadditional onetime rehabilitation costs for bridges on the Interstate \nHighway System. I repeat, no additional onetime rehab costs for the \ninterstate system bridges.\n  Madam Chair, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to \nsupport transportation safety and efficiency.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Chair, this is all well and good, but that \npresumes that moms, dads, and kids don't use the Interstate Highway \nSystem to go to school. Well, in my district they do, and especially in \nurban districts they do.\n  When it comes to these humongously long trucks, what are we talking \nabout? We are talking about a 14 percent increase in weight in a truck \nthat is up to 100 feet long.\n  Now, if you want your moms, dads, and kids to be driving next to \nthem, that is your prerogative in your State. I don't want them in my \nState, and that is up to us. As a Member of Congress, I don't want them \non the Interstate Highway System.\n  By the way, if we are going to talk about the DOT study, let's be \nsure we understand the conclusion of that study, which basically says, \n``At this time, the Department believes that the current data \nlimitations are so profound that the results cannot accurately be \nextrapolated to predict national impacts. As such, the Department \nbelieves that no changes in the relevant truck size and weight laws and \nregulations should be considered.''\n  That is their conclusion after the study that they did that was just \ncited.\n  I will end on this particular note. We have to understand who else is \nwith us who opposes this at this time. The National Troopers \nAssociation, the National Sheriffs' Association, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the AAA organization, the United States Conference of \nMayors, the Advocates for Auto Safety, and the Teamsters Union.\n  Madam Chair, I think those all speak for themselves who is on the \nside of safety and who is not on the side of safety. I hope that this \namendment is not adopted.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman from \nMassachusetts' comments, although my amendment doesn't address truck \nsize whatsoever. My amendment doesn't include any change in \nconfiguration to the truck size. It does take existing truck sizes, and \nit requires the additional axle to that.\n  I also find it a tad bit striking that someone from Massachusetts \nwould be challenging a 91,000-pound truck weight when their own State \nallows 99,000 pounds on State roads and county roads in certain types \nof trucks.\n  What I am trying to do, rather than having those trucks driving on a \ntwo-lane highway, is to get them on a separated highway where everyone \nis moving in the same direction and moving them off of the smaller \nroads.\n  I also would like to talk about the policy recommendations. What the \ngentleman from Massachusetts just referred to was a cover letter on the \nstudy, but not the study itself. I am referring to the actual study.\n  The scientists that actually did the study came to the conclusions \nthat I mentioned before. I'm not speaking of a political cover letter \nby the administration who opposes this.\n  If we want to talk about agencies and organizations that support my \namendment, there are over 80 of those. We could go on and on, but time \ndoes not allow.\n  I would emphasize once again that my amendment is compliant with the \nFederal Bridge Formula. I would also note that my amendment gives the \nDOT the flexibility to prevent the operation of heavier trucks on \ncertain roads if DOT determines that there is a safety risk. It also \nallows the States to opt out.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Barletta).\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Madam Chairman, I rise today to strongly oppose the \namendment. This is bad policy because our local communities cannot \nafford to spend billions in new damages to our local roads and bridges.\n\n  As a former mayor, I stand with the mayors, cities, and counties in \nopposition. When heavy trucks get off the highway to fuel up their \ntanks or to make their deliveries, they end up on roads and bridges \npaid for by the counties, the cities, and the States.\n  More than 25 percent of the Nation's bridges are structurally \ndeficient, and a majority of these are locally owned. In Pennsylvania \nalone, we have over 5,000 structurally deficient bridges. It doesn't \nmatter how many axles are on that truck.\n  Additionally, Madam Chairman, I worked in the construction industry \nbuilding roads and bridges. A local street only has a few inches of \nasphalt while the interstates have over a foot of concrete. Our local \nroads are not designed for the increased damage, and our local \ncommunities cannot afford billions in new maintenance costs.\n  This is not just fiscally irresponsible; it is indefensible. It is \nwrong to force our mayors and county commissioners to subsidize this \nspecial perk, a perk that many truck drivers are afraid to take on. \nThis weight increase is strongly opposed by truck drivers and \ncompanies.\n  There are serious safety concerns, such as braking problems and \nincreased crash rates. That is why I stand with the troopers, the \nsheriffs, and the first responders. Please vote ``no'' on this \namendment.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Madam Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from New York \n(Mr. Nadler), my friend.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Ribble \namendment to allow heavier and bigger trucks on the Nation's highways.\n  Every time we move a transportation bill, proponents of bigger trucks \non behalf of certain industries try to weaken\n\n[[Page H7590]]\n\nthe restrictions Congress has put in place to protect the safety of the \ntraveling public and to reduce wear and tear on the highways.\n  According to DOT, there is an $800 billion backlog of investment \nneeds on highways and bridges, including $480 billion in critical \nrepair work. The underlying bill does not provide any increase in \nfunding. If this amendment passes, heavier trucks will further damage \nour roadways and add to the backlog, burdening our transportation \nagencies.\n  In MAP-21, rather than consider an increase in truck weight, we \nrequired DOT to conduct a study. The DOT found there is insufficient \ndata to support an increase in truck size or weight. But we do know \nthat bigger trucks are damaging and dangerous.\n  The DOT study found that 91,000-pound trucks would damage thousands \nof bridges and divert more than 2\\1/2\\ million tons of freight from \nrail to truck, further congesting our roadways, further damaging our \nroadways, and further contaminating our air, since trucks are three \ntimes less energy efficient and more emissions-polluting than rail.\n  It is also well known that heavier trucks aren't safe. In 2013, there \nwere over 134,000 accidents involving large trucks, resulting in 4,000 \nfatalities. The DOT study found that 91,000-pound trucks resulted in a \n47 percent higher crash rate when compared to 80,000-pound trucks in \nState testing.\n  That is why the public is overwhelmingly opposed to bigger trucks. \nThat is why the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, and other law enforcement organizations \noppose this proposed increase in truck weight. That is why we should \noppose this increase in truck weight and this amendment.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Madam Chair, in response to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania earlier, Pennsylvania doesn't have to adopt this policy. \nIt is totally optional for that State to do so.\n  I find it interesting that the gentleman from New York is concerned \nabout this while the State of New York already allows these heavier \ntrucks on their roads in their State, as does the State of Wisconsin.\n  The study supports the fact that this configuration would actually \nreduce life-cycle payment costs. That is in the study by the \nscientists, not the cover letter.\n  So we have this dichotomy where 25 States already are running these \nheavier trucks. All my bill would do is allow them to move toward the \ninterstate system.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Chair, again, just two points. I think everything \nhas been said. I do want to add that I have been informed that the \nindependent owners and operators of trucking, which represents 90 \npercent of the owners of trucks in this country, oppose this bill.\n  This bill will help only the largest truckers in the company. It will \nhurt the little guy. It will hurt the drivers of trucks. It will put my \nfamily and other families in danger for virtually no advancement in the \neconomy.\n  It is a bad proposal. I understand the desire. I know that some \nStates have done it. And, God forbid, if they have done it, that is \ntheir prerogative. But they are the ones who are going to have to \nanswer to their increased deaths and damages on the highways.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Madam Chair, I will wrap this up. I appreciate this \ndebate. I will say this: I am not interested in whether truckers make \nmore money or rails make more money.\n  I am interested in the poor family that has to pay higher prices for \nfood, for clothing, for goods and services, and for electricity because \nof this weight restriction.\n  I also am concerned about the States that already are allowing these \ntrucks--25 of them--but we can't drive them on the interstate system, \nwhich makes no sense whatsoever.\n  I also want to remind everyone that any State can choose not to do \nthis if they don't want to. This would just allow the ones that would \nlike to be able to do that. It is in full compliance with the study.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Ribble-Schrader-\nRouzer-Peterson amendment that would give states the option of allowing \nmore productive trucks on the road if they are equipped with a sixth-\naxle.\n  In rural America, this amendment will mean that farmers will be able \nto get their harvest to market more efficiently, with fewer trips on \nthe road.\n  Fewer trips back and forth from the field saves fuel and saves time, \nwhich is especially important when farmers are racing the clock during \nthe busy harvest season.\n  Unlike other businesses, farmers can't just pass along the cost of \ntransporting their crops to market.\n  Staying competitive means that we need to take advantage of safe \ntransportation options, like the one that would be allowed by the \namendment we are considering today.\n  This amendment has the support of a broad coalition of agriculture \norganizations including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nNational Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the National Milk Producers \nFederation and the American Soybean Association to name a few.\n  This amendment, as part of a long-term reauthorization bill, is a \nnecessary step towards modernizing our transportation system, and I \nurge my colleague to vote in support of this commonsense amendment.\n  Again, Madam Chair, I strongly support the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ribble).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 15 Offered by Ms. Brown of Florida\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Chair, I have amendment No. 15 at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __ . NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON TRAVEL AND TOURISM \n                   INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) 1 out of every 9 jobs in the United States depends on \n     travel and tourism, and the industry supports 15,000,000 jobs \n     in the United States;\n       (2) the travel and tourism industry employs individuals in \n     all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and all of the \n     territories of the United States;\n       (3) international travel to the United States is the single \n     largest export industry in the Nation, generating a trade \n     surplus balance of approximately $74,000,000,000;\n       (4) travel and tourism provide significant economic \n     benefits to the United States by generating nearly \n     $2,100,000,000,000 in annual economic output;

and\n       (G) strategies to improve intermodal connectivity for long-\n     haul passenger travel and tourism.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida (Ms. Brown) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Chair, the amendment I am offering with \nmy colleagues, Representatives Titus and Rice of South Carolina, simply \ncreates a national advisory committee on travel and tourism \ninfrastructure.\n  The committee will advise the Secretary on current and emerging \npriorities and funding needs related to the use of the Nation's \ntransportation system to help facilitate travel and tourism.\n  The advisory committee will gather information, develop technical \nadvice, and make recommendations to the Secretary on policies that \nmaximize the benefits to the Nation that are generated through the \nUnited States travel and tourism industry.\n  The committee will then share this information with Federal, State, \nand local officials making investment decisions relating to \ntransportation projects that improve travel and tourism.\n  Advisory committee members will be appointed by the Secretary of \nTransportation and will include representatives from public and private \nsector stakeholders involved in the travel and tourism industry. The \ntravel industry generates $1.8 trillion in economic output and supports \n14.1 million jobs.\n  I represent central Florida, which includes Disney World, Universal \nStudios, SeaWorld, NASA, the Citrus Bowl, world famous beaches, and \nhundreds of other tourist attractions with over 50 million visitors \neach year.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Not only is it critical to ensure the best infrastructure for the \nefficient flow of these visitors, but ensuring best practices and \nsharing information will help move people out of harm's way in case of \na manmade or natural disaster.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, in the interest of the amendment's \nsponsors, it is already directly addressed in the bill by section 1201 \nand section 1202. They specifically add travel and tourism as \nconsiderations in the metropolitan and State planning process.\n  I appreciate the importance of travel and tourism to local economies. \nIn fact, in Pennsylvania, it is one of the most important in the \nPennsylvania economy.\n  A national advisory committee does not need to be mandated by \nCongress, in my view. The stakeholder community will now be able to \naddress travel and tourism in the development of State and metropolitan \ntransportation plans.\n  Further, there is nothing to prevent public and private interests \nfrom coordinating their efforts to promote tourism and travel in the \nabsence of a national advisory committee.\n  I urge all Members to oppose this. This is redundant. We already have \nit in the bill. I think it stands on its own merits in the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Chair, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).\n  Ms. TITUS. Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  I rise in support of the Brown-Titus-Rice amendment to establish a \nnational travel infrastructure strategy and advisory committee, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to do the same.\n  I represent the heart of the Las Vegas Valley, where more than 42 \nmillion travelers board planes, buses, and cars to come and enjoy some \nholiday time and bask in the sun and the bright lights of the Las Vegas \nStrip. Others come to attend some of the largest professional and \nbusiness meetings in the country.\n  Like so many places, our economy is built on the hospitality \nindustry, and its success depends on a strong transportation network to \nbring and move those millions of visitors around, as well as the \nfreight needed to serve those visitors. That is why I was proud to work \nwith my colleague from Florida (Mr. Webster) on an amendment just \nreferenced to ensure that State and local planning processes would \nconsider the needs of the traveler as part of the long-term planning \nprocess. This amendment was approved by voice vote just 2 weeks ago in \nthe committee.\n  Today, we are here with a similar bipartisan amendment that ensures \nthat travel and tourism are part of our national policy for \ntransportation. Our policies are enhanced when we consult and \ncollaborate with leaders who rely on our transportation networks. Their \nguidance and experience can ensure that our DOT decisionmakers are \naware of the changing needs and trends in travel and tourism, and can \ntailor investments and strategies to meet those needs.\n  We often hear people in this very body rail against Washington \nbureaucrats not knowing what is going on back home. This amendment \nwould address that. I urge your support.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to \nthe gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice).\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding.\n  I certainly appreciate and respect the chairman's hard work in \ngathering up this bill. While I respectfully disagree with him that the \nbill adequately addresses tourism, I think a national committee \nreporting directly to the Secretary of Transportation, similar to other \naspects of the travel industry, like freight, trucking, and other\n\n[[Page H7592]]\n\nthings, would certainly benefit the tourism industry and give a more \nbalanced perspective.\n  I rise in support of this amendment. It is important for the \nDepartment of Transportation not to lose focus on the movement of \npeople in their strategic planning of our Federal network. Congestion \nis at an all-time high, and new construction is at an all-time low. To \nbest address these issues, the Department of Transportation should \nconsult with experts in moving people efficiently: the travel and \ntourism industry.\n  Creating a national advisory committee on travel and tourism will \nensure that most knowledgeable private sector stakeholders have a role \nin the planning of our most important corridors.\n  Travel and tourism supports 15 million jobs in the United States and \nis important to every region of the country. Establishing a forum to \ncollaborate, strategize, and develop infrastructure that allows the \nindustry to exist is necessary to ensuring America's competitiveness in \nthe tourism global market.\n  Determining a long-term plan for anything is rare here in Washington. \nThat is exactly what this amendment does; it determines a long-term \nstrategic plan for the travel and tourism industry.\n  Madam Chair, in my district in South Carolina, Myrtle Beach welcomes \nover 16 million visitors annually. Tourism is the driver of our economy \nin the Grand Strand. We are one of the most visited destinations in the \ncountry and do not have interstate access. In fact, we are the most \nvisited destination that does not have interstate access. If a \ndestination attracts 16 million visitors without an interstate, imagine \nwhat areas like ours could do with one.\n  The national advisory committee on travel and tourism will identify, \nprioritize, and make recommendations to the DOT on areas in need of \ninfrastructure advances, like Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. That is why \nI am a cosponsor of this important amendment.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, again, I continue to oppose the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Myrtle Beach, the gentlewoman from Las \nVegas, and the gentlewoman from central Florida. I understand \ncompletely their concern with tourism.\n  As I pointed out earlier, this is already in the bill. I believe Ms. \nTitus and Mr. Webster got it into the bill in markup. So, again, this \nis redundant. This is not necessary. Section 1201 and section 1202 \nspecifically add travel and tourism, so I believe it is in the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. IDENTIFICATION OF ROADSIDE HIGHWAY SAFETY HARDWARE \n                   DEVICES.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study on methods \n     for identifying roadside highway safety hardware devices to \n     improve the data collected on the devices, as necessary for \n     in-service evaluation of the devices.\n       (b) Contents.--In conducting the study, the Secretary shall \n     evaluate identification methods based on the ability of the \n     method to--\n       (1) convey information on the devices, including \n     manufacturing date, factory of origin, product brand, and \n     model;\n       (2) withstand roadside conditions; and\n       (3) connect to State and regional inventories of similar \n     devices.\n       (c) Identification Methods.--The identification methods to \n     be studied under this section include stamped serial numbers, \n     radio-frequency identification, and such other methods as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than January 1, 2018, \n     the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     results of the study.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Chair, this commonsense amendment directs the \nU.S. Department of Transportation to study ways to improve data \ncollection on highway safety hardware devices. Today, these devices, \nwhich include guardrails, barriers, terminals, and railings, are \ncritical to the safety of our roadways yet are often taken for granted.\n  In November of last year, Darryl Blackmon, a 24-year-old San \nFrancisco Bay Area resident, a beloved family member who supported his \nmom, amongst other family members, community volunteer, and football \nstar at Kansas State University, was killed in a collision with a \nguardrail that 40 States and the District of Columbia have stopped \ninstalling due to safety concerns.\n  In response to tragedies like Darryl Blackmon's death and thanks to a \nwhistleblower who highlighted the fraudulent actions taken by this \nparticular guardrail manufacturer, earlier this year, a Federal judge \nhanded down a $663 million judgment against the manufacturer for \nfailing to disclose information to Federal and State regulators about \nmodifications made to their guardrail specifications after they were \napproved by the Federal Highway Administration.\n  Despite Federal tests dating back to 2005, suggesting these \nguardrails are safe, just last month, Virginia's attorney general said \nthat the guardrails tested by the Virginia Department of Transportation \n``failed miserably.'' According to media reports, more than 200,000 of \nthese particular guardrails may still be in service on our Nation's \nhighways. Unfortunately, there is no existing mechanism to accurately \nverify this number or locate all the guardrails. That is why this \namendment is critically important. Without a practical mechanism for \nidentifying defective guardrails, many States are still assessing their \nability to remove defective products from our roadways and incurring \nadditional liability.\n  Unfortunately, these events have highlighted the need to reform our \ncurrent system of identifying and inventorying our highway hardware. \nThis amendment makes progress towards reassessing FHWA's hardware \nreview process to enhance accountability, promote transparency, and \nimprove responsiveness to future safety concerns.\n  It is critical to the safety of the traveling public that products \ninstalled on our roadways and using Federal dollars are properly \nevaluated and accounted for when safety concerns arise. Madam Chair, I \nurge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment. It is \na thoughtful amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 17 Offered by Mr. Scott of Virginia\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 18 Offered by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment \nat the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 238, strike line 10 and all that follows through page \n     239, line 5, and insert the following:\n       (1) by striking paragraph (4); and\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chair, my amendment \nrepresents an important effort to preserve the existing budget \nauthority for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation \nAct, TIFIA, program. In essence, this simple amendment would strike \nDOT's ability to reallocate budget authority for TIFIA, ensuring that \nthis authority remains available for the TIFIA program.\n  The TIFIA program was first authorized by Congress in 1998 to fill a \ncritical gap in financing for large-scale transportation projects. \nSince that time, the Department of Transportation has provided low-\ninterest credit assistance to State and local governments in order to \nhelp finance projects of regional and national significance. Current \nlaw directs the Department of Transportation to redistribute \nuncommitted budget authority for TIFIA to States for use by their \nformula programs.\n  Due to unforeseen delays in allocating budget authority, DOT \nredistributed approximately $640 million of budget authority for TIFIA \nas recently as April of this year. This reduced capacity for project \nfinancing will have serious consequences. Texas alone, for example, has \nmore than $1 billion in potential projects that will utilize the TIFIA \nprogram.\n  Make no mistake, this funding capacity has been lost not because of a \nlack of demand for the program, but because of the inability to commit \nbudget authority in a timely manner.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Unfortunately, the highway bill being considered on the floor also \ncuts TIFIA drastically from the current level of $1 billion per year to \njust over $200 million per year. Allowing a redistribution clause to \nremain in place could result in further cuts to the program. My \namendment would simply protect what has proven to be an invaluable \nfinancing tool for State and local governments.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment so that we can preserve the \nloan capacity for this time-tested program.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Shuster and Ranking \nMember DeFazio for supporting this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chairman, the gentlewoman from Texas has been a \nlong-term member of the committee, and she has thought this through \nwell. We appreciate her bringing this amendment to the floor, and we \nsupport it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute \nto the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano).\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Johnson amendment, \nand I thank my colleague from Texas for offering it.\n  This amendment would allow unused TIFIA funds to be reprogrammed \ninto--in other words, to be put back into--the TIFIA account.\n  The L.A. Metro, in my region, is one of the biggest recipients of the \nfinancing from TIFIA. TIFIA is an incredibly important tool in Los \nAngeles County that allows us to use our two transportation sales tax \nmeasures to complete projects in 10 years instead of 30 years. Speeding \nup project construction saves money in the long run, and it allows our \ntransportation users the benefits of an improved multimodal system.\n  I understand the need to reduce TIFIA from $1 billion to $200 million \nfor transportation funding in the underlying bill in order to provide \nfor other important programs, such as a freight program. This amendment \nwould help reduce the burden that decreased TIFIA funding will have on \nlocal communities.\n  Madam Chairman, I support the Johnson amendment.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 19 Offered by Mr. Welch\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. WELCH. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 3010 of division A.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Vermont (Mr. Welch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELCH. Madam Chairman, one of the major challenges for a \ncomprehensive transportation bill is to have it facilitate the creation \nof livable communities, and we have, across this country, more and more \ncommunities that, as part of creating that space for good \ntransportation, want to include and have included bike paths.\n  Biking transportation has become a real attraction for younger people \nwho are moving into urban areas. It is something that has taken cars \noff the road and has put people on bikes. People are getting exercise \nand are finding beautiful ways to get around their communities. It is \nsomething that adds to the overall quality of life in communities \nacross the country. It used to be that biking was seen as something \nthat just individuals would do. It is now seen, as a result of \ntransportation policy, as integral to a livable community approach.\n  In the current legislation before us, the Federal match would be \nreduced\n\n[[Page H7594]]\n\nfrom 90 and 95 percent to 80 percent. This amendment would propose to \nkeep the status quo, keeping that Federal contribution at 90 to 95 \npercent. It makes a huge difference in our communities to get that \nextra boost as it makes a difference as to whether or not they can \nproceed on some bikeway improvements. So let's keep what we have. We \nhave a good thing going. With this amendment, the ability to keep it \ngoing will be even stronger.\n  In Vermont, bike commuting has increased by over 70 percent from 2005 \nto 2014. Vermont has 19 bike and pedestrian facility projects across \nthe State, totaling $38.9 million. There is a lot of local money in \nthat. By the way, the young and old and middle-aged are all getting \nout, taking advantage of those things. Burlington has proposed a fully \nintegrated bike network, and this amendment would help that city in \nVermont complete that goal.\n  The benefits to biking are tremendous. It is good for the \nenvironment. It is good for us when we get on bikes and get a little \nexercise. It is a good healthcare benefit. It is good for taking cars \nand congestion off the road. There are incidental benefits and \neconomic. It has been demonstrated in Vermont that there are \nsignificant revenue gains to local businesses by having as robust a \nbike system as we can have.\n  In summary, biking is integral in Vermont and in the Nation. Earl \nBlumenauer is the patron of biking in this country. It is a really big, \nimportant component, and I urge the passage of this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chairman, unfortunately, I rise in opposition to \nthis amendment by my good friend from Vermont. I know there are a lot \nof health benefits and other benefits to this. The main reason that I \nrise in opposition is that, with the gentleman's amendment, there will \nbe less money being invested in transit.\n  The higher Federal share means that a bike project can eat up the \nfunds the transit agencies need to address their needs. In addition, \nthis amendment would mean that a bicycle project gets a higher Federal \nshare than the acquisition of an ADA-compliant vehicle, which will \nsupport mobility for disabled individuals.\n  Almost every other type of project we authorize in this bill--roads, \nbridges, bus stations--requires a partnership of up to 80 percent \nFederal, 20 percent non-Federal. These bike projects shouldn't be the \nexception; so I would urge all Members to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELCH. Madam Chairman, may I inquire as to my remaining time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Vermont has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELCH. Madam Chairman, I have one comment.\n  We have a budgetary issue because we don't have as robustly funded a \ntransportation bill as we need. I appreciate the comments of the \nchairman of the committee, but that problem is something that is going \nto be hamstringing every activity we do, whether it is mass transit or \nbikes. My hope is that, by the end of this process, we are finally \ngoing to put the money into our infrastructure--every component of it \nthat we need.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), \nmy friend, who we all know in the United States House of \nRepresentatives is the champion of bikers everywhere.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting \nme to speak and for his raising this issue.\n  Madam Chairman, it is important that we have a balanced \ntransportation system, and there are already problems in terms of being \nable to promote nonmotorized transportation in terms of bike and \npedestrian. Being able to maintain the ability for the Federal funding, \nI think, is important. I don't think we should relegate this to being a \nsecond-class type of transportation.\n  I was in Brooklyn on Friday night, and people were engaged in their \ninitiatives with cycling. I started the week in Dallas. Texas cities \nare incorporating these mechanisms into their basic approach to \ntransportation.\n  This is not the end of the world, but I think it is ill-advised, and \nit is the wrong signal for us to be sending. There are several dozen \nwomen from the bicycle industry here--executives from companies--who \nare involved with hundreds of millions of dollars of economic activity. \nThis is something that does not deserve to be downgraded. This is not \ngoing to upset the apple cart by any stretch of the imagination.\n  I appreciate my colleague for putting the spotlight on this. We are \nwatching cycling explode from Washington, D.C., to Seattle, to \nRochester, New York, to Indianapolis, Indiana. This is a small but \nimportant step backwards.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chairman, I continue to oppose, and I urge all \nMembers to oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELCH. I thank the gentleman from Oregon, and I reiterate his \nstrong arguments.\n  Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 20 Offered by Ms. Sewell of Alabama\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom Alabama (Ms. Sewell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Chairman, I am offering this amendment \non behalf of myself and as the designee of the gentlewoman from Texas, \nCongresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  I wish to thank the chair and the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee for making this amendment in order.\n  I want to thank the Transportation and Infrastructure chairman, Bill \nShuster, as well as the ranking member, Peter DeFazio, for their \nefforts to bring the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform \nAct to the floor. I thank them for this opportunity to explain the \nJackson Lee-Sewell amendment, which makes a good bill even better by \nensuring that the national goals of strengthening our Nation's \ntransportation and infrastructure is aided by innovation.\n  The Jackson Lee-Sewell amendment improves this good bill by ensuring \nthat the goals of improving transportation efficiency and safety take \ninto consideration the topic of rest stop and other parking and the \ntopic of public safety.\n  This amendment seeks a public safety report to be provided to the \nHouse and the Senate Transportation Committees on the security of \nlocations that are intended to encourage the public use of alternative \ntransportation as well as personal transportation parking areas. More \nthan 1 in 10 property crimes occurs in parking lots\n\n[[Page H7595]]\n\nor in garages, and this study will provide an opportunity for Congress \nto do more to enhance the safety of parking areas that are used by the \nmost vulnerable in our communities: students, women, seniors, the \ndisabled, and other vulnerable members of the public.\n  The Jackson Lee-Sewell amendment will make surface transportation \ntravel safer. More importantly, it will increase safety for the \ntraveling public, especially for women, seniors, students, disabled \npersons, and children.\n  Madam Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee-Sewell \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER.

With the right IoT \n     solution in place, enterprises can connect all devices across \n     a centralized cloud network, and capture and share their \n     mission-critical data, allowing them to gain real-time \n     visibility of their operations.\n       This actionable insight is what provides organizations the \n     Enterprise Asset Intelligence they need to make improvements. \n     This enhanced business knowledge can be gained through a set \n     of enabling technologies in the areas of asset management, \n     cloud, mobile and Big Data.\n       By leveraging Enterprise Asset Intelligence, transportation \n     and logistics can dramatically improve the following areas:\n\n\n                        I. End-to-End Visibility\n\n       Transportation and logistics businesses around the globe \n     are focused on maximizing supply chain efficiency in order to \n     sustain profitability and viability.\n       However, to reach this level of performance, they need to \n     make end-to-end improvements. Complete visibility facilitates \n     more effective, timely decisions and reduces delays through \n     quicker detection of issues.\n       Mobile devices, such as radio frequency identification \n     (RFID), barcode scanners and mobile computers, have become a \n     major influence in supply chain visibility and operations. \n     Many transportation and logistics companies using RFID today \n     are reaching nearly 100 percent shipping and receiving \n     accuracy, 99.5 percent inventory accuracy, 30 percent faster \n     order processing and 30 percent reduction in labor costs.\n       Mobile technologies provide businesses line of sight into \n     equipment, inventory and business processes. This asset \n     intelligence allows organizations to increase their \n     efficiency by providing them real-time data across their \n     entire supply chain.\n       Though these types of solutions have already helped \n     transportation and logistics businesses make improvements \n     over the years, leveraging them with enabling technologies \n     like the IoT can deliver even more asset intelligence, \n     leading to more informed decisions.\n\n\n                   II. Warehouse and Yard Management\n\n       The warehouse and/or yard are at the core of transportation \n     and logistics businesses. Their efficiency directly impacts \n     the cost of doing business and the ability to compete. With \n     IoT-enabled mobile devices designed to track inventory data, \n     equipment and vehicles, enterprises can give their physical \n     assets a digital voice.\n       By converting the physical to digital, transportation and \n     logistics warehouses can capture and share their mission-\n     critical data across the cloud, ensuring they have the right \n     products in the right place at the right time.\n       Yard personnel are frequently moving around on foot or in \n     vehicles, manually conducting their routine tasks. This \n     process is time intensive and prone to error which causes a \n     number of visibility-related problems including redundant \n     trailer moves, yard gate congestion, product shrinkage, \n     wasted fuel and lost time. To address these issues, \n     organizations across the supply chain implement RFID systems \n     that automate asset tracking and location.\n       By reducing human intervention and enabling more machine-\n     to-machine information sharing, enterprises can greatly \n     increase efficiency and accuracy.\n\n\n                         III. Fleet Management\n\n       When it comes to transportation and logistics, fleet \n     management plays a critical role in managing maintenance \n     schedules, everyday vehicle usage and service routes. In \n     order to maximize productivity and operational efficiency, \n     fleet downtime must be minimized. With mobile scanners, \n     computers and RFID systems alone, enterprises can gain \n     visibility into their assets and better streamline operations \n     to keep their fleet moving.\n       By replacing manual and hard-copy work orders with mobile \n     devices, technicians save time and increase data accuracy. \n     Furthermore, with realtime, accurate insight into maintenance \n     history, parts availability and inventory records, \n     technicians can relay information back to their central \n     database.\n       By leveraging connected, mobile devices, enterprises can \n     capture, share and manage data around their moving assets \n     across the enterprise. Connectivity also enables enterprises \n     to communicate with their technicians (drivers) anytime, \n     anywhere, allowing them to be proactive with in-field \n     repairs, maintenance, etc. With real-time updates on certain \n     conditions such as bad weather or traffic, fleet technicians \n     can better respond and/or prepare.\n       For field technicians, real-time visibility into driver and \n     vehicle performance is critical. This visibility can be used \n     to increase the safety of technicians, reduce damaged \n     inventory and decrease insurance-related costs all of which \n     are critical to an enterprise's bottom line. Additionally, \n     with real-time insight, technicians and drivers can respond \n     to customer service inquiries in a timely manner. This helps \n     personnel know when and where to allocate their time--\n     improving the organization's overall performance and customer \n     service.\n       Furthermore, with the ability to securely monitor their \n     equipment and environment in real time, field service \n     technicians can take action before problems arise. With the \n     IoT, companies can gain intelligence remotely around their \n     assets in the field, allowing them to facilitate needbased \n     maintenance and eliminating unnecessary and/or reactive \n     responses.\n       Advances in mobile technology and the IoT are dramatically \n     improving the way transportation and logistics businesses \n     operate. The Enterprise Asset Intelligence delivered through \n     these solutions is what enables organizations to pinpoint \n     inefficiencies in real time, improving throughput and helping \n     them build progressive plans to move toward innovation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From MassTransitMag.com, Nov. 2, 2015]\n\n         Mapping IoT Into Today's Urban Transportation Systems\n\n                          (By Ashwini Chharia)\n\n       Today, more than 54 percent of the world's population lives \n     in urban areas, a number that is expected to increase to 66 \n     percent in the coming decades. This results initially in \n     higher urban density, followed by urban sprawl as people and \n     businesses expand beyond the initial city boundaries. Such \n     urban growth and sprawl results in a society with \n     considerably more vehicles on the roads, amidst an increasing \n     demand from commuters for faster and alternate transportation \n     channels. We can all relate to experiencing more congestion, \n     increased accidents and road construction, all of which are \n     also resulting in safety issues and increase the amount of \n     time the average person spends commuting. Traffic congestion \n     wastes energy, contributes to global warming and costs \n     individuals and businesses time and money.\n       Using mobile applications, users are promised real-time \n     travel information in order to reach a destination in an \n     efficient amount of time. Yet, even using map applications \n     many people still find themselves spending an inordinate \n     amount of time in commute due to traffic, accidents and other \n     disruptions. Cities are also increasingly forced to compete \n     amongst themselves to attract residents and businesses and be \n     considered a more desirable place to live and work. A city's \n     transportation and communication infrastructure is an \n     important consideration that has direct and indirect economic \n     impacts for government, businesses and residents.\n       To meet rising demand, cities require infrastructures and \n     systems that are connected, energy-conscious and intelligent \n     enough to quickly react to everyday traffic situations. This \n     includes supporting machine-to-machine interactions that \n     allow travelers to quickly reroute their trip or plan to take \n     alternate transportation, should a disruption arise. Critical \n     to achieving this is a strong foundation of information and \n     communications technology (ICT), and resource management \n     systems that operate under a supportive policy framework and \n     enable an expanded public-private cooperation. This \n     communication infrastructure needs to support reliable high-\n     speed transmission of vast amounts of data and enable \n     communication across people, organizations and systems. For \n     example, intelligent traffic management systems that use \n     wirelessly managed traffic lights at interchanges to help \n     reduce congestion require a robust infrastructure that \n     permits them to transmit large volumes of signal and video \n     data to traffic control centers.\n       Mobile technologies today are already enabling residents to \n     quickly inform and be informed of traffic situations and \n     patterns that are emerging during their commute. In a traffic \n     incident or natural catastrophe situation, mobile \n     technologies provide a means for interactive exchange of \n     information and quick guidance and action from other parties, \n     such as medical and law enforcement organizations and \n     insurance companies. With intelligent transportation systems \n     that can be used for traffic management and are available on \n     a cloud platform, even smartphones can be used to manage the \n     traffic system at any time.\n\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama.

Madam Chair, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof Congresswoman Sewell and myself.\n  Once again, I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules \nCommittee for making this Amendment in order.\n  I thank the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill \nShuster and Ranking Member Peter A. DeFazio for their bipartisan work \nto bring the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act to \nthe floor.\n  This Jackson Lee/Sewell Amendment provides a report to Congress from \nthe Secretary of the Department of Transportation on the ``Internet of \nThings'' (IoT) and its potential to improve transportation services to \nthe elderly and persons with disabilities as well as assist local, \nstate and federal transportation planners in achieving better \ninefficiencies and cost effectiveness, while protecting privacy and \nsecurity of persons who use IoT technology.\n\n[[Page H7597]]\n\n  The IoT refers to the wireless environment that will support \nnetworking of physical objects or ``things'' embedded with wireless \nelectronic components, software, sensors, and network connectivity \ntechnology, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data on \npeople, places and things.\n  The IoT will introduce the functionality of computing into physical \nspace as computing technology is integrated into devices and systems.\n  It will also challenge the privacy and security of users of the \ntechnology if precautions are not taken to ensure that information on \nthese devices is not protected.\n  This Jackson Lee/Sewell amendment will allow Congress to take into \nconsideration how IoT technologies can be used to make public \ntransportation, safer, more convenient to the elderly and disabled, and \nhow it may improve mass and personal transportation efficiency.\n  The ability to include wireless technology into physical things or \nsupport communication among digital devices that may be nearby or at \ndistances will offer many benefits to consumers.\n  IoT products are already being deployed for personal, recreational, \ncity planning, public safety, energy consumption management, \nhealthcare, and many other applications.\n  Today, local governments are working to incorporate IoT services into \ntransportation; garbage pickup, as well as the provision of wireless \nconnectivity for their residents.\n  The Jackson Lee/Sewell Amendment will help ensure that we harness the \nbenefits of the ``Internet of Things'' for the traveling public and \nminimize the threats to privacy and cybersecurity presented by this new \nand exciting technology.\n  I urge support for the Jackson Lee/Sewell Amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 22 Offered by Mr. Blumenauer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 22 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 326, line 10, strike ``13 percent'' and insert ``11 \n     percent''.\n       Page 326, beginning line 18, strike ``14.5 percent'' and \n     insert ``13.5 percent''.\n       Page 326, line 25, strike ``52.5 percent'' and insert \n     ``50.5 percent''.\n       Page 327, line 20, strike ``5 percent'' and insert ``10 \n     percent''.\n       Page 348, line 17, strike ``15 percent'' and insert ``2 \n     percent''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I appreciate the work that has been done \nin this underlying legislation to put more national priority dealing \nwith nonmotorized safety.\n  This new program gives States funding for Vision-Zero-type activities \nthat are on the forefront of what is happening in communities around \nthe country that are not accepting the carnage on the highways for \npedestrians and cyclists being able to use these tools, to be able to \nre-engineer and to enforce and protect some of our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  Being struck by a motor vehicle is the leading cause of injury-\nrelated death for children under 14, and being struck by a motor \nvehicle is the second-leading cause of injury-related death for senior \ncitizens. This is our young and our old.\n  In low-income neighborhoods, there is a much higher pedestrian \nfatality rate than in higher income areas. Fatalities on our roadways \nhave declined overall, but the number of pedestrians killed annually \nrose 16 percent over the course of the last 5 years.\n  We spend billions of dollars on surface transportation every year, \nnot as much as we should, but a significant amount of money. Yet, we \nare spending less than a billion on critical bike and pedestrian \nFederal projects.\n  That is why I strongly support the new nonmotorized public safety \nprogram. However, I have one modest concern. Only States where 15 \npercent or more of the traffic fatalities are nonmotorized are eligible \nfor this funding. My reckoning is that only 20 States and the District \nof Columbia would qualify. This seems backwards to me.\n  When we have this carnage occurring in communities large and small \nacross the country, this provision would actually reward States with \nFederal money that are more dangerous for bicyclists and pedestrians \nand doesn't provide incentives for those States who have lowered the \nnumber of bike and pedestrian incidents and are working to move \nforward.\n  I have introduced this legislation with my colleague, Congressman \nBuchanan of Florida, who is the co-chair of the Bike Caucus, to make \nthis funding available to virtually every State by lowering the \neligibility threshold to 2 percent of the fatalities and double the \nfunding for a nonmotorized safety program.\n  Madam Chair, this is serious business. I have encountered people from \naround the country who are part of this revolution in terms of \nenhancing bike and pedestrian facilities. This Congress has been in the \nforefront of moving it forward. I think extending the eligibility of \nthis program would be in keeping with this record of accomplishment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I do oppose this amendment.\n  In this bill, we have created a competitive grant program for \nnonmotorized users. In this program, it stood up for the first time. We \nshould let NHTSA stand this program up before we judge the success and \nbefore we award it more funding.\n  This amendment would cut funding for critical safety programs that \nkeep drunk drivers off our highways, encourage seat belt use, and \nimprove State safety data programs. The funds would be reallocated in a \nnew program created in this bill, as I mentioned, to focus on bike and \npedestrian safety.\n  I commend the gentleman for his passion and commitment to cyclists \nand their safety, but this is a new program that has been set up. So I \nwould just urge that we should let NHTSA stand the program up and then \njudge its success and whether we should allocate more money or not.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I appreciate what the committee has done \nputting this new program in. I think it is important. I look forward to \nits success.\n  Since it is a competitive grant program, allowing most States to be \neligible doesn't take that away.\n  The other areas that the gentleman is talking about have much more \ngenerous funding than programs that hit our youth and our senior \ncitizens in term of bike and pedestrian.\n  I think, by any rational reallocation, we would be putting more in. \nThis is a drop in the bucket, $28 million overall. It would be money \nwell spent and would allow the program to be able to evaluate which \nprograms are the best, particularly some that have successfully lowered \ntheir accident rate a little bit below the 15 percent threshold. Maybe \nthey have got something going. Maybe they have got something that we \ncould use for national applications.\n  I respectfully request that the amendment be approved.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 23 Offered by Mrs. Kirkpatrick\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking \nMember DeFazio, Subcommittee Chair Graves, and Subcommittee Ranking \nMember Holmes Norton for accepting my amendment on distracted driving.\n  Madam Chair, texting is an extremely dangerous activity as it \nrequires drivers to take their eyes, hands, and minds off the task of \ndriving. Drivers aged 16 to 24 have the highest propensity to text \nwhile driving. Cell phone conversations with handheld or hands-free \ndevices are dangerous as well, especially for young, novice drivers.\n  A Carnegie Mellon University study of MRIs shows that the area of the \nbrain responsible for processing moving visual information, a vital \npart of driving, has 37 percent less capacity when talking on the \nphone. A driver texting may miss seeing up to 50 percent of his or her \ndriving environment, even when looking through the windshield. This \nincludes stop signs, pedestrians, and red lights, according to the \nUniversity of Utah Applied Cognition Laboratory.\n  This simple, commonsense amendment ensures that States that have \nenacted texting and teen cell phone bans qualify for incentive grant \nfunding. This amendment will also allow additional States to qualify \nfor distracted driving incentive grant funding while maintaining the \ncore safety requirement of the grant.\n  The amendment has the support of AAA, Advocates for Highway and Auto \nSafety, Governors Highway Safety Association, MADD, the National Safety \nCouncil, and Safe Kids Worldwide.\n  We want to ensure that States that make necessary improvements to \ntheir distracted driving laws qualify for incentive grant funding.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndo not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, this amendment makes an important change to \nthe distracted driver incentive grant program that will ensure more \nStates can qualify for funding.\n  It is a good amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chairwoman, over the course of my \ncareer, one issue that has taken on tremendous importance to me is \nreducing the number of traffic fatalities that occur on our roads and \nhighways.\n  One of the ways we can keep making progress in this area is by \nfocusing on young drivers. As any parent with a teenaged child can tell \nyou, young people do not have the knowledge, experience, and maturity \nto drive safely 100 percent of the time, and that can have deadly \nconsequences for themselves and for others.\n  In 2013, more than 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving teen \ndrivers. For drivers aged 16 to 19, the fatal crash risk is three times \nhigher than for drivers over age 20.\n  My amendment will help reduce those risks by encouraging all 50 \nStates to adopt core graduated driver's license requirements that we \nknow will help keep teens safe as they learn to drive.\n  This amendment encourages States to enact meaningful requirements to \nhelp keep everyone safe on our roads. The amendment would require young \ndrivers to go through two stages of licensing, a learner's permit \nfollowed by an intermediate stage.\n  Drivers must have a learner's permit for at least 6 months. They have \nto pass vision and knowledge tests. They have to be supervised when \nthey drive. They have to gain 50 hours of experience behind the wheel, \nwith 10 of those hours at night.\n  They must be strictly prohibited from using a cell phone or other \ndevice while driving, as all drivers should be, regardless of age, \nbecause even the most experienced driver in the world becomes dangerous \nwhen they are texting or taking selfies behind the wheel of a car.\n  A learner who passes a driving test advances to the intermediate \nstage,\n\n[[Page H7599]]\n\nwhich lasts at least another 6 months. The cell phone ban remains in \nplace, and violating that restriction must be a primary offense.\n  Intermediate drivers cannot drive after 10 p.m., with reasonable \nexceptions. Eighty percent of crashes involving 16- and 17-year-old \ndrivers happen between 9 o'clock at night and midnight, and this \nrestriction reduces crashes by up to 60 percent during the overnight \nhours.\n  Intermediate drivers cannot have any drunk driving violations, fake \nID violations, reckless driving, failure to wear a seat belt, speeding, \nor other violations.\n  These are some of the very basic requirements that we know are \nnecessary to help keep young people safe as they learn how to drive. \nThis should be the law in every American State.\n  My amendment helps move us toward that goal by providing grant \nfunding to States that adopt and implement these requirements in full.\n  I want to note that this amendment is supported by the National \nSafety Council, as well as AAA, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, \nthe Governors Highway Safety Association, Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving, and Safe Kids Worldwide.\n  The language in this amendment is the same as the language in the \nDRIVE Act, which passed in the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I believe it deserves the same bipartisan support in the House. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, this amendment would actually gut the \nreforms in this bill that ensures more States with graduated driver's \nlicense programs can qualify for these important safety grant funding \nprograms.\n  MAP-21 established an incentive grant program to improve teen driver \nsafety by encouraging States to adopt graduated driver's license \nprograms. Unfortunately, the Federal requirements for the program were \ntoo prescriptive, which happens so many times we put out something. As \na result, over 40 States have graduated driver's license programs in \nplace today. None of them qualified for grant funds in 2014.\n  The STRR Act reforms the Federal requirements and ensures more States \nwill qualify for funding.\n  This amendment does little to reform the Federal requirements. Few, \nif any, States will qualify for funds if this amendment passes.\n  I urge all my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Madam Chairwoman, I ask the Chairman if he \nwould be willing to work with us in conference on this.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I would be glad to continue to work with \nthe gentlewoman on this. The issue is important. Again, I think we have \nreforms in here. We would love to work with the gentlewoman and move \nthis forward to make sure that these reforms get into place when we \nhave a final bill on the floor.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Chair understands that amendment No. 25 will not be offered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 26 Offered by Mr. Duncan of Tennessee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 26 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SAFETY STUDY REGARDING DOUBLE-DECKER MOTORCOACHES.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with State transportation safety officials, \n     shall conduct a study regarding the safety operations, fire \n     suppression capability, tire loads, and pavement impacts of \n     operating a double-decker motorcoach equipped with a device \n     designed by the motorcoach manufacturer to attach to the rear \n     of the motorcoach for use in transporting passenger baggage.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report \n     containing the results of the study to--\n       (1) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \n     the House of Representatives; and\n       (2) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     of the Senate.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Madam Chairman, my amendment requires the \nDepartment of Transportation to conduct a study on the operations of a \ndouble-decker motorcoach equipped with a luggage carrier on the rear of \nthe vehicle. The Department of Transportation will be required to \nreport its findings back to the Congress 60 days after the enactment of \nthe bill.\n  Federal law does not limit the length of buses but provides that \nStates cannot limit buses to less than 45 feet. A majority, but not \nall, States adopted laws providing for a 45-foot maximum limit for \nbuses years ago when all intercity buses were no longer than that \nlength. However, the 45-foot limits in these States effectively \nprecludes the attachment of a luggage carrier, known commonly as a \nluggage box, to the back of modern double-decker intercity motorcoaches \nof the sort now used by several intercity bus companies because the \nluggage boxes extend the bus by about 2 feet and several inches over \nthe 45-foot limit.\n  Luggage boxes have been in use, Madam Chairwoman, for many years in \nEurope, where they are used by over 600 bus operators. They are also \ncurrently in use in Florida and Georgia, neither of which State has a \n45-foot bus length limit. Even with the luggage box, these buses are \nmuch shorter than most truck-trailer combinations.\n  Further, an intensive study undertaken by two respected ex-NHTSA \nengineers last year has confirmed that the luggage box poses no hazard \nto the bus, its passengers, or highway safety. In fact, no Federal or \nState vehicle safety agency has raised any objection to the use of the \nluggage box.\n  While there is no evidence that the use of these luggage boxes is \nunsafe, I do think we would benefit from an independent study by the \nDepartment of Transportation so everyone will be completely assured \nthat there is no safety risk involved in these luggage boxes at all.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this very minor amendment to have \nthe Department of Transportation conduct this study.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I congratulate the gentleman on his \namendment. I think that this will help provide us with more factual \nknowledge in terms of looking at any future changes as might relate to \nthese sorts of buses and also will provide useful information to \nconsumers. I think it is very well thought out, and I congratulate the \ngentleman. I urge support of the amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I certainly appreciate that \nsupport from the ranking member, Mr. DeFazio. I urge passage of this \namendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 27 Offered by Mrs. Comstock\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Virginia.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment, \nwhich incorporates important provisions from a bill of mine, H.R. 3585, \nthe Surface Transportation Research and Development Act of 2015.\n  I appreciate that I serve on two committees that are very important \nto my district: the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and \nthe Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. I am also honored to \nchair the Subcommittee on Research and Technology, which came together \nto pass this measure.\n  This amendment, which consists of parts of this bill, is common sense \nand bipartisan. It provides for more and better solutions to ease \ntraffic congestion and provide key research for transportation.\n  The first part of the amendment further clarifies language in the \nunderlying bill regarding universities' abilities to submit grant \napplications for the University Transportation Centers program as \neither the lead or partnering applicant. This provides more \nuniversities the opportunity to seek these funds.\n  The second part directs the Secretary of Transportation to develop a \n5-year Strategic Plan for Transportation Research and Development.\n  The third part of the amendment covers an issue that will be \nappreciated by Members representing urban and suburban areas of the \ncountry, and that is traffic congestion. It provides authority for the \nTransportation Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology to \nconduct research to reduce traffic congestion.\n  That research would ask the Assistant Secretary to:\n  First, help accelerate the adoption of transportation management \nsystems that allow traffic better to flow in safe and more efficient \nways;\n  Second, to assess traffic, transit, and freight data from various \nsources;\n  Third, develop and disseminate strategies to reduce congestion for \nhigh-density traffic regions; and\n  Fourth, to collaborate with other Federal, State, and local \ngovernments as well as industry and universities.\n  The fourth and final part of this amendment authorizes the Assistant \nSecretary to transmit a report to Congress on rail safety issues.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSmith), the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Chair, I support the amendment sponsored by\n\n[[Page H7601]]\n\nRepresentative Barbara Comstock, chair of the Subcommittee on Research \nand Technology of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and \nthe subcommittee's ranking minority member, Dan Lipinski.\n  The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has jurisdiction over \nresearch, development, and technology programs at the Department of \nTransportation. In anticipation of a House surface transportation \nauthorization bill, the committee exercised its jurisdiction with a \ntransportation research and development hearing in June. In September \nthe Subcommittee on Research and Technology marked up H.R. 3585, the \nSurface Transportation Research and Development Act of 2015.\n  It is essential that we find a way to maintain a healthy, substantive \nresearch base for America's transportation initiatives. We have to \nensure that Congress gets its priorities right and that taxpayers \nreceive maximum value for their hard-earned tax dollars. H.R. 3585 does \njust that. This makes the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's \njurisdiction over R programs at the Department of Transportation \nparticularly relevant.\n  Since the introduction and subsequent markup of the underlying bill, \nmembers and staff of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology \nhave worked closely with our counterparts on the House Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure to ensure inclusion of some of the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology's priorities into the \nhighway bill.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster for working with Congresswoman \nComstock and me in this venture.\n  I look forward to further discussions after the House passes this \nbill, as we continue to work cooperatively on policy deliberations and \nresolution of individual R provisions during the House-Senate \nconference.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Shuster for his support of this amendment, \nand I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for introducing the \nunderlying bill that has been put into this underlying bill as well.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I consume. I \nactually rise in support of the amendment, and I particularly want to \ncongratulate my colleague, Dan Lipinski, who serves on both the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, for his work on this amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member for his support \nof this amendment. I thank Chairwoman Comstock and Chairman Smith for \nworking with me and working together on this amendment.\n  The piece of the amendment that I want to address is the language \nbased on a small piece of the Future TRIP Act, which I introduced, \ncosponsored by Chairwoman Comstock, and that we passed in the \nSubcommittee on Research and Technology of the Committee on Science, \nSpace, and Technology. The gentlewoman is chair of that committee. I am \nranking member on that subcommittee.\n  The language in this amendment from my bill calls for a regional \ntransportation center on connected vehicles and connected \ninfrastructure. Connected and autonomous vehicles hold enormous promise \nfor safe, efficient transportation. This research center could play a \nbig part in developing new technologies in this area, so I am very \npleased to have it included in this amendment.\n  The amendment also contains language from my bill in regard to \nUniversity Transportation Centers. It allows universities to lead one \nproposal for each type of center. It also permits universities to \ncollaborate on as many awards as they like, as long as they are not \nleading the proposal. This gives increased flexibility to those \nuniversities that have special expertise in this area.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their \nsupport in working with us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Madam Chairman, I thank Chairman Smith, and I thank \nRanking Member Lipinski for their support. I also thank Chairman \nShuster and our ranking member for working with us on this amendment. I \nurge passage of this amendment that will help bring our transportation \nsystem into the 21st century.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n\n                Amendment No. 28 Offered by Mr. Barletta\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR TOP FITTINGS PROTECTION FOR \n                   CLASS DOT-117R TANK CARS.\n\n       (a) Protective Housing.--Except as provided in subsections \n     (b) and (c), top fittings on DOT specification 117R tank cars \n     shall be located inside a protective housing not less than \n     \\1/2\\-inch in thickness and constructed of a material having \n     a tensile strength not less than 65 kilopound per square inch \n     and conform to the following specifications:\n       (1) The protective housing shall be as tall as the tallest \n     valve or fitting involved and the height of a valve or \n     fitting within the protective housing must be kept to the \n     minimum compatible with their proper operation.\n       (2) The protective housing or cover may not reduce the flow \n     capacity of the pressure relief device below the minimum \n     required.\n       (3) The protective housing shall provide a means of \n     drainage with a minimum flow area equivalent to six 1-inch \n     diameter holes.\n       (4) When connected to the nozzle or fittings cover plate \n     and subject to a horizontal force applied perpendicular to \n     and uniformly over the projected plane of the protective \n     housing, the tensile connection strength of the protective \n     housing shall be designed to be--\n       (A) no greater than 70 percent of the nozzle to tank \n     tensile connection strength;\n       (B) no greater than 70 percent of the cover plate to nozzle \n     connection strength; and\n       (C) no less than either 40 percent of the nozzle to tank \n     tensile connection strength or the shear strength of twenty \n     \\1/2\\-inch bolts.\n       (b) Pressure Relief Devices.--\n       (1) The pressure relief device shall be located inside the \n     protective housing, unless space does not permit. If multiple \n     pressure relief devices are equipped, no more than 1 may be \n     located outside of a protective housing.\n       (2) The highest point on any pressure relief device located \n     outside of a protective housing may not be more than 12 \n     inches above the tank jacket.\n       (3) The highest point on the closure of any unused pressure \n     relief device nozzle may not be more than 6 inches above the \n     tank jacket.\n       (c) Alternative Protection.--As an alternative to the \n     protective housing requirements in subsection (a) of this \n     section, the tank car may be equipped with a system that \n     prevents the release of product from any top fitting in the \n     case of an incident where any top fitting would be sheared \n     off.\n       (d) Implementation.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to require the Secretary to issue regulations to \n     implement this section.\n       (e) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall prohibit \n     the Secretary from approving new technologies, methods or \n     requirements that provide a level of safety equivalent to or \n     greater than the level of safety provided for in this \n     section.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Madam Chairwoman, I am offering an amendment to make \nthe transportation of crude oil by railroads safer.\n  My amendment would require all tank cars moving flammable liquids to \nbe retrofitted with new safety equipment. This is in addition to the \nstrong safety measures included in the Federal Rail Administration's \nrecent tank car rule.\n  The safety measures would place top-fitting protections on the tank \ncar. These top fittings protect the pressure relief valve, which \nprotects the integrity of a tank car.\n  The valve can slowly release the gases in the unlikely event that the\n\n[[Page H7602]]\n\ntank car is exposed to pressure buildup in a fire as a result of a \nderailment. This decreases the likelihood of a major incident and \nprovides first responders additional time.\n  The newer tank cars have this type of protection, but the majority of \nDOT 111 legacy tank cars do not have this enhanced protection. That is \nabout 50 percent of the expected retrofit tank car fleet, making this \nreform very important. A similar requirement was considered and \nrejected during the tank car rulemaking process due to cost-benefit \nconcerns.\n  This proposal is a less costly option that is supported by the \nAssociation of American Railroads, the American Chemistry Council, the \nRailway Supply Institute, the American Petroleum Institute, and the \nRenewable Fuels Association.\n  I am proud to offer this amendment to improve the safety of moving \ncrude oil by rail. This is an issue that is very important to \nPennsylvania.\n  I thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for working with \nme on this amendment. I also thank Mr. Lipinski for cosponsoring the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I rise to claim the time in opposition, \nalthough I am not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the two gentlemen involved for noting this deficiency in the \nrule. It is inexplicable to me that, although they certainly noted the \nneed in the new design to have a protective housing around the pressure \nrelief valve so they wouldn't shear off in a rollover accident, they \ndid not extend that to retrofitted cars. This amendment ensures that \nthey will meet those stronger standards. I think this amendment has \ntremendous merit.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Lipinski), the Democratic sponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I thank \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) for all his work on this \namendment. I rise in support of this amendment and ask my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Madam Chair, this amendment is common sense and will strengthen the \nDepartment of Transportation's tank car rule by providing all legacy \ntank cars retrofitted for class III flammable liquid service to include \nenhanced top fittings protections for pressure relief valves.\n  The pressure relief valve on a new tank car standard allows tank cars \nto vent gases to reduce the chance of a tank car rupturing from vapor \npressure, which can happen if it is heated after a derailment or an \naccident. However, this pressure relief valve is susceptible to damage \nin the event of an accident, as it can easily be torn off, thus \neliminating any safety benefit.\n  To mitigate this issue, this amendment would require the installation \nof a small, protective device that will help keep this valve in place \nafter an accident and save lives in the process.\n  This amendment is supported by the American Petroleum Institute, \nAssociation of American Railroads, the American Chemistry Council, and \nRenewable Fuels Association, and is something that has been called for \nby first responders who have a lot of these trains going through these \ndistricts.\n  I know it is very important to me in my district in the Chicagoland \narea. We are the rail hub of the Nation, with nearly 40 percent of \nAmerica's rail traffic flowing through, and my district is host to \ntrack owned by six out of the seven class I railroads.\n  More crude oil passes through Chicago than anywhere else in the \nNation, with upwards of 40-mile-long unit trains snaking through \nneighborhoods in the region each week, making them a common sight at \nthe 195 at-grade crossings in my district, a few of which are as close \nto within a mile of my own home.\n  While the energy renaissance has brought relief to many in the form \nof lower gas prices, it requires the use of rail to ensure that this \ncommodity is transported in the safest possible manner. This amendment \nmakes it even safer.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Madam Chairwoman, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 29 Offered by Mr. Lynch\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 29 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 573, after line 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7016. SAFETY OF PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n       The Secretary shall, at the request of a State or tribal \n     government, conduct a review of the safety and safety-related \n     aspects of a pipeline transportation infrastructure project.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, first of all, I want to come to the floor and \nsay thank you to Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their \ngreat work in bringing a long-term transportation bill to the floor.\n  They need to really be congratulated on the work that they have done \nin negotiating the finer points of this bill, which I think is nearly \nperfect, with one small flaw, which I will attempt to cure with my \namendment.\n  Madam Chair, in my district and in many districts across the United \nStates, we are dealing with a situation where high-pressure natural gas \nlines are being extended and expanded in some urban areas and some \nrural areas.\n  I have three areas in my district that are impacted severely in some \nrespects: the town of Dedham, the town of Weymouth, and the \nneighborhood of West Roxbury. I think the neighborhood of West Roxbury \noffers the most clear example of what my concern is.\n  In the neighborhood of West Roxbury, we have an active gravel quarry. \nIt is located a matter of yards away from a residential area. You could \nthrow a baseball from the blasting zone of the quarry to the \nresidential homes next door. You have got kids there. You have got \nschools there. It is a densely settled population there and is a \nbeautiful neighborhood.\n  FERC, in its wisdom, has authorized the placement of a high-pressure \ngas line that runs through the active blast zone adjacent to the \nresidential area where my constituents live and are raising their \nfamilies, where their kids go to bed at night. We cannot get entrance \ninto the process because FERC controls the whole process. They make \ntheir decision, and then, in your appeal, they get to review their own \ndecision.\n  So what this amendment would do in those situations--like the West \nRoxbury situation where you have a pipeline company putting in a high-\npressure gas line through an active blast zone next to a residential \narea--is to have an appeal process where the public safety officers of \nthe State could ask for a review on public safety grounds of that \ndecision of where to place that pipeline.\n  In all fairness to the community, they are just asking them to \nrelocate the pipeline out of the blast zone. It would seem to make \nsense that that would be a reasonable request. But I think, obviously, \nthe pipeline company is interested in reducing costs and delivering \ntheir product.\n  I am trying to intervene, as any Member of Congress would, just to \nget them to take a good, hard second look at this, a fresh set of eyes \non the request that the pipeline company has made and FERC has \nauthorized.\n  So that is the purpose of my amendment here. I am just trying to get \na fair hearing on this decision, which I think is a horrendous decision \nand may result in the loss of life here, if they are not careful. We \ndon't have much of a buffer zone between the pipeline, the quarry, and \nthe homes where the people live.\n\n[[Page H7603]]\n\n  That is the purpose of my amendment. I am urging my colleagues here \nto consider themselves being in my position, trying to defend your \nconstituents from a palpable danger, hoping that this body would \nrecognize the wisdom in having a real appeal process.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I certainly understand where the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts is coming from. I don't know all the details, but it \nsounds troubling.\n  His amendment, as it is written, would go far beyond the mandate by \ninserting PHMSA into the approval process to construct a pipeline at \nthe request of a State or tribe. This could significantly slow down \nconstruction to complete some of these pipelines around the country or \neven to start them.\n  Pipelines are extremely safe. Again, I understand and empathize with \nthe gentleman and the situation he is talking about, but pipelines \ncarry 99.997 percent of all hazardous material safely to their \ndestination. Again, we need to make sure PHMSA's scarce resources are \nfocused on its mission to ensure pipelines are operated and maintained \nsafely.\n  This is a time where the country desperately needs to get more \npipeline. The gentleman's amendment is just too broadly written, and \nthe unintended consequences would go far beyond what he is talking \nabout.\n  So I would have to vote in opposition to his amendment, but I \ncertainly would like to help the gentleman, if I can, if it is a \nsituation where we can be of any help to him. But this amendment is too \nbroadly written. So I would oppose it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, can I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, we do have a pipeline safety bill that is \ncoming up later in the session. So I would appreciate the opportunity \nto work with the chairman to try to address that.\n  But I do want to remind him that these are very, very unique \nsituations. You don't have many cases where you have a high-pressure \ngas line being put through a blast zone adjacent to residential homes.\n  So this is a special danger, and it would require that special danger \nto exist before the State could take action. We are only asking for \nextra review.\n  I would remind the Members that there was a tragic incident in 2010 \nin San Bruno, California, where 8 people were killed and 38 homes were \ndestroyed during a Pacific Gas and Electric natural gas line pipe \nexplosion. That is what I am trying to prevent.\n  This is a rare situation. I realize you have got to build pipelines, \nbut I think you ought to be able to do it without, as I have said \nbefore multiple times, putting a pipeline through a blast zone adjacent \nto residential homes. I think you can find another route that wouldn't \ngo through that blast zone. It is the one quarry I have got in my \ndistrict, and they chose to go right through it.\n  I know the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I know the hard work he has \nput into this bill. I am just looking for some relief for people that I \ncare about. I am very fearful of the consequences if this is allowed to \ncontinue.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nMassachusetts will be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 30 Offered by Mr. Lewis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 30 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 36, after line 23, insert the following (and \n     redesignate accordingly):\n       ``(12) Planning, design, or construction of a Type II noise \n     barrier (as described in section 772.5 of title 23, Code of \n     Federal Regulations).''.\n       Page 38, line 7, strike ``(11)'' and insert ``(12)''.\n       Page 47, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (8) National highway system designation act.--Section 339 \n     of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (23 \n     U.S.C. 106 note) is amended--\n       (A) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (B) by redesignating subsections (c) through (j) as \n     subsections (b) through (i), respectively.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. LEWIS. Madam Chair, I appreciate the chairman and the ranking \nmember's hard work on this bill.\n  I rise to offer an amendment that is very important to the people of \nmetro Atlanta. My amendment would allow Federal funds from the Surface \nTransportation Block Grant Program to be used to construct type II \nnoise barriers. These are barriers built to cut down noise along \nexisting highways.\n  Current Federal law ties the hands of State transportation agencies. \nIt limits their ability to address key quality-of-life concerns in the \nplanning process.\n  Madam Chair, my office has been working with the Georgia Department \nof Transportation for years to address these concerns. Many communities \nin metro Atlanta are tired of the noise and just want some peace and \nquiet. We are ready to move forward, but we need Congress to untie our \nhands.\n  My amendment does not cost one cent, not one dime. If anything, it \nimproves the effectiveness of the money we already send to the States.\n  It does not require that States build these barriers; instead, it \nallows them the flexibility they need to minimize Federal funds, to \nraise property values, and to improve the quality of life in frustrated \ncommunities across America. Madam Chair, we have the opportunity to do \nsomething that would make our citizens' lives better.\n  Living next to a loud highway can be a headache. When you have a good \nand quiet neighborhood, when you can get some sleep, you can be happy. \nI urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The prohibition on installing noise barriers on existing roads is put \nin place for a reason. Residents and businesses that have coexisted \nwith highways for years, or even decades, should not be entitled to \nnoise barriers. People built their houses, built their businesses.\n  I understand there is increased traffic, certainly here in the \nWashington, D.C., area; but these noise barriers should be reserved for \nnew highways or a significant highway expansion as a result of changing \nconditions in the neighborhoods.\n  Again, if a homebuilder is willing to build his house next to a \nhighway or an airport, they know what the consequences are; and to have \nto put this burden on the taxpayers just is something that I don't \nbelieve is fair. Given that we have limited resources, funding should \nbe reserved for highway and bridge construction, and not used for noise \nbarriers on existing roads.\n  Again, if people have been there, then it is up to the local folks, \nit is up to the developer if they are building a development along that \nroad to pay that bill, and again, not the taxpayer. So I oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I would suggest that I would like to \ncontinue\n\n[[Page H7604]]\n\nthe discussion. I think there are different conditions.\n  Certainly if a developer buys a large tract of land next to an \nexisting interstate and then expects the taxpayers to pay for sound \nprotection, that is not right. But I think there are cases where you \nhave found that a lot of interstates were built in areas where there \nwasn't a lot of traffic. The houses have been there for quite some \ntime, and now the traffic has grown phenomenally, particularly truck \ntraffic and things that create more noise. I think there may be a way \nto do it in certain circumstances where it is merited, where it isn't \ndue to new development but due to growth and traffic and noise and \nthat.\n  I don't know if the chairman has considered that.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I think the gentleman from Oregon has a reasonable \nargument. I think those things do occur, and that would be something I \nwould continue to work with him and work in the future on as we move \nforward on this.\n  As the amendment stands right now, I would have to oppose it. But I \nam fully willing to accept what the gentleman from Oregon says and work \nwith him, and I have great respect for the gentleman from Georgia.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Madam Chair, with the discussion and the words of the \nchairman and the ranking member, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 31 Offered by Mr. Takano\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 31 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 68, after line 21, insert the following:\n       ``(3) Special rule.--The Secretary may treat a program of \n     eligible projects as a single project for purposes of meeting \n     the requirement of paragraph (1)(B)(i).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, the Nationally Significant Freight and \nHighway Projects program in this bill will address critical \ninfrastructure needs that will improve America's economic \ncompetitiveness, but will also bring tremendous benefit to our \ncommunities, especially districts like mine, which is the epicenter of \nthe international supply chain flowing through the Ports of L.A. and \nLong Beach.\n  Freight corridors that run through districts such as mine, and those \nin Chicago, Houston, Florida, Charleston, New York, New Jersey, and \nSeattle, bring jobs and spur economic growth. However, they also create \ncongestion, pollution, and safety concerns.\n  One of the primary strategies to alleviate these issues--congestion, \nair pollution, and accidents--is to build rail grade separations that \nallow trains and cars to flow freely. In fact, grade separations are \nexplicitly mentioned in the bill as eligible to receive funding from \nthe Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects program. \nHowever, the $100 million threshold far exceeds the cost of most grade \nseparation projects.\n  To better achieve the intent of this bill, my amendment simply \nclarifies that a program of eligible projects, such as a corridor of \ngrade separations, be eligible to receive funding from this program.\n  There is ample legislative precedent for ``programs of projects'' to \nbe eligible for funding, most notably, in the TIFIA loan program, the \nNational Highway Performance Program, and Highway Safety and \nImprovement Program.\n  This amendment recognizes that addressing nationally significant \ntransportation challenges are not always best addressed through one \nmajor project but, instead, a comprehensive package of related projects \nthat achieve a meaningful national objective.\n  An example of this type of project is the Alameda Corridor-East, \nwhich was first recognized 10 years ago by this House in SAFETEA-LU. \nThe Alameda Corridor-East was designated as a Project of National and \nRegional Significance, spanning four counties in the Nation's largest \nurban area, stretching over 100 miles of rail.\n  In my county alone, Riverside County, this Federal funding, in \npartnership with local self-help tax dollars, has made possible nearly \na half billion dollars in freight projects that are cleaning our air, \nmaking our constituents safer, and making the national economy more \nefficient. However, of these 16 projects on the same corridor, the \nhighest cost project was $67 million. Yet, together, they have had a \ntremendous impact on the transportation system.\n  My amendment ensures that this momentum can continue, not just in my \ndistrict, but in all communities that are impacted by our national \nfreight system. This is an easy technical fix, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. The Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects \nprogram is the core reform, a new program in this bill. It is \nfundamental to this bill's redirecting us back to our national \ninterests on these freight corridors and these major projects.\n  Allowing a group of small projects to count toward the $100 million \nthreshold for eligibility would actually destroy the very purpose of \nthe program, to provide funding for large-scale projects, that is, \nlarge-scale projects that States cannot fund with their $4 million that \nthey get.\n  In our bill, it is very different from what the Senate bill does. The \nSenate bill puts it out in formula. That is not going to solve the \nproblem. This program will solve some of those problems that States \ncannot fund with, again, the money that is coming from their formulas.\n  Many bridge projects, for example, fall under this category, as do \nlarge highway expansion projects. The only exception is a 10 percent \nset-aside for smaller freight projects with an impact on interstate \ncommerce.\n  Again, the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects \nprogram in this bill was carefully crafted and negotiated with our \nranking member and the folks on the other side of the aisle, and we \nbelieve the program is properly structured. So, again, I would oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Aguilar).\n  Mr. AGUILAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, today I rise in support of my fellow Inland Empire \ncolleague, Mr. Takano's amendment to the surface transportation bill, \nwhich would clarify project eligibility under the Nationally \nSignificant Freight and Highway Projects program.\n  Improving our roads, rails, and bridges is crucial for the Inland \nEmpire, a region of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties that \nCongressman Takano and I represent.\n  Working families need reliable transportation and infrastructure to \nget to and from work, to get their children to school, and to have the \nability to play a role in our regional, State, and national economies.\n  This amendment would allow more local projects to meet that $100 \nmillion threshold to qualify for the Nationally Significant Freight and \nHighway Projects program that otherwise wouldn't meet the requirements \nand would be excluded from Federal funding.\n  The Valley Boulevard grade separation in Colton is just one program \nin San Bernardino County that would benefit directly from this project, \none of many throughout California and the Nation.\n  This amendment would help San Bernardino and Riverside County \nresidents, as well as millions of working families and public safety \nofficials who\n\n[[Page H7605]]\n\nrequire the grade separations throughout our country, who rely on \ntransportation and infrastructure each and every day.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I will just again say I know where the \ngentlemen are coming from. I have not been there once. I have not been \nthere twice. I have been there several times.\n  Southern California has got every known problem in the transportation \nworld because of the congestion, your ports. It is an important part of \nthe country, but, again, this Nationally Significant Freight and \nHighway Projects program was carefully crafted to make sure that there \nare other places in the country that we can get those projects.\n  Cobbling together a couple of smaller ones is really going to take \naway from the focus of this program and the focus of this bill, to try \nto get us looking back at what our national priorities are, when that \nhas to be moving freight.\n  One of those key places is the Port of Los Angeles, Long Beach, but \nthere are places around the country, and we think this program is going \nto be able to address those with large sums of money, not bits and \npieces flowing out there.\n  So again, at this time, I understand where you are coming from. I \nhave been there. I understand the problems in southern California, but \nI would have to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I appreciate the sentiment of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania, that he has been to our region and understands the \nimportance of making sure that freight through rail is moved \nexpeditiously.\n  I do urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I wish that the \ngentleman would have a change of heart.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 32 Offered by Ms. Brownley of California\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 70, line 24, strike ``10 percent'' and insert ``20 \n     percent''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Brownley) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Madam Chair, I would like to begin by \nthanking the chairmen and ranking members of the full committee and the \nsubcommittee for their work on this bipartisan bill.\n  I worked very hard to become a member of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee because I wanted very much to be part of a \nteam that gets things done.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  When I first joined the committee, many of my constituents back in \nVentura County questioned whether the 114th Congress could get a \nsurface transportation bill through the House.\n  The progress that we have made so far on the bill is a testament to \nthe good work that Congress can do when we work together in a \nbipartisan way, through the committee process, to get things done for \nthe American people. I am also very appreciative of the Rules Committee \nfor making my amendment in order this evening.\n  Madam Chair, my amendment would fix a small problem with the new \nfreight program and would allow small- and mid-sized communities an \nopportunity to compete for a slightly larger piece of the pie.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that we absolutely must address \ncapacity issues along long-haul routes and freight corridors. We must \naddress the costly and time-consuming bottlenecks within congested \nmetropolitan areas. We must also address the first- and last-mile \nconnections to our ports, freight yards, and other job centers in our \ncommunities.\n  However, Madam Chair, I am concerned that the freight program created \nin this bill includes a minimum project threshold of $100 million. Let \nme repeat: $100 million is the minimum threshold. Many of us represent \nsmall- and mid-sized communities.\n  In my district of Ventura County, we have struggled over the past few \nyears to address freight bottlenecks in our community, including along \nRice Avenue, where we have seen far too many deadly accidents in recent \nyears.\n  But as this bill is currently drafted, Ventura County and many other \nsmall- and mid-sized communities across the country won't be able to \nfully compete for the freight program. We just don't have the resources \nback home to compete with these large projects.\n  But that doesn't mean that we don't have freight bottlenecks. All \nthat I am seeking is to ensure that small- and mid-sized communities \nlike my county, Ventura County, can better compete.\n  Madam Chairman, my simple amendment would increase the small project \nset-aside from 10 percent to 20 percent of the available resources to \nallow more communities across the country to compete for these limited \nresources. The small project threshold is $5 million or more.\n  My amendment will still leave 80 percent of the money for larger \nprojects. Increasing the small project set-aside will not guarantee \nfunds for any specific project, but it will give many of our districts \nat least a fighting chance to compete for one-fifth of the funds under \nthe new freight program.\n  Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, let me say first to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia thank you for your valuable contribution in putting this \nbill together and your hard work in committee. We thank you for that. \nYou played an important role in developing this bill.\n  Once again, the Nationally Significant Freight and Highways Projects \nprogram in the bill was carefully crafted. We do have a 10 percent set-\naside, as you mentioned, for some of these smaller programs and \nprojects, but the idea is to really have these large projects. Let's \nfocus on them.\n  Once again, in southern California and that region, you have numerous \nprojects there that are going to far exceed $100 million. Around the \ncountry, whether it is in Texas or in New Jersey or in New York, we \nhave got these projects. We believe that we have crafted this to be \nable to really get those dollars to those projects to be able to move \nthem forward.\n  Again, just like the last amendment, if you cobble together a couple \nof smaller ones, then you take away money for smaller projects. Then we \nare not going to get the impact that we need.\n  So, again, I appreciate the gentlewoman's passion, and I appreciate \nher work on the committee. But at this time, I have to oppose the \namendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Madam Chair, I will close. I just would \nlike to reiterate that my amendment will simply increase the small \nproject set-aside, which will leave 80 percent of the limited funds in \nthe program for large projects.\n  This is allowing the large projects to win. A small project may not \nwin at all, but it is just giving us, the small- and mid-sized \ncommunities, an opportunity to compete.\n  Again, for many, many districts, $100 million is just an \ninsurmountable sum, but we can and want to compete under the freight \nprogram for very important projects.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for all of his work on this important \nbill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n\n[[Page H7606]]\n\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 33 Offered by Mr. Costello\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 33 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 71, line 2, strike ``(i)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, I rise to ask for a simple bipartisan amendment along \nwith my fellow Transportation and Infrastructure Committee member, \nRepresentative Dan Lipinski of Illinois.\n  This amendment would make a minor modification to the Nationally \nSignificant Freight and Highway Projects grant program. This amendment \nwould not change any dollar threshold or increase funding to the \nprogram, nor would it increase the cost of the overall bill.\n  Under the program set forth in the bill, large grants, as they are \ndefined, meaning those in excess of $100 million, are eligible for four \ntypes of programs: one, freight projects on the National Highway \nFreight Network; two, highway or bridge projects on the National \nHighway System; three, intermodal or freight rail projects on the \nNational Multimodal Freight Network; and, four, railway-highway grade \ncrossings and grade separations.\n  However, the bill sets aside 10 percent of program funding for small \nprojects defined as those projects that are less than $100 million. \nHowever, the bill only allows one of the previously mentioned four \nprograms, freight projects on the National Highway Freight Network, to \nbe eligible for this reserved small project funding.\n  Madam Chair, in my home State of Pennsylvania, the structural \nintegrity of our aging bridges and roadways is a major concern of my \nconstituents and a personal priority of mine. I seek to add the other \nthree programs to be eligible under the small projects definition.\n  So I ask: Should a $50 or $95 million project to restore a crumbling \nbridge have less of a shot at program funding than a $100 million \nproject? Or for the 55 short-line railroads in Pennsylvania, including \nthree in my district, if they would otherwise be eligible for program \nfunding to improve roadway grade separations, why should they not be \neligible to compete for those dollars set forth for small projects?\n  Madam Chair, this amendment addresses this discrepancy.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time \nin opposition, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, this is a very meritorious amendment offered by the \ngentleman. It provides flexibility for small projects under the \nNationally Significant Freight and Highways Projects program.\n  Rather than only highway freight, States and localities will be able \nto apply for funds to carry out a variety of project types, such as \nhighways, bridges, intermodal, freight rail, and grade crossings.\n  This is giving more control to local governments to do the most cost-\neffective solutions to their problems that they know best. So I think \nit has great merit. I support it and recommend our colleagues support \nit.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I urge support for this \nmeritorious amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 34 Offered by Mrs. Radewagen\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 34 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 74, after line 15, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 1112A. TERRITORIAL HIGHWAY PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 165(c) of title 23, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) Division of funds between territories.--In carrying \n     out this subsection, the Secretary shall allocate the funds \n     made available to the territories each fiscal year among the \n     territories according to quantifiable measures that are \n     indicative of the surface transportation requirements of each \n     of the territories, which may include the use of population, \n     land area, roadway mileage, or another measure determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from American Samoa.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Chair, the amendment that I am offering \ntogether with my colleague from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. \nSablan) brings rationality and logic to the allocation of Territorial \nHighway Program funds among the four smaller U.S. territories. At \npresent, these funds are simply allocated as the Department of \nTransportation sees fit using a formula set back in 1992, I understand.\n  That system may have been okay for the last 23 years, but now that I \nam representing the people of American Samoa, I want to be sure that \nFederal funds are distributed among the territories in a way that has \nsome rational basis.\n  I cannot say to my constituents that we just have to live with the \nway things have always been done. I want to say to them that the \nassistance we get from the Federal Government is based on our real \nneeds.\n  Madam Chair, I also believe that my constituents deserve to have \ntheir elected representative participate in decisions like the \ndistribution of highway funds. We elected no one at the Department of \nTransportation where the decision is now made.\n  The amendment that I am offering, however, does not override the \nexperts at the Department. The amendment simply instructs the experts \nto use the data they have to set up an allocation based on objective, \nquantifiable measures that apply to all the territories.\n  If it turns out that American Samoa gets less as a result of that, so \nbe it. Whether it is road distance or traffic volume--whatever it may \nbe--let the Department ground its decision in some transportation \nreality. That would be a responsible use of Federal dollars.\n  Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I certainly am sympathetic. I have heard \nfrom all of the territories throughout this process, and because of the \npaucity of funding in this bill, the funding to the territories, no \nmatter what formula you use, is inadequate to the growth and the \nproblems that they are experiencing.\n\n[[Page H7607]]\n\n  I am not opposed to the idea of developing and updating statistical \nmeasures to target the limited funds. My preference would be there \nwould be more funds.\n  This funding formula was set in 1992 by the Federal Highway \nAdministration. They included consideration of population, land area, \nand road mileage of each of the four covered territories.\n  Based on that review, they came up with these allocations--obviously, \nthat was 23 years ago--40 percent each to Guam and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands and 10 percent to American Samoa and Northern Mariana Islands.\n  Before we unilaterally take steps to change the formula that has been \nin place for two decades, I think we need to hear from the delegates of \nall four. I have been contacted by the other two territories that would \nbe impacted who are strongly opposed, and I would certainly like to \nwork with the gentlewoman and all of the delegates to see what we could \ndo to have a fair and balanced update of the formula.\n  Again, formulas are some of the most tricky things around here. You \nchange just one factor and you get dramatic differences at the other \nend. So we would have to first agree on criteria and proper factors and \nthen direct the FHWA to run those numbers.\n  So, Madam Chair, I reluctantly rise in opposition and urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan).\n  Mr. SABLAN. Madam Chair, let me make one thing very clear. The \namendment that the distinguished lady from American Samoa and I have \nintroduced does not change the formula.\n  But I also want to take the time to thank Chairman Shuster and \nRanking Member DeFazio and all the committee members who worked \ntogether successfully to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  I want to thank the committee, also, for deciding to increase funding \nfor the Territorial Highway Program from $40 million to $42 million per \nyear.\n  The territories are some of the poorest parts of our country. We face \na financial challenge providing transportation on separate islands and \nfrom one island to another island. I think the only territory that \ndoesn't have to do that is the southernmost territory in the Mariana \nIslands.\n  We are grateful for the assistance we receive from our fellow \nAmericans. It is in the spirit of bipartisanship and with a deep \nrespect for the wise use of Federal funds that Congressman Radewagen of \nAmerican Samoa and I are offering the amendment at the desk.\n  The amendment simply requires the Department of Transportation to use \nsome rational basis for allocating the Territorial Highway Program \nfunds among the territories.\n  Currently, the Department is on autopilot. It uses a fixed allocation \nit devised back in 1992 and has continued to use ever since, without \nthinking about any changes that have occurred in the last 23 years.\n  I believe that Federal dollars should not be spent willy-nilly. There \nshould be some connection with the needs on the ground.\n  I would like to make clear that this amendment does not slice up the \npie to take money from one area and give it to another. In fact, thanks \nto the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the pie is actually \ngetting a little larger.\n  Our amendment does not even specify what objective measures the \nDepartment uses in allocating the territorial funds. It could be road \ndistance, traffic volume, population, land area, or a combination, as \nlong as the decision is based on some concrete reality related to \nhighways.\n  We think that linking the dollars to the need is simply good \nstewardship of Federal resources and American taxpayers' money. We hope \nthat the House agrees to this responsible approach and agrees to this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Chair, I want to thank the chairman and the \ncommittee for their consideration.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from American \nSamoa will be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 35 Offered by Ms. Edwards\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 110, strike lines 3 and 4 and insert the following:\n\n       ``(I) improve the reliance and reliability of the \n     transportation system and reduce or mitigate stormwater \n     impacts of surface transportation; and''.\n\n       Page 113, strike lines 22 and 23 and insert the following:\n\n       ``(I) improve the reliance and reliability of the \n     transportation system and reduce or mitigate stormwater \n     impacts of surface transportation; and''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Edwards) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maryland.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Madam Chair, the amendment at the desk is consistent \nwith the streamlining effort that has already been underway in this \nbill.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio because \nthey have put in yeoman's work to make this a bipartisan effort.\n  Ultimately, my amendment will reduce the overall cost of projects and \nthe need for mitigation. If implemented, it will save money.\n  As we know all too well, highway storm water is a growing threat to \nwater quality, aquatic ecosystems, and the fish and wildlife that \ndepend on the health of these ecosystems. Moreover, the high volumes \nand rapid flow of storm water runoff from highways and roads poses a \nserious threat to the condition of our Nation's water and \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  Impervious surfaces create rapidly moving high volumes of untreated \npolluted storm water that rush off road surfaces, erode unnatural \nchannels next to and ultimately underneath roadways compromising the \nintegrity of roadway infrastructure, and increase the stress on storm \nwater sewer systems, shortening the life of all of this infrastructure.\n  The total coverage of impervious surfaces in an area is usually \nexpressed as a percentage of the total land area. According to the \nChesapeake Bay program, impervious surfaces compose roughly 17 percent \nof all urban and suburban lands in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The \ngreatest concentration of impervious surfaces in the bay watershed is \nthe Baltimore-Washington metropolitan areas of D.C., Maryland, and \nVirginia. In fact, the Virginia Tidewater area, Philadelphia's western \nsuburbs, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, are also regions in our watershed \nwhere impervious surfaces are greater than 10 percent of the total land \narea.\n  While there are serious water quality concerns with not adequately \ncontrolling roadway infrastructure runoff, there are also serious \ninfrastructure costs that are ultimately passed on to taxpayers and \nratepayers. These can be avoided if transportation authorities do more \nto control and manage storm water runoff with the infrastructure assets \nthey plan and manage.\n  The aim of the amendment, of course, is to improve highway design to \nbetter manage storm water to avoid the costly damage that poorly \nmanaged storm water causes, and to move this up in the planning process \nso that thought goes in at the beginning how best to plan, design, and \nconstruct effectively, while also reducing costs. Now, that work is \ndone near the end of the process, where mitigation is often used and \ncosts are much higher.\n  My amendment would simply move up the consideration of storm water \nissues in statewide and metropolitan\n\n[[Page H7608]]\n\nplanning. Specifically, it would require consideration of projects and \nstrategies that will improve the resiliency and reliability of the \ntransportation system and reduce or mitigate storm water impacts on \nsurface transportation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to address the problem \nthat is facing America's waterways and infrastructure, and to do that \nearly in the planning, which is more efficient and less costly.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, even though \nI am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 36 Offered by Mr. Calvert\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 36 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 164, line 8, strike ``up to 10'' and insert ``up to \n     25''.\n       Page 164, line 10, strike ``up to 10'' and insert ``up to \n     25''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, the highway bill, crafted by my friends, \nChairman Bill Shuster and Ranking Member Peter DeFazio and the rest of \nour colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \ncontains a number of important reforms to our highway programs that \nwill benefit commuters across this country.\n  One of those provisions, section 1313, establishes a pilot program \nthat would allow States to conduct environmental reviews and make \napprovals for projects under State environmental laws and regulations \ninstead of Federal laws and regulations. It is expected that this pilot \nprogram will save highway projects time and money, while maintaining \nthe same environmental standards.\n  The bill permits the State to designate 10 local governments to \nadminister local projects under the new pilot program. However, for \nlarge States like California, New York, Texas, and Florida, limiting \nthe program to 10 localities is simply not enough. My amendment would \nincrease the allowable number of localities to 25 in order to allow \nmore communities to take advantage of bringing down the cost and \nshrinking the amount of time required to complete highway projects.\n  The amendment is supported by the California State Association of \nCounties, local transit authorities, and CalTrans is not opposed.\n  We are well aware that our need for highway infrastructure continues \nto outpace the resources we have available. That is exactly why we need \nto support efforts like my amendment that can make more highway \nprojects a reality by bringing their costs down and completing them \nmore quickly.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment which will help our \ncommunities, counties, and commuters.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, we are in the middle of a healthy and \nbipartisan debate on the highway bill. This is an important process, \nand I am encouraged by the enthusiasm of all Members' participation.\n  I am encouraged, all right.\n  While we rarely schedule votes later than 7 p.m., Members are advised \nthat due to the number of amendments expected to be considered, it is \nlikely we will need to vote late tomorrow evening. Members should be \nprepared for both late and multiple votes series tomorrow night.\n  Members are further advised to expect a full day on Thursday as we \nwill not leave until the House completes its work for the week.\n  Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As a former majority leader, I want to tell my friend that the \nenthusiasm of the Members for late nights has a very short fuse, but I \nappreciate his efforts.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Well, I do thank the gentleman from Maryland. We are \ninto the process of regular order and giving feedback for everybody \nhaving an amendment.\n  Tonight's work has gone very fast, faster than we expected. I did not \nwant to keep people too late, but I do expect tomorrow night will very \nlikely be a late night and a multiple series.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of Georgia).

It is now in order to consider \namendment No. 37 printed in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 226, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     ``Honey Bees.--'' on line 13 of page 227.\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri.\n\n\n           Modification to Amendment Offered by Mrs. Hartzler\n\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe modified in the form I have placed at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n  Modification to amendment offered by Mrs. Hartzler:\n\n       Page 226, strike lines 13 through 21 and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Use of funds under chapter 1 programs.--Section 319 of \n     title 23, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 319.

Encouragement of pollinator habitat and forage development and \n              protection on transportation rights-of-way.''.\n\n  Mrs. HARTZLER (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading of the modification.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, my amendment gets our priorities right in \nour highway funding by prohibiting Federal funds from being used for \nlandscaping and scenic beautification on highway projects.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  We should spend our Federal highway dollars to improve our roads and \nbridges, not plant flowers.\n  From 1992 to 2013, over $1.3 billion was spent on landscaping and \nscenic beautification. With data showing over 61,000 bridges classified \nas structurally deficient and 65 percent of the roads in the United \nStates in less-than-good condition, this is outrageous.\n  I appreciate roadside landscaping, but given today's limited highway \ndollars, these initiatives are best left to volunteer organizations \nsuch as the popular Adopt-a-Highway program.\n  We must ensure that Federal funds are applied where they are needed \nmost, and that is upgrading and improving our National infrastructure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's concern about \nthe condition of our bridges, and I have spent, as I spoke earlier \ntonight, a lot of time on that issue and, in fact, opposed the so-\ncalled stimulus bill because of the lack of investment in \ninfrastructure, particularly bridges.\n  But in this case, I think perhaps there are some drafting errors in \nthe amendment because it would preclude using these funds for rest \nareas, which I think is problematic.\n  We have a crisis in terms of safe places for people to pull over, \nboth commercial truck drivers and individuals. So I assume that the \ngentlewoman did not mean to preclude the use for rest areas.\n  Also, I don't know Missouri well, but I know in the West, actually, \nwe have used these landscaping funds when we do new construction or \nsignificant construction to reduce maintenance costs because we have \nhigh wildfire danger in the West and, if you can plant, basically, \nnatives that will dominate, that are not tall, are not fire-prone, then \nyou don't have to go in and mow two or three times a year in case some \nidiot throws their cigarette or cigar out of the car and starts a \ncatastrophic forest fire.\n  So, actually, leaving the discretion to the States to use these funds \nin that way, depending upon their conditions, I think is important.\n  There have been a couple of instances in past bills where they went \noverboard with this kind of stuff. I think the current restrictions on \nthe program are such--and there is no mandate for the projects like \nresurfacing or anything else that is new construction. And doing it, as \nappropriate, to state ``and including rest areas.''\n  I think, because of all those things, I reluctantly oppose the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's concerns. I, \ntoo, share his concern. I want to make sure that rest areas are still \nallowed.\n  In fact, there is another provision in the code that does still allow \nand permit rest areas, for States to be able to build them. This \namendment does not address that section. So there still would be that \noption.\n  My amendment simply wants to make sure our highway tax dollars go \nwhere they are needed. This picture points out where they are needed \nand that 65 percent of our road system in our country now is in failing \nor is in bad condition.\n  In fact, there are many, many deaths caused every year due to the \ncrumbling of our highways. We also have 61,000 bridges that are \nconsidered structurally deficient.\n  So this makes sure that our dollars that the people spend every time \nthey go fill up their car with gas--that those highway road dollars \nwill go to roads and they are not going to go to highway \nbeautification.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Transportation disagrees. We sent \nthis language to them, and they said, yes, it appears, by repealing 23 \nUSC 319, the amendment would remove the Secretary's authority to \napprove, as part of the construction of Federal aid highways, the costs \nof landscape and roadside development, including acquisition and \ndevelopment of publicly\n\n[[Page H7615]]\n\nowned and controlled rest and recreation areas and sanitary and other \nfacilities reasonably necessary to accommodate the traveling public.\n  So I am pleased that it was not her intention. But, according to DOT, \nthis amendment would do that, and that would be very deleterious to the \ntraveling public. So I would oppose the amendment, as drafted.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), as modified.\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Missouri \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 38 Offered by Mr. Farenthold\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 229, line 23, strike the closing quotation marks and \n     final period.\n       Page 229, after line 23, insert the following:\n       ``(n) Operation of Vehicles on Certain Texas Highways.--If \n     any segment in Texas of United States Route 59, United States \n     Route 77, United States Route 281, United States Route 84, \n     Texas State Highway 44, or another roadway is designated as \n     Interstate Route 69, a vehicle that could operate legally on \n     that segment before the date of such designation may continue \n     to operate on that segment, without regard to any requirement \n     under this section.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Farenthold) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 90 seconds.\n  This bipartisan amendment would allow trucks with current weight \nexemptions to be allowed to continue to operate at those higher weight \nexemptions after certain segments of highways in Texas are reclassified \nand redesignate as Interstate 69.\n  This language will not increase truck weights, nor will it allow for \nweight exemptions for new trucks. This is a narrow amendment that does \nnot include new trucks. It only allows those that are currently \noperating to continue to operate.\n  In the last omnibus, the State of Kentucky was able to include this \nexact language for their State whose industries were facing this exact \nproblem. This amendment models Kentucky's language, except that it \nincludes Texas highways.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndo not oppose the bill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, every one of us on the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee hears a lot about trucks, bigger trucks and \nheavier trucks. I think by now it is safe to say that all 435 of us \nhave heard a lot about trucks. It is a tough issue with strong feelings \non both sides.\n  But this amendment isn't talking about bigger trucks or heavier \ntrucks, as my colleague, Mr. Farenthold, said. All we are talking about \nhere is allowing the State of Texas, through a rigorous licensing and \napproval process, to keep the same weight limits that are in place \nright now for certain trucks on certain stretches of our road, not \nbigger, not heavier, but the same.\n  Unless we get this amendment adopted, the new blue signs for \nInterstate 69 in East Texas won't just mean a new interstate. It could \nmean financial ruin for our loggers who already have a very thin profit \nmargin and a very tough time for our timber industry.\n  It will mean a dramatic decrease in the amount of weight that all the \nloggers can haul on their trucks, which they have been doing safely and \neffectively on these roads for generations, even back when these same \nTexas counties were represented by our colorful Texas Democrat \nCongressman, Timber Charlie Wilson.\n  I am asking all of my colleagues, no matter where you stand on bigger \ntrucks, to join me, Congressman Farenthold, and Congressman Gene Green \nin supporting this bipartisan amendment to allow the State of Texas to \nbe treated in the exact same way that this same body treated the States \nof Kentucky and Mississippi just last year and help save these jobs.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I would like to add it is not just the \nforestry industry as well. Various farm and ranch, cotton industries, \nin certain areas, especially in south Texas, as U.S. Highways 77 and \n281 are becoming Interstate 69, is making it very difficult for the \nvery concrete trucks necessary to make improvements to those roads to \ntravel on that road.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Chairman \nShuster for his work on this bill and his not opposing this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 39 Offered by Mr. Rooney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I of division A, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. VEHICLE WEIGHT LIMITATIONS FOR INTERSTATE SYSTEM \n                   HIGHWAYS.\n\n       Section 127(a) of title 23, United States Code, as amended \n     by this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(15) Hauling of livestock.--A State may allow, by special \n     permit, the operation of vehicles with a gross vehicle weight \n     of up to 95,000 pounds for the hauling of livestock. The cost \n     of a special permit issued under this paragraph may not \n     exceed $200 per year for a livestock trailer.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Rooney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to ask my \ncolleagues to support my amendment to H.R. 22, which would allow for \nStates to give ranchers the flexibility they need in transporting \nlivestock by truck.\n  Today Florida is home to more than 1.7 million head of cattle. Of \nthat, there are nearly 1 million head of beef cattle cared for by the \n15,000 beef producers across the State.\n  Nationally, Florida comes in ninth place in overall cattle numbers. \nIn fact, the top three ranking counties for cattle in my State are in \nmy backyard, Okeechobee, Highlands, and Osceola Counties.\n  Florida is what is referred to in the cattle industry as a cow-calf \noperation State. This means cows are bred and calved in Florida, but \nthe calves are then shipped out West for development and processing. \nBecause of this, our cattle ranchers and beef producers rely on the \nshipping of cattle through the State and across the country in order to \nsucceed.\n  Unlike most goods shipped by truck or rail, livestock needs special \nattention. That is why shipments are carefully organized to consider \nthe needs and welfare of the animals being shipped. The livestock \nindustry's goal is to move the cattle between locations safely and as \nfast as possible to minimize the stress on the animals.\n  Unfortunately, this is where Washington regulations get in the way. \nThe current gross weight limit restriction for all trucks on Federal \nhighways is 80,000 pounds, which limits how many cows can be hauled in \none load. This restriction results in a partially empty livestock \ntrailer, increasing the needs for more shipments, and ends up putting \nmore trucks on the road.\n  The patchwork of State and national truck weight laws creates \ninefficiencies and forces livestock transporters to take indirect and \nlonger routes.\n\n[[Page H7616]]\n\n  For cow-calf operations that rely on shipping their hauls nationwide, \nthese constraints reduce the efficiency of their operation and reduce \nthe slim profits for our hardworking ranchers.\n  My amendment allows States to issue special permits for the \ntransportation of livestock on trailers for up to 95,000 pounds. \nFocusing only on livestock shipping and allowing States to opt in to \nthis program, my amendment would greatly benefit not only ranchers, but \nall American producers and consumers.\n  This amendment means fewer trucks on the road and lower costs for \ntransporting livestock. I encourage my colleagues to support my \namendment and take overly restrictive government red tape out of the \nequation of beef production.\n  My amendment is supported by the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, the oldest and largest national trade association \nsupporting America's cattle producers.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and make \nWashington work for America's cattle ranchers instead of the other way \naround.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Earlier this evening, an amendment was defeated to go to 90,000 \npounds. This would go to 95,000. At least the amendment on 90,000 had \nan additional axle, which made it compliant with the Federal bridge \nformula that is not causing undue damage every time a truck went over a \nbridge. This amendment does not require an additional axle and goes \neven 5,000 pounds higher.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  So it would violate the Federal Bridge Formula, and Federal Highway \nsays that it has estimated that a truck at this weight with the number \nof axles they have is currently paying about 43 percent of the cost of \nthe damage they cause to the system, and that is an underpayment of \nabout $6,000 a year. The bill does allow them to be charged another \n$200 a year, but that is a pretty big deficit with an already \nsubstantially deteriorated system.\n  Raising truck weights is always a very controversial and difficult \nproposition because we have to look out for the taxpayers in terms of \nundue wear and tear to an already fragile and deteriorated system. \n140,000 bridges, as we mentioned numerous times already, need repair or \nreplacement, and, unfortunately, I believe this would accelerate that \nproblem. So I appreciate the gentleman's advocacy for a significant \nindustry in his district, but I would have to oppose that increase.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I would just say in response \nthat, yes, the amendment increases the cap of weight on these trucks; \nbut if we look at it from the standpoint of each individual State, \nincluding my own, we have to think about things like trucks hiding on \nlocal roads, and some of those bridges you were talking about that are \nmost vulnerable are on those local roads. We also allow for States to \nbe able to charge a small yearly fee to livestock haulers so that they \ncan more efficiently transport their loads.\n  So when we talk about actually reducing the number of trucks on the \nroads, getting them from outside of the shadows of these small, local \ncounty and municipal roads so that they are avoiding the interstates, \nplus the fee that we will be able to charge, I think that the overall \nresult will be actual safer roadways.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my State is unique. We actually have a weight mile \nformula we charge to the trucking industry. Federally, when I first \nserved here, the industry tried to preempt it a number of times and \nnever did. It is now widely recognized as one of the fairer systems in \nthe States because it apportions according to scientifically based \nresearch, much of it done at Oregon State University in the labs there, \nthe impacts of individual vehicles.\n  In this case, DOT says that these vehicles would cause an additional \n$6,000-per-vehicle per-year damage on the Federal system, and they \nwould be charged $200. I don't think that is a fair return to the \ntaxpayer, and I urge Members to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Rooney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 40 Offered by Mr. Rothfus\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 40 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of Division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EMERGENCY EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any road, highway, railway, bridge, or transit facility \n     that is damaged by an emergency that is declared by the \n     Governor of the State and concurred in by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security or declared as an emergency by the \n     President pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) and \n     that is in operation or under construction on the date on \n     which the emergency occurs--\n       (1) may be reconstructed in the same location with the same \n     capacity, dimensions, and design as before the emergency; and\n       (2) shall be exempt from any environmental reviews, \n     approvals, licensing, and permit requirements under--\n       (A) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);\n       (B) sections 402 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342, 1344);\n       (C) division A of subtitle III of title 54, United States \n     Code;\n       (D) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.);\n       (E) the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et \n     seq.);\n       (F) the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 \n     et seq.);\n       (G) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.), except when the reconstruction occurs in designated \n     critical habitat for threatened and endangered species;\n       (H) Executive Order 11990 (42 U.S.C. 4321 note; relating to \n     the protection of wetland); and\n       (I) any Federal law (including regulations) requiring no \n     net loss of wetland.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to discuss the need to help communities \nimpacted by a national disaster get back on their feet without facing \nunnecessary regulatory obstacles. Families, businesses, and all members \nof the community may face significant challenges when the roads, \nbridges, transit, and other infrastructure they use on a daily basis \nare not acceptable and not repaired in a timely manner.\n  We can all agree that we should do what we can to protect the \nenvironment from harm. However, we should carefully consider \nregulations currently in place that delay transportation infrastructure \nprojects and remove or reform regulations that are inefficient, \nredundant, or harmful.\n  I would include the redundant and time-consuming environmental \nreviews required for rebuilding disaster-damaged infrastructure in this \ncategory. Those who might argue there is already enough flexibility in \ncurrent law, in communities to efficiently restore their critical \ninfrastructure after a natural disaster or during a state of emergency \nshould consider the following information from the Federal Highway \nAdministration:\n  FHA estimates that it takes an average of 58 months--that is almost 5 \nyears--for transportation projects to complete the NEPA process, and, \nsince 2010, Federal permitting holdups have delayed at least nine \ntransportation\n\n[[Page H7617]]\n\nprojects in my State of Pennsylvania by more than a year.\n  At the very least, we should consider removing reconstruction \nprojects for critical disaster-damaged infrastructure from this drawn-\nout process. No community trying to rebuild and restore its critical \ninfrastructure after a natural disaster should have to endure such a \nlong delay simply to rebuild infrastructure that has already been built \nbefore.\n  My amendment, which was inspired by legislation introduced by Senator \nToomey in the last Congress and Democratic Senator Ben Nelson before \nhim, is intended to speed up reconstruction efforts. My proposal would \nexempt projects to rebuild any road, highway, railway, bridge, or \ntransit facility that is damaged in a declared emergency from \nadditional environmental permitting.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that my amendment may only \napply to projects where the same structure its being rebuilt. In other \nwords, damaged infrastructure would need to be reconstructed in the \nsame location and with the same capacity, dimensions, and design as \nbefore the emergency.\n  It should be common sense that additional environmental reviews of \nthis sort aren't a good use of taxpayer money and aren't helpful to \ndisaster victims. Some commonsense streamlining is appropriate in these \nchallenging cases. Because of this, this proposal has been supported by \na number of groups, including CamTran, the transit agency for Cambria \nCounty, Pennsylvania; the National Association of Counties; the \nPennsylvania Association of Township Supervisors; the Pennsylvania \nState Association of Boroughs; the County Commissioners Association of \nPennsylvania; Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority; and National \nStone, Sand & Gravel; as well as Americans for Prosperity.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to advance this commonsense \nreform and help communities recover after natural disasters by voting \n``yea'' on my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Actually, Mr. Chairman, most of the statutes that the gentleman is \ntalking about already specifically have waivers and exceptions for \nnatural disasters for emergency reconstruction under the Clean Water \nAct, under the Endangered Species Act, under NEPA just enacted 3 years \nago in MAP-21, so this seems perhaps to be broader. I don't fully \nunderstand the implications. But if you look at the Minnesota bridge \ncollapse, you look at the reconstruction of Vermont after the \ncatastrophic hurricane flooding a few years ago, if you look at work in \nLouisiana, all these waivers were put into effect, and the projects \nwere not unnecessarily delayed.\n  This seems to be a broader and more general grant, and I don't fully \nunderstand the implications and feel it could potentially usurp \nnecessary review, so I would oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, this is a simple remedy to follow after a \nnatural disaster. Again, I look at my State of Pennsylvania with its \nmany valleys and riverbeds, and I look at the people supporting or who \nhave supported this type of proposal before: again, the National \nAssociation of Counties, Pennsylvania Association of Township \nSupervisors, and Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority.\n  We need to make sure that our communities have a robust capacity and \nability to respond in the event of a disaster, and that is what the \npoint of this amendment is.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 41 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of Division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ___. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 106 of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k) Megaprojects.--\n       ``(1) Megaproject defined.--In this subsection, the term \n     `megaproject' means a project that has an estimated total \n     cost of $2,500,000,000 or more, and such other projects as \n     may be identified by the Secretary.\n       ``(2) Comprehensive risk management plan.--A recipient of \n     Federal financial assistance under this title for a \n     megaproject shall, in order to be authorized for \n     construction, submit to the Secretary a comprehensive risk \n     management plan that contains--\n       ``(A) a description of the process by which the recipient \n     will identify, quantify, and monitor the risks that might \n     result in cost overruns, project delays, reduced construction \n     quality, or reductions in benefits with respect to the \n     megaproject;\n       ``(B) examples of mechanisms the recipient will use to \n     track risks identified pursuant to subparagraph (A);\n       ``(C) a plan to control such risks; and\n       ``(D) such assurances as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate that the recipient will, with respect to the \n     megaproject--\n       ``(i) regularly submit to the Secretary updated cost \n     estimates; and\n       ``(ii) maintain and regularly reassess financial reserves \n     for addressing known and unknown risks.\n       ``(3) Peer review group.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A recipient of Federal financial \n     assistance under this title for a megaproject shall, not \n     later than 90 days after the date when such megaproject is \n     authorized for construction, establish a peer review group \n     for such megaproject that consists of at least 5 individuals \n     (including at least 1 individual with project management \n     experience) to give expert advice on the scientific, \n     technical, and project management aspects of the megaproject.\n       ``(B) Membership.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall \n     establish guidelines describing how a recipient described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall--\n       ``(i) recruit and select members for a peer review group \n     established under such subparagraph;\n       ``(ii) ensure that no member of the peer group has a \n     conflict of interest relating to the project; and\n       ``(iii) make publicly available the criteria for such \n     selection and the identity of members so selected.\n       ``(C) Tasks.--A peer review group established under \n     subparagraph (A) by a recipient of Federal financial \n     assistance for a megaproject shall--\n       ``(i) meet annually until completion of the megaproject;\n       ``(ii) not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     establishment of the peer review group and not later than 90 \n     days after the date of any significant change, as determined \n     by the Secretary, to the scope, schedule, or budget of the \n     megaproject, review the scope, schedule, and budget of the \n     megaproject, including planning, engineering, financing, and \n     any other elements determined appropriate by the Secretary; \n     and\n       ``(iii) submit a report on the findings of each review \n     under clause (ii) to the Secretary, Congress, and the \n     recipient.\n       ``(4) Transparency.--A recipient of Federal financial \n     assistance under this title for a megaproject shall publish \n     on the Internet Web site of such recipient--\n       ``(A) the name, license number, and license type of each \n     engineer supervising an aspect of the megaproject; and\n       ``(B) the report submitted under paragraph (3)(C)(iii), not \n     later than 90 days after such submission.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     applies with respect to projects that are authorized for \n     construction on or after the date that is 1 year after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan amendment establishes \nan independent peer review group to assess the quality assurance, cost \ncontainment, and risk management and, in addition, creates a stricter \ncost\n\n[[Page H7618]]\n\nmanagement plan for Federal transportation projects that cost over $2.5 \nbillion. So it is only Federal projects over $2.5 billion. It doesn't \napply to anything below $2.5 billion.\n  As we all know, large infrastructure projects are vital to our \ncountry's development and its economic growth. Unfortunately, 9 out of \nevery 10 megaprojects experience cost overruns and suffer significant \ndelays. This is according to an extensive research project out of \nCambridge University in England. Current law already requires financial \nreporting for projects costing more than $500 million, but no \nadditional oversight, such as what we have in this bill, exists for the \nlargest and most complex megaprojects.\n  Projects like the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the I-265 bridge \nbetween Kentucky and Indiana, the Big Dig in Boston, the Tappan Zee \nBridge in New York, and Denver International Airport--all of these \nprojects would have benefited greatly from a comprehensive risk \nmanagement plan and an independent peer review group, according to the \nexperts.\n  Mr. Chairman, the public deserves a system that manages costs, \nforesees risks, and holds decisionmakers accountable. In my prior life \nas a member of the California State Legislature and the State senate, \nwe had a bipartisan investigation and public hearings as to what went \nwrong and what lessons could be learned from our overruns on the \nOakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge replacement that was replaced, a \nproject that was $5 billion overbudget and 10 years late.\n  The project started, unfortunately, in 1989 because of the Loma \nPrieta earthquake. The idea in this bipartisan review was just to learn \nwhat we could from our experience and not to cast any judgments. \nAmongst the most significant things we were told were the \nimplementation of a rigorous, with the least conflict of interest \npossible, peer review group and a more rigorous cost assessment and \ncost review process.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment establishes that independent peer review \ngroup consisting of at least five individuals, without conflicts of \ninterest, tasked with giving expert advice on scientific, technical, \nand management aspects of the megaproject. The amendment saves taxpayer \ndollars and reduces project timelines by requiring a comprehensive risk \nmanagement plan that includes a description of identified risks \nassociated with the project, proposed mechanisms to manage such risks, \nand updated cost estimates, among others.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bipartisan \namendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nLaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nCalifornia to support this effort to rein in cost overruns on large, \ncomplex projects that end up costing taxpayers far more than original \nestimates.\n  Too often, extremely large projects suffer from extreme cost overruns \nthat not only fail to provide good value to taxpayers, but damage other \ninfrastructure by absorbing funds that could support other \ntransportation projects.\n  In California, for example, the State's high-speed rail proposal is \nestimated to cost over twice what voters were promised, and no honest \nobserver actually believes that estimate is even high enough at twice. \nThe project's growing costs threaten funding for every other aspect of \nCalifornia's transportation system, including key infrastructure that \npeople are demanding like roads and highways, or in this time of record \ndrought in California, with unlimited funds, maybe even for water \nstorage projects in that area.\n  Mr. Chairman, if this amendment were in place today, Congress would \nhave the benefit of an independent peer review analysis when \ndetermining whether to provide funding, and the project would have \nprepared a detailed risk management plan to control costs--very similar \nto when I was a State senator in California, S. 22, to do this very \nsame thing similarly on high-speed rail at the time.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Policymakers need accurate and partial information to make decisions, \nand this amendment will ensure that information is available.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, I believe, is unnecessary. \nSpecial requirements and protections are already in place for any \nproject costing more than $500 million, a much lower threshold than \nproposed by the gentleman's amendment.\n  Each project must have a project management plan that documents \nprocedures to manage the scope, costs, schedules, and Federal \nrequirements applicable to the project. The plan must also document the \nrole of the agency's leadership and the project management team in \ndelivering the project.\n  Each major project must have in place an annual financial plan that \nprovides detailed estimates of the cost to complete the project, \nincluding future increases in the cost of the project.\n  Again, it is already in the bill. It is at a much lower threshold \nthan the gentleman's amendment.\n  I urge all Members to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Chaffetz). The gentleman from California has 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman. I also \nwant to thank him for his coaching and helping me through a prospective \nworking mistake.\n  With all due respect--and, of course, the chairman is much more \nknowledgeable than I am--it is the intention at least of the author \nthat this would be in addition to.\n  I would respectfully ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

REGULATION OF MOTOR CARRIERS OF PROPERTY.\n\n       Section 14501(c)(2)(C) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``the price of'' and all that follows \n     through ``transportation is'' and inserting ``the regulation \n     of tow truck operations''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman \nShuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their hard work on the \nunderlying bill and for considering Congressman Van Hollen's and my \namendment.\n  Our amendment is simple. It would merely restore the ability of State \nand local governments to regulate the tow truck industry.\n  Through a provision slipped into the Federal Aviation Administration \nAct of 1994 that defined the tow truck industry as an interstate \ncarrier, State and local regulation of tow truck operations has been \npreempted.\n  But the very next year, passage of the Interstate Commerce \nTermination Act struck down the Federal regulatory body that was \noverseeing the towing industry. So it essentially left it without any \noversight despite widely reported consumer abuses.\n\n[[Page H7619]]\n\n  In the years since, a number of conflicting court rulings have been \nmade on cases between tow operators and localities. Some decisions have \nupheld some aspects of local regulations and others have stayed silent.\n  With no Federal regulator and a confusing patchwork of Federal \npreemption and judicial rulings, no level of government has been able \nto adequately regulate the towing industry.\n  This lack of regulatory authority has led to more than two decades of \nmajor misconduct by some unscrupulous towing companies, and these bad \noperators continue to taint an otherwise much-needed and respectable \nprofession.\n  State and localities are the logical towing regulators. They have an \nestablished body of law in place to do so.\n  Mr. Chairman, in my family automobile business, we have long run our \nown tow trucks. We have contracted with independent tow truck companies \nfor decades. Most of them are hardworking, honest, small businesses. \nThey work long days and nights, weekends, in all kinds of weather, but \nthey are given a bad name by the few, but real, irresponsible operators \nin the industry.\n  I would just like to note our amendment is supported by the largest \ntrade association representing small business trucking professionals \nand professional truck drivers, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers \nAssociation.\n  In their letter of support, they talk about nonconsensual tows and \nsay:\n  These are situations where there is no opportunity for motorists to \nnegotiate services or compare prices among multiple towing operators. \nSo it is critical that States have the ability to enact important \nconsumer protections.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and end unnecessary \nand impractical Federal overreach. Return this important authority to \nthe States and help end our constituents' frustrations with abusive \ntowing practices.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, even \nthough I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I believe the gentleman's amendment is a \nsound amendment. I support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 43 Offered by Mr. Mica\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 43 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 229, after line 7, insert the following:\n       ``(m) Operation of Certain Specialized Hauling Vehicles on \n     the Interstate.--\n       ``(1) In general.--A State may not prohibit the operation \n     of an automobile transporter with a gross weight of 84,000 \n     pounds or less on--\n       ``(A) any segment of the Interstate System (except a \n     segment exempted under section 31111(f) of title 49); or\n       ``(B) those classes of qualifying Federal-aid primary \n     highways designated by the Secretary under section 31111(e) \n     of title 49.\n       ``(2) Reasonable access.--A state may not enact or enforce \n     a law denying reasonable access to automobile transporters, \n     to and from highways described in paragraph (1), to loading \n     or unloading points or facilities for food, fuel, repair, or \n     rest.\n       ``(3) Axle weight tolerance.--A State shall allow an \n     automobile transporter a tolerance of no more than 5 percent \n     on axle weight limitations set forth in subsection (a).\n       ``(4) Automobile transporter defined.--In this subsection, \n     the term `automobile transporter' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 31111(a) of title 49.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Mica) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, I know the chairman and the \nranking member have done yeoman's work in bringing this bill forward, \nand the staff have also done great work.\n  This is a special achievement. I have been there and tried to do \nthis, done it, and it is very difficult. Sometimes you try not to \ninterfere in the process, but from time to time an issue comes up that \nyou try to negotiate and make sense out of.\n  My amendment is pretty simple. In the committee bill, the bill before \nus, the committee has already allowed for a very limited number of \nautomobile transporter vehicles to increase their length from 75 to 80 \nfeet, some 5 feet, which will accommodate approximately one more \nvehicle.\n  However, there is no consideration for the way to correspondingly \nprovide for, again, the increase in the length. I have tried to \nnegotiate between the industry. I do not support 91,000 pounds. I do \nnot support 88,000 pounds. I do not support 86,000 pounds.\n  What I said is: What would it take to transport one more vehicle? \nThere are 12,000 of these vehicles across the country. About what \nweight would it take to add one more vehicle to the length that is \nalready in this bill? And it is about 4,000 pounds.\n  This amendment is simple. It says we would allow in this limited \ninstance to go to 4,000 pounds because the committee draft and bill \nbefore us has, again, a provision to increase and allow, again, the \nadditional 5-foot length.\n  Forty percent of these carriers travel empty. We could actually force \nmore vehicles on the road by not allowing this amendment. Actually, \ngiving them the length, but not the capacity to carry, doesn't make \nsense. So that is my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this \nparticular amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).\n  This amendment would raise the allowable gross vehicle weight of \nautomobile transporters to 84,000 pounds, as was stated. It would also \nallow higher allowable axle weight, up to 5 percent above levels set in \ncurrent law.\n  We have agreed in the base bill to provide an exemption for the extra \nlength to allow additional vehicles to be added to an automobile \ntransporter.\n  Amendments to raise truck weights are very controversial and have the \npotential to weaken support for an otherwise carefully negotiated bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed that the other side of \nthe aisle would not consider this a well-thought-out, reasonable \namendment.\n  The underlying bill does allow, again, 5 additional feet. It would \naccommodate another vehicle, but no accommodation for weight. That just \ndoes not make sense. We are talking about a very limited number of \ntransporting vehicles.\n  So even having offered on many occasions folks on the other side to \npresent reasonable amendments and given that opportunity and not being \nallowed that tonight, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nmy amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 44 Offered by Ms. DelBene\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 44 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 268, after line 17, insert the following:\n       ``(E) Report to congress.--The Secretary shall make \n     publically available a report on the Frontline Workforce \n     Development Program for each fiscal year, not later than \n     December 31 of the year in which that fiscal year ends. The \n     report shall include a detailed description of activities \n     carried out under this paragraph, an evaluation of the \n     program, and policy recommendations to improve program \n     effectiveness.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Ms. DelBene) and a\n\n[[Page H7620]]\n\nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Shuster and \nRanking Member DeFazio as well as subcommittee Chairman Graves and \nRanking Member Holmes Norton for their work on this important bill. I \nwould also like to thank Congresswoman Foxx for cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  This amendment is bipartisan, straightforward, and will ensure the \nFederal Government is getting the best return on our investment while \nhelping the greatest number of people.\n  The underlying bill provides grants through an innovative frontline \nworkforce development program to train and recruit underrepresented \npopulations for career pathways in transit maintenance and operations.\n  By establishing apprenticeships and forging local and regional \ntraining partnerships, these grants will provide targeted, hands-on \ntraining for workers across the country. This is critical for \nidentifying potential workforce shortages in the future and filling \nthose gaps with skilled workers.\n  Workforce development programs are often referred to as ladders of \nopportunity. Helping people find good-paying, long-term employment is \nthe best way to ensure everyone has access to economic opportunities.\n  The program included in today's bill is a great example of this. It \nwill help low-income Americans become self-sufficient by giving them \nspecialized training to secure a career in the transit field and \nincrease their earning potential, and it will identify the best ways to \nhelp the most people succeed.\n  My amendment would simply require a report on the frontline workforce \ndevelopment program for each fiscal year. The report would include an \nevaluation of the overall program and would include policy \nrecommendations to improve the program's effectiveness.\n  The amendment would not affect direct spending or revenue and is \nbudget-neutral, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I firmly believe that this amendment improves the underlying bill, \nwhich will inject a sorely needed boost to our Nation's infrastructure \nand economy. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, even \nthough I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's work on the \namendment, and I support her amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support of \nthe amendment and encourage others to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 45 Offered by Mrs. Napolitano\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 45 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-325.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 184, line 22, strike ``and'' at the end.\n       Page 185, line 7, strike ``and'' at the end.\n       Page 185, after line 15, insert the following:\n       (iv) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(G) Waiver.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Upon the request of a public authority, \n     the Secretary may waive the requirements of subparagraph (E) \n     for a facility, and the corresponding program sanctions under \n     subparagraph (F), if the Secretary determines that--\n\n       ``(I) the waiver is in the best interest of the traveling \n     public; and\n       ``(II) the public authority has made a good faith effort to \n     improve the performance of the facility.\n\n       ``(ii) Condition.--The Secretary may require, as a \n     condition of issuance of a waiver under this subparagraph, \n     that a public authority take additional actions, determined \n     by the Secretary, to improve the performance of the \n     facility.''; and\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 507, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Mrs. Napolitano) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to give thanks to both \nMr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio for their great work on this bill. It is \nabsolutely amazing. Thank you so very much.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan amendment with Mr. Royce and Mr. \nCalvert and would allow a State or local transportation agency to apply \nfor a waiver from the current HOV degradation standard if the Secretary \nof Transportation determines that a waiver is in the best interest of \nthe traveling public and that the State or local agency has made a good \nfaith effort to improve the performance of the HOV lane.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  The Secretary may require the public authority to take additional \nactions to improve the HOV lane.\n  The current HOV degradation standard requires HOV lanes to maintain \nan average speed above 45 miles per hour 90 percent of the time during \npeak hours. I repeat: during peak hours. This arbitrary standard does \nnot take into consideration or account the specific transportation \nconcerns of each State.\n  Over 60 percent of California's highways are noncompliant by this \nFederal degradation standard, which means that California will be \nforced to spend limited resources on transportation projects that do \nnot meet the needs of the general public. California will also have to \nreduce the amount of energy-efficient vehicles that it allows in the \nHOV lane.\n  In California, we have studied the issue and have found that they do \nnot meet the minimum driving speed standard because of accidents, \nweather events, and other unpredictable events. The degradation \nstandard is supposed to address manageable recurring congestion, but \nCalifornia is noncompliant in the standard based on manageable traffic \nevents.\n  This amendment would allow the DOT to recognize that there are \nspecial circumstances in each State that lead to lane degradation and \nthat they do not always include recurring congestion. The amendment \nwould allow the DOT to grant waivers to States and local agencies that \napply based on their local congestion concerns. It would protect States \nagainst a one-size-fits-all Federal policy that does not work for each \nState.\n  I ask for the support of my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentlewoman from California.\n  Mr. Chairman, I understand that California has unique issues with HOV \ndegradation, and I believe a waiver process is appropriate. One size \ndoes not fit all. I think this is another example we can all learn \nfrom. California is different from Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is \ndifferent from Minnesota.\n  I appreciate the gentlewoman for continuing to fight for this \namendment. I know that Mrs. Mimi Walters, from southern California, was \nalso an advocate for this. We went back and forth on the negotiations \nas it was in one minute and out the next; but I appreciate your \nperseverance and Mrs. Mimi Walters' perseverance in that we were \nfinally able to get this amendment to the floor and come to agreement \non it. I support this amendment, and I think it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I thank the chairman for those kind words. I thank \nMrs. Mimi Walters and Messrs. Royce and Calvert for their support of \nthis amendment.\n  I certainly look forward to continuing to work on transportation, and \nI thank the gentleman for hanging in there this late in the evening. I \nlook forward to working with the gentleman and with Ranking Member \nDeFazio on this issue during the conference.\n\n[[Page H7621]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Kasich,\n     Governor of Ohio, Columbus, Ohio.\n       Dear Governor Kasich: I am writing to inform you that I \n     will resign my congressional seat in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, effective 11:59 p.m. October 31, 2015. ,\n       Some 25 years ago, I asked the people of Ohio's Eighth \n     District to send me to Washington on a mission to help build \n     a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government. \n     First and foremost, that has meant helping constituents and \n     local officials cut through gridlock and navigate the \n     bureaucratic maze to get things done. In Hamilton, we brought \n     together the Army Corps of Engineers and local officials to \n     get the Meldahl Lock and Dam power plant off the ground. In \n     Butler County, we worked with officials at all levels to keep \n     the veterans highway and Union Centre Blvd. projects on \n     track. We made sure that Wright Patterson Air Force Base and \n     the Springfield Air National Guard Base had the resources \n     they need to support our men and women in uniform. And not to \n     mention the tens of thousands of constituents we helped \n     through casework, letters, phone calls, my open door program, \n     and of course, Farm Forum. None of this would have been \n     possible without the hard work of my staff, which has been \n     first-rate from start to finish. Together, we did the right \n     things for the right reasons and good things happened.\n       It has been an honor to serve.\n           Sincerely,\n     John A. Boehner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/house-section/article/H7622-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. WOODALL.
