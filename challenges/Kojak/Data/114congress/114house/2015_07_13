The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, we will gather in Portland \nto mourn the passing and celebrate the life of Don Frisbee, who died \nJune 26 at the age 91.\n  Don led an extraordinary life, rising through the company ranks to \nbecome the chairman and CEO of PacifiCorp, then the major private \nutility in the Pacific Northwest.\n  He was a bold and visionary leader of this important company. He was \na board member of Fortune 500 companies like Weyerhaeuser and First \nInterstate Bank, now Wells Fargo. He was widely regarded as the most \ninfluential business leader in Oregon for 2 decades.\n  Don's influence, though, extended beyond the business space. He was \nalso on the board of two prestigious Northwest academic institutions, \nWhitman College in Walla Walla and Reed College in Portland, where he \nplayed a critical role in the development of that storied institution.\n  He helped promote the growth of Portland State University, the Oregon \nHealth Science University, and helped guide the Children's Institute.\n  Later in his retirement, he worked for 5 years with his daughter-in-\nlaw, Denise Frisbee, on a program throughout the State of Oregon to \nconnect people with their public schools.\n  He cared deeply about the civic infrastructure, how to encourage and \nempower individuals to make a difference the way that he, himself, had. \nHe was instrumental in the creation and growth of the Oregon Leadership \nForum, which now for 30 years has gathered people from all across \nOregon on an ongoing, yearlong program to develop leadership capacity \nand commitment to our State. From its founding to his board leadership, \nfrom participating in the very first year's programming, he was the \ndriving force for this unique organization.\n  The utility executive was passionate about Oregon's special places. \nHe loved the out-of-doors and his own special place, his beloved ranch \nin Sisters, located in a spectacular setting in central Oregon.\n  This veteran utility executive didn't think there was a conflict \nbetween sound, sustainable business practices and protecting the \nenvironment. During the last conversation I had with Don, he talked \nabout how delighted he was with the Pope's encyclical on the \nenvironment and global warming.\n  For all his many accomplishments, his family and friends were central \nin his life, even more so as the years passed. He lost his beloved \nwife, Emily, in 2003, after 56 years of marriage. Together, they built \na family, a career, and a better community.\n  A little at loose ends after losing Emily, later in life, he met, \nwooed, and wed a widow who was his neighbor, Betty Perkins. Together, \nthey found extraordinary happiness. They had an amazing effect on \neveryone they met, whether on a cruise, on the 60th reunion of Don's \nclass at the Harvard Business School, or just people on the street.\n  At a time when most their age would be in rocking chairs, they were \ntraveling the world, providing inspiration to all privileged to spend \ntime around them. His was an extraordinary life well lived.\n  Portland is often regarded as one of America's finest city, listed on \nall the best places. Over the last 50 years, no one made it a better \nplace than Don Frisbee.\n  Our hearts go out to Don's family; his wife, Betty; and to all of \nthose who were touched by this extraordinary man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5091-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5091-H5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TIME TO STREAMLINE SIMPLE IRA ROLLOVERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, in 1966, Federal legislation established a new \ntype of employer-sponsored retirement plan known as a SIMPLE IRA. These \nplans are designed to give small businesses a retirement option for \ntheir employees without the administrative burdens of other employer-\nsponsored retirement plan types.\n  SIMPLE IRAs face a 25 percent early withdrawal penalty during the \nfirst 2\n\n[[Page H5092]]\n\nyears of their existence, compared to 10 percent for other IRAs. In \norder to prevent accountholders from unknowingly rolling their IRA \nfunds into SIMPLE IRAs and being surprised by an increased early \nretirement penalty, current law prohibits rolling funds over into a \nSIMPLE IRA from other retirement accounts.\n  However, SIMPLE IRAs have the same early withdrawal penalty as other \nIRAs after that initial 2-year period, and consumers and financial \nplanners have struggled with the rollover restrictions as they attempt \nto consolidate accounts.\n  This week, I will introduce legislation to allow for rollovers into \nSIMPLE IRA accounts that have met the 2-year threshold. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has previously estimated this legislation would \nhave a negligible effect on Federal tax revenues. This bill will \nsimplify retirement planning and ensure a complex Tax Code does not \nprevent sensible financial planning decisions. Individuals should be \nable to consolidate their retirement funds in a way that best meets \ntheir needs.\n  This legislation is a small but important first step in the long road \nto ensuring our tax system works for Americans, not against them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5092-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SHORT-TERM HIGHWAY FUND EXTENSIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, 2-year short-term highway fund extensions \nhave become one of Congress' most costly habits. Kudos to the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, which has marked up the \nhighway portion and may come to the floor this week with a 6-year bill.\n  That bill is not yet paid for, but the Senate is at least making \nprogress toward a 6-year bill, the kind that is needed to make a dent \nin the backlog of our construction projects in the States.\n  We should not be deterred by the likelihood of another short-term \nbill, perhaps going to the end of the year. The goal before the year is \nout must be a long-term bill.\n  Congress has taken to authorizing the highway trust fund for 2 years, \nknowing full well that the trust fund, collecting gas user fees at 1993 \nlevels, would run out even before those 2 years are out; then the waltz \nbegins with endless short-term bills.\n  The States are disgusted and exhausted. MAP-21 ran out before the end \nof its 2-year lifetime. The last short-term bill extension was so \nuseless that it has lasted longer than expected because the States \ncould not apply the funds to the backlog of now endless rescheduled \nprojects; 6-month extensions have yielded 6-month projects, usually \nonly patchwork.\n  This poster goes beyond showing that the short-term extensions have \nbeen useless to the States. These short term bills and extensions are \nhaving negative effects on the pocketbooks of our constituents. The \nhighway user fee, which has not been raised for 22 years, costs drivers \n$97 a year. The bad roads that are the result cost those same drivers \n$515 per year.\n  Find your State for the cost to your constituents. Here is a random \nsample: Louisiana, $514 per year; Oklahoma, $763 per year; New Jersey, \n$685 per driver; Ohio, $446 per driver; California, $762 per driver; \nand Pennsylvania, $471 per driver.\n  All the figures are high, regardless of State or region of the \ncountry, and those high dollar amounts go out of the pockets of our \nconstituents to patch bad roads, instead of putting the funds into \nfixing those roads, bridges, and transit.\n  Congress' short-term attention to our roads, highways, transit and \nbridges is breaking the bank, not for the Federal Government, but for \nour constituents. It is no longer the old adage ``you can't get \nsomething for nothing'' rather, not funding the highway trust fund for \n6 years costs the people we represent not nothing, but $515 per driver.\n  We have got to fund our transportation projects or ask our \nconstituents to pay for their bad roads. The costs to the American \npeople make our options clear what the best thing to do is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5092-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5092-H5093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS DENYING JUSTICE TO VICTIMS OF SEXUAL \n                                ASSAULT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice is failing \nrape victims.\n  Across America, an estimated 400,000 untested rape kits sit on \nshelves. Government officials long blamed a lack of resources to test \nthe kits; so Congress fixed this problem in the reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act, VAWA, as it is called.\n  VAWA included the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act, or \nSAFER, which allows and mandates that 75 percent of Debbie Smith DNA \nBacklog Grant funds go directly to test the long backlog of rape kits.\n  The bottom line, money has been allocated to fund the backlog of \n400,000 rape kits. Funds are required to be made available for audits, \nso we could find the true number of languishing kits throughout \ndifferent States and then test them.\n  The goal of SAFER was to ensure that no rape kit went untested, so \nall victims had answers and all rapists were brought to justice; yet, \nMr. Speaker, it has been 2 years. Kits remain in basements on dusty \nshelves, and nothing has changed.\n  The money is there; the law is written, but the DOJ, the Department \nof Justice, shamelessly ignores this mandate leaving sexual assault \nvictims waiting for justice. Meanwhile, untested rape kits create an \nunfair treatment of victims. One thing it does is it allows the guilty \noutlaws to go free and prevents the innocent from being exonerated.\n  Also, the statute of limitations may expire. Then, when the criminal \nis captured, he may escape justice because the kit was analyzed too \nlong after the crime was committed. That is a travesty of justice. It \nis an insult and shameful treatment of sexual assault victims.\n  To quote an old legal maxim, ``the criminal goes free because the \nconstable has blundered'' or, in this case, the constable is \nincompetent.\n  Without this SAFER Act, which allowed the implementation of funds to \nanalyze backlogs of rape kits, we would still be in a problem that we \nhad 2 years ago.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  But these funds are available for the States to analyze and get the \nkits tested. Once tested, the results would allow the apprehension of \ncriminals.\n  This is not occurring. The Department of Justice has yet to even \noffer the SAFER audit grants to the States. The DOJ cannot show that 75 \npercent of the funds are going to direct testing and lab capacity \nenhancement, as required by the law.\n  To give rape victims justice, DNA often holds the critical key and \nthe only key to learning the identity of the perpetrators. Without \nthis, justice is often delayed or denied forever.\n  Ignoring SAFER is an affront to sexual assault victims. Mr. Speaker, \nvictims deserve to know who assaulted them. They need to know for peace \nof mind. It is mental turmoil for rape victims not to know the identity \nof the perpetrator while sometimes they still fear for their own \nsafety. A rape kit DNA test may prove to be their best and last and \nonly hope in knowing the identity of the rapist.\n  Bureaucrats should do their job. Quit making excuses for not \nimplementing the law.\n  In my 30 years as a prosecutor and criminal court judge, I talked to \nand met a lot of sexual assault victims. Sexual assault, or rape, is, \nto me, the worst crime in society. And rape victims, more than anything \nelse, want to know who did it. They want to know who did it.\n  We have the capability of helping rape victims know who the \nperpetrator in 400,000 cases. Why aren't we doing it?\n  Not knowing the identity of a rapist is haunting to their victims. It \nis traumatizing. And to know that the rapist still may be on the loose \nbecause the testing kit was not done is inexcusable incompetence.\n  Each day that goes by, we are running out the clock on the statute of \nlimitations, increasing the chance that criminals may escape the long \narm of the law. It is time to analyze the\n\n[[Page H5093]]\n\n400,000 rape kits and capture the rapists.\n  The Department of Justice must live up to its name. Enforce the SAFER \nAct and follow the law. The Department of Justice must ensure justice \nfor victims. Until then, many rape victims see no justice.\n  Our country deserves better; sexual assault victims deserve better; \nand, Mr. Speaker, justice deserves better. Because, justice is what we \ndo in this country.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5093-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ANTIQUITIES ACT ABUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last week, the President announced his \nplans to designate, once again, over 300,000 acres, this time of \nmountains, meadows, and other areas that stretch over 100 miles in \nnorthern California, including parts of Yolo, Solano, Napa, Lake, \nMendocino, Glenn, and Colusa Counties, as a monument.\n  This designation now marks the 19th time this President has created \nor expanded, since taking office, resulting in over 260 million acres \nof designated lands and waters in monuments or wilderness areas.\n  This move actually exemplifies the President's complete disregard for \nthe legislative process and his lack of hesitance on using every single \npolitical tool to carry out even more of his executive power grabs.\n  Indeed, the one in Snow Mountain was a bipartisan effort underway, \nwith legislators working on how that might become a designated area. \nInstead, that has now been usurped by one more round of executive \npower, kind of like we have seen recently with the Supreme Court \nexercising its power usurping the legislative process where we, the \nlegislators, are subject directly to we, the people.\n  Using the Antiquities Act as justification to designate over a third \nof a million acres in my State overnight is not only a serious abuse of \npower, it is a serious misrepresentation of the intent of the law \nitself. This law, the purpose of this law, which was enacted after \narcheologists years ago noticed small artifacts disappearing or ending \nup in private collections across different countries, was meant as an \nemergency option to curb looting in small archeological sites in the \nSouthwest.\n  The short and what would seem like simple text of the law actually \ndirects the President to limit any designation to the smallest area \ncompatible with proper care and management of the resource or the \nobjects to be protected.\n  Now, when you see 330,000 acres designated here or 700,000 designated \nin Nevada or, a few years ago, when President Clinton declared 1 \nmillion acres in Utah, are we really protecting a particular area or \nzone or is this a widespread power grab?\n  Indeed, what are we protecting it from? Well, you will hear from the \nleft, from oil and gas development, from timber, from mining, or from \nall sorts of things that would be devastating to the environment.\n  Have you noticed how hard it is to get a permit to do any one of \nthose things, by the time you get through the EPA, U.S. Fish and \nWildlife, and the whole litany of others that are in the way of doing \nthings that could be done with good environmental stewardship at the \nsame time as developing the resources that people in this country still \nneed? They still need fuel; they still need oil; they still need gas; \nthey still need paper products. Heaven knows, we use enough paper \nproducts in this building.\n  But we need development in this country. We do it more responsibly \nthan anywhere else in the world. Yet these wilderness area \ndesignations, these monuments, they don't seek to really protect \nanything. They just make it off limits to all Americans, even if you \njust want to go in for hiking or hunting or a little off-roading and, \nindeed, those that would develop the resources.\n  This is so absurd, it even has made it difficult for fire suppression \nin our forested areas, for our various fire agencies to go do the job \nthey need to do, to have the roads in the areas that are needed so they \ncan attack the fires.\n  And even more so, as we have seen what happened with the loss of life \nwith illegal immigrants in this country, like Kathryn Steinle in San \nFrancisco, illegal immigration, the effort to stop that at the border \nwas made even more difficult, I believe, down in New Mexico when the \nPresident designated a bunch of the area along New Mexico as a \nmonument, making it where the Border Patrol can't even patrol the areas \nbecause it is now an environmentally protected zone. That is \nridiculous, and I think Americans, when they hear about this, say, \n``What is going on?''\n  So this is, again, a power grab that is completely inappropriate. It \nbypasses the legislative process where the legislators are directly \naccountable to the people.\n  It is about time that we change the Antiquities Act, or at least if \nwe had somebody in the White House that knew the balance between \ndesignating just a small area that actually helps protect a resource \nand archaeological site versus hundreds of thousands or millions of \nacres that makes it just off limits to the type of use the public needs \nand actually makes the assets a safer and healthier one, for example, \nwith our forests, where we can do the work that needs to be done to \nkeep them healthy.\n  Local residents have very little input, if any, on a designation \nhappening in their backyard. Is this a transparent process? No.\n  It is power in Washington, once again, ruling over the people, ruling \nover the stakeholders in those communities that know best how to manage \nthe resource, what that resource needs, and what that could mean to the \nlocal economy, whether it is hunting or fishing or hiking, off-roading, \neven a little gold mining.\n  We can do these things. We know how to do them environmentally \nresponsibly, and yet we get run over time and time and time again by \nleft-leaning folks using the Antiquities Act as something for their \nenvironmental dreams.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am highly frustrated by this, and I hope the American \npublic will get behind an effort to help us change the Antiquities Act \nand make it something that actually works for the American public and \nprotects what needs protecting, not everything else.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5093-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, recently, President Obama \nstruck another blow destroying American jobs with his new proposal to \nraise the salary threshold for overtime. This top-down, burdensome \nregulation will inhibit job creation, burden small businesses, and \npenalize hard-working Americans.\n  By increasing the wage threshold, businesses in South Carolina and \nacross America will be faced with difficult choices: reducing hours for \nworkers and cutting jobs. This change will hurt hard-working employees, \nwho will face a lack of flexibility, limited opportunity for \nadvancement within their jobs, and lower base salaries.\n  The new mandate joins other harmful administration regulations, \nincluding mandatory wages and fixed work schedules, destroying jobs.\n  The failed liberal welfare state policies of the last 50 years have \nproduced increased poverty, and we should change policies to promote a \nlimited government of expanded freedoms, creating jobs.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5094-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADDRESSING FORECLOSURES AND SHORT SALES IS CRITICAL\n\n  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, homeownership is one of the cornerstones \nof the American Dream; yet, since the 2007 housing crisis, millions of \nAmericans have lost their homes through the foreclosure process, and \nmany more continue to struggle.\n  Addressing foreclosures and short sales is critical. Accelerating the \nshort sale process for homeowners would be part of the solution.\n  Unfortunately, in California and across the country, one of the most \nsignificant factors that slows down the short sale process takes place \nwhen a homeowner's second mortgage lender delays final negotiations on \nthe short sale; and too often, second mortgage lenders use stonewalling \ntactics to delay payouts from the first mortgage lenders. This, \nunfortunately, delays and hurts the homeowners, willing buyers, and the \neconomy at large.\n  After further investigation on this issue, I will be introducing a \nbill to address short sales and ask the Federal Housing Finance Agency \nto provide an update on what it is doing to facilitate short sales and \nprotect homeowners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5094-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WESTERN WATER AND AMERICAN FOOD SECURITY ACT\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2898, the \nWestern Water and American Food Security Act. This is by Representative \nValadao from California. I appreciate his hard work and bipartisan \nefforts on this.\n  California's drought is having devastating effects on agriculture and \nour food supply nationwide. Last year, drought-related water cutbacks \ncaused an estimated 400,000 acres to be fallowed, costing thousands of \njobs and leaving consumers less food choices in the United States.\n  While the solution is certainly not going to be all encompassed in \none bill, this will be a great start towards getting California back \nwhere we need to be for drought relief.\n  We cannot stand by and watch one more family suffer, small businesses \nand our economy leaving the State, when we should have those jobs right \nin the valley.\n  It ends the finger-pointing and blame game, and provides desperately \nneeded short-term relief while advancing commonsense policies to fix \nthe situation in the long term.\n  It would update Federal laws and streamline water permitting so we \ncould build Sites Reservoir in northern California. Indeed, it also \nensures sound and real-time science and water delivery methods so we \ndon't have a situation where we are leasing 15,000 acre-feet twice to \nbenefit less than 30 steelhead fish.\n  Let's get on with getting California's water supply back on track so \nthat this important legislation is not stalled by the usual suspects on \nthe environmental left.\n  Indeed, the proof will be in the pudding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5094-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CELEBRATION OF THE HUNT\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota.

These traditions are often \npassed down from one generation to the next, teaching many important \nlife lessons along the way.\n  Connor depicts this in his essay, describing the bonding experience \nwith his father, the spirituality of the hunt, as well as everything \nthat the hunt has taught him about life.

Mr. Speaker, as a result of the shale energy revolution, \nthe United States is benefiting from the economic and energy security \nand, I might add, environmental benefits of a natural gas abundance.\n  However, the EPA is threatening to take this energy advantage and \nmake it a disadvantage. The EPA is currently trying to further regulate \nthe byproduct of natural gas production, that of methane gas.\n  The EPA, under the Obama administration, is at its worst. The Obama \nadministration mission is clear: if it is not a ``green'' energy source \nthat he likes, it should not exist.\n  And Obama has proven that he will use the EPA to do all he can to \nmake it more difficult and expensive for American families to utilize \nthis incredibly wonderful source of natural gas that we have here in \nAmerica.\n  Lower energy prices for Americans, and we have also helped the \nenvironment.\n  So I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in opposing the \nburdensome mandates that will unnecessarily hinder natural gas \nproduction in the United States, thereby dismantling and diminishing \nthe energy advantage that we have today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5094-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5094-H5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CURES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, Friday afternoon of last week, this House \npassed what may well be the most important piece of legislation that \nwill be passed in our lifetimes. I am talking about H.R. 6, the 21st \nCentury Cures Act.\n  This is legislation that is to improve and enhance the discovery, \ndevelopment, and delivery of new medicines,\n\n[[Page H5095]]\n\nnew devices, lifesaving efforts that can bend the course of someone who \nis trapped right now in an intractable disease. We all know what they \nare: Alzheimer's, diabetes, recalcitrant cancers, heart disease.\n  What if we were to be able to solve one of these riddles? What a boon \nthat would be to the Federal budget because, as we can see, in the \noutyears of expenses for health care, it is nothing but up.\n  In May of 2012, Glen Campbell and his family came to the Library of \nCongress. They came and testified before the Senate, and they gave a \nvery moving presentation on why it was important to deal with diseases \nsuch as Alzheimer's. In fact, that night, when Glen Campbell gave a \nconcert at the Library of Congress--you can see him here with his \ndaughter Ashley as they were playing on stage--it was a wonderful \nreminder just what is at stake here.\n  What if we could provide one more time for a daughter to smile at her \nfather because we have found, finally, the cure for this intractable \ndisease?\n  It is time to get the Senate to move and get this done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5095-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  When an entrepreneur starts a business, one of the first challenges \nthey face is getting the money they need to produce their new product \nor patent their great idea.\n  For small businesses, this has remained a constant struggle. However, \nwe also know that small businesses are vital to our economic growth \nand, since the recession, have accounted for 60 percent of new net jobs \nin this country.\n  For these reasons, over 60 years ago Congress created the Small \nBusiness Administration, the SBA, and tasked it with the vital mission \nof ensuring that small businesses can get the capital they need.\n  The Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, program is a public-\nprivate partnership that provides small businesses access to equity and \ndebt financing.\n  It has been extremely successful over the years providing billions in \nprivate capital to help promising businesses grow into household names. \nPandora, Whole Foods, Apple, even Nike, were all small businesses that \nreceived early financing from the SBIC program.\n  In fiscal year 2014 alone, SBICs invested $5.46 billion in small \nfirms that employ approximately 113,000 workers all across America. In \nmy home State of Ohio, more than 2,000 people have jobs today because \nthe SBIC program helped small businesses there in Ohio access the \nresources that they needed to grow.\n  Under current law, successful SBICs under common control, frequently \ncalled the family of funds, are limited in the amount of funds they can \nprovide to small businesses.\n  By merely raising this cap from $225 million to $350 million, as this \nlegislation would do, we could stimulate up to $750 million a year in \ncapital that would be available to the next Nike or Apple. Given the \nvolatile fiscal climate, we can all agree that small businesses would \nbenefit from such a valuable increase in private investment.\n  H.R. 1023 increases this flow of private funds to small businesses at \nno cost--let me repeat--no cost to the taxpayer. The committee passed \nthis bill with bipartisan support, both Republican and Democrat \nsupport.\n  I want to thank several members of the Committee on Small Business \nfor their support and work on this bill, including Representatives \nBost, Chu, Curbelo, Gibson, Hahn, Hanna, Knight, Lawrence, Luetkemeyer, \nand Meng.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1023.\n  I want to thank Ileana--I want to thank Nydia Velazquez for her \nstrong leadership on this bill and much of the other bipartisan work \nthat we have done in the committee. Ileana is another Member who I \nstrongly support and admire greatly.\n  At this point, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  I, too, want to thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee \nfor working in a bipartisan way to craft this legislation.\n  Indeed, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is a good friend of mine from Florida. So \nI don't take any offense.\n  Small business investment companies have assisted thousands of high-\ngrowth companies over the years, providing nearly $75 billion in \ncapital.\n  By design, the program fills the gap in the capital markets for \nbusiness that has outgrown the SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loan program, but \nremain too small or too risky for traditional private equity markets to \nbear.\n  SBICs operate in a unique public-private partnership with SBA. Once \nmanagers raise enough private capital, the\n\n[[Page H5096]]\n\nagency provides matching funds, which are pooled together and invested \nin high-growth small businesses.\n  To maximize the impact of the program, the most successful fund \nmanagers are permitted to hold more than one SBIC license at a time, \nknown as a family of funds, with the benefit of drawing additional SBA \nleverage.\n  The current leverage caps, implemented in 2010, allow single \nlicensees to draw $175 million and family-of-fund licensees to draw \n$225 million. H.R. 1023, the Small Business Investment Company Capital \nAct of 2015, would increase that cap by an additional 55 percent to \n$350 million.\n  According to SBA data, only seven SBICs would be able to take \nadvantage of the increase, limiting the actual amount of capital that \nwill reach our small business community. The roughly 150 other SBIC \nfamilies are unlikely to ever need this increase.\n  Similarly, concentrating additional taxpayer-backed leverage in just \na few asset managers necessitates the need for more oversight. I look \nforward to working with the chairman to strike the right balance \nensuring this capital is deployed efficiently, but with less risk.\n  The SBIC program has done a lot of good for the small business \ncommunity over the years. In fact, since 2010, SBICs have quadrupled \ntheir output to over $3.4 billion last year alone, but it is still \ncoming up short in its assistance to women, minorities, and veterans.\n  These groups receive just 6 percent of total SBIC capital. It is my \nhope, as we work with the Senate on finalized language, steps can be \ntaken to address this inequity.\n  Providing ways to get more capital into the hands of small business \nowners is a top priority for both sides of the aisle in this committee.\n  I want to thank Chairman Chabot for introducing this legislation, and \nI am hopeful the increase in leverage will provide new capital \nopportunities to entrepreneurs from every walk of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n1023, the Small Business Investment Company Capital Act of 2015.\n  Small businesses serve as America's economic engine, driving \nessential job creation. In my Western New York district, small \nbusinesses provide the good-paying jobs that people need to support \ntheir families. However, we need to do more to encourage small business \ngrowth.\n  This legislation aids the SBIC program, which utilizes private \ninvestment funds to provide long-term loans and capital to small \nbusinesses in need. Without this vital program, many of the small \nbusinesses in our country would not be able to succeed.\n  Since inception, the SBIC program has invested $73 billion in more \nthan 118,000 U.S. small businesses. In western New York, this program \nhas supported companies like Gemcor in West Seneca and Synacor in \nBuffalo and is critical to the jobs they provide.\n  This crucial investment is why I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting H.R. 1023.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield \nmyself the balance of my time.\n  Since its creation in 1958, the SBIC program has injected billions of \ndollars into promising startups and small businesses.\n  With the help of the SBIC, some of these small businesses grow into \nFortune 500 companies. Apple, Inc., was once an SBIC client. Today it \nis one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization.\n  By providing businesses with capital to grow, the SBIC program has \nalso been a driver of job creation. In 2014 alone, the program helped \ncreate or retain 113,000 jobs.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and our colleagues in the \nSenate on this legislation. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me just reiterate the impact this minor \nchange could have on small businesses all across this country.\n  H.R. 1023 would increase the amount of capital available to small \nbusiness and enable well-managed SBICs, at no cost to the taxpayer, to \nincrease investment in small businesses.\n  This legislation is a commonsense, bipartisan reform, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1023.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1023, the \nSmall Business Investment Company Capital Act. As a co-sponsor of this \nbi-partisan legislation and a member of the Small Business Committee, I \nrecognize the importance of supporting small businesses and providing \nthem with resources for success. This bill provides small businesses \nwith such tools by raising the maximum debt that the Small Business \nAdministration can guarantee to borrowers in the Small Business \nInvestment Company, or SBIC program, from $225 million to $350 million.\n  Currently, 30% of SBICs in the program are hitting or approaching the \n$225 million cap, thus restricting them from further investment. This \nbill will allow SBICs to increase its cap by $125 million, allowing it \nto invest in many underserved companies, including those led by \nminorities, women, and veterans.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has stated that by adopting this \nbill, there is no expected additional cost to administer the program, \nnor will there be an additional cost to the taxpayer as businesses \nparticipating in the program pay fees that would offset such costs.\n  In the last five years, SBICs have invested more than $1.6 billion in \nmy home state of New York. Last year alone, over $5.46 billion was \ninvested in 1,085 companies and SBICs supported over 113,000 jobs.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  A natural disaster exposes us to the worst of nature. Yet, in some \npowerful way, it brings out the best in people. Communities ban \ntogether. Neighbors help neighbors, and volunteers donate their time \nand energy all in an effort to rebuild.\n  In the last decade, America has faced some of its worst natural \ndisasters, with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, more recently, Hurricane \nSandy in 2012.\n  In the aftermath of any disaster, it is imperative that the Federal \nGovernment programs operate as efficiently and effectively as possible \nso that victims are able to rebuild and return to their normal lives as \nsoon as possible.\n  Following Hurricane Sandy, there have been startling reports \nregarding the Small Business Administration's inability to properly \nadminister the disaster loan program. The SBA was unwilling to \nimplement and utilize preexisting statutory authority that would have \nassisted the agency in its response to Sandy.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. Speaker, despite our living in the Internet era with smartphones, \nemail, and apps, the SBA was shocked and surprised at the volume of \nelectronic disaster assistance applications it received, and the \nsystems were overwhelmed and unable to process applications. In a poor \npun, the SBA's disaster loan program was a disaster itself for the \nvictims of Hurricane Sandy.\n  The legislation before us, H.R. 208, is a corrective to those who \nsuffered twice--first, by a disaster and, second, by the SBA's \ninability to effectively provide disaster assistance.\n  As Congress did with those who suffered from Hurricanes Katrina, \nRita, and Wilma, this legislation would allow those in the areas \naffected by Sandy to apply for disaster assistance, irrespective of the \nartificial and nonbinding deadlines imposed by the SBA.\n  Further, given the struggles that the SBA had in responding to \nHurricane Sandy, H.R. 208 makes practical changes to the disaster loan \nprogram to help ensure that victims of future disasters do not suffer \nas those who felt the brunt of Sandy did.\n  For example, H.R. 208 requires the SBA to update their disaster plan \nto account for a disaster with extreme application volumes and allows \nthose affected by disasters to use SBA disaster loans to build safe \nrooms as a mitigating measure against future similar disasters.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation also makes smart changes to create \nparity among disaster victims by requiring the SBA to establish credit \nstandards so that similarly situated borrowers are treated in an \nidentical manner following a disaster.\n  These changes, among others, will ensure that the SBA is fully \ncapable of responding to the next catastrophic disaster. Unfortunately, \nwe all know there will be one or probably many.\n\n[[Page H5098]]\n\n  I want to thank Ranking Member Velazquez, once again, for her \nleadership on this issue and for working with me to develop a bill that \nstrives to ensure those affected by disasters can rebuild quickly.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 208, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in \n2012, New York City was one of the hardest hit areas. Thousands of \nhomes suffered damage, infrastructure was disrupted, and our city's \nsmall businesses were impacted physically and economically.\n  Mr. Speaker, 32,000 New Yorkers lost their jobs that November, losses \nmany economists attribute to the storm's economic impact. After \ndisasters like these, it is not uncommon for as many as 40 percent of \nimpacted small businesses to fail, depressing commerce and slowing the \noverall community's recovery.\n  The Small Business Administration's disaster lending functions are \nmeant to provide quick credit to small firms and homeowners that have \nbeen impacted by catastrophes. With entrepreneurs' and homeowners' \nlivelihoods at stake, it is vital that the SBA's disaster programs \noperate effectively. That is why, in 2008, after Katrina, Congress \npassed reforms meant to improve SBA's disaster response.\n  It became evident after Hurricane Sandy that there is still more work \nto be done. The Government Accountability Office, the inspector \ngeneral, and reports from Small Business Committee Democrats have all \ndocumented long delays in the processing and disbursement of loans.\n  Our committee found, for instance, that small businesses waited 46 \ndays to get their application processed by SBA, a threefold increase \nover previous Atlantic storms.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 208 takes steps to address these shortcomings and \nensure those affected by Hurricane Sandy are treated fairly. To begin, \nthe bill would allow small businesses to apply again for loans. As SBA \nwas so unprepared for a disaster of this scale, it is important that \nthose impacted have another chance at securing assistance.\n  The bill would also correct a number of the shortcomings that have \nheld back the SBA's programs from functioning smoothly. Businesses will \nno longer be prohibited from posting their assets as collateral. This \nis important as, previously, many entrepreneurs have had to use \npersonal assets for loan collateral. By reducing closing and \ndisbursement delays, H.R. 208 would ensure funds flow more swiftly to \nbusinesses after future catastrophes.\n  Lastly, the measure takes steps to require SBA to implement reforms \nCongress passed following Katrina. The fact is the agency has been \nwoefully slow in making these changes, and this law will help hold it \naccountable.\n  Mr. Speaker, our small businesses are counting on the SBA in times of \ncrises to provide badly needed help so they can recover quickly and \ncontinue supporting our local economies. This legislation, which enjoys \nbipartisan support, will help improve that process, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, when disasters strike, getting small businesses back on \ntheir feet quickly can help local economies recover. For that to \nhappen, the SBA's disaster lending initiatives must work as intended, \nproviding American capital to firms that have suffered physical and \neconomic damage.\n  The legislation we are considering would allow businesses that \nencountered delays to reapply for assistance and be made whole. It will \nimprove how the agency functions in the future, speeding help to small \nbusinesses and homeowners when they are most in need.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill, and it will do much good for \nentrepreneurs impacted by Sandy and for businesses impacted by future \ndisasters. I thank Chairman Chabot for his support on this legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in closing, we never know when and where the \nnext disaster will strike, but, unfortunately, we do know that there \nwill be more disasters. Given this, we must ensure that the SBA is \ntruly prepared to help victims in the aftermath of those disasters.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 208 rights the wrongs imposed by the SBA on those \nwho suffered from the effects of Sandy, but H.R. 208 does more than \njust correct past mistakes; it imposes obligations on the SBA to ensure \nthat the agency learns from history and does not repeat those mistakes \nso people in this country are actually helped next time and not harmed \nby the agency.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, earlier today I was pleased to \nsupport the Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program \nImprovement Act (H.R. 208). This legislation will provide assistance to \nboth homeowners and businesses that were utterly failed by the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA) in the aftermath of the Superstorm Sandy, \nopening up assistance eligibility for an additional year and making \nnecessary changes to the Disaster Loan Program.\n  Last week, I had the privilege of testifying before the House Small \nBusiness Committee regarding the hardships now faced by homeowners who \napplied for SBA disaster assistance due to a complete lack of \ninformation and disclosure in the loan process. This bill will help \nthose who did not even have the opportunity to obtain or file a loan \napplication due to SBA's serious incompetence and disorganization.\n  As the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported, SBA missed \nits timeliness goals by a longshot and is likely still unprepared for \nanother large-scale disaster. SBA was plagued by missed deadlines, \ndecision backlogs, computer systems failures, and insufficient \npersonnel training--problems that should not have come as a surprise in \nthe aftermath of SBA's abysmal response to Hurricane Katrina. Further, \nGAO found SBA could once again ``be unprepared for a large volume of \napplications to be submitted quickly following future disasters, which \nmay result in delays in loan funds for disaster victims.''\n  These failures cannot continue. Here we are more than two and a half \nyears following Sandy, still correcting failures that have slowed the \nrecovery process. In May, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA) reopened all Sandy-related flood insurance claims due to \nwidespread fraud and a complete lack of oversight of the National Flood \nInsurance Program (NFIP). These issues were completely foreseeable but \nwere not addressed, and Sandy victims continue to suffer as a result.\n  In addition to reopening the loan application process, H.R. 208 will \nreduce delays in closing and disbursement on loans, allow the \nconstruction of safe rooms, modify collateral requirements, increase \ntransparency, establish new performance measures, and require disaster \nplan improvements, among other commonsense changes. I commend Ms. \nVelazquez and Chairman Chabot for their leadership on this issue, and \nlook forward to working with them to further address necessary reforms \nto the SBA Disaster Loan Program.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 208, \nSuperstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act of \n2015. I appreciate the support and assistance of both Chairman Chabot \nand Ranking Member Velazquez to include my legislation, H.R. 2397, the \nTornado Family Safety Act of 2015 as part of this legislation.\n  The Small Business Administration is currently afforded the authority \nto issue physical disaster loans for 120 percent of the value of \nproperty destroyed but not covered by insurance. The purpose of the \nadditional 20 percent is so that individuals and business can modify \nstructures to reduce damage from future disasters. In Oklahoma, the \nthreat of tornadoes is ongoing, and we are always in between tornadoes. \nPlanning is essential in order to militate against damage and loss of \nlife.\n  It is for this reason that Section 4 is necessary. It reinforces the \nintent of Congress that already exists in statute--the SBA should \nalready be including the construction of safe rooms as a use for \nphysical disaster loans because it is mitigating measure. The SBA's \nexisting interpretation of existing language in the Small Business Act \nis incorrect.\n  Because of misinterpretation of this section previously, the SBA \nshould now understand that physical disaster loans can also be used for \nother types of storm shelters as well, including, but not limited to \nstructures that protect occupants from not only tornadoes, but from \nother natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires.\n  It is important to note that loans may not be used to upgrade homes \nor make additions unless as required by local building codes and \nsecondary or vacation homes are not eligible for these loans. The SBA \ndoes not duplicate insurance claim payments. Generally, loans are made \nover 30 years and interest rates are not more than 4 percent for those \ncannot obtain credit elsewhere and for those that can\n\n[[Page H5099]]\n\nobtain alternative credit, the rate does not exceed 8 percent for the \nloan.\n  While local and state governments have an obligation to meet the \nincrease in shelter demand, the construction of the shelters is \nexpensive. Under guidelines from the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency (FEMA) and the International Code Council (ICC), a safe room \nshould withstand 250 mph winds and the impact of a 15-pound plank \nhitting a wall at 100 mph, according to the Insurance Institute for \nBusiness and Home Safety.\n  Safe rooms designed to the FEMA and ICC standards are recommended for \nboth tornadoes and hurricanes. For individual homes, a safe room could \nrange anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000.\n  For anyone who has experienced Mother Nature's most indiscriminate \nand unpredictable terrors, you can truly understand the extent to which \nthey devastate lives and property.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I support Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster \nLoan Program Improvement Act of 2015. As I have stated before on the \nfloor of the House, I hope every Member reflects on the situation of \nour fellow Americans during a time of crisis or disaster. While we may \nhope that our communities remain peaceful and safe from crisis; we \ncertainly must support those that do not escape such natural and man-\nmade calamities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 208, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to improve \nthe disaster assistance programs of the Small Business \nAdministration.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5099-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5099-H5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MICROLOAN MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CHABOT.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the microloan program, overseen by the Small Business \nAdministration, the SBA, is designed to provide credit for those \nentrepreneurs that would not otherwise have any access to credit, even \nbasic revolving credit.\n  Among the SBA's capital access programs, the microloan program is \nunique because it also provides technical assistance to borrowers. It \nmerges the money with the know-how.\n  To borrow a sports reference, microloans punch above their weight. I \nknow the President has used that phrase on a number of occasions. These \nsmall-dollar loans are often the most difficult to receive and \ntypically are the deciding factors in an entrepreneur's ability to \nstart a business. This is demonstrated by the large number of first \ngeneration entrepreneurs who have received assistance under the \nmicroloan program.\n  Think about the number of successful individuals who recall starting \na business with funds pooled from family and friends. Well, if no one \nin your family has started a business or has money to lend, then that \nentrepreneur's dream quickly fades to a distant memory. This is \nparticularly true in traditionally underserved markets.\n  By making small-dollar loans less complicated and more accessible, we \nwill empower individuals to become entrepreneurs; lift up their \nfamilies; improve their communities; and, most importantly, create jobs \nfor a whole lot of Americans.\n  H.R. 2670 does that. This bill enhances the microloan program by \nallowing microloan intermediaries greater flexibility in providing \nloans and technical assistance to their borrowers. The expectation is \nthat the greater flexibility will result in greater participation by \nmicrolenders in the microloan program, thereby increasing the \navailability of critical small-dollar loans to these micro-\nentrepreneurs that punch above their size.\n  Despite the greater flexibility, H.R. 2670 also provides safeguards \nto maintain the primary feature of the program, and that is low-dollar \nloans offered to micro-entrepreneurs, along\n\n[[Page H5100]]\n\nwith intermediary-provided technical assistance.\n  By modernizing the microloan program, as H.R. 2670 does, we are \nallowing the little guy a chance to get off the ropes, use their \nskills, and create innovative ideas to compete with the heavyweights of \nAmerican industry. We all strive for a stronger, more competitive \neconomy; and this bill aids in that mission.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support once again.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2670, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, since 1991, the SBA microloan program has provided \nmillions of dollars in financing and technical assistance to small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs.\n  By providing loans to nonprofit intermediaries, who in turn lend \nfunds to the smallest of small businesses, the program helps borrowers \nstreamline their operations, grow to profitability, and create new \njobs.\n  However, the program remains substantially the same as when it was \nfirst enacted. Over the years, we have identified a number of the \nprogram elements that could be updated to better deploy capital.\n  With that goal in mind, I want to thank Congressman Moulton for \nintroducing this important legislation. The Microloan Modernization Act \nof 2015 will make a number of targeted improvements to assist small \nbusinesses.\n  For borrowers, SBA set the maximum term of a microloan at 6 years. \nParticularly for larger microloans, this has caused financial strain \ndue to higher monthly payments and is impeding some businesses from \ngrowing.\n  Today's bill would allow a repayment period of up to 10 years for \nloans greater than $10,000, providing borrowers with the flexibility to \nbetter manage cash flow, improve operations, and create more jobs. \nSimilarly, SBA has prohibited lines of credit; yet not all businesses \nneed a fixed-rate term loan.\n  A line of credit is sometimes the better product for a microbusiness \nthat has cyclic or uneven cash flow. Today's bill will give borrowers \nand lenders the flexibility to get them in the right loan product for \ntheir needs.\n  For intermediary lenders, today's bill would create a new waiver to \nthe 25-75 rule that restricts the use of technical assistance grants. \nThis waiver process will help intermediaries more efficiently deploy \ntechnical assistance funding.\n  Additionally, the legislation will raise the lending cap by 20 \npercent. By giving successful intermediaries access to an additional $1 \nmillion in SBA funding, they will be able to serve more borrowers in \nhigh-demand areas.\n  The microloan program fills a critical gap in the capital markets, \nhelping underserved businesses that are too small for the banking \nsector yet too big to finance with a credit card or loans from friends \nand family.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Moulton for introducing \nthis bill. It will go a long way toward increasing access to capital \nfor our Nation's small businesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just would like to point out the fact that 62 percent \nof microborrowers are women and minorities, and so this is filling an \nimportant gap that exists for these groups to access capital.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  I thank the gentleman for introducing this important piece of \nlegislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Energy and Trade of the Committee on Small Business.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business for yielding, and I also thank him for his \nleadership on all of these important issues. I also want to commend the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton) for his work on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2670, the Microloan Modernization \nAct of 2015. The microloan program is unique due to its focus on \nmerging technical assistance with access to capital. For several micro-\nentrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved markets, this offers a \nway to get the small dollar loans, which a conventional bank would \notherwise deny, while learning important skills, such as developing a \nbusiness plan, that will be critical as the company finds success and \ngrows.\n  Last year alone, the microloan program was responsible for providing \nnearly $56 million in capital and aiding small businesses in creating \nor retaining 15,000 jobs.\n  However, after listening to several entrepreneurs and microloan \nintermediaries, it became clear that for the microloan program to truly \ntap into its potential, changes were necessary.\n  H.R. 2670 strives to make those changes and better support \nentrepreneurs. For example, currently, the statute says that microloan \nintermediaries may make short-term fixed-rate loans to small firms. \nShort term can mean different things to different people, but according \nto SBA regulations, short term means 6 years.\n  While in some instances this may make sense when the loan is a lower \namount, this one-size-fits-all approach is not beneficial to small \nfirms. This bill would remedy that by establishing maximum term limits \nfor loans made by intermediaries to their borrowers: 6 years for loans \nunder $10,000, and 10 years for loans over $10,000.\n  While this may seem like a minor change, we all know that allowing \nborrowers to get the best repayment terms possible is crucial for \nensuring low default rates and increasing participation in the \nmicroloan program.\n  Mr. Speaker, in summary, this is a commonsense, bipartisan reform \nthat will increase access to capital for those most challenged to \nreceive--our micro-entrepreneurs.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I congratulate \nMr. Moulton for advancing this bill and Chairman Chabot for bringing it \nto the House floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2670 and remind them that the \nreason we in the Small Business Committee work so hard for these \nentrepreneurs, for these people that are making a difference, is \nbecause they hire those in our society, in our communities, that most \nneed jobs. Think of the college graduate who is looking for a job; \nthink of the immigrant who arrived in this country and is looking for a \nway forward. It is small businesses that oftentimes give these people \ntheir first shot at success.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the sponsor of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Velazquez for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we often say that small businesses are the engine of \neconomic growth. That is true; and if you look at the data, new \nbusinesses--those younger than 5 years old--created nearly all of our \neconomy's new jobs in the past two decades.\n  In order to create the conditions for job creation, the Federal \nGovernment must increase access to capital so new entrepreneurs with a \ngood idea can take a risk and start a new business. The Small Business \nAdministration's microloan program fills a critical gap in the capital \nmarkets, helping underserved businesses that are too small for the \nbanking sector yet too big to finance with a credit card or loans from \nfriends and family.\n  The program has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in financing \nand technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs, but the \nprogram is in need of reform. That is why I introduced H.R. 2670, the \nMicroloan Modernization Act of 2015, which will make a number of \ntargeted improvements to the program so more borrowers can benefit from \naccess to capital.\n  First, the bill increases the loan limit cap for intermediary \nlenders. Many successful intermediaries have hit the current $5 million \ncap and, as a result, deserving small businesses are denied capital \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  Second, the bill extends the loan repayment period for loans greater \nthan $10,000. This small change will provide borrowers with the \nflexibility to better manage cash flow, improve operations, and create \nmore jobs.\n\n[[Page H5101]]\n\n  Third, the bill permits lines of credit, which are currently \nprohibited by the SBA. Not all businesses need a fixed-rate term loan. \nSometimes a more flexible line of credit is the better product for a \nsmall business that has cyclic or uneven cash flow.\n  Fourth, the bill creates a waiver for an overly rigid technical \nassistance formula known as the 25/75 rule to help intermediaries \ndeploy technical assistance more efficiently.\n  Lastly, the bill commissions two studies to explore ways to \nincentivize intermediaries to participate in the microloan program and \ndetermine if mandatory savings accounts would benefit entrepreneurs.\n  The microloan program supported nearly 4,000 small businesses just \nlast year, and two of these successful businesses are located in Lynn, \nMassachusetts, in my district. Prism Products, an industrial \ndistributor, received a microloan from the SBA to purchase extra \ninventory. As a result of the loan, owner Lisa Fitzpatrick was able to \nincrease revenue and hire a sales professional with 15 years of \nexperience.\n  In 2013, local restaurateurs Shawn and Noyan Edmond fulfilled their \nlifelong dream of opening a Caribbean restaurant in downtown Lynn. The \nmicroloan enabled the Edmonds to purchase new kitchen equipment and \nmake renovations to the storefront of Rite Spice Caribbean.\n\n  As our economy recovers from the recession, we need more people like \nthe Edmonds and Lisa Fitzpatrick to take a risk and start a business, \nand we need the SBA microloan program to help them. That is why the \nMicroloan Modernization Act of 2015 is so critical.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my ranking member, Nydia Velazquez, \nfor her work on this bill; my chairman, Steve Chabot; and my \ncolleagues, Representatives Curbelo, Chu, Takai, and Radewagen, for \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support America's newest entrepreneurs and \nvote ``yes'' on this important legislation.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The microloan program provides very small loans to start-up, newly \nestablished, or growing small businesses. Many of these businessowners \ncome from traditionally underserved markets, where personal and \ncommercial credit is hard to come by.\n  As a result, the SBA's microloan program is a critical resource that \nnot only injects much-needed capital, but provides the necessary \nbusiness training that ensures borrowers are equipped with the \nknowledge needed to succeed.\n  Since the end of the recession, microlending is up 25 percent \nnationwide. By the way, for the last couple of years, the default rate \non microloans is going down. In fact, SBA requested an additional $10 \nmillion for next year to handle demand. I can think of no better time \nto make long-sought changes to improve the program's efficiency and \ncapital deployment.\n  I wanted to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for introducing \nthe Microloan Modernization Act of 2015. It will give borrowers new \nrepayment flexibility and loan choices, provide more flexibility to \nintermediaries, and inject additional capital in high-demand areas.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, as we work to get capital into the hands of \nentrepreneurs, we need to keep SBA programs relevant. We also must \nensure that our lending partners have the flexibility to manage their \nloan portfolios in a way that makes the most sense for the borrower. \nH.R. 2670 does that.\n  I want to thank Mr. Moulton and Mr. Curbelo for their leadership on \nthese reforms. And I once again want to recognize the ranking member, \nMs. Velazquez, for her leadership and her cooperation in getting this \ntype of legislation to the floor today so that we can pass this.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2670, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2670.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5101-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5101-H5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VETERANS ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CHABOT.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Every day, American soldiers are risking their lives and leaving \nfamily and friends and loved ones behind to protect our freedoms and \ndefend the United States. Currently, there are over 21 million veterans \nliving all across the United States. When these brave men and women \nreturn home, they strive to transition seamlessly, hopefully, back into \ntheir civilian lives.\n  Veterans face challenges in that transition, one of those being \nemployment. Our most recent veterans who have served in Active Duty at \nany time since September 2001 have a higher unemployment rate than the \naverage civilian. In particular, our recent female veterans have an \nunemployment rate that is over twice the national average.\n  While finding employment upon transition to civilian life is a \nchallenge,\n\n[[Page H5102]]\n\nmany veterans find that skills learned during military service \ntranslate well into entrepreneurship. Yet many veterans have found it \ndifficult to obtain the funds needed to start a small business.\n  In looking for ways to finance their new businesses, veterans may \nturn to the Small Business Administration, the SBA, for loan \nassistance. In fiscal year 2014, veterans received over 2,000 7(a) \nloans, totaling almost $600 million, but I believe we can do more to \nget these loans into the hands of veterans. Already the SBA \nAdministrator is using her authority to waive certain fees charged to \nveterans.\n  One way to increase veterans' access to capital is to make SBA loans \nmore affordable for veterans by permanently waiving the up-front fee \ncharged by the SBA to borrowers through the agency's 7(a) express loan \nprogram. H.R. 2499 does just that, all at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  H.R. 2499 strikes a delicate balance between providing a fee waiver \nto help America's veterans while safeguarding scarce taxpayer dollars \nby creating an exception to the fee waiver in any year where an \nappropriation is necessary to cover the cost of the overall 7(a) loan \nprogram. This ensures that this fee waiver will never have a cost to \nthe taxpayer.\n  I believe, as many Americans do, that we must support our veterans, \nand this legislation provides support to veteran entrepreneurs for \nyears to come at no cost. It is a smart, commonsense approach which had \nbroad bipartisan support and passed out of our committee by a voice \nvote, meaning basically everyone supported it on the committee.\n  Further, this bill has support from major veterans' groups who are \nwell aware of the challenges that brave veterans face in transitioning \nto civilian life.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2499, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Veterans play a significant role in the U.S. economy. They own 2.4 \nmillion businesses, employ 5.8 million people, and have generated well \nover $1 trillion in receipts.\n  Like most small businesses, access to capital is still hard to come \nby, yet is vital to their existence, paving the way for growth and \ncontinued job creation. As the Federal Government's main provider of \nsmall business assistance, the SBA guarantees loans to veteran-owned \nbusinesses through a number of lending programs.\n  In 2013, the agency's 7(a) program provided over 2,000 veterans with \nloans, totaling $600 million. This, however, represented only 4 percent \noverall. In an effort to increase veteran lending volume, the SBA has \nwaived the borrower fees paid by veterans on small-dollar and SBA \nExpress loans.\n  In 2014, the impact of the waiver was a mixed bag. While veterans saw \na 23 percent increase in loans of $150,000 or less, the program \nexperienced an 8 percent decrease in veteran loans overall. The \ninitiative has had more success this year with veteran lending seeing a \n20 percent increase, which is outpacing the 7(a) program's overall \ngrowth.\n  To build on that trend, H.R. 2499 will make the fee waiver permanent \nfor veterans who are seeking an SBA Express loan. It will reduce costs, \nspur more veterans to borrow, and, in turn, will grow businesses and \ncreate jobs.\n  I want to thank Chairman Chabot for introducing this bill to keep \nmore dollars in veteran entrepreneurs' hands. We know that every little \nbit counts when trying to start or to grow a small business, and I \ncannot think of a group that is more deserving than that of our \nveterans.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Knight).\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2499, the \nVeterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015.\n  This will expand opportunities for veterans who return home and want \nto apply their skills and disciplines in starting businesses.\n  What we are doing today is talking about letting our leaders who are \nout in the field and are defending our Nation come home and do the same \nthing here, bring their entrepreneurial skills and bring their \nleadership skills to small business, to the business industry, and to \ndo it in the way they have done when protecting the Nation.\n  Our fighting men and women are uniquely inclined to succeed in \nbusiness ventures. They are hard workers and natural leaders and are \ntrained to build teams and to think critically in high-pressure \nenvironments.\n  Veteran-owned small businesses make up about 9 percent of all small \nfirms and nearly 4 million businesses, with average annual revenues of \nalmost $500,000. These are people who know how to succeed. These are \npeople who know how to lead.\n  This bill is just taking away some of the obstacles, making it a \nlittle bit easier for our leaders to come back into the \nentrepreneurship of America and succeed.\n  While the economic environment is improving generally, some of our \nvets are having a tough time getting access to the funds they need to \nput their skills into action.\n  Particularly, female veterans are dealing with outsized obstacles in \ntransitioning to the private sector. The unemployment rate for women \nwarfighters who have come home from Iraq and Afghanistan is 11.4 \npercent, more than twice that of what our male veterans' national \naverage is.\n  It is time we turned our attention to addressing the problems faced \nby our veteran entrepreneurs, who have made such tremendous sacrifices \nand who want to continue to pursue the American Dream.\n  This bill takes a prudent, responsible step in harnessing their \nskills and expertise in order to add value to the economy and in \nlowering the barriers for these trained leaders to get their ideas off \nthe ground.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, the 7(a) loan program \nprovides a critical source of capital for our veterans.\n  This year the SBA lending to veteran-owned firms is on track to \nexceed $1 billion for the first time ever. Today's bill will save \nveterans millions of dollars every year at no cost to the taxpayers.\n  That means that veteran-owned businesses can invest or reinvest this \nmoney into their businesses. Our Nation's veterans are some of the most \nprolific small business creators, establishing thousands of firms every \nyear.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Chabot for taking steps to expand \naccess to capital for this important group of job creators. I look \nforward to working with him and our colleagues in the Senate to move \nthis legislation forward.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff \nof the Small Business Committee for their hard work, especially a staff \nmember on my side, Justin Pelletier.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In \nclosing, I would, first of all, like to acknowledge that Mr. Knight, \nwho just spoke, is a veteran himself, and we certainly appreciate his \nservice to our country.\n  Again, I want to stress that H.R. 2499 will provide greater \nassistance to our veterans without imposing any additional costs on \ntaxpayers.\n  The enactment of H.R. 2499 then represents only a small token of the \nappreciation that we can show to our veterans as they take their skills \nlearned through service to create small businesses that will help \ncreate jobs, thus serving our country a second time. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2499.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2499, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n[[Page H5103]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5103-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5103-H5104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH TRIBAL LAND EXCHANGE ACT\n\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(H.R. 387) to provide for certain land to be taken into trust for the \nbenefit of Morongo Band of Mission Indians, and for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Morongo Band of Mission Indians, a tribe located about 20 miles \nwest of Palm Springs, California, along with the city of Banning and a \nprivate property owner who resides in California together have asked \nCongress to enact H.R. 387, providing for the exchange of certain lands \nwithin or adjacent to the Morongo Reservation.\n  The bill also directs the Secretary of the Interior to grant an \neasement to the city of Banning for the use of certain lands currently \nheld in trust on behalf of the tribe. The easement will provide the \ncity with the ability to install electric, sewer, water, and related \nutility lines to accommodate commercial activity in the area.\n  This bill will accomplish three goals. First, it will promote the \nconsolidation of the tribe's reservation lands. Second, it will resolve \na land use dispute between a private landowner, the city, and the \ntribe. Third and finally, it will facilitate commercial development on \nlands adjacent to the tribe's reservation, which will be beneficial for \nthe city of Banning and the tribe as well as for the private landowner.\n  This bill truly represents a win-win-win agreement without any of the \nparties having to compromise their desired goals.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am proud to rise in support of my bill, H.R. 387, the Economic \nDevelopment Through Tribal Land Exchange Act.\n  This non-controversial, bipartisan bill passed unanimously out of the \nHouse Natural Resources Committee and is supported by the Department of \nthe Interior. The bill would aid economic development in the city of \nBanning, California, through a land swap that is supported by all of \nthe parties involved.\n  Currently, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and a private \nlandowner, Mr. Lloyd Fields, would like to exchange two parcels of land \nwhich are nearly identical in size and value, but they are restrained \nfrom doing so because one of the parcels is currently held in trust by \nthe United States on behalf of the tribe.\n  My bill facilitates an equitable land swap between the Morongo tribe \nand the landowner to provide more consolidated reservation land for the \ntribe and commercial development opportunities for the landowner, the \ncity of Banning, and Riverside County.\n  This bill serves as a model for how land use issues can be addressed \nby communities coming together while upholding the sacred government-\nto-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian \ntribes.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Robert Martin of the Morongo Band of \nMission Indians and the city of Banning for bringing this issue to my \nattention.\n  I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Paul Cook from \nCalifornia, for being an original cosponsor, and Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia for introducing the bill in the Senate.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member \nGrijalva for expediting this bill through committee so that we could \nbring it to the floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the type of bill that we can all support for the \nsimple reason that it benefits all parties involved and spurs economic \ndevelopment and job creation.\n  We passed this bill unanimously on the floor last year. Let's move it \nonce again. I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 387.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, in closing, this just basically shows that you \ncan actually get some things done at the local, State, and Federal \nlevels.\n  This battle has been going on for a long while. I used to represent \nthe area when I was in the State House. And when you can finally get \nall of the parties together and work in a bipartisan fashion, good \nthings can happen.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is a clear example, as Representative Paul Cook said, of two \nneighboring districts from different parties coming together for the \nbenefit of economic development, for the betterment of our tribes, and \nfor the betterment of our counties.\n  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my colleague, \nRepresentative Paul Cook, for his support of this legislation, as well \nas to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for their work \nto bring this non-controversial bill to the floor before the end of the \nsummer.\n\n[[Page H5104]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Torres), my friend and colleague, who also sits on the Indian, \nInsular and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Ms. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 387, which directs \nthe Secretary of the Interior to take certain land into trust for the \nbenefit of Morongo Band of Mission Indians.\n  This legislation is a commonsense approach that will benefit the \ntribe, the city of Banning, and the larger local economy. Taking land \ninto trust on behalf of tribes is one of the visible and impactful \nactions our government can undertake to uphold our trust obligations to \nthe 567 sovereign tribal nations around the country.\n  Indian lands are critical for the exercise of tribal self-governance \nand self-determination and often represent great spiritual and cultural \nsignificance to tribal nations.\n  This bill represents an opportunity for the Morongo Band of Mission \nIndians to consolidate their land base and provide for their people \nwhile also resolving longstanding disputes that will clear the way for \nincreased private economic development opportunities for the region. \nThis legislation is a win-win for the tribe, the city, and private \nenterprise.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia, Norma Torres, for her remarks in support of the bill. I \nwould like to thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to again thank \nRepresentative Paul Cook for his support of this legislation.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for \ntheir work to bring this noncontroversial bill to the floor before the \nend of the summer. I look forward to working together in the future on \nadditional legislation to provide our tribal nations with the tools to \ncreate their own economic opportunity through self-determination and \nself-governance.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together, once again, and pass this \ncommonsense bill that will create jobs and spur economic development \nfor the Morongo Tribe and the city of Banning. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. \n387.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 387.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5104-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Tennessee?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 179, a bill to name a post office in \nChisholm, Minnesota, after a very distinguished former Member of this \nbody, Congressman James Oberstar.\n  The bill was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, and our colleague \nCongressman Richard Nolan has introduced House companion legislation.\n  Mr. Oberstar served in the House for a remarkable 36 years, and I \nthink it is very fitting and appropriate to honor his legacy by lending \nhis name to a post office in his hometown of Chisolm.\n  Congressman Oberstar was born in Chisholm, Minnesota, on September \n10, 1934, and graduated from the high school there in 1952. Four years \nlater, he earned a bachelor of arts from the University of St. Thomas \nin St. Paul, Minnesota. He later earned a master's degree from the \nCollege of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. A lot of people knew he was very \nfluent in French and liked to express himself on many trips in French.\n  Before running for Congress himself, Congressman Oberstar served on \nthe staff for Congressman John Blatnik of Minnesota from 1963 to 1974. \nIn that capacity, he worked with Congressman Blatnik on all of the \nlegislation from the Public Works and Transportation Committee. In the \nlast 3 years he was with Congressman Blatnik, Congressman Oberstar \nbecame the chief of staff for that committee.\n  Congressman Oberstar was first elected to represent the people of \nMinnesota's Eighth District in 1974. Among many notable achievements, \nhe served as chairman of the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In total, he served \nin 18 Congresses.\n  Sadly, Mr. Oberstar passed away on May 3, 2014, in Potomac, Maryland. \nHe certainly was a devoted public servant who left a remarkable legacy \nof service to the citizens of Minnesota and the United States.\n  Earlier in this Congress, there was another tribute for Congressman \nOberstar. At that time, I said this:\n\n       It is an astounding figure to think that a man worked on \n     this one committee for 47 years of his life, but he did so \n     with great honor and distinction. In fact, I think most \n     everybody knew that there was no one in the Congress and \n     probably never has been anyone in the history of the Congress \n     who has known transportation issues and understood them and \n     worked on them longer and harder and with more effectiveness \n     than Jim Oberstar did.\n       At one point, he was chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. \n     In 1994, after the election, the Republicans took control, \n     and I had the honor of becoming the chairman of the Aviation \n     Subcommittee, and I served for 6 years in that position, \n     which was the maximum allowable on our side.\n       When I took over as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, \n     I frequently heard Jim Oberstar referred to as ``Mr. \n     Aviation.'' So I went to him and asked for his help, and he \n     helped me, guided me, and gave me advice that, to this day, I \n     appreciate very much. He did so in a very kind and humble \n     way.\n\n  Of course, then he reached the pinnacle and became chairman of that \ncommittee, a committee that he loved. He was a great chairman. He \nworked across the aisle in a very bipartisan way, and I think he tried \nto help everyone on both sides of the aisle and others in any way that \nhe possibly could.\n  I just wanted to join in this opportunity to pay tribute to a man who \nwas a great American and a great Member of this body, Congressman James \nOberstar.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I certainly associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Duncan.\n  I am asking my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 179. That is \nthe bill that would designate a United States post office located at 14 \n3rd Avenue Northwest in Jim Oberstar's hometown, Chisholm, Minnesota; \nand it would be called the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am speaking today for a memorial for Jim Oberstar not \nonly because of my position on the committee, but for me, this is an \nact of love and respect. I am speaking for a man known in this House as \none of singular intellect and personal qualities.\n  Jim was a native of Chisholm. He graduated--and anybody who knew Jim \nwill not be surprised at this--summa cum laude from the University of \nSt. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota; then he got a master's degree in \nBelgium. That may be where he picked up his French, which he playfully \nused on us at every opportunity.\n  Jim was not long out of college when he began working in this House, \nand working in this House was to determine his destiny for the rest of \nhis life. He first served as clerk of the Committee on Rivers and \nHarbors, as it was then called. He became administrator of the \nCommittee on Public Works--now called Transportation and \nInfrastructure--when Representative John Blatnik became chairman in \n1970.\n  Four years later, Jim, himself, ran for Congress, succeeding Mr. \nBlatnik who retired from Minnesota's Eighth District of Congress. Then \nJim served 36 extraordinary years in this House, and he became the \nlongest serving Member from Minnesota in the House of Representatives. \nDuring that period, Jim Oberstar became the leading expert on \ntransportation and infrastructure in the Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, for example, he served as chairman of the Subcommittee \non Aviation when it passed legislation, increasing our investment in \nairports and air security, which we are still benefiting from.\n  Later, he became ranking member of the full committee. There, he \nworked\n\n[[Page H5106]]\n\ntirelessly for something we are trying to get in this House now, for \nthat gas user fee, which used to be bipartisan and was often raised and \nhelped Jim and those who served with him improve and make our system \nreliable on the transportation and infrastructure that we so often \ncelebrate today--and I mean, all of it, roads, bridges, and transit \nalike.\n  We were very fortunate when in 2007, Jim Oberstar was elected \nchairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was \nduring his chairmanship that the economy went down; and we really \nneeded an expert on transportation and infrastructure, since investment \nin transportation and infrastructure is the best investment for the \ndollar during a recession and that, of course, was the deepest \nrecession since the Great Depression.\n  Jim's work during that period is still blossoming in the States. He \nheld 300 hearings and passed almost 300 bills and resolutions out of \ncommittee and through the House. Nearly 200 of those pieces of \nlegislation were approved by both Houses, including the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, the bill that authorized the maintenance and \nconstruction of America's harbors, as well as funding for important \nwildlife habitat projects.\n  Mr. Speaker, Jim also was a cyclist. He took transportation \nseriously. He cycled on the trails that he helped get built and that he \nso loved. His knowledge of our work was so encyclopedic that Democrats \nand Republicans alike, when Jim spoke, listened hard because they knew \nthey were getting a once-in-a-lifetime lesson in the complexities \nassociated with transportation and infrastructure in our country. He \nwas a particular leader on intermodalism, which we know as the \ntransportation wave of the future today.\n  It was with enormous sadness that we learned that Jim Oberstar passed \naway on May 2, 2014. He was 79 years old. Jim will long be remembered \nfor his dedication to public service and for leaving his mark on \ntransportation in our country. It is a mark that will never be erased.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), a sponsor of the House companion \nof S. 179, a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee \nand the gentleman who represents the very same district that Jim \nOberstar represented.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Duncan \nand Representative Norton for the fine tributes to a fine Member and a \nreal credit to this institution.\n  This bill honors our friend and our colleague, the late Jim Oberstar, \nin an important way, by naming the United States post office in his \nhometown of Chisholm, Minnesota, the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post \nOffice.\n  I will never forget the first day that Jim walked into the Chamber \nthrough one of the side doors over here as a former Member of Congress. \nAs he walked in and proceeded down the aisle, Members recognized him, \nand they started spontaneously, Democrats and Republicans alike, to \napplaud Jim Oberstar.\n  By the time he got to the well, the whole House was engaged in this \nspontaneous, bipartisan, genuine, loving, and appreciative applause for \nJim Oberstar. I, quite frankly, have never seen anything like it. I \nhope to see a lot more things like it in the days to come, but what a \nremarkable moment that was.\n  It was a real genuine spirit of affection for someone who worked \nreally hard, knew his material as well or better than anyone, and was \nsuch a good nonpartisan when it came to what is good for America; I \nhave never quite seen anything like it.\n  Jim received more honors than he could count in life; quite frankly, \nhe received even more in his passing, but I think it is safe to say \nthat no honor would please him more than being recognized by his \ncolleagues in the hometown of Chisholm where Jim grew up.\n  Chisholm, on Minnesota's Iron Range, is where he learned the value of \nideas as a star on his high school debate team. They say he was a \npretty good football player, too, but he liked to recall that the \neditor of his hometown said to him on a couple of occasions, ``Jim, you \nare a really good debater. You really know how to argue. You might want \nto keep working at that''--and how fitting that he would end up in the \nCongress of the United States.\n  It is also in Chisholm where he learned about public service with his \nfirst working job for that editor, peddling papers to the miners and to \nthe mining families and learning about the politics of the community. \nIt is also where he learned hard work from his parents. Jim's dad \nworked in the mines his entire life and hardly ever missed a day's \nwork.\n  Chisholm is also the place where Jim learned those old-fashioned \nvalues that brought him to the House of Representatives.\n  He believed that a good idea was a good idea, and it didn't matter if \nit was a Republican idea or a Democratic idea. All that mattered was \nthat someone had offered the idea; and he had such enormous respect for \nthe process and for his colleagues that he gave every good idea an \nopen, an honest, and a fair hearing.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  And if it turned out to be something good for the Nation, why, it was \ngood enough for Jim, regardless of the origin.\n  So, in urging my colleagues to honor Jim by passing this bill, I \nwould like to ask that we honor him by rededicating ourselves to that \nspirit of bipartisanship, that spirit of working together, that spirit \nof getting things done that enabled Jim Oberstar to accomplish the many \nthings that he did that were cited by my colleagues here just a few \nmoments ago. That was the spirit that epitomized Jim Oberstar, and that \nis how he was so successful in getting things done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the time.\n  I rise to honor the late Jim Oberstar, the Congressman from \nMinnesota's Eighth District.\n  For 36 years, Jim Oberstar proudly served the residents of \nMinnesota's Eighth Congressional District. During his decades of \nservice on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \nRepresentative Oberstar made investing in the future prosperity of this \ncountry a top priority.\n  His commitment to laying the foundation for a 21st century \ntransportation system helped make travel safer and kept millions of \nAmericans working on the job and strengthened our economy. He worked \nand accomplished all of that.\n  On August 1, 2007, the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed in Minnesota. \nThirteen people lost their lives, including some of my constituents, \nand many more were injured.\n  Chairman Oberstar moved with incredible speed to draft legislation to \nrespond to the tragedy, and within 48 hours, he had passed a bill on \nthe floor. On August 6, less than 1 week after the disaster, funding \nfor construction of a new bridge was signed into law.\n  But he didn't stop there. Chairman Oberstar worked to call attention \nto the epidemic of weak bridges all across our country. He fought to \nmake bridge repair and replacement the focus of the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act of 2009. Because of his commitment, thousands of \nbridges were thoroughly inspected, repaired, or, in fact, replaced.\n  Not that Jim's response was anything out of the ordinary, throughout \nhis career, Jim remained committed to fighting for the people he served \nand the causes he believed in.\n  It is fitting that the post office in Chisholm, Minnesota, will be \nnamed the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office, because we know the \nsuccess of a post office, after all, is inextricably linked with \ninterstate highways, runways, docks, railways, and roads, because that \nis how the mail gets delivered and that is how we are connected \nthroughout this world.\n\n[[Page H5107]]\n\n  The imprint left by Congressman Jim Oberstar on every mode of \ntransportation throughout our country cannot be overstated.\n  And if I may, on a personal note, Jim, both professionally and \npersonally, helped give the new Congresswoman from Minnesota a lot of \nthanks.\n  So, with that, I want to just say, again, it is more than appropriate \nthat the post office in his hometown of Chisholm, Minnesota, be known \nas the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building, a testament to \nhis life's work.\n  Jim, we thank you.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 179, to honor the \nmemory of Jim Oberstar, a colleague, mentor, and friend to me and to \nmany more.\n  From his time serving as a staff member to his tenure as the chairman \nof the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Jim spent \nevery day of his 47 years on Capitol Hill working to improve our \nNation's infrastructure and, in turn, the lives of Americans across the \ncountry.\n  I was proud to serve with Jim on the T and I Committee for 4 years \nand to share in his passion for all the things that help ensure that \nour quality of life is high and that our economy is strong.\n  Jim's thoughtful, forward-thinking approach to our Nation's \ninfrastructure needs was built from years of experience and careful \ndeliberation, and it earned him the well-deserved nickname, Mr. \nTransportation. During his time as chairman, committee members knew \nthat they were going to learn something when they arrived at the \ncommittee room, and they are going to leave on a mission.\n  Jim was truly a visionary when it came to our Nation's infrastructure \nsystem, but he didn't just talk about what needed to be done. Whether \nit was modernizing our Nation's airspace, improving rail safety, moving \nfreight on time, repairing our roads, rehabilitating transit systems, \nor advancing cycling, Jim got things done. That is because Jim had a \ntireless work ethic and was as a great leader and friend as he was a \npolicy expert. Jim treated people well, and it didn't matter whether \nyou were Republican or Democrat; he was willing to work with you and \nhelp your district and constituents.\n  My bicycle is a fixture in my office, and its presence reminds me of \nJim and the time I spent cycling with him, when I learned more than I \never expected to be able to learn on a bike ride.\n  Jim was known for his love of the French language, and he spoke it \nflawlessly. What fewer people know is that Jim perfected his French \nwhile serving in a volunteer program that preceded the Peace Corps. He \nwas teaching French and Creole to Americans helping out in Haiti.\n  Jim loved helping people. He was a big promoter of adoption and a \ndefender of life. It was all an outgrowth, I believe, of his strong \nCatholic faith.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress and the Nation are better because of Jim \nOberstar, and those of us who worked closely with him are better public \nservants, colleagues, and people because of him. S. 179 is a fitting \ntribute to Jim Oberstar, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the ranking member and the \nmanager of this legislation.\n  I have had the privilege of being here during the mighty leadership \nof Jim Oberstar, and I would really call him America's Congressperson.\n  He would be an eloquent spokesperson today for not isolating his \nadvocacy for his own region or State, but he would rise up on the floor \nof the House to speak eloquently about the need for the refurbishing, \nthe rebuilding, the restoration of America's infrastructure, \ntransportation infrastructure, from highways and bridges and dams to \nairports and train stations and tracks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just came in today from Philadelphia on Amtrak, and as \nyou know, on trains, we engage with our fellow travelers. I guess we \nare called passengers, but we are fellow travelers.\n  It was interesting to engage with these constituents of America who \nwere using this mode of transportation. They made a very valuable \npoint. They said it is not the equipment of Amtrak or whether the Acela \ncan move faster than any other train, it is the infrastructure upon \nwhich the train travels. It is the train tracks. It is the investment \nin that infrastructure to make Amtrak what it needs to be.\n  Now, Congressman Oberstar certainly did not live in this part of the \ncountry, but he could see the general landscape of what America needed.\n  I was very interested in hearing my colleague from Minnesota speak of \nthat time when the bridge collapsed. What a tragic incident. All of us \nwere appalled and saddened, and it was amazing how ``General \nOberstar,'' if you will, took the leadership role to help America.\n  So I rise today to support this underlying legislation and to simply \nthank him and to thank his family for sharing Jim Oberstar, the \nFrenchman, as he would like to say.\n  And in concluding my remarks, might I say ``merci beaucoup'' to you, \nto the late Jim Oberstar, a man who loved America and could be called \nAmerica's Congressperson.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, Jim Oberstar was a rare Member. He managed to awe us by \nhis knowledge at the same time that he nurtured us with his warmth and \nhis kindness. That is why you have heard Members speak so eloquently \nabout him today. He left his mark in this House.\n  I am very pleased that, with this bill, he will leave his own mark in \nhis own hometown with a memorial, a post office named for Jim Oberstar. \nI urge Members of this House to vote for this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I will just close by saying that I am very grateful to Jim Oberstar. \nHe helped me obtain many things for my district. His last year in \nCongress, in August of that year, he came to my district to dedicate a \nbeautiful new transit center which the city of Knoxville was kind \nenough to name after me. I always was grateful for his spending that \nday with me in Knoxville.\n  I can tell you that I am now in my 27th year in Congress. Twenty-two \nof those years were spent working with Congressman Oberstar. This \nNation, as Mr. Lipinski said a few minutes ago, is a better place today \nbecause of the work of Congressman Jim Oberstar.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of this bill, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 179.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5107-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5107-H5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, the Supreme Leader's \nhandpicked puppet, Rouhani, prematurely tweeted about what he called a \nvictory of diplomacy and, get this, mutual respect before a nuclear \ndeal between the P5+1 and Iran was actually sealed.\n  This is the same regime that openly calls for death to America and to \nour ally, the democratic Jewish State of Israel, and the same despots \nwho support terror all across the globe aimed at U.S. interests.\n  Now we hear that we may capitulate and end the arms embargo on Iran, \nits conventional military and ballistic missile program, and that the \nU.S. will lift all sanctions on day one.\n  And for what, Mr. Speaker? So that Iran can keep in place every major\n\n[[Page H5108]]\n\npiece of its nuclear infrastructure, and Iran can claim victory over \nthe Great Satan and the Little Satan.\n  This will be more than just a defeat for diplomacy. It will be a \ndisaster that will set in motion a nuclear and conventional arms race \nin the world's most volatile region. And who knows what dangers that \nwill bring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5108-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE SERVICES AND THE ABILITYONE PROGRAM\n\n  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BEATTY.

Mr. Speaker, the nuclear weapon agreement with Iran \nis near. The deal will lift crude oil export sanctions on Iran. This \nwill be a billion-dollar boom to the world's largest state sponsor of \nterrorism.\n  Meanwhile, here in America, the administration bans exporting our own \ncrude oil. We can't even export Texas light crude oil to our closest \nneighbor, Mexico.\n  The administration has within its power to lift the crude oil export \nban. The ban hurts the U.S. economy. Thousands of oil industry workers \nhave been laid off. Half the drilling rigs in Texas have been shut \ndown. This administration seems to be more worried about making Iran \nhappy and wealthy than helping the U.S. economy by creating energy \njobs.\n  Why can't America get the same deal that Iran is getting? While the \nadministration lifts the sanctions on Iranian exports, it should lift \nthe oil export sanctions on America. And, Mr. Speaker, Texas will even \nagree not to enrich uranium or develop nuclear sanctions if the \nsanctions are lifted.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5108-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TONKO.

Mr. Speaker, this morning on the hallowed ground \nof a hill in Dallas County, Iowa, a hero was laid to rest at the Iowa \nVeterans Cemetery.

He \nwas a dependable and encouraging brother in arms to his fellow Marines.\n  But long before Adam was a U.S. Marine, he was just a boy. He was a \nloving son who brought joy and laughter to his mother Jill and father \nDean. Adam was a playful protective brother to his sisters McKenzie and \nAnna. And he made his grandparents so proud. He loved them all so much. \nAnd, indeed, they loved him.\n  Over the weekend I attended a celebration of life service honoring \nAdam.

Mr. Speaker, we may be hours away from a deal with Iran. \nThe question before us is not is it a good deal or is it a bad deal or \nwhat should the executive branch of government do. The question before \nus is what should Congress do if we have a President who has signed the \ndeal.\n  We don't know precisely what is in the deal. But we do know that it \nhas advantages and disadvantages in the first year because it causes \nthe vast majority of Iranian stockpile of enriched uranium and the \nmajority of their centrifuges to be taken off the table. The \ndisadvantage is it provides the Iranian Government with access to $120 \nbillion plus of its own money.\n  We do know that, in the next decade, the deal will be unacceptable \nbecause next decade Iran will be able to have massive enrichment \nfacilities.\n  So the question before Congress is, first, how do we prevent this \ndeal from being morally binding on the American people next decade with \nthat administration and that Congress.\n  And then the tougher issue is whether we want to forfeit the \nadvantages, knowing there are disadvantages, of what the deal does in \nits first year.\n  It is this kind of analysis, not partisans screaming about is it a \ngood deal, is it a bad deal, that should guide us in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5108-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5108-H5109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              U.S.-SWITZERLAND SKILLED TRADES COOPERATION\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to have an \nimportant conversation, a conversation that is long overdue, a \nconversation that is crucial to healing America's deep racial wounds, \nour topic being the Confederate battle flag and why racial symbols \nmatter.\n  The Charleston 9 killings focused many of our attention on the \nsignificant appropriateness and bigoted history of this flag. In 2015, \nwhy do so many still revere a flag that tolerated the shackling of \npeople because of their skin, a flag that allowed human beings to be \ncounted as three-fifths of a person, a flag that was flown during \nlynchings, the holding of children, and one that symbolized a movement \nto deny education and equal treatment under our laws?\n\n  Fifty years since Selma, we think of the Freedom Riders, marchers, \nboycotters, protesters, and policymakers who pointed our Nation in a \nmore positive direction. They knew it was time to reject the traditions \nof the past.\n  The civil rights movement symbolized the quest of equality and a \nchange in mood for America. Thousands from all backgrounds had the \ncourage to join in peaceful protests, lunch counter sit-ins, and \nboycotts at the expense of being jailed, beaten, or killed. They did \nthis for one Nation and one flag.\n  And in the way of these Americans stood those who believed in the \nperseverance of inequality, who believed in an America of White and \ncolored, an America of two flags, and the Confederate battle flag \nrepresented their America.\n  Jim Crow America saw States that seceded from the Union, reacting to \nthe growth of the civil rights movement, with the use of the \nConfederate battle flag as the representation of their resistant \nmovement.\n  In 1956, the State of Georgia incorporated the battle flag into its \nofficial State flag design. The movement continued into the sixties, \nwhere it met renewed and intensified opposition, opposition that waved \nthe Confederate battle flag in the name of continued racial oppression.\n  In 1961, just 2 months after the sentencing of nine students arrested \nfor a lunch counter sit-in in Rock Hill, South Carolina, the \nConfederate battle flag was raised over South Carolina's State house \nduring a centennial celebration of the Civil War's opening.\n  That same year, in neighboring Georgia, Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton \nHolmes were the first two African American students to be admitted to \nthe University of Georgia. Their admission only came after a court \norder sent from Federal court.\n  Eleven days after arriving on campus, Hunter and Holmes were attacked \nby a mob of White rioters who threw rocks and bottles at them while \nwaving the rebel flag. The attacks were so fierce that the dean of \nstudents suspended both Hunter and Holmes for their own safety.\n  Now, even with me highlighting this violence, we are told that the \nstars and bars are about heritage. That heritage, Mr. Speaker, is not \nso subtle a reminder to African Americans that they are less than--\nmaybe not three-fifths of a person, but still not equal.\n  This is a reminder that there are two classes of citizens. And \ndespite our Declaration of Independence clearly stating that all men \nare created equal, this is a reminder that there is a lesser class and \nwill never be equal.\n  But why are we honoring the heritage and flag of the hooded night \nriders of the Klan at our State houses and in this Congress instead of \nthe flag of the Freedom Riders who died for a single, fair, and equal \nAmerica?\n  Two years after Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ``I have \ndream'' speech before 600 civil rights marchers, including our friend \nand colleague from Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, a different group \nof civil rights heroes were greeted by police officers in Selma, \nAlabama, proudly displaying the Confederate flag on the side of their \nhelmets.\n  These officers brutally beat the marchers, and their actions were a \nreminder that Dr. King's speech had not yet resonated in the hearts of \nthose who needed to hear it most.\n  But it was the undeterred resilience of the protesters who refused to \nback down and refused to resort to violence that persevered. It was the \nlove, the respect, and the mutual understanding that displayed what was \nthe strongest symbol of strength, honor, and heritage than the \nConfederate battle flag.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way since 1965, but we still have a \nways to go. We must move forward. The needed progress, however, will \nnot come if the Federal Government continues to provide American \ncitizens with reminders of our hateful and oppressive past in a manner \nthat legitimizes such hate.\n  I am glad to host this important Special Order hour with my colleague \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to talk about where we go from here and why \nwe continue to give energy to symbols of hate and division.\n  I yield to the kind gentleman from Newark, New Jersey (Mr. Payne).\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois.\n  This is a very timely topic, as we have seen what has transpired in \nour Nation over the past several weeks. It is incredible to me how fast \nthis issue has moved over the past month. But it always seems that it \ntakes a horrific act in this country for us to wake up and realize that \nmaybe something isn't right.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Nine people at church study on a Wednesday night, not knowing their \nfate, were gunned down in cold blood by someone who actually said: You \nknow, they were so nice to me, I almost didn't do it, but I had to.\n  Last week in South Carolina, there was a monumental step in removing \nthe Confederate flag from its State capitol, where it had shamefully \nflown for 54 years; but here in our Nation's Capitol last week, \nRepublicans tried to go back to the future.\n  House Republicans had to pull a vote on a spending bill because some \nof their Members opposed a measure that would ban Confederate flags \nfrom national cemeteries, and when the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, \npresented an opportunity for Republicans to do the right thing and \nimmediately remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol Grounds, they \npunted.\n  South Carolina, the birthplace of the Confederacy, had the courage to \ndo what the House Republicans did not, remove that dreaded symbol. It \nis the symbol of an incomprehensible hate, a hate that manifested \nitself in a massacre. Since that unfortunate day 1 month ago, we, as a \nnation, have been forced to look inward at who we are and who we want \nto be.\n  Mr. Speaker, out of this immense grief of that dark day in Charleston \ncame a resounding call throughout our Nation to remove the Confederate \nflag and other symbols of racism and racial supremacy. For many, the \nremoval of these symbols is a logical step in the trajectory of our \nNation, a necessary action on the path toward the more perfect Union.\n  For others, calls to remove these symbols of hate are seen as an \nattack\n\n[[Page H5110]]\n\non the Southern identity, heritage, and culture; but arguing that the \nConfederate flag is a symbol of Southern pride celebrates a single \nhomogenous culture.\n  It means listening to only some voices at the expense of others. It \nmeans ignoring the African American experience throughout our Nation's \nhistory from the dark period of slavery to the civil rights movement to \nthe present day.\n  According to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative, 3,959 African \nAmericans in 12 States were killed by the terror of lynching between \n1877 and 1950, 3,959 Americans lynched.\n  If we are going to refer to the past and debate over the Confederate \nflag, certainly, we need to take all of this into account. The \nConfederate flag has always stood for racial supremacy and bigotry, and \nif we are to realize our Nation's promise of justice and full equality, \nwe cannot embrace this symbol. Eradicating symbols of hatred, violence, \nand cruel oppression steeped in racism is a critical step to \nconfronting prejudice in our society.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, we have all heard complaints that this debate does \nnot matter and that removing the Confederate flag and other symbols of \nhatred is a distraction from the larger problems facing our Nation, \nsuch as rampant gun violence.\n  I agree that significantly more must be done to address racism and \npersistent inequality in our Nation. I agree that we need meaningful \ngun reform from expanding background checks to reducing unchecked \nonline ammunition purchases. I agree that we need to create jobs, \nreduce wealth disparities, and expand educational opportunities.\n  But symbols matter; symbols legitimize public opinion and, in doing \nso, entrench attitudes and beliefs. At the same time, they create a \nmeaning, shape actions, and connect us to one another. Just as a symbol \ncan connect us, they can tear us apart.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I go to my seat, I was talking to my staff the other \nday about this and how much we were happy to see that flag lowered. The \nsymbol is gone, but the sentiment remains.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Payne, for those words. \nRight now, it is my pleasure to introduce the Congressman from North \nCarolina and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman \nButterfield.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank you, Congresswoman \nKelly and Congressman Payne, for your leadership. Your leadership is \nvery much appreciated, and your constituents in your respective \ndistricts should be very proud of each one of you. I know the \nCongressional Black Caucus is proud of you.\n  For the past several weeks, Mr. Speaker, the Nation has been focused \non the Confederate battle flag. Most fair-minded Americans have been \nasking the question: Why is this flag continuing to fly on State \ngrounds and Federal lands? And why are policymakers refusing to \nsquarely address this issue?\n  The Confederate battle flag, Mr. Speaker, represents an era of \nAmerican history that ended--or at least it should have ended--150 \nyears ago. This flag represents the years following President Lincoln's \nelection. Those years starting in December of 1860 saw 11 Southern \nStates leave the Union.\n  The fancy name for their leaving the Union, Mr. Speaker, was called \nsecession, but the reality was that these Southern States were \nrebelling. They were in rebellion against the Union. They organized a \nso-called government called the Confederate States of America. They \ntook up arms, Mr. Speaker, and they fought against the Union for 4 long \nyears until they surrendered.\n  They then returned to the Union. The Confederate flag represents that \nera where Southern States were resisting freedom for 4 million slaves. \nThere continues to be elements today in our society who subscribe to \nseparation of the races--how unfortunate. There continues to be \nelements in our society who believe in White supremacy.\n  The question now, Mr. Speaker, is: Do we constructively address the \nquestion of hate groups in America? Do we continue to insist that other \nStates remove symbols of White supremacy as South Carolina has done? Or \ndo we continue to simply ignore racism?\n  Other States continue to display Confederate flags, and even in this \nCapitol--even in this Capitol--you will find eight statues of \nConfederate soldiers who fought against the Stars and Stripes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call upon every American to bury for good the dark \nhistory of slavery and bigotry. We are a great nation, and we will be \neven greater when we can judge our neighbor on the content of their \ncharacter and not on the color of their skin.\n  Let's remove these symbols from our view. I thank each one of the \nfloor managers.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield, for those \nfine words. Many questions, many questions: Why are they still holding \non? Is it just heritage and tradition? Or is it something more?\n  At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the \ngentlewoman from Illinois, and my friend, the gentleman from New \nJersey, for their important leadership they are exercising here this \nevening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have come to speak about why symbols matter and why \nthis symbol, the Confederate flag, must not stop with the flag, but \nmust also go to what to do not only about the flag, but about the guns \nthat took down the Charleston 9.\n  To be sure, symbols matter, Mr. Speaker. To take two of the most \npowerful symbols in the world, the cross and the Star of David, we know \nwell these symbols can sometimes mean everything. We also know that the \nConfederate flag is a symbol of a different and lower order.\n  A symbol stands for more than itself; the symbol tells a story. The \nreligious symbols evoke tears; they evoke joy, and they evoke their own \nset of stories. The Confederate flag, when it led to the extraordinary \ntragedy of the Charleston 9 will always--should always--make us think \nof the gun that was responsible for the Charleston 9--not just the \nsymbol, but the story behind the symbol.\n  In the 19th century, the flag signaled the importance of slavery. In \nthe 20th century, it had a different meaning. Robert E. Lee had told \nhis soldiers:\n\n       Put down the flag. We are one Union now.\n\n  He was, in a real sense, the counterpart to Abraham Lincoln, who was \ntrying to draw us together after Lee had lost that war.\n  In the 20th century, the flag was revived. It was revived by Southern \nDemocrats--Dixiecrats, as they called themselves. It has been, in the \n20th century and, now, the 21st century, a symbol of discrimination and \nracism. No matter what it stood for in the 19th century about heritage, \nit lost that meaning when, in the 20th century, George Wallace raised \nit and said ``segregation now'' and ``segregation forever.'' Nobody who \nnow speaks of heritage then said: Wait a minute, Governor Wallace, \ndon't take away our heritage.\n  Only when African Americans have the nerve to raise the notion, after \nwe lost nine good people in Charleston, does it somehow now become a \nsymbol of heritage.\n  I will give Senator Mitch McConnell some credit. He wants to remove \nthe statue of Jefferson Davis from the Kentucky State Capitol, but when \nasked about removing the Jefferson Davis statue from the United States \nCapitol, Mr. McConnell grew silent.\n  We have got to come to grips with what this flag meant to this boy \nwho used a gun. I am not going to forget those who died and what we owe \nthose who died.\n  The Dixiecrats bolted from Harry S. Truman when Truman refused to \nembrace their racism. These were Southern Democrats, and we owe them \nthe 21st century meaning of the Confederate flag.\n  Mr. Speaker, why are we talking about this symbol and not another \nsymbol? The other symbol is the gun in America.\n  The grace of the people of Charleston so overwhelmed the country that \nthere were many who were simply grateful that, instead of bursting \nforward with rage, they showed their extraordinary Christian heritage, \nthe heritage they undoubtedly shared with the gunman. We were so \ngrateful, all of us, and so proud that we have not talked about\n\n[[Page H5111]]\n\nwhat took the lives of these nine good people.\n  Well, I want to talk about it because the Confederate flag for me now \nwill always represent those nine people and the gun that took their \nlives. That 21-year-old kid didn't know anything about them except \ntheir Christian love when they invited him into their sanctuary.\n  But, he knew about what that flag stood for, and he raised that flag \nbefore he went into that sanctuary.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  We must not forget not only the flag--we cannot live by symbols \nalone--we must not forget the gun that took down the Charleston 9.\n  Now, I understand--I read--that Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey \nare interested in reviving their gun safety legislation. There are \nseveral bills here in the House that do that in one form or another.\n  We know what happened. There was a breakdown in the background check \nsystem, which is why this young man was even able to get a gun. He \nwould have been denied a gun if those who opposed any bill hadn't \nassured that the bill would have only a 3-day time period, during \nwhich, if you couldn't find something on the individual, then he got \nhis gun, no matter who he was. That is how he got his gun.\n  There are some of us who know full well that the Confederate flag has \ndone more than put the flag back on the agenda--on the Nation's \nagenda--it has put gun safety once again on the agenda.\n  I must say, I don't believe we, who celebrate the extraordinary grace \nof the families of the Charleston 9, owe them only our speeches about \nthe flag. They probably, once they saw it come down, have moved on; and \nnow, they have only their loved ones to think about.\n  If I were one of them, I would wonder: What are those who celebrate \nthe flag coming down going to do about making sure that, never again, \nwill people like our loved ones have to suffer because of gunfire?\n  The flag is the symbol that is important to raising our consciousness \nin the long run. If all we have is our memory of the symbol and not why \nthat symbol became important, then we will leave on the table a real \nmemorial to the Charleston 9.\n  I appreciate the time.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Holmes. I am so glad \nthat you and Congressman Payne brought up the issue of the gun because \nwe cannot forget that either. I look at Charleston as when racism and \nhate found the gun.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge), our \nformer head of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want \nto thank my colleagues, Congressman Payne and Congresswoman Kelly, for \nleading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you have not noticed, the people of this country are \nfed up. Quite frankly, so am I. We are at a point in our Nation's \nhistory when we can no longer give lip service to equality and \nopportunities to succeed. We must take action to show we mean what we \nsay; otherwise, it is nothing more than empty rhetoric.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Confederate flag is more than just a piece of \nfabric. It is more than just a visual representation of the Confederacy \nor part of the storied history of the South. If that were true, we \nwould not be having this conversation today. We would not have buried \nnine Americans murdered because of the color of their skin, and the \nConfederate battle flag would still be flying in the State of South \nCarolina.\n  Let's be honest about the history of the Confederate battle flag. \nWhile the majority of this House may want to ignore the facts and \nrewrite history, we will not be ignored. The Confederate battle flag \nand any adaptation of it is a painful reminder of intimidation, \ntorture, and murder for all of us in the Black community. It is a \nflying symbol of hatred and injustice that tells Black and Brown people \nin this country: Your lives have no value, and you don't matter.\n  It is an embarrassment to all Americans that the majority of this \nHouse introduced a spending amendment which included language allowing \nthe battle flag on Federal properties.\n  It is just plain shameful that they would go even further and use \nprocedure to stifle a motion to openly discuss a ban of the Confederate \nbattle flag imagery from the Capitol Grounds.\n  How can the Members of the majority of this House continue to say \nthat they represent all Americans when they refuse to have a real \ndiscussion about what is really happening in our country? Have we \nlearned nothing from what has happened in the past few weeks?\n  In a June Gallup poll, African Americans ranked race relations as the \nmost important issue facing the United States. Will taking down the \nConfederate battle flag immediately change this perspective? Absolutely \nnot--but it will certainly do more than letting it continue to fly.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time we do away with lip service. It is time we \nlisten to our constituents and take real action toward healing the \nracial wounds of this country. It is time we move forward.\n  The flag must come down.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for \nher eloquent words and the truth of what happened in Congress last week \nand what we need to do to go forward.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the managers of this very \nSpecial Order and my words to them and to this House. I want you to \ntake note of the spirit in which these Members have come.\n  If our constituents are seeing us and watching us, if those who agree \nwith us are watching, no one has come with anger and a cry of hysteria. \nThey have come with a reasoned request and pronouncement of the \nwrongness of the present situation in this House.\n  Let me say that it was in 1864 that the States were given the call to \nsend forward two statutes to come to represent their States in the \nUnited States Congress. In addition, we know that the United States \nCongress has a number of flags representing various States.\n  This was to be the people's House, and the people's House would \nreflect the people of the United States of America. History should be \nsomething that grows with the Nation and reflects the goodness of the \nNation. Yes, there is history that should be taught, such as the \nugliness and violence of the slave history; but it is not to be \nhonored.\n  I join my colleagues today to be able to call for the taking down of \nsigns of Confederacy in the United States Capitol--in particular, as I \nam in the House of Representatives, in the people's House.\n  Let me give you a credible basis upon which to do so, why this \nSupreme Court decision has been so ignored. Let me cite it for my \ncolleagues, Walker III v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, \nissued on June 18, 2015--ironically, the day after the martyrdom of \nnine wonderful African Americans practicing their Christian faith.\n  This particular decision indicates that the State of Texas was to be \nsupported. This was a case that engaged many of our constituents in \nTexas. We organize and galvanize.\n  I want to thank Dr. Clark, the president of the Missionary Baptist \nGeneral Convention of Texas, and Reverend Max Miller, who came up as we \nargued this case. We were convincing. The Texas Department of Motor \nVehicles board agreed that a Confederate license plate issued by the \nState of Texas would be offensive and would be considered, in essence, \na public action or public speech.\n  For those who want to raise the question of the First Amendment, this \ncry that we, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are making \nis perfectly constitutional and legitimate. We are talking about flags \nthat are flown on State property or Federal property.\n  This caucus should be congratulated. It is succinct in its argument; \nit is detailed in its argument, and no First Amendment opposition can \nbe raised because the Supreme Court of the United States has said that \nwe can deny utilizing the Confederate flag that may be considered State \naction as it is placed on Federal lands on the Federal property here.\n\n[[Page H5112]]\n\n  Our colleagues, in particular Hakeem Jeffries and Mr. Huffman and \nothers, understood that when they acted last week. Now, the considerate \nthing to have done is there are amendments to stay in place, the \nInterior bill to be voted on, and the right thing would have been done \nbecause they argued the point that this was State or Federal action.\n  We now come again to try and clarify for our colleagues that these \nflags should come down. In the privileged resolutions that have gone on \nlast week, they made the point very clear that it was an insult to the \ndignity of the House.\n  I have introduced H. Res. 342 that I hope will complement, and it is \none that talks about the enhancement of unity in America and stands on \nthe Walker decision and, in particular, makes it very clear that \ndivisive symbols--license plates, specialty license plates, replicas, \nand flags--on public buildings or government property and symbols on \nState or Federal action, State public speech--that is a speech of those \nyou represent--should not be allowed.\n  How divisive is that point of view? It is not. The divisiveness is \nthose that stand on a false sense of history, yet want to offend those \nwho likewise have great leadership.\n  Let me make this point about the battle flag, this Confederate flag. \nMight I ask the question: Have southerners not fought in the War of \n1812, in World War I, in World War II, in the Korean war, in the \nHungarian war in the fifties, and in Vietnam and shed their blood under \nthis flag, have they not been honored when they have shed their blood?\n  Not only that, when Confederate soldiers died, they were honored \nappropriately in graves where those who desired to honor that shedding \nof the blood were allowed to do so. We did not run into the funerals of \nthose Southern fallen soldiers and cast upon them and curse them and \ndeny them. They were allowed to be honored appropriately, and they now \ngo into the annals of history.\n  When you understand what grounds they stood on, what their general \nstood on, such as Jefferson Davis, who called the individuals who were \nslaves as unprofitable savages--that is what one general who has been \nhonored has called them, ``unprofitable savages''--is that the history \nthat we should be honoring?\n  Is that what we should be lifting up? Is that what should be placed \nin the place of honor in the United States Congress? Is that engaged in \nthe uplifting of the dignity of the House? Or is it insulting the \ndignity of the House?\n  To my colleagues, I stand with you today to join in trying to create \nan understanding of the rightness of the work of our colleagues last \nweek on the Interior bill, of the rightness of the Congressional Black \nCaucus going, as someone would say, on and on and on about this flag; \nand my good friend from New Jersey said it is symbols, and we need to \nbridge the gap of the inequity and wealth, we need education, we need \njobs.\n  Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus and \nmy colleagues and the Democratic Caucus and good will Republicans are \nfighting for jobs--or should be--fighting for education. We are not \nlanguishing along the side highway of life. We fought to maintain the \nObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. We are not ignoring the other \ndesires of our constituents.\n  Let me close on this final point, and I am glad that my colleague \nfrom the District of Columbia raised it, and Congresswoman Kelly has \nbeen a leader, and Congresswoman Kelly, let's rise again, and that is \nthe horror of gun violence.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Let me say to Director Comey, since I am on the Judiciary Committee, \nthank you for your honesty, but let me make it very clear that we \nsuffered this loophole because of the opposition to the sensibleness of \nthe Brady anti-gun violence legislation.\n  Imbedded in it was this nonsensical point that, if I don't hear from \nyou, then I am going to sell it. Who is selling it? The gun store.\n  I have no opposition to our fellow citizens who make their living and \nprovide for their families by selling guns. I do have opposition to the \nevil and vile perpetrator who went into that Mother Emanuel Church and \nkilled illegally with a gun that he should not have had.\n  He did so because the 3-day time had expired, because there was a \ntime when the NICS was closed--that is the entity that the FBI relies \nupon--and the 3 days expired, and the owner said, ``I am going to sell \nthe gun.''\n  This week I will be introducing a single piece of legislation--and I \nask my colleagues to join me--I know there are many other bills--to \neliminate the 3-day period of discretion, that no discretion will \nexist. They either answer the question that he or she is eligible or it \nis denied.\n  So on the graves of these wonderful martyrs, I stand in honor of \nthem. I mourn them, and I mourn for their families. I say to them: We \nwill never forget.\n  Once and for all, bring the flag down and remove these items in this \nplace of honor that have denigrated and considered one race of people \nvile and unequal.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Jackson Lee. Always \ndetailed and insightful. Thank you for all of your work on the \nJudiciary Committee. It is very much appreciated and hailed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), \nwho took center stage last week as we discussed and worked toward the \nremoval of the flag.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I want to thank my good friend, the distinguished \ngentlewoman from Illinois, Robin Kelly, for once again presiding over \nthis important CBC Special Order hour, as well as her co-anchor, the \ndistinguished gentleman from New Jersey, who is right across the Hudson \nRiver, and who so ably serves the communities of Newark and beyond.\n  Mr. Speaker, this evening we have heard from so many distinguished \nmembers of the Congressional Black Caucus, most recently from the \ngentlewoman from Texas, with whom I serve on the Judiciary Committee, \nabout the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves \nright now related to not just the Confederate battle flag, but perhaps \nmore importantly: What is the legacy that we want to have as Americans, \nas Members of Congress, in dealing with the complicated issue of race?\n  It is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come \nto the House floor to have this conversation.\n  This is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the \nAmerican people, an appropriate one, I would add, given the House's \nconstitutional relationship to the people of America, this, of course, \nbeing the only institution that was envisioned by the Founding Fathers \nas one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly \nelected by the people.\n  The Senate's Members, of course, in its original constitutional \nversion, were elected by the State legislature. Then, of course, the \nPresidency, to this day, is a vehicle through which the individual is \nselected by the Electoral College.\n  So this is the people's House, the institution most intimately \nconnected to the people of America and the place where we should be \nable to speak truth to power.\n  We witnessed that last week as we were forced, unfortunately, to \ndiscuss the issue of the Confederate battle flag at a moment when \npeople of all races--Democrats and Republicans, Blacks, Whites, the \nextraordinary leadership from the Governor of South Carolina, and the \ndistinguished gentleman from South Carolina, Jim Clyburn--came \ntogether.\n  At the moment when the Confederate battle flag was coming down in \nSouth Carolina, there were Members of this House trying to lift it up.\n  It was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment \nthat we were having in America, led in South Carolina, to address the \nbattle flag issue on this House floor; but I am hopeful that, as we \nmove forward now in a more productive way, we can begin to confront \nsome of the public policy challenges that we face in America that \nsupporters of the Confederate battle flag have fought against.\n  As others have detailed during the presentation here today, the \nbattle flag, which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the \nCivil War, remained\n\n[[Page H5113]]\n\nlargely dormant in American history until 1954 in the Supreme Court's \ndecision of Brown vs. Board of Education.\n  It was decided that this facade of separate and equal was \nconstitutionally suspect and that African Americans were being denied \nthe opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the Deep \nSouth and in other places in America.\n  Really, it was in the mid-fifties and then into the early sixties \nwhen the Confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the \nsegregationists who were fighting to uphold Jim Crow.\n  It was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of \ncourageous individuals like Congressman John Lewis, who in 1965 was the \nco-chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n  It was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by John \nLewis and others to make sure that the franchise--the right to vote--\nwas colorblind in nature and that the 15th Amendment could actually be \nbrought to life all throughout America and in the Deep South, where \nthere were those who were trying to prevent African Americans from \nbeing able to vote. The battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and \nin the sixties to stop certain things from happening.\n  It seems to me that, rather than having the discussion about whether \nit should come down, no reasonable person can take the position that it \nshould have a place of honor. So it is extraordinary to me that we had \nto take to the House floor last week and have to come to the House \nfloor today to continue to address this issue.\n\n  Hopefully, reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the \nnext couple of days--even prior to the August recess--and we can move \nbeyond the Confederate battle flag issue and address some important, \nsubstantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy \nof the Confederacy. We don't want to see the ghosts of the Confederacy \ninvading the United States Congress from a policy perspective.\n  Those nine souls--God-fearing, church-going African Americans--who \nwere killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of \nsomeone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a \nrace war that was inspired, in part, by the Confederate battle flag.\n  One of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is \nthe battle flag has come down, but that is just the beginning of the \nwork that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions \nthat so many people find themselves in all across America.\n  As has been mentioned, we have got to confront the gun violence issue \nthat we have in the United States. How can it be that we have 5 percent \nof the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns?\n  It is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in \ncirculation. Nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold \nhas been placed around the Federal agencies charged with preventing gun \nviolence and dealing with gun safety in America. It is an incredible \nact of legislative malpractice, but it is estimated that we have got \nover 285 million guns in America.\n  Isn't it reasonable, particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in \nCharleston, South Carolina, that we come together and figure out a way \nto prevent those guns, consistent with the Second Amendment, from \nfalling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm? It seems to \nme to be a reasonable thing that we can do as Americans.\n  It also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the \npassage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to stop trying to prevent \nAmericans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in \nAmerican democracy.\n  Yet, something happened in the aftermath of 2008, a real interesting \nmoment in November of that year, that seemed to have shocked a whole \nlot of people across this country. As a result, 2 years later, when \nthere was a midterm election, subsequent to that, there was an outbreak \nwith this concern of voter fraud, fabricated because no one can point \nto any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud.\n  Not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this \ncountry that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed; but we \nhave had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are \nconsistent with the ghosts of the Confederacy and what those folks \nstood for who were waving the Confederate battle flag in opposition to \nthe changes of the fifties and sixties.\n  What shocks me is that even the Supreme Court has gotten into the act \nby decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section \n4 is outdated, and this House refuses to act on fixing the Voting \nRights Act.\n  I would argue that--again, consistent with our democracy and the \nspirit of coming together--that, perhaps, that is one of the things we \ncan address so that we can take down, on the one hand, the divisive \nsymbol of hatred--the Confederate battle flag--from here in this \nCapitol and in whatever form it hangs all across America so that we can \nlift up policies that make Americans safer, policies that are \nconsistent with our values and that everyone--White, Black, Latino, \nAsian, Democrats, and Republicans--should be able to rally around.\n  I am thankful for Congresswoman Kelly's and Congressman Payne's \nleadership--this wonderful tandem, R. Kelly and D. Payne, who are \ntremendous advocates here in the Congress--and for their giving me this \nopportunity to share these thoughts.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Jeffries, for reminding \nus about the Voting Rights Act. Again, thank you for everything you did \nlast week in this Congress. It was so commendable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), who \ngave a passionate speech on the floor last week about the flag.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I am honored to be with the team of Kelly and \nPayne tonight. You do outstanding work, and you also provide an \nopportunity for other Members to have an opportunity to call to the \nattention of our constituents some of the concerns that we have to \naddress in Congress. I will always be grateful for the wonderful work \nthat you do in Congress.\n  I am also very grateful and thankful to the many persons who worked \nto bring down the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina. It was not \neasy. There are many who said they never thought they would see it \nhappen, but it did, and it happened because of a willingness to forgive \nand an understanding that we had an opportunity to do something \nmeaningful for a good many people across the length and breadth of this \ncountry who saw the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of segregation, \na symbol of racism and bigotry, a symbol of slavery. Not all did, but \nit was painful for a good many who did see it this way, many who \nsuffered the indignation and humiliation of segregation, who suffered \nknowing that their bloodline had suffered slavery.\n  So I am here tonight to thank those who worked so hard to get this \ndone. It was not easy, and I want to thank you for what you did. But I \nalso know that there are a good many people now who would like to see \nus go back to normal. They are ready to get back to the normal things \nthat we have in this great country of ours, the richest country in the \nworld. For them, normal is a very pleasant thing. Normal means new \nhomes. Normal means greater opportunities.\n  But let's talk about normal for some others in this country because \nnormal is not always the same for everyone. Normal for the month of \nJune 2015 unemployment: normal for Whites was 4.6 percent, that is the \nunemployment rate. That is normal for Whites. Normal for Latinos was \n6.6 percent, and normal for Blacks was 9.5 percent.\n  Now, I have already heard the arguments about how President Obama \nought to resolve this; this is all his fault. Not so, my friends. If \nyou look back through the vista of time, you will find that \nunemployment for African Americans is usually about twice the \nunemployment rate for White Americans. This is not something new to \nPresident Obama. This is not something that started in 2008 when he was \nelected or when he was sworn in in 2009. This is not something that is \nnew to us, those of us who know and see the pain and suffering that \nresults from a lack of employment.\n  We understand that the flag coming down was a great moment for us \nsymbolically. It was symbolism. Now, the\n\n[[Page H5114]]\n\nsubstance is what we ultimately have to deal with, and the substance is \nthe normal life that people lead under conditions that are abnormal for \nmany others in this country.\n  Let's look at normal as it relates to lending for businesses. \nMinority businessowners in 2012--this is the latest information that I \nhave from the Federal Reserve--paid interest rates that were 32 percent \nhigher than what Whites paid--32 percent higher. That is normal.\n  Some people don't want to go back to this normal state of affairs. \nThey see the flag coming down as an indication that we need to move on \nin other substantive areas. Lending, mortgage lending is an important \narea. Normal for African Americans meant that in 2013 only 4.8 percent \nof loans made to buy homes were made to Blacks, when Blacks comprise \n13.2 percent of the total population. Normal for Latinos meant that in \n2013 only 7.3 percent of the loans made to buy homes were made to \nLatinos, Hispanics, when they make up 17.15 percent of the total \npopulation. That is normal.\n  Normal in 2013 meant the conventional mortgage loan denial rate was, \nand this is according to CNN, 10.4 percent for Whites, 13.3 percent for \nAsians, 21.9 percent for Hispanics, and 27.6 percent for African \nAmericans. There are a good many people who don't live normal lives in \nthis normal climate that we want to get back to--we, in a generic \nsense.\n  I, not the personal pronoun for me, I don't want to get back to this. \nI want to see us move on with substantive change. I appreciate what was \ndone in bringing down the flag. I celebrate its coming down, but it is \ntime for us to initiate greater action in areas where we can integrate \nthe money. I am an integrationist. I think we ought to integrate every \naspect of American society, including the money.\n  Let's talk about normal. Normal means that Black applicants are 2.1 \ntimes more likely to be denied loans by mortgage lenders than non-\nHispanic Whites. That is normal. For Hispanics, it means that they are \n1.7 times more likely to be denied loans. That is normal. For Asians, \n1.2 times more likely.\n  So I am saying to us that we have got to create a new normal. It is \ntime for us, those of us who sit on committees of jurisdiction, to use \nour influence on these committees of jurisdiction to bring about the \nsubstantive change that lowering the flag and placing it in its place \nof honor, proper place where it should be, lowering that Confederate \nflag. That means that we must do that, but do it in such a way that we \nacknowledge that there is more work to be done, and we can do it on our \ncommittees of jurisdiction.\n  So, given that I serve on the Committee on Financial Services, I will \nbe calling to the attention of the committee the need to investigate \nthe mortgage lending culture in banks. We need to understand why it is \nthat African Americans and Latinos who are equally as qualified as \nWhites can go into a bank and not get a loan when a White can. We have \ngot to find out why. I know that there are many people who are \nuncomfortable with the language of Black and White and Brown, but that \nis the language we have to use to communicate clearly a message of what \nis taking place.\n  So on my committee, I am going to push for an investigation of banks. \nWe need to know why banks consistently do this. Not all banks, but we \nneed to know why those who do it are doing it.\n  The way you do this is to test, to send people out who are equally \nqualified of different ethnicities and acquire the empirical evidence. \nIn every instance--maybe with a few exceptions, but in every instance, \nin a general sense, we find that Blacks and Browns who are equally as \nqualified as Whites do not receive their loans.\n\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to use your committees of \njurisdiction to create a new state of normalcy for those who have been \nsuffering continuously.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much, Congressman Green, for your \nwords, your passion, and your call to action.\n  I would like to thank all of my colleagues for participating tonight. \nSymbols of the Confederacy have been an inescapable and often haunting \npart of life in many Southern States. Every day the Confederate flag is \nflown proudly in front yards, worn on T-shirts, and you will find them \non pickup trucks, and that is the right that folks have.\n  Many argue this is a symbol of Southern history, tradition, and \nhonor. I would argue against the merits of that. After all, what are we \nproudly honoring and looking upon nostalgically? The Confederate flag \nrepresents a dark time in our Nation's history, full of pain, \nsuffering, and loss.\n  Why do we allow the mascot of terrorist groups to fly high on the \ngovernment grounds? Would we permit ISIS the luxury of putting their \nsymbols on our Federal grounds? In modern society, people have made a \ndecision to eradicate materials that do not represent our country's \ncore values: the value of inclusion, the value of nondiscrimination, \nand the value that our Nation can be the beacon of hope for everyone \nregardless of the color of their skin.\n  The institution of slavery destroyed families, killed millions, and \nformed the beginning of a systemic inequality faced by African \nAmericans today. That is what the Confederacy sought to preserve when \nit seceded from our great Nation. Every time a Confederate flag flies, \nwhether it is the intent of the owner or not, that is what is being \ncelebrated.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to take down the flag and we also need to have a \nserious conversation about gun violence. On behalf of Congressman Payne \nand me, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my \ncolleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss tonight's CBC \nSpecial Order Hour: ``The Confederate Battle Flag: Why Symbols \nMatter.'' I stand here today fully acknowledging that the eradication \nof this hurtful flag from state and federal grounds is only one step in \nfully addressing race relations in this country; but, just as so many \nof my CBC colleagues have stood on this very floor to exclaim that \n``Black Lives Matter,'' so too do symbols. Symbols of hatred, \ninstitutionalized racism and white supremacy, they matter. Symbols like \nthe flags of Apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia, embraced by Dylann \nRoof, the terrorist responsible for the unspeakable events at Emmanuel \nAME Church in Charleston last month, Mr. Speaker, they matter.\n  Last week, the South Carolina legislature voted overwhelmingly in \nfavor of removing--once and for all--the confederate battle flag from \ntheir Capitol grounds. I applaud the state of South Carolina for this \nhistoric gesture and for the outstanding leadership necessary to ensure \nthat this flag comes down in the aftermath of the ``Emmanuel Nine'' \ntragedy. I implore other southern states that still fly the battle flag \non state grounds to follow suit and have the flag removed. As a Member \nof Congress, I pledge my support to any legislation that completely \neradicates this symbol from all federal lands.\n  To understand why the confederate battle flag has been offensive to \nmillions of Americans for so many years requires a proper framing of \nAmerican History. The version of the confederate battle flag that most \npeople are familiar with today was first used by the Army of Tennessee \nduring the Civil War. Shortly thereafter, it became widely known as the \nsymbol of the Confederacy--eleven states who wished to secede from the \nUnion over the right to own slaves. For the many Americans who deny a \nbasic historical fact by refusing to believe that slavery was a central \npoint of conflict in the Civil War, I quote directly from the \ndeclaration of secession from my home state of Texas:\n  ``We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various \nStates, and of the confederacy itself were established exclusively by \nthe white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African \nrace had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully \nheld and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that \ncondition only could their existence in this country be rendered \nbeneficial or tolerable.''\n  Similarly, overt references to slavery as a motivation to secede from \nthe Union are also present in the declarations of secession of South \nCarolina, Georgia and Mississippi.\n  Repeatedly, throughout the 20th century, the confederate battle flag \nflew as a symbol of direct defiance to advancements in civil rights. \nThe flag was first displayed at the South Carolina state Capitol in \n1938 after angry Members of Congress defeated a bill that would have \nmade lynching a federal crime.\n  In the 1940s, the flag became the symbol of the Dixiecrats, the \nsegregationist political faction birthed out of its firm stance against \nthe civil rights agenda of the national Democratic party of the time. \nMembers of the Dixiecrats were faithfully devoted to maintaining the \nsegregation of the Jim Crow South, many of\n\n[[Page H5115]]\n\nwhom stood on this very House floor decades ago, extolling the virtues \nof an American society that subjugated its black citizens.\n  In 1962, the flag was raised to the dome of the South Carolina state \nCapitol after President Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes \nand literacy tests for voting, and the Supreme Court declared \nsegregation in public transportation unconstitutional. The raising of \nthe confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of resistance in South \nCarolina to two landmark achievements of progress that our country \nrelied on to move forward in its quest for racial equality.\n  While the confederate battle flag may represent ``Southern Heritage'' \nto some, to millions of other Americans it represents an opposition to \nthe racial equality we still fight for today. This flag is a symbol of \nthe painful history that this country has worked hard to overcome; and \nin order to continue moving forward, it is a symbol that we must \nfinally put behind us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5115-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Clyburn (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/house-section/article/H5115-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL\n\n\n  revisions to the aggregates and allocations of the fiscal year 2016 \n                           budget resolution\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2015.\n       Mr. Tom Price of Georgia: Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section \n     314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I hereby \n     submit for printing in the Congressional Record revisions to \n     the aggregates and allocations set forth pursuant to the \n     Fiscal Year 2016 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget \n     Conference Report, S. Con. Res. 11. The revision is for new \n     budget authority and outlays for provisions designated as \n     program integrity initiatives, pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(B) and (C) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), contained in H.R. 3020, \n     the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016.\n       S. Con. Res. 11 set the base discretionary 302(a) \n     allocation to the Committee on Appropriations at $1,016,582 \n     million, which is the sum of the fiscal year 2016 \n     discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA. \n     Section 251(b) of BBEDCA allows for adjustments to the \n     discretionary spending limits for certain purposes including \n     overseas contingencies, disaster relief, and program \n     integrity initiatives.\n       H.R. 3020, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     2016, contains $1,484 million in budget authority for program \n     integrity initiatives, which is within the allowable limits \n     for this purpose as established in section 251(b)(2)(B) and \n     (C) of BBEDCA.

Res. 11 for an additional $1,484 million in budget \n     authority to accommodate program integrity funding contained \n     in H.R. 3020. After making this adjustment, H.R. 3020 is \n     within the fiscal year 2016 discretionary spending limits \n     under section 251(c) of BBEDCA and the 302(a) allocation to \n     the Committee on Appropriations established by S.
