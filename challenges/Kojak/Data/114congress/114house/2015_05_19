The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, last week, The Washington Post ran a story \ntitled, ``Defense Firm that Employed Drunk, High Contractors in \nAfghanistan May Have Wasted $135 Million in Taxpayer Dollars,'' by \nColby Itkowitz. Colby writes:\n  ``The defense contractor investigated in 2012 after cellphone videos \nsurfaced of its employees drunk and high on drugs in Afghanistan may \nhave misused almost $135 million of U.S. taxpayer money, an audit \nfinds.''\n  The Hill further reported that:\n  ``The company also did not comply with Federal procurement law, the \naudit found.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been coming down to this floor for weeks to \nhighlight the waste, fraud, and abuse in Afghanistan, which John Sopko, \nthe Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, has \nreported is worse now than ever.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act, which the House passed last \nweek, authorized $42 billion for Afghanistan, which is one of the \nreasons I did not vote for the bill.\n  Why do we continue to spend billions of American taxpayer dollars in \nAfghanistan when infrastructure all over the United States is rapidly \ndeteriorating? This past weekend, CBS' ``60 Minutes'' ran a segment on \nAmerica's failing infrastructure and reported that 70,000 bridges in \nthe United States have been deemed structurally deficient, according to \nthe Federal Government. That is one bridge out of every nine. My \nconstituents in eastern North Carolina continually experience \nfrustration and concern over the Bonner Bridge, which is falling apart. \nThis further highlights the waste and the failed policy in Afghanistan.\n  I know some Members of Congress will be upset that I am calling \nattention to the reckless spending in Afghanistan the NDAA authorized, \nbut then why doesn't Congress stop sending billions of dollars to a \nfailed state where young American men and women are being wounded and \nkilled? Mr. Speaker, this includes the father of these two little girls \nwho are on a poster beside me. Their names are Eden and Stephanie \nBalduf. Their daddy, Sergeant Kevin Balduf, was shot and killed in \nAfghanistan 2 years ago by the Afghan he was training.\n  Mr. Speaker, it just gets worse and worse. Those wasted billions of \ndollars should be allocated to fix American bridges and roads from \nfalling apart and endangering American citizens. It is the right thing \nto do.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me remind the American people that, last year, the \nObama administration signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement with \nAfghanistan strapping us with 10 more years of waste, fraud, and abuse; \n10 more years of billions of dollars being wasted; 10 more years of \nyoung Americans being killed and wounded while the infrastructure in \nAmerica is collapsing; 10 more years of veterans worrying about their \nbenefits. There are so many needs here in America, so many needs that \nare not being met because we are wasting money overseas in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress should debate and vote to stop the madness in \nAfghanistan on behalf of our soldiers and our men and women in uniform, \ntheir families, and the taxpayers of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been said many times that Afghanistan is a \ngraveyard of empires. I hope there is a headstone for America because \nthat is where we are heading, to the graveyard in Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3313-5", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3313-H3314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRANSPORTATION FUNDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, after a rocky start this Congress, we \nhave seen some signs of progress.\n  Earlier this session, the House leadership allowed the process to \nwork when all Democrats joined many Republicans to rescue Homeland \nSecurity from the potential disastrous shutdown by cutting off funds.\n  Later, a decade-long struggle on the Medicare sustainable growth \nrate, the so-called doc fix, moved forward. An impasse that had lasted \nfor years was\n\n[[Page H3314]]\n\nbroken, and the solution was overwhelmingly approved by Members of both \nparties.\n  Well, now, we are facing yet another impasse, one that has haunted us \nfar longer than a decade, transportation funding. The authority to \nspend for surface transportation programs expires May 31.\n  Just as I predicted last summer, the stopgap approach that we \napproved then would put us right back in the same spot this spring, \ncutting badly needed transportation projects this summer and the jobs \nthat go with them.\n  America is falling apart and falling behind in part because you \ncannot pay for 2015 transportation needs with 1993 dollars, which was \nthe last time we raised the gas tax. Thirty-two short-term funding \nextensions are evidence of a bipartisan failure for these 22 years to \ndeal with the gas tax, and there is no meaningful alternative for \ntransportation resources on the horizon.\n  Ironically, the solution is clear, thoroughly studied and broadly \nsupported: raise the gas tax for the first time since 1993. The House \nRepublican leadership doesn't have to do anything extraordinary, just \nallow the Ways and Means Committee to follow regular order. Let's \nlisten to the experts; invite the stakeholders that build, maintain, \nand use our transportation system.\n  Listen to the heads of the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nleaders in transit, truckers, AAA, bicyclists, all of whom agree with \nPresident Eisenhower, who used the gas tax to start the highway trust \nfund and the interstate freeway system, and President Ronald Reagan, \nwho increased gas tax a nickel, more than doubling it in 1992.\n  In fact, we can invite legislators from today. Six red Republican \nStates have raised the gas tax already this year: Nebraska, Georgia, \nIdaho, Iowa, Utah, and South Dakota. State Senator Michael Vehle comes \nto mind.\n  The key is to have real hearings, like Congress used to conduct. Have \na full week devoted to solving the transportation funding crisis. Bring \nin the witnesses, grill them, test their thoughts and theories, discuss \nreal solutions, not gimmicks or ideologically driven fantasies.\n  Let's have serious work sessions and a markup. President Obama could \nhelp by establishing a marker that he will approve no further \nextensions past September 31.\n  It will not be less complex, expensive, or easier politically in \n2016, 2017, or 2018. If this slides until 2016, which is the approach \nevidently favored by the Republican leadership, we will be struggling \nwith this in the next Congress and the next administration.\n  This does not have to be an exercise in futility. We are seeing the \nleadership exhibited all across the country with 20 States that have \nstepped up, and as I mentioned, six red States already this year.\n  Now is the time for Congress to do its job. In fact, if we do our \njob, taking the solution that has been thoroughly vetted, studied, and \nwidely supported by interest groups across the political spectrum, we \nare going to be able to solve this funding conundrum.\n  We will be able to rebuild and renew America, putting hundreds of \nthousands of people to work at family-wage jobs, while Congress helps \nmake our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.\n  I strongly urge that the House reject the approach that would simply \ndodge this problem for 2 more months, then slide to the end of the year \nand beyond. We should call the question now, establish the parameters.\n  This is something that is long overdue, that all of us can embrace, \nand America will be the better for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3314-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Holding) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, the challenges we face today are different \nfrom the challenges we faced when Mental Health Awareness Month began \ndecades ago, but now, it is more important than ever that we take time \nout of our busy schedules to speak about the prevalence of mental \nillness and understand the importance, as friends, as family members, \nand as a community, of discussing the common signs of mental illness.\n  Mr. Speaker, you may be surprised to learn, as I was, that 1 in 5 \nadults experience mental health problems each year; and, while each \nillness is unique, there are some common signs that you or a loved one \ncould be suffering from mental illness, like difficulty concentrating \nor experiencing a change in sleeping habits.\n  As parents, we must make an effort to talk to our children about \ntheir emotions and their mental health, just as we care for our \nchildren's physical health, by encouraging them to eat well, get enough \nsleep, and exercise frequently.\n  Without a doubt, Mr. Speaker, America is one of the most blessed \ncountries in the world. We are all offered the opportunities for life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Raising healthy families, both \nphysically and mentally, is one of the responsibilities that comes with \nthose freedoms.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, the more voices we have speaking up about \nmental health, the better we can eliminate stigma surrounding mental \nhealth conditions. The National Alliance on Mental Illness of North \nCarolina is asking individuals in my home State, North Carolina, to see \nthe person and not the illness and pledge to be stigma-free.\n  It is time to end the silence and stigma often linked with mental \nhealth conditions, and I join them happily in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3314-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF B.B.

Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, B.B. \nKing, a musical genius, has passed away.\n  When B.B. King was just a little boy down in Indianola, Mississippi, \nhe stood up in the middle of a cotton field, and he said:\n\n       One day, somebody is going to stand up and sing about me \n     and play the guitar about me.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       You know, I reckon it will be myself. Yeah, I reckon it \n     will be me.\n\n  B.B. King went on to become a worldwide icon of music; and people all \nover the world, regardless of race, creed, or color, appreciated and \nloved B.B. King. B.B. King influenced all the great ones, from Frank \nSinatra to Elvis Presley; and Elvis Presley loved B.B. King.\n  Aretha Franklin, Sam Cook, Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, even the \nBeatles and Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, all of these musical legends were \ninfluenced by B.B. King.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  B.B. King sung about the deep things of life. He sung about love--\nlove lost and love gained. B.B. King sang, and he played the blues. A \nunique American cultural, musical genre, B.B. King.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, B.B. King would say:\n\n     Trouble in mind, I'm blue\n     But I won't be blue always\n     'Cause I know the sun's gonna shine in my back door someday\n     I am all alone at midnight, and the lights are burning low\n     But the sun's gonna shine in my back door someday.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the great classic of so many classics that he wrote and \nhe sang was ``The Thrill is Gone.'' As he would say, ``The thrill is \ngone away.'' But, Mr. Speaker, the thrill of B.B. King and his life and \nhis music and his great contributions as a genuine American hero will \nlive on and on for generations to come. B.B. King's music will live on, \nand Lucille, his guitar, will live on.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Speaker, we thank God, Jehovah God \nAlmighty, for sending B.B.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, a large and respected Iranian expatriate \ncommunity has settled in California, and it has been my privilege to \nget to know some of them in recent years. They are part of an \ninternational diaspora of 5 million people who fled Iran after it fell \nto Islamic fascism 36 years\n\n[[Page H3315]]\n\nago. The stories they tell are bloodcurdling.\n  One woman told of her cousin who had been rounded up in an \nantigovernment demonstration and taken to prison. After several years, \nthe families were informed that their loved ones were to be released in \nthe town square. When the excited families arrived for their long-\nawaited reunion, their sons were hanged before their eyes.\n  A doctor told me of his college days in Paris. He called home to tell \nhis brother in Tehran of an anti-Khomeini demonstration. His brother \nwas promptly arrested, tortured, and imprisoned for simply listening.\n  Now, a few months ago, after many years of silence, the brother in \nAmerica received a call from his brother in Iran who wanted to tell him \nof the simmering unrest going on throughout that country. The American \nbrother told him to shut up, to remember what happened the last time \nthey had spoken so candidly. His brother in Tehran said: ``I don't care \nanymore. They can't arrest all of us.''\n  All of the Iranian expatriates I spoke with tell me the same thing: \nthe economic sanctions and international isolation of the regime were \nbringing Iran to the brink of revolution.\n  And this brings us to the President's negotiation with Iran's fascist \nIslamic regime. Any agreement between Iran's leaders and the United \nStates is meaningless because Iran's leaders' word is meaningless. \nIran's government is a notoriously untrustworthy rogue state that has \nmade it unmistakably clear that it intends to acquire nuclear weapons \nand, once acquired, to use them. The only way to avert this nightmare, \nshort of war, is for the regime to collapse from within.\n  Over the last several years, the Iranian opposition has grown \ndramatically for two reasons: there is a strong and growing perception \namong the Iranian people that the Iranian dictatorship is a pariah in \nthe international community, and the resulting international economic \nsanctions have created conditions that make the regime's overthrow \nimperative.\n  At precisely this moment in history, Barack Obama did incalculable \ndamage by initiating these negotiations. By engaging this rogue state, \nPresident Obama has given it international recognition and legitimacy \nat just that moment when it had lost legitimacy in the eyes of its own \npeople. Worse, by promising relief from economic sanctions, he has \nremoved the most compelling reason the organized Iranian resistance had \nto justify the regime's overthrow.\n  It is not the outcome of the negotiations that matters because any \nagreement with Iran's conniving leaders is meaningless. It is the \nnegotiations, themselves, that have greatly strengthened the regime, \njust when it was most vulnerable from growing opposition among its own \npeople.\n  Now, the House just passed H.R. 1191 that purports to restore \ncongressional oversight to these talks. I believe it completely missed \nthe point.\n  First, our Constitution requires that any treaty be approved by two-\nthirds of the Senate. Well, that wasn't going to happen, so Mr. Obama \nsimply redefined the prospective treaty as an agreement between \nleaders, an agreement with no force of law and no legal standing.\n  I fear the Congress has just changed this equation by establishing a \nwholly extra-constitutional process that lends the imprimatur of \nCongress to these negotiations with no practical way to stop the \nlifting of sanctions. Instead of two-thirds of the Senate having to \napprove a treaty, as the Constitution requires, this agreement takes \neffect automatically unless two-thirds of both Houses reject it--a \ncomplete sham.\n  But worse, I fear this bill gives tacit approval to extremely harmful \nnegotiations that Congress, instead, ought to vigorously condemn and \nunambiguously repudiate.\n  We can only hope that in the days ahead what Churchill called ``the \nparliamentary democracies'' will regain the national leadership \nrequired to prevent these negotiations from producing what amounts to \nthe Munich accords for the Middle East. That will require treating the \nIranian dictatorship as the international pariah that it is, and it \nwill require providing every ounce of moral and material support to the \nIranian opposition that they need to rid their Nation of this fascist \nIslamic dictatorship, to restore their proud heritage, and to retake \ntheir place among the civilized nations of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3315-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3315-H3316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, Mark Twain once said that ``action speaks \nlouder than words but not nearly as often.''\n  Since last week's tragic Amtrak accident, we have heard plenty of \nwords about the need for stronger rail safety measures and investments \nin our infrastructure, but it is time for Congress to back up these \nwords with action. It is time for Congress to put its money where its \nmouth is.\n  We know how to prevent tragic accidents like the one that happened on \nAmtrak last week. We even mandated new technology called positive train \ncontrol that would have prevented it. But what Congress has refused to \ndo is to pay to actually get it done.\n  Positive train control is a game-changer for rail safety. The \ntechnology would have likely prevented 140 train accidents that have \ncaused more than 280 deaths and $300 million in property damage since \n1969. But this safety technology is also incredibly complex and \nexpensive to implement. We have mandated technology that is expected to \ncost billions, and we are forcing the Nation's railroads to foot the \nentire bill.\n  Much of this last week's focus has been on Amtrak, but despite last \nweek's accident, Amtrak is actually on target to implement positive \ntrain control by the end of the year.\n  For the already cash-strapped commuter railroads around the country, \nit is a completely different story. For them, Congress' refusal to fund \npositive train control has pretty much stopped implementation in its \ntracks. Expected to cost commuter railroads nearly $3.5 billion, it is \nno wonder that over 70 percent of commuter railroads won't achieve \npositive train control implementation before this year's deadline.\n  Our commuter railroads are integral to the daily commute of millions \nof Americans. In fact, Amtrak's annual ridership pales in comparison to \nour Nation's commuter railroads. While Amtrak carries 30 million riders \na year, commuter railroads carry close to 500 million.\n  In the Chicago area alone, Metra's ridership last year was over 80 \nmillion. With numbers like that, how can Congress justify mandating a \npolicy that they know commuter railroads simply cannot afford while \nproviding very little funding to help them do it?\n  This unfunded mandate is forcing commuter rails to sacrifice other \ninvestments that are crucial to railroad safety and efficiency. Fifty \npercent of commuter railroads are currently deferring other capital \ninvestments to implement positive train control.\n  And what happens when the commuters aren't able to implement this \ntechnology before the end of this year? They get penalized--fined. \nInstead of giving money to the commuters to pay for PTC, the Federal \nGovernment is actually going to end up collecting money from them for \nnot being able to afford to do so.\n  For good reason, Congress mandated incredibly important and \nincredibly expensive new technology. But it has amounted to a lot of \nwords and very little action.\n  The same 2008 law that mandated PTC also authorized $50 million a \nyear in rail safety technology grants to help Amtrak and commuter \nrailroads pay for this implementation, but in the 7 years since the law \nwas passed, Congress has only appropriated funding once.\n  Mr. Speaker, $50 million a year wasn't enough then, and it is sure \nnot enough now. That is why I introduced a bill with the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski) in March to reauthorize PTC funding at $200 \nmillion a year.\n  It is time for Congress to finish what it started. It is time for \nCongress to get serious about investing in our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure. And it is time for Congress to help our commuter \nrailroads implement positive train control and prevent the kind of\n\n[[Page H3316]]\n\ntragedies that we saw on Amtrak last week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3316-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING MAX DEMBY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. \nDemby is a former congressional intern from my office, a University of \nColorado senior, and an outstanding young man of character who was \nrecently recognized by his community and local police for an act of \nheroism when he stopped a sexual assault in progress on his school \ncampus.\n  Mr. Demby, who is from Cortez, Colorado, is a dedicated student, \npursuing a degree in accounting at CU. He fills his time outside of the \nclassroom with extracurricular activities such as internships and also \nworks as a Ralphie handler at CU, which involves helping to manage the \nschool mascot.\n  Late one evening, Mr. Demby was walking on campus when he happened to \ncome across what looked to be an attempted sexual assault. Acting with \nbravery and determination, Mr. Demby took action and ran off the \nattacker.\n  Referencing the confrontation with the attacker, Mr. Demby humbly \nstated: ``I was able to be in the right place at the right time and do \nthe right thing.'' By intervening, Max put himself in harm's way to \nhelp the victim, and his act of selflessness drastically reduced the \nirreparable damage that the criminal was intent on causing.\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Demby's selfless act should not go unnoticed. He \nserves as an admirable example of what young men of character should \nbe. By putting others before himself and by intervening to stop a crime \nwithout hesitation, he made his community and campus a safer place.\n  On behalf of the Third Congressional District and the State of \nColorado, I would like to thank Mr. Demby for his selfless act of \nbravery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3316-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HUNGER AMONG SENIORS GROWING IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The food looked and smelled delicious and \nreminded me of what my grandmother used to make.\n  I joined Arthur on his normal N1 route, making stops at 15 homes in \nNorthampton. At each stop, I had the opportunity to deliver the meal \nand chat with the residents. It was an eye-opening experience, and I \nthoroughly enjoyed hearing people's stories.\n  Each meal delivered contains one-third of the daily nutritional \nrecommendations. For many individuals, the meal they receive from Meals \non Wheels is the only well-balanced meal they eat all day.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The individuals who receive these meals are low-income and often have \nsignificant health challenges that make it simply too difficult to \nprepare a full meal, never mind going out to the grocery store to shop.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the most interesting things I learned from my \nvisit is that Meals on Wheels is so much more than just a meals \nprogram. People who are homebound--many, who live alone--look forward \nto the brief, daily visits from the volunteers. These visits lift their \nspirits and allow them to socialize, and volunteers can check in and \nsee how they are doing. Because of programs like Meals on Wheels, \nseniors can stay in their own homes where they are most comfortable and \nlive independently longer.\n  Mr. Speaker, when we talk about food insecurity in this country, \nnearly everybody talks about children, and we are right to want to do \neverything we can to end childhood hunger. But lost in that narrative \nis the reality that, among the food insecure, the rising population is \nseniors. One in twelve seniors in our country is faced with the reality \nof hunger. That is 5.3 million seniors who don't have enough to eat. \nMany are living on fixed incomes that often force them to choose \nbetween prescriptions and food--or paying their medical bills or \nheating their homes.\n  Seniors and the disabled represent about 20 percent of those who \nreceive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. \nThe average SNAP benefit for households with seniors is a meager $134 \nper month. Unfortunately, we also know that eligible elderly households \nare much less likely to participate in SNAP than other eligible \nhouseholds. Many seniors may not realize that they qualify for \nassistance, or they may simply be reluctant to ask for help.\n  Seniors have unique nutritional needs. Hunger is especially dangerous \nfor seniors and can exacerbate underlying medical conditions. Food-\ninsecure seniors are at increased risk for conditions like depression, \nheart attack, diabetes, and high blood pressure.\n  Mr. Speaker, May is Older Americans Month, and national organizations \nlike Feeding America, the nationwide network of food banks, are focused \non raising awareness about senior hunger through their \n#solveseniorhunger social media campaign.\n  In July, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Older \nAmericans Act, which provides a range of critical services, including \nMeals on Wheels, that enable about 11 million older adults to stay \nindependent as long as possible. To honor that significant anniversary, \nI hope that Congress will pass a strong reauthorization of OAA \nprograms, which have been flat-funded over the past decade and without \na long-term authorization since 2011. Demand for OAA programs and \nservices continues to rapidly increase as our population ages, and to \nthink that more and more seniors will experience hunger is \nheartbreaking. It is unacceptable in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the wonderful people and the \nwork that they do at Highland Valley Elder Services throughout western \nMassachusetts. Every day they are making the lives of seniors a little \nbetter and a little brighter. We in Congress should do our part to \nensure that our Nation's seniors don't go hungry. We should pass a \nstrong reauthorization of the Older Americans Act and adequately fund \nprograms like Meals on Wheels, and we should reject harmful cuts to \nSNAP that will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us: \nchildren, seniors, and the disabled.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should urge the White House to hold a White House \nConference on Food, Nutrition, and Hunger to come up with a \ncomprehensive plan to end hunger once and for all in this country. We \ncan and we should end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3316-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3316-H3317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAMS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Reed) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an issue that is \ncoming upon us very quickly.\n  Mr. Speaker, many people across the Nation have talked about Social \nSecurity and Medicare and the trust funds going bankrupt for the \nretirement fund and Medicare sometime in 2033, 2034, but, Mr. Speaker, \nthere is a more impending crisis coming down upon us. The Social \nSecurity disability trust fund is scheduled to go insolvent in 2016. \nThat means, if we do nothing, what is going to happen in 2016 is \nmillions of Americans across this Nation who receive those lifesaving \ndisability benefits monthly will see a reduction in their benefits to \nthe tune of 20 to 21 percent. That is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker.\n\n[[Page H3317]]\n\n  Two years ago, as I serve on the Ways and Means Committee, I had an \nopportunity to question our Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew. I asked him \nthe question 2 years ago: You know this crisis is on the horizon. I \nhave read your testimony to this committee of Ways and Means, and I \nread the entire President's budget.\n  I said: Nowhere in there is a solution or a reference to this \nimpending crisis. What is the solution the White House is offering?\n  Simply, what they propose is they are going to take the portion of \nour payroll taxes that goes to Social Security retirement that is paid \nby future retirees and use the $270 billion necessary to bail out the \ndisability trust fund.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I had a private business. If \nyou talk to any small-business owner across America, what they will \ntell you that is, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul because the Social \nSecurity retirement trust fund is on that same path to insolvency in \n2033. So why would you take from one and use it to bail out another \nwhen both programs are in dire straits? So, Mr. Speaker, I said to Jack \nLew this year, when I had an opportunity to question him, that is \nunacceptable. We need to do better not only in order to protect the \nSocial Security retirees, who are near and dear to me, but also to \nthose in the disability community that rely on these benefits.\n  The disability trust fund hasn't been reformed for decades. I care \nabout those individuals deeply. And when I see disabled folks coming in \nto my office, as I have reached out to stakeholder groups and had \nconversations, what they tell me is they have a disability trust fund \nprogram that essentially penalizes them for trying to go back to work. \nThat doesn't make sense.\n  We should be standing with the disability community if they have a \ncapacity, a willingness, and a desire to go back to work. Our policies \nhere in Washington, D.C., should say we are going to stand with you, we \nare going to encourage you, and we are going to applaud you, not \npenalize you, for doing that.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that this crisis needs to be \ndealt with. It is time to lead. What we are looking for is input from \nacross the country on ideas on how we can reform the disability trust \nfund, protect our Social Security retirees to the extent that we \npossibly can, and make sure that we have a disability trust fund that \nis designed and performing in the 21st century, a trust fund that says \nto the disabled community, we are with you, we are going to stand next \nto you, and we are going to give you the resources you need in order to \nlive a great and fruitful life. At the same time we are going to look \nat our Social Security retirees and say to them, ``We are going to \nprotect you.''\n  If we can't fix this crisis coming upon us in 2016, Mr. Speaker, then \nhow in God's name can we fix the crises of Medicare and Social Security \nthat are coming upon us in 2033 and thereabouts? There are millions of \nAmericans that deserve a better answer than kicking the can down the \nroad. Mr. Speaker, it is time to lead, and I rise today to ask all my \ncolleagues to join me in that leadership role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3317-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Father Gregory \nGoethals, a member of the Society of Jesus and the president of Loyola \nHigh School in Los Angeles, to the United States House of \nRepresentatives. We thank him for delivering today's opening prayer.\n  Father Goethals is one of Los Angeles' finest public servants. He has \ndedicated his life to educating our country's next generation of \nleaders. Loyola High School, an all-boys school in the Pico Union area \nof Los Angeles, ranks as one of the finest institutions of secondary \neducation in America.\n  At Loyola, under Father Goethals, young men are motivated to become \n``educated'' in the full sense of the word. Not only do students at \nLoyola go on to complete college at the finest universities in America, \nbut they graduate Loyola having donated more than 1.5 million hours of \ncommunity service to inner city schools and neighborhoods over the past \n25 years.\n  This year, Loyola High School will celebrate its 150th anniversary, \nmaking it the oldest continually operated educational institution in \nsouthern California. Under the visionary stewardship of Father \nGoethals, Loyola is poised to graduate yet another era of American \nheroes and leaders.\n  For that, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me to applaud \nFather Gregory Goethals for his dedication to his faith and to our \nleaders of tomorrow. We will remember his words of prayer this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3317-7", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3317-H3318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RESIGNATIONS AS MEMBER OF COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND COMMITTEE ON \n                            FOREIGN AFFAIRS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee) laid before the \nHouse the following resignations as a member of the Committee on \nAgriculture and Committee on Foreign Affairs:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2015.\n     Hon.

Without a funding solution, the \njobs of over 600,000 American workers are at risk.

Mr. Speaker, the infrastructure investment can be an \neconomic game changer. In western New York, the Federal highway bill \nfunded the reconstruction of Fuhrman Boulevard, which reconnected our \ncommunity with its waterfront, resulting in new private sector \ninvestment.\n  From Filmore Avenue and Ohio Street in Buffalo to Main Street in \nWilliamsville, the Robert Moses Parkway in Niagara Falls, and Kenmore \nAvenue in Tonawanda, tens of millions of Federal dollars are \ncontributing to transformative projects in our community. The \nconstruction of these projects has economic benefits as well. 660,000 \njobs depend on Federal road and transit investment. Yet today, the \nHouse will extend, for just 2 months, the Federal transportation \nprogram that is weak and inadequate.

It is unacceptable.\n  We must work together to find a long-term solution to repair our \nroads, bridges, and transit. Today our Republican colleagues have \nintroduced a plan that just kicks it down the road again. This must be \nthe last time. Funding the highway trust fund is about this Nation's \nfuture. It is about our competitiveness. It is about providing \nbusinesses and local and State governments the certainty that they \nneed, and it is about good-paying jobs for working families.\n  It is time to end this culture of crisis and bring to the floor a \nlong-term, sustainable solution to authorize the highway trust fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3319-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                 HOPEFULLY THE PRESIDENT CHANGES COURSE\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.

This follows the mass murder of \nMuslim pilgrims in Karachi, Pakistan, and Egyptian Christians in Libya. \nRadical Islamic attacks are increasing worldwide with the murder of \nJews in Paris, the killing of troops at Fort Hood, and the stabbing in \nLondon.\n  Incredibly, the President continues negotiations with the murderous \nideology of Tehran while they continue development of intercontinental \nballistic missiles to fulfill their goal of death to America, death to \nIsrael. Hopefully, the President will divert policies to establish a \nlegacy of peace through strength.

It is no surprise Texas has also led the Nation in exports for \nthe last 13 years running.\n  Allowing free enterprise and open markets to thrive has fueled \ndecades of Texas growth.

But instead of addressing the issue during the last \nseveral Congresses, short-term fixes have been passed, and Congress has \nkicked the can down the road. We need more than rhetoric on the \nimportance of infrastructure. We need solutions.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Thursday I will introduce the Prioritizing American \nRoads and Jobs Act. This bill will roll back 100 percent Medicaid \nexpansion reimbursement rates to be equal to traditional Medicaid \nrates, with the savings transferring to the highway trust fund. This \nbill will add $15 billion a year to the trust fund and put it back on \nthe path to financial stability for the long term, while freeing up \n$150 billion for deficit reduction over the next 10 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3320-6", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3320-H3321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS.

Head \nStart programs give students an opportunity to start out strong and \nhelp to close the achievement gap that plagues many low-income \ncommunities.\n  As a mother, grandmother, and retired educator, I recognize that \nearly education provides students with the resources they need in the \nmost critical learning years. More than 27 percent of the people in my \ndistrict live below the poverty line. Students in low-income families \nhave obvious disadvantages that are exacerbated when they arrive in \nkindergarten less prepared than their peers.\n  More than 3,000 children in my district benefit from Head Start \nprograms. These programs give many children the jump-start and the \nconfidence\n\n[[Page H3321]]\n\nthey need. Research shows that children enrolled in high-quality \neducation programs are more likely to graduate from high school, go to \ncollege, and secure high-paying jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, an investment in early education is an investment in our \nfuture. I will continue fighting for early learning initiatives and \ncommonsense education reform that prepare all of our students to \nsucceed, and I call on my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3321-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING CADET JONATHAN CHASE STRICKLAND\n\n  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

Only Congress can permanently replace our \nbroken immigration system with one that works, one that restores the \nrule of law, one that secures our border, and one that provides a \npathway to citizenship.\n  I hope the fifth circuit will rule on the side of justice and the \nrule of law by lifting the injunction; but no matter what happens, this \njudicial mess is just further proof of Congress' failure to act.\n  I call upon Congress to address our broken immigration system and \nmove forward with restoring the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3321-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2015.\n     Hon.

The gentleman from Washington is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, H. Res. 271, providing for consideration of three \nimportant bills.\n  This rule provides for consideration of the America COMPETES \nReauthorization Act of 2015 and the Legislative Branch Appropriations \nAct of 2016 under structured rules, and the Highway and Transportation \nFunding Act of 2015 under a closed rule. It is important to note that \nthis combined rule allows for separate consideration of each bill. This \nHouse will separately debate and consider these important issues.\n  The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is traditionally \nconsidered under a structured amendment process, and that practice is \ncontinued today.\n  The America COMPETES Act makes a dozen amendments in order, with more \nthan half--eight amendments--coming from Democratic sponsors.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1806 is a fiscally responsible proscience bill that \nreauthorizes civilian research programs at the Department of Energy, \nthe National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, and the White House Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy.\n  The bill keeps our Nation competitive on the global stage and works \nto refocus the Federal Government's primary scientific role to fund \nbasic research. This reprioritization of basic research will help \nensure future U.S. economic competitiveness and security and will spur \nadditional private sector technological innovation, which is crucial to \nthe United States remaining a world leader in scientific and \ntechnological advances.\n  This bill keeps overall funding for these programs equal to the \nfiscal year 2015 appropriated levels and is consistent with the caps \nset by the Budget Control Act, prioritizing taxpayer investment in \nbasic research without increasing overall Federal spending.\n  The emphasis this legislation places on Federal investment and \nresearch in the physical sciences and engineering helps to develop and \nadvance knowledge and technologies used in fields by scientists who are \ndedicated to improving the lives of all Americans.\n  I have seen firsthand the importance of these investments while \nvisiting the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, one of our 17 \nnational labs, which I am proud to represent in my district, \nWashington's Fourth District.\n  The work being done at PNNL and at the national labs and research \nuniversities all across the country is critical to our country's \nfuture, and the prioritizations and reforms on this bill will enhance \nthe work being done to the benefit of all Americans.\n  Additionally, H.R. 1806 reduces by $1 billion the administration's \nlarge and unjustified program, such as late stage commercialization, \nwhich picks winners and losers that compete with the private sector.\n  We must be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars, and this \nlegislation will prevent duplicative and wasteful research activities \nby requiring the Department of Energy to certify that the work being \ndone is original and has not already been conducted by another Federal \nagency.\n  Overall, the America COMPETES Act will reestablish the priority of \nbasic research in the core physical sciences and biology in the \nNation's civilian science agencies. This bill sets the right priorities \nfor our Nation's civilian research and will promote U.S. innovation, \ningenuity, and competitiveness, all without increasing our national \ndebt or deficit.\n  This rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 2250, the \nLegislative Branch Appropriations Act of 2016. This legislation \nprovides funding for all operations of the United States House of \nRepresentatives, the U.S. Capitol complex, the Capitol Police, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the many other agencies that are so \nimportant to the day-to-day functions of Congress.\n  H.R. 2250 provides the legislative branch with $3.3 billion in fiscal \nyear 2016--the same amount as fiscal year 2014, as well as fiscal year \n2015--continuing this Chamber's commitment to leading by example during \nthese times of huge deficits and out-of-control debt.\n  The activities this bill funds are critical to the operations of the \nCapitol complex, which must be protected, cared for, and maintained. \nVisitors from my district in central Washington, as well as visitors \nfrom across the country and throughout the world, travel countless \nmiles to visit this remarkable institution, which is a symbol of \ndemocracy and freedom for so many.\n  For these and many other reasons, we must ensure that the Capitol \nremains in this pristine condition and is able to withstand the test of \ntime so that many future generations are able to visit this truly \nunique and historic place.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Finally, this rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 2353, the \nHighway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015.\n  H.R. 2353 will extend the highway trust fund's expenditure authority \nfor 2 months--from May 31 to July 31. It will also provide an extension \nfor many important Federal highway and public transportation programs, \nsuch as the motor carrier and highway safety programs as well as the \nhazardous materials transportation program, through July 31.\n  Last August, Congress passed and the President signed the Highway and \nTransportation Funding Act of 2014, which was intended to provide \nenough funding for the highway trust fund to remain solvent through May \n31 of this year. However, the funding is now lasting longer than was \noriginally predicted, and this bill will extend the trust fund's \nexpenditure authority so that transportation spending is able to \ncontinue through July while Congress works to find a solution that will \nensure the trust fund remains solvent for years to come. A constructive \ndialogue in Congress is needed on this issue, one that will give States \nthe certainty they need to build the roads, the bridges,\n\n[[Page H3323]]\n\nand other infrastructure that our communities and our economy need to \nthrive in the 21st century.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule. I support its \nadoption, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the \nunderlying bills.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and the \nunderlying bills.\n  We should be celebrating today the start of the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals expansion and the Deferred Action for Parents of \nAmerican Citizens program that President Obama launched in light of the \ncontinued failure of this Congress to finally fix our broken \nimmigration system. This Congress hasn't brought forth a single \nimmigration bill, not secured our border, not ensured that employers \nfollow our law and only employ legal American workers; but, rather, at \nevery opportunity, it has sought to thwart the executive branch, doing \nwhat they can with the powers they have under our U.S. Constitution to \nrestore the rule of law without the help of this body.\n  These three bills before us today are yet another way of kicking the \nball down the road and refusing to address our broken immigration \nsystem, a problem that will continue to get worse until Congress steps \nup and solves it.\n  I hope that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program's \nexpansion, known as DACA--already a great success with additional \nsuccess along the way with the new expansion--and the Deferred Action \nfor Parents of American Citizens program, or DAPA, are soon unclogged \nby the courts to at least reduce the size of this sometimes \ninsurmountable problem that Congress continues to refuse to tackle. \nThat is the alternative.\n  If Congress continues to bring up three bills every week and if none \nof them are about border security and none of them are about \nimmigration, do you know what? Instead of there being 10 million people \nhere illegally, there are going to be 15 or 20 million here 10 years. \nThat is exactly where this Republican Congress is leading us--towards \nan America where, someday, there might be more people here illegally \nthan there are here legally. Think about that, Mr. Speaker.\n  This first bill that we are considering before us today is not \nimmigration reform. It is, instead, a 2-month extension of the current \nsurface transportation authorization. Our transportation system is the \nlifeblood of our country. It dictates our ability to move and manage \nnot only people but information, ideas, products, industries, commerce, \njobs. By failing to pass a long-term transportation reauthorization, \nwhich will ensure the security of our highways and transit systems for \nmore than 60 days, we are putting our Nation's economic lifeblood in \njeopardy.\n  The second bill we will see before us today is not immigration \nreform. The second bill, instead, is a partisan attempt to inject the \nideological priorities of my Republican colleagues into education and \nresearch, priorities that are opposed by the very titans of research \nfor whom this bill is ostensibly designed. I will talk more about that \nin a moment.\n  Of the third bill before us today, I am hopeful. Is it immigration \nreform? I ask the gentleman from Washington: Is the third bill before \nus today immigration reform? I am happy to yield to the gentleman for \nan answer.\n  In reclaiming my time, he is speechless. He is speechless because he \nknows the truth: the third bill is not immigration reform. The third \nbill is actually the funding bill for the legislative branch of \ngovernment. Maybe if the legislative branch of government were actually \ndoing its job we would have an immigration reform bill before us; but, \nno, my colleague from Washington is speechless because he knows as well \nas I do that this is not immigration reform, that it is, instead, a \nfunding bill for Members of Congress' salaries and the salaries of our \nstaffs. I guess that is more important than securing our border. I \nguess that is more important to the Republicans than restoring the rule \nof law.\n  Let me get into these three bills.\n  The Surface Transportation Act would extend the authority of the \ngovernment to fund our highways for 2 months--only for 2 months. What \nthat means is we risk wasting $51 billion and, in jeopardizing that \nfunding, risk over 660,000 jobs by failing to do a long-term \nauthorization of the highway trust fund.\n  We all have an interest in this. Any one of us can talk about the \nimportance of transportation in our districts. If you have ever been to \nColorado, you will know that there is one major artery to get to our \nworld-class ski facilities and unparalleled 14,000 peaks from the metro \narea--Highway 70. If you have ever taken it, particularly on a Friday, \nor have come back on a Sunday, you might very well have sat in your car \nat a dead stop. If you have been to Fort Collins, which is the largest \ncity in my district and is home to one of our great universities, \nColorado State University, you might have found similar circumstances \naround the long rush hour on Highway 25 north. Waiting 45 minutes in \ntraffic to go 5 or 10 miles is something my constituents do every day--\ndoubling, tripling, quadrupling their commuting time.\n\n  These stories aren't unique to Colorado. They aren't unique to my \ndistrict. I will bet every Member of Congress can share the importance \nof transportation in their districts. That is why, ostensibly, every \nMember of Congress says, ``We want transportation. We support roads.''\n  There are no Republican roads and Democratic roads. There are roads. \nYet, by continuing to fail to provide a long-term funding structure for \nthem, we are playing games with the livelihoods of the American people, \nhurting our own economic lifeblood, wasting people's time as they are \nsitting in traffic, throwing into jeopardy the status of the jobs of \ncontractors and subcontractors, and risking lives by continuing to \nrepair our necessary bridges and infrastructure that have accumulated \nsafety deficits. I urge my colleagues to consider the irresponsibility \ninherent in this punt.\n  I would also like to talk about the America COMPETES Act. Now, the \noriginal genesis of this bill, which was passed in 2007, was to help \nAmerica compete in an increasingly global environment across the \nsciences and to ensure our innovative spirit.\n  My district is a hub for scientific research, and we are excited to \nhave the University of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado State University, \nNOAA, NREL, and NCAR. Research that is done in Colorado has \nramifications and positive effects across the country, like our space \nweather lab in Boulder, which helps make sure that air traffic \ncontrollers and pilots have access to up-to-the-minute information \nabout solar flares that could alter their trajectories in realtime.\n  This bill, instead of continuing the bipartisan legacy that the \noriginal COMPETES Act sets out or instead of replacing our broken \nimmigration system with one that works for our country, seems to \ncherry-pick winners based on ideology and overturns the historic \npriorities of the bill. Why else would the dean of Research at CU-\nBoulder oppose this bill? Why else would our widely respected Secretary \nof Energy oppose this bill? Dozens of the largest scientific \norganizations and coalitions--this is supposed to be a science bill--\nare saying, ``Don't give us this bill. It will hurt science in our \ncountry.'' How does that even make any sense?\n  The efforts of the Republicans to hijack this legislation for \nideological interests are utterly transparent. Scientists are saying, \n``Go home Federal Government. Don't help us with this bill.'' Again, in \nyet another instance of Federal overreach, the Republicans are imposing \ntheir versions of science on those in the field who are doing work.\n  Finally, this rule brings forth H.R. 2250, also a bill that is not \nimmigration reform. It does nothing to secure our border, but it does \nmake sure that Members of Congress get paid. I am sure Republicans can \ngo home happy about that. It makes sure our hard-working staff gets \npaid, the committees get paid, and the buildings get repaired.\n  No, I am not against those things. Those are fine things. If we had \nan all-volunteer legislature, we probably\n\n[[Page H3324]]\n\nwouldn't have the fine caliber of statesmen we have tackling our \nnational problems here today. But it is not immigration reform, Mr. \nSpeaker. It doesn't secure our border, and it will only continue to \nincrease the number of people who are here illegally in our country \nwhile Congress continues to punt and to undermine the efforts of the \nPresident to do what he can with the powers he has through DACA and \nDAPA, which were scheduled to start today.\n  I do want to point out that the underlying draft of this Legislative \nBranch Appropriations Act is another example of the failure to address \nmany of the needs of our country. There was an effort by my colleague \nDebbie Wasserman Schultz to put forward an amendment to ensure that \nHouse cafeteria workers receive a living wage. You would think we would \nwant to be an example of a model employer. I would hope that we, as \ncustodians of the U.S. Capitol, would take some pride in that we are a \nmodel employer; we are a little microcosm of what employers should do, \nbest practices. But there is a Senate employee who is homeless because, \non the salary he gets, he can't even afford to rent here in Washington. \nPeople who work every day here in the Nation's Capital are living in \npoverty.\n  I think that we can do better as a model employer. If this were my \ncompany, I would take no pride in that. I would like to think that this \nis our company. It is the United States of America, and we are the \nboard. Let's have employment policies that we as employers can be proud \nof.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule and to, instead, bring \nto the floor immigration reform or better versions of these bills: a \nscience bill that, maybe, scientists support, maybe; or a \ntransportation bill that maybe funds our highways for more than 2 \nmonths so that people can plan. It is time we begin working for the \nAmerican people, not against them.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I share the gentleman from Colorado's opinion that the issue of \nimmigration reform is huge, that it is one of the biggest issues facing \nthis country today. I agree that we need to give it adequate debate and \ntime and consideration; although, today is not the day.\n  Mr. Speaker, we recently heard from colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle that combining multiple bills in a single rule can lead to \nfragmented and confusing debate.\n  In an effort to refocus our debate today, I yield 6 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the distinguished chairman of the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nWashington for yielding me time, and who is a former member of the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee himself.\n  H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015, is a \npro-science, fiscally responsible bill that sets America on a path to \nremain the world's leader in innovation. This bill reauthorizes \ncivilian research programs at the National Science Foundation, at the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, at the Department of \nEnergy, and at the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n  Since January, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee has \nheld numerous hearings that have provided input into this bill. This \nincludes budget hearings with the NSF Director, the Acting NIST \nDirector, the Secretary of Energy, and the Assistant Secretary for \nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. But our consideration of the \nprovisions in this bill began long before last year.\n  In the last Congress, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee \nheld numerous hearings on the topics addressed by this bill as well, \nand many of the provisions in the bill were debated during the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee's consideration of the first act last \nCongress, which the Science, Space, and Technology Committee passed in \nMay.\n  Title I of the bill reauthorizes the National Science Foundation for \n2 years and provides a 4.3 percent increase for research and related \nactivities. The bill prioritizes funding for the directors of biology, \ncomputer science, engineering, and mathematics and physical sciences, \nand it recognizes the need to make strategic investments in basic R \nfor the U.S. to remain the global leader in science and innovation.\n  The bill reprioritizes research spending at the National Science \nFoundation by reducing funding for the Social, Behavioral, and Economic \nDirectorate and Geosciences. The bill, instead, focuses funds on the \nphysical sciences from which there are almost all of the scientific \nbreakthroughs that drive new technology, new businesses, industries, \nand job creation and that spurs innovation.\n  Tight Federal budget constraints require all taxpayers' dollars to be \nspent on high-value science in the national interest. Unfortunately, \nthe National Science Foundation has funded a number of projects that do \nnot meet the highest standards of scientific merit--from climate change \nmusicals, to evaluating animal photographs in National Geographic, to \nstudying human-set fires in New Zealand in the 1800s--and there are \ndozens of other examples.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The bill ensures accountability by restoring the original intent of \nthe 1950 NSF Act and requiring that all grants serve the national \ninterest.\n  Title II represents the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's \ncommitment to enhancing STEM education programs. A healthy and viable \nSTEM workforce is critical to American industries and ensures our \nfuture economic prosperity. The definition of STEM is expanded to \ninclude computer science, which connects all STEM subjects.\n  Title III includes three bipartisan bills the Committee on Science, \nSpace, and Technology approved in March. Those bills--H.R. 1119, the \nResearch and Development Efficiency Act; H.R. 1156, the International \nScience and Technology Cooperation Act of 2015; and H.R. 1162, the \nScience Prize Competitions Act--passed the committee by voice vote. Two \nof these bills were sponsored by Democrats.\n  Title IV supports the important measurement standards and technology \nwork taking place at the National Institute for Standards and \nTechnology laboratories, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nprogram, and the recently authorized Network for Manufacturing \nInnovation.\n  Title V reauthorizes the Department of Energy Office of Science for 2 \nyears at a 5.4 percent increase over fiscal year 2015. It prioritizes \nbasic research that enables researchers in all 50 States to have access \nto world-class user facilities, including supercomputers and high-\nintensity light sources. This bill also prevents duplication and \nrequires DOE to certify that its climate science work is unique and not \nbeing undertaken by other Federal agencies.\n  Title VI reauthorizes the DOE applied research and development \nprograms and activities for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017.\n  H.R. 1806 refocuses some spending on late-stage commercialization \nefforts within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to \nresearch and development efforts.\n  Title VII proposes to cut red tape and bureaucracy in the DOE \ntechnology transfer process. Currently, the private sector has little \nincentive to build reactor prototypes due to regulatory uncertainty \nfrom the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  H.R. 1806 sets the right priorities for Federal civilian research, \nwhich enhances innovation and U.S. competitiveness without adding to \nthe Federal deficit and debt. I encourage all my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I was told the gentleman from Washington \nshares a desire to address the broken immigration system. I know the \nchair of the Committee on Rules, Mr. Sessions, has indicated similarly. \nJust as I have posed to Mr. Sessions in the past, I would like to pose \nto the gentleman from Washington if he has a timeframe for when we can \nexpect immigration legislation here on the floor of the House.\n  I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Washington to answer \nthat.\n  Well, sometimes silence speaks louder than words.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a\n\n[[Page H3325]]\n\nmember of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in yielding me \nthis time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to just one aspect on the floor of this \nrule. My colleague from Washington made a statement that we are dealing \nwith a 2-month extension because we found some extra money to let it \nlast longer.\n  No, the reason that we are having a 2-month extension is because we \nhave not been able to resolve this problem. I made the remarks on the \nfloor of the House last summer that extending it to May is not going to \nget us anyplace, and we would be right back in the same spot. I could \ndust off the same speech.\n  What is happening is that you have a little tiny bit of give, but it \ndoesn't mean that we have enough money and that there aren't \nconsequences. There are States across the country, because of the \nuncertainty of the Republican funding approach, that are already \ncutting back on construction projects this summer.\n  This will be the 33rd short-term funding extension. It is a symbol of \nthe failure of my Republican colleagues to do anything in the 55 months \nthat they have been in charge to deal with transportation funding. They \nhave never even had a hearing on transportation finance.\n  Now, I will say that over the last 22 years there have been some \nbipartisan failures to step up to it. Ironically, the solution is \nclear, thoroughly studied, and broadly supported: raise the gas tax for \nthe first time since 1993.\n  The Republican leadership doesn't have to do anything extraordinary, \njust allow the Committee on Ways and Means to follow regular order. \nHave some serious committee hearings. Listen to the experts. Invite in \nthe stakeholders that build, that maintain, and use our transportation \nsystem. Let's have at the witness dais heads of the AFL-CIO, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce--who agree we should raise the gas tax--the head of \ntransit, the American Trucking Association, AAA, bicyclists.\n  They could refer back to great Republican leaders of the past. Dwight \nEisenhower established the gas tax to fund the Interstate Highway \nSystem. Ronald Reagan, the conservative icon, called Congress back in \nNovember of 1982 to more than double the gas tax, which Ronald Reagan \nand Tip O'Neill did.\n  In fact, my Republican friends could involve Republican leaders \ntoday. Six Republican States have raised the gas tax already this year: \nIdaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah, South Dakota, Georgia.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Not exactly liberal bastions.\n  This is something that we can and should do. Let's step up, solve \nthis problem, avoid this continual uncertainty for people around the \ncountry. They deserve better.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, just a note to my colleague from Colorado, \nI agree that this is an important issue that he keeps bringing up of \nimmigration, and I will certainly ask my chairman for any timeframe, \nand I will look forward to working with him and all my colleagues on \nsolving this important issue.\n  But today we are talking about highways. We are talking about \nscience. We are talking about keeping this place running smoothly.\n  To get us back on subject, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Washington for \nyielding me the time. I am glad to hear I am getting us back on \nsubject.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 1806, the \nAmerica COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015. This is fiscally \nresponsible legislation that cuts wasteful government spending and \nprioritizes innovative scientific research and development.\n  A key reform included in the America COMPETES Act is reining in \nspending at the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy, or EERE. EERE's budget has grown by almost 60 percent \nin the last decade. President Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget request \nfor EERE is over $2.7 billion, with a B, which is a requested increase \nof another $800 million over last fiscal year.\n  The Department of Energy's approach to energy research and \ndevelopment has also become more and more unbalanced with the EERE's \ncontinued growth. In fact, the President's proposed budget for EERE R \nis more than double the budgets for nuclear, fossil, and electricity \nR combined. In addition, the work prioritized by EERE is far too \nfocused on increasing the use of today's existing technology. Many EERE \nprograms are focused on reducing market barriers for existing \ntechnology or funding R activities already prioritized by the private \nsector, not conducting the fundamental research to build towards future \nbreakthroughs.\n  With our national debt at $18 trillion and rising, and spending caps \nguiding budgets on everything from energy to national defense, Congress \ncannot rubberstamp this kind of out-of-control spending. It is time to \nadjust the Department of Energy's budget to reality.\n  The America COMPETES Act refocuses Federal investment on energy \nresearch and development, not deployment of today's technology. By \nfunding the basic research and development prioritized in the America \nCOMPETES Act, the Department of Energy can build a foundation for the \nprivate sector to bring innovative energy technology to the market and \nthereby grow the American economy.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this rule and ``yes'' on \nH.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards), the ranking member on the Committee on Science, \nSpace, and Technology Subcommittee on Space.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today both as a member of the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure.\n  I can't think of a worse rule, frankly, that we could bring to the \nfloor. We could have had bipartisan cooperation on America COMPETES so \nthat we can invest in our science and our research and our technology, \nand yet that is not what is happening here today.\n  As to the Highway and Transportation Funding Act, it doesn't allow \nfor any amendments to the legislation that would fix and fund our \nNation's crumbling infrastructure with predictability, stability, and \nfor the long term. The highway trust fund and the current surface \ntransportation authorization, as we know, are set to expire on May 31, \nleaving just 3 legislative days to extend it or 4,000 transportation \nworkers will be laid off and work would stop on Federal highway \nprograms all across the country right in the middle of prime \nconstruction and building season.\n  Now, the responsible among us know that we can't walk away from the \nhighway trust fund. Millions of jobs and thousands of businesses hang \nin the balance. But we also know that what is before us today is the \nleast most responsible way to fund our infrastructure--2 months at a \ntime. Can you believe it? Two months at a time, Mr. Speaker; no long-\nterm projects, no opportunity for planning, no relief for workers, and \nat another pivotal moment in the construction season.\n  As a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \ntoday I am joining Ranking Member DeFazio and Eleanor Holmes Norton in \nintroducing the GROW AMERICA Act on behalf of the administration. This \nbill would serve us well to provide $478 billion over 6 years for our \nhighways, bridges, transit, rail, and highway safety programs. This \nlong-term and robust funding bill is a 45 percent increase over our \ncurrent spending on our tatterdemalion and crumbling infrastructure. It \nis the type of plan that we have to ensure that our major-league \neconomy does not have the infrastructure that wouldn't even fit \nchildren playing T-ball.\n  While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle twiddle their \nthumbs 2 months at a time, America is falling apart. Once one of the \nleaders in the world in quality infrastructure, we are now number 16, \naccording to the World Economic Forum. According to the American \nSociety of Engineers, the overall assessment of our Nation's \ninfrastructure ranks with a whopping D-plus.\n\n[[Page H3326]]\n\n  Now look at my home State of Maryland: 5,305 bridges are deficient; \nthey are falling apart. That is 27 percent of the bridges in our State. \nJust a few months ago, one of my constituents was driving along \nSuitland Parkway, minding her own business, when a chunk of cement fell \nand hit her car hood because the bridge was in disrepair.\n  Though it is not my preference, we have to extend the highway trust \nfund today, and I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to use this time to go through a bipartisan negotiation on how to \npay for our long-term and fully funded investments to construct and \nrebuild our roads, bridges, transit, and rail infrastructure.\n  Thirty-four extensions of the highway trust fund, 52 votes against \nACA. Come on, let's get serious. Move away from the kids' table; get to \nthe grownup table and fund our highway transportation and \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the reason you hear so many people talking \nabout different topics is there are three completely unrelated topics \nin this single rule. There is the funding for all of the legislative \nsalaries and the people who work in this building, that is one bill; \nanother one funds roads, but only for 2 months, across the whole \ncountry; and the other one is the one that they say is for science but \nall the scientists oppose. So that is why it is so confusing. There are \nthree completely unrelated bills in here, none of which do a thing \nabout illegal immigration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. \nWelch), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. WELCH. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need a surface transportation bill, but the last \nthing in the world we need is this bill, a 2-month extension.\n  If this short-term plan was a necessary step to get us to a long-term \nbill, that would make some sense; but, as speakers have noted, this is \nthe 33rd time in the past 5 years where Congress has failed to provide \nlong-term and sustainable funding for our surface transportation needs. \nThis is a habit; it is not a plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill follows on the heels of the bill we passed 9 \nmonths ago, and that was a 9-month extension of surface transportation \npaid for by ``pension smoothing.'' You can't make that up.\n  We lowered the obligation corporations pay to pensions in order to \nput money in the highway transportation fund. We created a pothole in \npensions to fix potholes in the highways; it makes no sense, but now, \nwe are here on a 2-month plan--a good job, Congress.\n  We were given some assurances that we would have a long-term bill. \nThe fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, there are good long-term plans \nout there. Congressman Renacci has a plan, the President has a plan, as \ndo Congressman Delaney and Congressman Blumenauer. There are policies \nout there. We don't need a policy debate. We need a decision.\n  The reality is we have got to make Congress work, do its job, and \npass a long-term funding bill that is going to allow this country to \nmodernize its airports, fix its bridges, make its railroads safer, and \ndredge our ports deeper.\n  We have to bring our 20th century infrastructure into the 21st \ncentury, and the only way we are going to get that done is by stepping \nup to the responsibility that we have to pass a long-term funding plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have indicated to the Speaker himself that it is a \ntough job putting a bill on the floor. It always is tough when Congress \nhas to pull the trigger on what that revenue source is going to be.\n  I will support any plan that is reasonable and sustainable. The only \nplan I won't support is no revenue plan at all.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Kilmer), a member of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Colorado for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Congress, I worked at the Economic \nDevelopment Board for Tacoma, and in my office, I had a sign that said: \n``We are competing with everyone, everywhere, every day, forever.''\n  That sentiment was echoed in a report by the National Academies last \ndecade called, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which was the main \ninfluence behind the bipartisan America COMPETES Act. The report \nprovided us with a pathway on how to increase American competitiveness \nso that we don't fall behind our global competitors.\n  Its finding were stark. The report told us that, if we are going to \ncompete as a nation, if we want innovation to happen here in America, \nif we want jobs to be created here in America, we need to make \nsignificant investments in basic research and double the funding \ndedicated toward research and development. That is from that report.\n  That is not what we are doing here today. In fact, funding for basic \nresearch in the bill that we are currently debating fails to keep up \nwith the rate of inflation. It fails to live up to the standards set \nforth in that bipartisan report.\n  When this bill was first considered in the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee last Congress, a group of my fellow members of the \nNew Democratic Coalition developed a set of principles we thought \nshould guide a reauthorization of America COMPETES legislation.\n  These principles included increasing funding for basic research, \nstabilizing funding for research and development, and supporting \npolicies that spark innovation.\n  We were disappointed when the FIRST Act strayed away from these \npolicies and are disappointed this America COMPETES legislation fails \nto make investments needed for America to remain competitive in the \n21st century.\n  The amendment I introduced, along with my colleagues, does not call \nfor doubling the funding for research and development in the underlying \nbill or put funding on pace with what was outlined in ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm.'' The amendment we put forward was a compromise. \nUnfortunately, this amendment was made out of order and not brought to \nthe floor for consideration.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we fail to make critical investments in research and \ninnovation, America will fall behind. Let's take up a bill that lives \nup to the spirit of bipartisanship and the goals laid out in ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm.'' Let's compete everywhere, every day, \nforever.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Peters), who represents one of the strongest science \nclusters in the United States in San Diego.\n  Mr. PETERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, our country, as Mr. Kilmer pointed out, is facing an \never-increasing global competition for scientific research. We can't \nafford to cede the leading edge we have built up in innovation to other \ncountries, but the current level of funding in the underlying COMPETES \nbill does not provide adequate and constant funding for our basic \nscientific endeavors.\n  It cuts energy efficiency and renewable energy by 37 percent, cuts \nelectric grid reliability research by 30 percent, and cuts the Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency for Energy, or ARPA-E, by 50 percent.\n  These levels will not maintain strong foundations for basic \nscientific research and will make it even harder for us to retain young \nscientists in the United States. The Scripps Institution of \nOceanography, a world leader in ocean research, has noted the harmful \ncuts to the geoscientist program, which is used to improve prediction \nfor events, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, tsunamis, \ndrought, and solar storms. At a time of increasingly extreme weather, \nwe should be investing in research, not cutting it.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment offered by Mr. Kilmer, Ms. Esty, and me \nto increase funding by a small but significant 3.5 percent was not even \ngiven\n\n[[Page H3327]]\n\na chance to have a vote here on the House floor.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this rule and to stand up for America's \nscientists and our competitiveness.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom the great State of Colorado for yielding and for his leadership on \nthe Rules Committee and on so many other important issues before this \nCongress.\n  Mr. Speaker, the highway trust fund, which finances highway and \ntransportation projects all across this country, is set to expire at \nthe end of this month. It is coming right up. Passing a short-term fix \nis necessary because the Republicans have ignored our Nation's \ntransportation needs for the past 10 months, since the last short-term \nextension was passed.\n\n  We don't need a short-term extension. We need long-term planning and \ninvestment in our infrastructure. The sad reality is that the United \nStates is not investing nearly enough in its infrastructure. As a share \nof gross domestic product, we invest about one-half of what Europe \ndoes. We invest only one-quarter of what China does.\n  As you look at this chart, it shows the amount of road traffic volume \nis up 297 percent; yet the public spending on road maintenance is so \nmuch lower, 125 percent. It is nearly 2.5 times faster that we are \nspending--and having volume go up--but we are not investing in our \ninfrastructure to keep up with this volume.\n  One out of every four bridges is structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete in the United States. We have had two bridges \nwith cars on them that literally collapsed in recent history.\n  The question of whether to fix our infrastructure is not about the \nmoney. We are already spending the money, fixing our cars when they hit \nyet another pothole or wasting our time sitting in traffic. Why don't \nwe have high-speed rail like the rest of the world?\n  Let's save ourselves some time and money by investing wisely to \nsupport our transportation infrastructure through the highway trust \nfund.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, this rule under this debate covers three \nsignificant but entirely unrelated bills. That is why you are hearing \npeople discuss highway funding; you are hearing people discuss the \nlegislative branch, and you are hearing people discuss science.\n  On the day that DACA expansion and DAPA were scheduled to go into \neffect to make sure people here illegally can pay a fine, get right \nwith the law, and be employed legally, rather than illegally, we are \ndoing nothing relating to restoring the rule of law and securing our \nborders or anything to address our broken immigration system.\n  We are making sure that Members of Congress and our staffs get paid. \nThat is not the wrong thing. Our hard-working men and women who work \nhere should get paid. It is a question of priorities. I would like to \nsee us do something about the 10 or 12 million people here illegally \nbefore we start paying ourselves and our staff.\n  What about the highway trust fund? Again, this is an example of \nCongress kicking the ball down the road 2 months here, 2 months there, \na month here, a month there. All the contractors and subcontractors \ndon't even know how to present bids when they don't know whether a \nyearlong or 2-year project will be funded for more than 2 months. \nTaxpayers wind up paying more for the same amount of work because we \nlack the certainty.\n  Then there is the COMPETES Act--the science bill--which targets \ncertain kinds of science which apparently Republicans don't like--for \ninstance, the physical sciences and the geological sciences.\n  Handicapping the physical sciences hurts our ability to recognize the \ncauses of things like wildfires and floods that affect my district in \nColorado, foresee patterns leading to events like the great Western \ndrought in California. It seems like, if anything, there should be a \nfocus on a very relevant form of science that impacts quality of life \nevery day.\n  They also apparently don't like, for political reasons, the social \nsciences. Again, going after the social sciences would harm our ability \nto adapt for historic storms like Hurricane Sandy or the flood in New \nOrleans with Katrina and mitigate against floods like those in \nColorado.\n  There is an interface between the physical sciences and people, and \nthat is the work of the social science programs: how public health \nlooks, how flood evacuations look, how disease control looks.\n  These are important considerations and should not be politicized by \nthis body, which is why not only I oppose this bill, but dozens of the \nlargest scientific associations and coalitions oppose this bill that \nostensibly is for the cause of science.\n  Having all these bills under this rule is what we call a grab-bag \napproach, just jamming unrelated legislation into ineffective packages \nthat seem to confuse and muddle the meaningful debate that needs to \noccur.\n  Since 2011, when Republicans won the majority of the House, this \npractice of jamming several unrelated bills together into one rule has \nincreased by 400 percent. This rule is an example of that, and it is \nwhy the American people suffer from the somewhat disjointed debate \naround it--one person talks about highways; another counters a point \nabout science; another talks about the legislative branch. It is \nbecause they are all in here. This is a Christmas tree bill.\n  Now, if it had immigration reform in it, I would support this \nChristmas tree. I could swallow the others if that was in here. I \noffered that to the gentleman from Washington, but unfortunately, it is \nnot, Mr. Speaker.\n  In fact, the very people that should be benefiting from the bills we \nare reviewing today, like scientists, are actually opposing the bills. \nThat should be a signal that this body is not understanding or heeding \nthe needs of the American people.\n  We can reject this rule. We can tell Congress to get back on course. \nWe can tell Congress to do a long-term reauthorization of \ntransportation funding. We can tell Congress to pass a COMPETES Act \nthat actually fosters innovation and makes America more competitive and \na legislative branch appropriations bill that furthers the ability of \nthis body to deliberate and be a model employer for those who work \nhere.\n  How do we do that, Mr. Speaker? We do that by rejecting this rule.\n  If we can bring down this grab-bag, Christmas tree rule, we can set \nthis Congress right.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Americans have sent us here to get things done. They are tired of \ngridlock. And we, in the 114th Congress, are on track to be one of the \nmost productive Congresses in modern history.\n  House Republicans have an aggressive and forward-looking agenda which \nwill help our economy recover and help create high-paying American \njobs.\n  The use of the compound rule, which provides for separate \nconsideration of each underlying measure under a single rule, helps \nexpedite legislative business.\n  The consideration of one rule allows the House more time to debate \nthe underlying measures, or to consider additional legislative \nbusiness. We have a lot to do, and this is an efficient way to get our \nwork done.\n  I appreciate the discussion that we have had over the last hour. And \nalthough we may have our differences of opinion, I believe that this \nrule and the underlying bills are strong measures that are important to \nthe future of our country.\n  This rule provides for ample debate on the floor: the opportunity to \ndebate and vote on three bills and numerous amendments sponsored by \nboth Democrat and Republican Members of this Chamber. This rule will \nprovide for a smooth and deliberative process for sending these bills \nto the Senate for their consideration.\n  These bills are solid and substantial measures that will address \nseveral critical issues facing our country.\n\n[[Page H3328]]\n\n  H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015, is a \npro-science bill that will keep America competitive in the 21st century \nglobal economy by prioritizing taxpayer investments in basic research \nwithout increasing overall Federal spending.\n  H.R. 2250, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 2016, keeps \nfunding for the legislative branch level with fiscal years 2014 and \n2015 and will be used efficiently and effectively for the operations of \nthe legislative branch of the Federal Government.\n  H.R. 2353, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015, will \nallow transportation spending to continue through July while we in \nCongress work diligently toward a next step to close the shortfall in \nthe highway trust fund.\n  Currently, highway and transit spending authority expires at the end \nof this month, and officials at the Department of Transportation are \nconcerned that Federal cash infusions to transportation projects in my \nState and around the country would slow or even halt as the summer \nconstruction season begins unless we extend this temporary extension.\n  Overall, this is a strong rule that provides for consideration of \nthree important bills, and I urge my colleagues to support House \nResolution 271 and the underlying bills.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 1806, the \nAmerica COMPETES Act of 2015, a bill that was originally written to \nprovide much needed support for our nation's res arch and development \nactivities in science and engineering.\n  I thank Chairman Sessions and Ranking Member Slaughter for the \nopportunity to speak on the Rules for H.R. 1806.\n  The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 as written raises \nserious concerns among the representatives from the scientific, \nacademic, and business communities.\n  The groups that oppose the bill include the American Physical \nSociety, the American Geophysical Union, the American Anthropological \nAssociation the Association of American Universities, and the \nConsortium of Social Science Associations.\n  Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member on the House \nScience Committee, the committee that authored the bill, will be \noffering a Managers Amendment to this bill.\n  The Administration has also signaled that it will not support the \nbill in its current form.\n  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the bill: reduces \nfunding for several scientific disciplines; curtails the ability of \nfederal agencies to pursue climate science; and adds burdensome new \nrequirements to the way the National Science Foundation operates.\n  Perhaps most worrisome, the legislation would prevent the federal \ngovernment from using Department of Energy-sponsored research to make \npolicy.\n  My amendments offered for inclusion in the Rule to H.R. 1806 were \nsimple and would have improved the bill by addressing the STEM \neducation and training gap.\n  These Jackson Lee amendments focus on reducing the STEM gap that \ncurrently exists between people of different geographic regions and \nsocio-economic backgrounds.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics, reports that as many as 1.4 million \nnew computer science jobs could soon be available in the United States, \nbut only 400,000 students will be enrolled in programs at colleges and \nuniversities that would prepare them to take these jobs.\n  This disparity is often referred to as the STEM gap.\n  Only 1 out of 10 high schools in the U.S. offer computer science \nprograms.\n  It is estimated that the education systems in 25 states do not count \ncomputer science classes toward high school graduation.\n  Both economists and business leaders have identified that the future \nof the American economy will 130 in STEM fields, which the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics estimates win create more than 9 million jobs between \n2012 and 2022.\n  The STEM gap is more pronounced when considering minority groups.\n  U.S. Census 2010 data from the National Science Foundation and the \nU.S. Census Bureau, showed that underrepresented minorities earned 18.6 \npercent of total undergraduate degrees from 4-year colleges, but only \n16.4 percent of the degrees in science fields and less than 13 percent \nof degrees in physical sciences and engineering.\n   Many historically underrepresented groups, including low income \nurban, rural and Native American communities have difficulty accessing \nSTEM education and job training opportunities.\n  By including all of the Jackson Lee Amendments in the Rule the \ncommittee could have made significant progress in reducing the STEM gap \nunderserved populations with the chance to participate in the economy \nof the future.\n  Jackson Lee Amendments offered on H.R. 1806, included: Jackson Lee \nAmendment #3, which the Rules Committee has included in the Rule for \nthe bill would create state and regional workshops to train K-12 \nteachers in project-based science and technology learning, which will \nallow them to provide instruction in initiating robotics and other STEM \ncompetition team development programs.\n  This amendment also leverages the collaboration among higher \neducation, businesses, local private and public education agencies to \nsupport STEM efforts at schools located in areas with unemployment is 1 \npercent or more above the national rate.\n  Robotics competitions and other similar competitive opportunities \nhave proven to be one of the most successful paths for engaging young \nminds in STEM education.\n  Competitions such as FIRST, a national robotics competition that \nengages 400,000 students each year and awards millions of dollars in \nscholarships are paving the way for future STEM success.\n  Jackson Lee Amendments Not included in the Rule: Jackson Lee \nAmendment #17 would have increased awareness among underrepresented \ngroups in STEM employment and education opportunities by providing \ninformation on certification, undergraduate and graduate STEM programs.\n  One of the most enduring difficulties faced by underrepresented \npopulations is a lack of awareness and understanding of the connection \nbetween STEM and employment opportunities.\n  In 2012, a survey found that despite the nation's growing demand for \nmore workers in science, technology, engineering, and math, the skills \ngap among the largest ethnic and racial minorities groups remain \nstubbornly wide.\n  Blacks and Latinos account for only 7 percent, of the STEM workforce \ndespite representing 28 percent of the U.S. population.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #18 would have made sure that the issue of \nreducing the skills and education gap of underrepresented groups in \nSTEM degree programs is considered as current STEM education federal \nprograms were reviewed.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #19 could have furthered the skills development \nand training of teachers who provide instruction in K-12 STEM courses \nwhere 40 percent of the students are on free or reduced lunch programs \nor in areas where unemployment is 1 percent or more above the national \naverage.\n  Although most STEM specific education occurs in college and graduate \nschool, interest in STEM fields must be fostered from a young age \nthrough successful K-12 programs.\n  Many schools serving low-income students lack the resources to \nprovide continuity of STEM K-12 education, and as a result, students \nlose the opportunity to develop the skills that will prepare them for \nhigher STEM education.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #21 was an effort to identify no-cost or low-\ncost summer and after school science and technology education programs \nand have that information broadly disseminated to the public.\n  Throughout primary and secondary education, skills retention is one \nof the most pressing concerns facing underrepresented students.\n  Without access to after-school and summer programs, even those \nstudents with a passion for STEM risk falling behind their peers.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #22 made grants available to local education \nagencies to support training in STEM education methods to teachers to \nimprove their instruction at schools serving neglected, delinquent, and \nmigrant students, English learners, at-risk students, and Native \nAmericans as determined by the director.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #23 establishes within the Directorate for \nEducation and Human Resources an Office of STEM Education Gap Awareness \nwith the duties of reducing the STEM gap in K-12 and post-secondary \neducation among underrepresented populations.\n  The Jackson Lee amendments are intended to bridge the STEM gap in \nrural and urban areas where opportunities for training in STEM that can \nenhance the productivity of businesses large and small are lacking.\n  The Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program's report ``The Hidden STEM \nEconomy,'' reported that in 2011, 26 million jobs or 20 percent of all \noccupations required knowledge in 1 or more STEM areas.\n  Half of all STEM jobs are available to workers without a 4 year \ndegree and these jobs pay on average $53,000 a year, which is 10 \npercent higher than jobs with similar education requirements.\n  There will be STEM winners and losers not because the skills needed \nare too difficult to obtain, but because people are not aware of the \njobs that are going unfilled today nor do they know what education or \ntraining will create job security for the next 2 to 3 decades.\n  I am very aware of the importance of STEM job training and education.\n\n[[Page H3329]]\n\n  A third of Houston jobs are in STEM-based fields.\n  Houston has the second largest concentrations of engineers (22.4 for \nevery 1,000 workers according to the Greater Houston Partnership).\n  Houston has 59,070 engineers, the second largest population in the \nnation.\n  STEM jobs are at the core of Houston's economic success, but what we \nhave done with STEM innovation and job creation in the city of Houston \nis not enough to satisfy the region's demand for STEM trained workers.\n  Houston anticipates that in the next 5 years the gap in the number of \npeople with STEM skills and training will not keep up with the number \nof positions requiring those skills.\n  This is not just true for Houston, Texas--it is true for every region \nof the nation--whether you live in a rural community or urban center.\n  By 2018 the United States will need: 710,000 Computing workers; \n160,000 Engineers; 70,000 Physical Scientists; 40,000 Life Science \nworkers; 20,000 Mathematics workers.\n  STEM Computing Jobs are critical to America's future: Software \nengineers; Computer networking workers; Systems analysis; Computer \nresearcher or support workers.\n  Types of STEM Engineering Jobs: Structural Engineers; Mechanical \nEngineers; Software Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Automotive \nEngineers; Aeronautical Engineers; Naval Engineers; Architects.\n  Types of STEM Physical Sciences Jobs: Biologists; Zoologists; \nAgricultural; Food Scientists; Conservation Scientists; Medical \nScientists; Climatologists.\n  Types of STEM Life Scientists [PhDs]: Political Science; Economists; \nAnthropologists; Archaeology; Cultural Researchers; Language Experts \n(Linguistic and Language Skills).\n  Types of STEM Mathematics: Teachers; Physicists; Cryptographers; \nStatisticians; Accountants.\n  In order to ensure that underserved populations reach the level of \nSTEM education and opportunity they choose to pursue, I believe it is \nintegral to create an office that will focus on closing the STEM \neducation gap.\n  Mr.

The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nShuster) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control \n30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2353, the Highway and \nTransportation Funding Act of 2015. This bill will extend the Federal \nsurface transportation programs for 2 months, through July of 2015.\n  H.R. 2353 is a clean extension of the surface transportation \nprograms, funded at the authorized amounts for fiscal year 2014. No \ntransfer of funding to the highway trust fund is necessary because the \ntrust fund will remain solvent during the period. However, we will more \nthan likely have to pass another short-term patch before the August \nrecess and take steps to ensure the trust fund remains solvent. I hope \nall of you will support H.R. 2353.\n  I have to say, a short-term extension through the end of July was not \nour\n\n[[Page H3333]]\n\npreferred path forward. Our hope was to extend the surface programs \nthrough the end of the calendar year. That would have ensured reliable \nfunding for the States through the construction season. A longer \nextension would also have allowed us to focus on finding a long-term \nfunding solution within the context of tax reform without the \ndistraction of needing to address a shortfall in the highway trust fund \nlater this summer. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach an agreement \non a 7-month extension, and so we are left with a 2-month patch.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have an immediate, critical need to extend the \ncurrent surface transportation law. If Congress fails to act, over \n4,000 Department of Transportation personnel will be furloughed and the \nStates will not be able to be reimbursed. Transportation projects and \njobs across the country will be at risk.\n  I appreciate Chairman Ryan's attention to this pressing issue, as \nwell as his commitment to addressing the long-term solvency of the \nhighway trust fund. A long-term reauthorization bill will continue to \nbe a top priority for this committee. I look forward to working with \nChairman Ryan, Ranking Member DeFazio, and others to achieve a long-\nterm bill.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Well, here we are again, yet another short-term pass. It is a heck of \na way to run a great nation. Our system is falling apart: 140,000 \nbridges on the National Highway System need repair or replacement; 40 \npercent of the surface National Highway System is in such bad shape we \nhave to dig up the roadbed and resurface; and we have an $86 billion \nbacklog in transit just to bring the existing transit up to a state of \ngood repair. It is so bad that we are killing people in the Nation's \nCapital unnecessarily because of the state of disrepair of the Metro \nsystem.\n  It is embarrassing. The United States of America has gone from number \none in the world, unparalleled in terms of its infrastructure in the \nEisenhower era and through a good deal of the latter part of the last \ncentury, to 26th and falling fast. We are investing less of a \npercentage of our GDP in infrastructure repairs and maintenance--let \nalone, building out a new system--than virtually every nation in the \nworld.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  We are down to around 1 percent. There are many developing nations \nwho are investing much, much more because they know they have to move \ntheir people and their goods more efficiently in a world economy.\n  We cannot continue to kick this can down the road. The road is at a \ndead end. Today, we will reluctantly go along with a 2-month patch \nbecause, if we do not act today, at the end of this month, June 1, \n4,000 people will be laid off at DOT and all Federal funding for \nsurface transportation and transit would stop. That would be the end of \nit. It wouldn't be authorized.\n  States that had bills pending couldn't be paid, and States that want \nto get new commitments for new projects wouldn't be able to do it, a \ntragedy at the height of the construction season. Sixty days should be \nenough time to negotiate a long-term bill.\n  Today, we introduce the GROW AMERICA Act written by the \nadministration. It has many, many good points to it, especially the \nspending levels. We need to enhance spending. We can't pretend, Oh, we \nare going to do more with less. We are past that point.\n  Look at what has happened to the purchasing power of the gas tax, \nwhich hasn't been changed since 1993, two and a half times faster road \ntraffic volume is going up than we are dealing with the funding issues. \nWe are in a huge deficit situation, and there are many, many ways--many \nof them proposed on a bipartisan basis--to deal with this. We should be \nable to work that out.\n  More importantly, this committee writes the policy. We introduced a \nbill today that sets the levels for $87 billion. It is an increase in \ntransit to deal with the backlog, an increase in highways to deal with \nthe insufficiencies there, a new dedicated program for freight; and it \nputs some more money into rail--commuter rail, in particular--to deal \nwith positive train control and other issues.\n  We believe that this is the last wake-up call to give Congress time. \nSixty days is more than enough time to write a long-term authorization \nand for the Ways and Means Committee to figure out a way to fund it.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and \nTransit.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank, in \naddition to this patch, I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Chairman \nRyan for their very hard work towards a long-term reauthorization of \nthe Federal highway bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, my home State of Missouri has nearly 35,000 highway \nmiles and over 10,000 bridges that are practically begging for our \nattention. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Highways and \nTransit, every single day I hear about the need to improve and repair \nour roadways in this country.\n  As you can imagine, this isn't a simple task. This is a job that is \ngoing to take years to complete. It requires the hard work and \ncooperation of thousands of men and women and relies on partnerships \nbetween the stakeholders, local governments, and Washington.\n  Most importantly, though, a task of this magnitude requires that \nthose responsible for planning each project, the State and local \ngovernments, are able to do so with confidence. They need certainty not \nonly in this year's budget, but also the budgets for the next 5 or 6 \nyears.\n  This 2-month extension does not come under ideal circumstances, but \nit is going to ensure that States are reimbursed for their expenses on \nFederal projects, and it is going to give us the time to craft a \nbipartisan long-term reauthorization that we so desperately need.\n  Long-term reauthorization is critical for everyone who plays a role \nin improving our Nation's highways and bridges. For too long, they have \nbeen forced to operate off of short-term extension after short-term \nextension, and this makes the already difficult job of maintaining our \nroadways nearly impossible.\n  This Congress, we have a huge opportunity to secure a long-term \nhighway bill that is going to improve, rebuild, and modernize America's \nhighway system. It is time that we come together to do just that, and I \nhope this extension gives us the time to come up with that agreement \nthat we need.\n  Again, I want to thank both chairmen for their hard work, and I look \nforward to finalizing a much-needed long-term reauthorization.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the ranking member of the \nHighways and Transit Subcommittee.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.\n  By July, when this new patch expires, Mr. Speaker, we shall have \nspent a full year since the last patch, not even trying to make \nprogress toward a long-term authorization bill.\n  We have acquired a dangerous habit--33 since the last long-term \nbill--of patches that create no urgency to get a long-term bill done. \nThe Ways and Means Committee, the funding committee for this bill, is \nholding its first hearing next month. The frustration in the States has \naccumulated as fast as the untenable backlog of projects. Another \nconstruction season has already been sacrificed.\n  The reason we are here is itself a comment on congressional neglect \nof the Nation's infrastructure. States have slowed down their request \nfor reimbursements from the trust fund because the unreplenished fund, \ntogether with the short-term patches, make it impossible for States, \nthemselves, to even begin projects of any size.\n  Mr. Speaker, the States have already scaled back their plans for 2015 \nthat would have created jobs. This self-inflicted crisis is threatening \nother jobs, too--many Federal employees in my district and thousands of \nothers throughout the country. If Congress fails to take action by May \n31, many Federal employees will be furloughed; Federal reimbursements \nwill stop, and the highway and transit programs will\n\n[[Page H3334]]\n\nshut down. The hidden costs are even worse, the many economic \ndevelopment projects in the country that can't be started until roads, \nbridges, and transit to accommodate them are done.\n  Today, the Democrats on the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee have introduced the President's GROW AMERICA Act. We are \nputting a good bill on the table. Change it or do your own substitute, \nbut do not leave the Nation's infrastructure twisting in the dust of \nanother delay.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Crawford).\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman Shuster and \nRanking Member DeFazio for their hard work and to the rest of the \ncommittee for the hours of work already done on a long-term \ntransportation bill.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2353 to prevent the shutdown of \nfunding for infrastructure improvement. I believe there is shared \ncommitment between the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and \nmost of the Members of the House to pass a fully funded, multiyear \nhighway bill.\n  With the debt crisis we continue to battle, it is becoming more and \nmore difficult to find the much-needed resources for our most critical \nneeds. That leaves few options at our immediate disposal, most of which \nare not palatable in this economic environment.\n  Members of both the Transportation Committee and the Ways and Means \nCommittee will have to take a closer look at potential funding \nalternatives and be creative in how to finance a reliable and modern \ninfrastructure system, and at the same time, we need to work towards \ngetting our country back on a path of fiscal solvency.\n  As we work on a long-term solution, we should examine how to reform \nthe highway trust fund to prevent finding ourselves in this same \nposition over and over. A consistent funding mechanism, paired with a \nmore transparent system that demonstrates effective use of taxpayer \ndollars, will put us in a better position to fund critical \ninfrastructure projects and instill more confidence on the part of our \nconstituents.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 2353 so we can \ncontinue work on a multiyear transportation bill to ensure our Nation's \ngrowth. Failure to act threatens our general contractors and their \nemployees, suppliers, and puts at risk the jobs that are both directly \nand indirectly supported by these projects.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we want to keep our folks in business and continue \nany meaningful growth in our economy, then we must find a reliable, \nlong-term solution.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Nadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to extend highway and \ntransit programs for 2 months, but with reservations.\n  The last surface transportation bill, MAP-21, expired last fall. At \nthat time, we passed an extension to the end of this month to give us \ntime to work on a long-term bill. We have known for months that this \nday was coming; yet we have made no progress finding a solution to \nfunding highways, transit, and other important surface transportation \nprograms.\n  MAP-21, itself, was only a 2-year bill, breaking the tradition of \nCongress passing 5- or 6-year bills to provide the reliable funding \nnecessary to promote long-term capital plans and projects that require \na commitment beyond 1 fiscal year. The last long-term bill we passed \nwas SAFETEA-LU in 2005. That was 10 years ago, and that bill was \nunderfunded because of a resistance to raising the gasoline tax or to \nidentifying new revenue sources.\n  For over a decade, we have failed to address the funding challenges \nnecessary to break the cycle of underinvestment and put this country \nback on a competitive path with the rest of the work.\n  Today, we spend about 1.7 percent of GDP on infrastructure, while \nChina spends 9 percent and Europe spends 4\\1/2\\ to 5 percent. We used \nto spend 4\\1/2\\ to 5 percent also.\n  According to DOT, there is an $800 billion backlog of investment \nneeds on highways and bridges, including $479 billion in critical \nrepair work. Public transit has an $86 billion backlog of critical \nmaintenance and repair needs, which increases by $2.5 billion each year \nas bus and rail infrastructure ages.\n  While our infrastructure crumbles around us, House and Senate \nleadership refuse to come up with the additional $60 billion needed to \nfill the gap in the highway trust fund just to do a long-term bill at \ncurrent levels; but this week, they will put on the floor a tax \nextender that will cost $182 billion over 10 years, completely unpaid \nfor. The priorities of this Congress are completely out of whack.\n  I am concerned that we will pass this 2-month extension and be right \nback here in July having this same conversation. I will support this \nextension, but only with the understanding that we must spend the next \n2 months, once and for all, making transportation funding a priority so \nthat our citizens don't have to risk unsafe transportation so that we \ncan invest in our infrastructure and we can be competitive in our \neconomy going forward.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2353, the Highway and Transportation \nFunding Act of 2015.\n  Although we must construct a long-term highway bill, this legislation \nis a compromise that will provide States with certainty through the \nvital summer construction months.\n  By extending the expenditure authority of the highway trust fund \nthrough the end of July, States will not have to worry about \nreimbursements from the Federal Government while they are in the middle \nof the busiest construction season of the year.\n  Following the passage of this extension, I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee \nto construct a long-term highway bill with a sustainable funding \nmechanism.\n  Upon its enactment in 2012, MAP-21 made important reforms by \nconsolidating Federal highway programs and streamlining the project \napproval process. The next highway bill should build on MAP-21's \nsuccesses to cut red tape and ensure highway trust fund dollars are \nspent responsibly.\n  We must also be good stewards of taxpayer dollars by keeping our \npromise to the American people that the next surface transportation \nbill will provide adequate funding for highway and freight \ninfrastructure to create jobs and keep our Nation competitive.\n  My constituents and the hard-working people all over this country \nneed reliable roads and bridges to commute to work, take their children \nto school, and get home safely at night.\n  Unfortunately, the President's funding proposal is not viable and, I \nbelieve, will encourage more inversions or takeovers of American \ncompanies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2353 and encourage them to \ncommit to crafting a long-term fiscally responsible highway bill that \nwill provide the much-needed certainty to States, industry, and the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, \nand I appreciate his leadership on this matter. He hit it right on the \nnail.\n  We are in a situation, I am sad to say, having listened to my \ncolleague a moment ago; the States will still have to worry. Two months \ndoesn't give them a straight shot at a construction season, and there \nis still uncertainty.\n  I could have dusted off the speech I gave last summer where I said we \nwould be right back here in the same spot, with uncertainty around the \ncountry; and the local governments, the State governments, the \ncontractors don't deserve that.\n  But it is not the problem of the T and I Committee, as much as Ways \nand Means. You can't craft a bill unless you know how much money you \nhave got to spend. I am embarrassed as a member of that committee that, \nin the 55 months my Republican colleagues have been in charge, we have \nnot had a single hearing on transportation finance.\n  We hear certain things are off the table or not acceptable. It is \ninteresting, we haven't raised the gas tax in\n\n[[Page H3335]]\n\n22 years, but six States--six red States--have raised the gas tax \nalready this year. Utah, Idaho, Georgia, South Dakota--these are not \nflaming bastions of liberalism. These are people who looked at the \nproblem and decided they needed to step up, and they stepped up not to \ntake the place of the Federal responsibility, but in anticipation that \nat some point, the Federal Government would meet its obligation for \nalmost half of the major construction projects.\n  I would respectfully request that we dive in and see what we can do \nover the course of the next couple of months, but that the Ways and \nMeans Committee spend one week listening to the men and women who \nbuild, operate, and use our Nation's infrastructure, spend a week, look \nat the items, consider maybe what Ronald Reagan thought was a good idea \nin 1982: raise the gas tax.\n  We can pass that bill out of committee in 1 week, and you can have \nthe next couple of months to give America the bill it needs to rebuild \nand renew this great country.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes from the gentleman \nfrom Nevada (Mr. Hardy).\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of long-term highway \nfunding. I will support the bill on the floor today, but let's be \nclear. This is a long-term problem that needs to have a long-term \nsolution.\n  We gather in hearings and we gather in meetings to discuss the \nvarious options we have for revenue. We now have to gather to make a \ndecision, the long-term decision.\n  We were elected to Congress to represent our constituents and to make \ndifficult decisions that will help us guide our Nation forward. It is \ntime for us to accelerate and produce a solution to our highway funding \nproblems. Our highways and our bridges are falling into disrepair.\n  Before I became involved in public service, I was a contractor in \nNevada where I worked on roads, bridges, and dams. I know the wear and \ntear that our infrastructure is experiencing. I know the uncertainty \nthat States are facing when it comes to highway projects.\n  Our inaction has created a difficult environment for the States to \nmake decisions. So I stand here today to support long-term funding. It \nis a long-term problem that requires a long-term solution.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Johnson).\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the \nleadership of this committee for getting to this point. I am very, very \nsorry that this is another kicking the can down the road, but we don't \nhave much choice but to support the bill before us today.\n  We have missed a major construction season already. Bridges are \nfalling; accidents are happening; traffic jams increase because of the \ncrumbling infrastructure. This is all very costly, and it is more \ncostly when we have a winter like we just had that hits already \ncrumbling infrastructure.\n  We must address this costly neglect of our infrastructure around the \ncountry. It is not partisan. There are no Democrat and Republican \nbridges or streets. We must address our responsibility to this Nation.\n  Sensible, large projects must have time to plan for those long-term \nprojects. They cannot do that. No city or State can do that kind of \nplanning without knowing whether we have a long-term source of funding \nthat will keep it going.\n  It is unwise for us to continue just to put this off. We have got to \npay for it no matter when we do it. The time is now. We have extended \nthis time too long. The Nation has suffered too long. Traffic is \njamming; accidents are happening; and it will not get better until we \ntake on our responsibility.\n  I would urge all of us today to support this short-term bill for the \nlast time. It is time for us to have a long-term infrastructure bill \nfor this Nation.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the Chair the \nbalance of time remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 19 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 22 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. It is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, the funding and authorization for our Federal \nhighway program expires in just 12 days. This is a deadline that \nCongress, the Department of Transportation, and the American people \nhave known about for almost a year now. And the bill before us today is \nnot the long-term solution that we were hoping for, but it is the \nnecessary step forward at this time while we continue to work on a \nlonger term solution for our highway funding.\n  I appreciate very much the attention that Chairman Shuster has given \nto this important issue. He has taken a very keen interest in what we \nneed on a national level, and many of us from the Houston area \nappreciate his coming to our part of America to learn and see what our \nneeds are in the State of Texas. I am confident that the chairman and \nthose of us on the relevant committees in the House and the Senate will \ncome together and deliver a long-term solution for our highway programs \nand will strengthen them for every Texan and every American.\n  While this bill before us isn't ideal, the choice is very simple. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on this bill to keep \nour State Department of Transportation on the job through the summer \nbuilding months and to keep Congress working on a long-term solution.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Brown).\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, here we go again, passing another \nextension and failing in our duty to provide a world-class \ntransportation system.\n  Transportation programs are much too critical to our economy to be \ndelayed any longer. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in \nWashington continues its long-running failure to fund surface \ntransportation infrastructure programs. Just last week, House \nRepublicans passed a bill, with no offsets, that cut taxes by $269 \nbillion for the richest 1 percent of Americans, but they failed to pass \na real transportation authorization bill that would put Americans to \nwork. We know, for every billion dollars we invest in transportation, \nit generates 44,000 permanent jobs.\n  In closing, Secretary Anthony Foxx said that all of us have roles to \nplay in shaping our Nation's infrastructure. As we saw last week during \nthe tragic train derailment in Philadelphia, Congress urgently needs to \nincrease funding for our Nation's passenger rail system in order to \nmake it safer for all of the traveling public and to prevent future \ntragedies on our Nation's rails.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. DeFazio for yielding and for \nthe work that he does on this committee.\n  Let me also say to the chairman of the committee, Mr. Shuster, how \npleased I am with the kind of work that he does on the committee. Very \nfrankly, Mr. Shuster is committed to getting things done and to working \nin a bipartisan fashion. That is good for this House, and it is good \nfor his State, and it is good for the country. I thank him for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 60-day extension because it is \nessential that we do this. The consequences of not doing it would be \nvery, very negative. I rise to lament the fact that we have gone 10 \nmonths in our having known full well that this date was upon us and \nthat theoretically, we thought, that funding as well as authorization \nwould end on the 31st of this month. We have now found that funding \nwill not end. This bill is necessary to authorize, not to fund, because \nfunding is available for the next 60 days from the 31st.\n  I also rise to urge this House, under Mr. Shuster's and Mr. DeFazio's \nleadership, to do the work we were sent here to do--to invest in \nAmerica, to invest in the growth of our economy, to invest in the \ncreation of jobs--in fact, what the board of directors of the greatest \ncountry on the face of the Earth ought to have done many years and, \ncertainly, months ago.\n  I am absolutely convinced that this House has the capacity, the \nintellect, and the ability within 60 days to come\n\n[[Page H3336]]\n\nto this floor with a bill that will invest in our infrastructure and \nprovide sufficient funds to make America competitive and to pay for it, \nnot to pass the expense along to future generations--my children, my \ngrandchildren, my great grandchildren. They are going to have to buy \nfor themselves the infrastructure of their generations, and they ought \nnot to have to pay the bills of our generation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. It is a moral responsibility that this generation pays for \nthe investments that it needs to make in the infrastructure that will \nbe used today and tomorrow.\n  Mr. Shuster, I know, wants to do that. Mr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio \nhave the courage to do that. The issue is going to be whether this \nbody, on both sides of the aisle, comes forward with a responsible, \npaid-for infrastructure bill, particularly for highways and roads and \nbridges, but for other investments as well.\n  I want to tell Mr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio that I will work closely \nwith them and that I will urge the Members on my side of the aisle to \nwork closely with the Members on Mr. Shuster's side of the aisle to \neffect this end. But let us not pretend on July 30 that we can extend \nuntil December 31 or until a year from then. Today, let us commit \nourselves to using the next 70 days, approximately, to come up with a \npaid-for, 6-year reauthorization that will make America stronger, grow \nour economy, and be a pride of the American people, whom we serve.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished whip for his kind \nwords, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, again, may I inquire as to the amount of \ntime remaining on my side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Nolan), a member of the committee.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, this failure to \nwrite a long-term, paid-for surface transportation bill for this \ncountry has become a national embarrassment. Quite frankly, it is an \ninternational embarrassment. Passenger trains and oil trains are coming \noff the tracks, are taking lives, are causing untold amounts of damage. \nThe simple truth is that we can't fix those lives who were lost, but we \ncan fix our transportation system. Isn't it about time that we do that? \nIt is not only a national embarrassment, our failure here, but it is a \nfailure of the Congress. It is a failure of the legislative process. It \nis a failure of the committee process. That is what is happening here.\n  We held hearings in the last session. We heard from the Chamber of \nCommerce; we heard from the unions; we heard from the retailers; we \nheard from the truckers. Everybody said three things: one, our \ntransportation system is falling apart. They had that right. Two, it is \nhurting our ability to grow our economy and to create jobs. They had \nthat right. Three, they said we need to find some new revenue. None of \nit could be more obvious. Yet the Transportation Committee held \nhearings from all of those people in the last session, and we held \nhearings again in this session, but we never took up the markup and the \nwriting of a transportation bill.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  That is the simple truth, Mr. Speaker, and I am calling on the \nleadership here to either instruct the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure or allow the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure to write a transportation bill. I have absolute \nconfidence that we can come together if we do.\n  It is through the committee process that we find common ground. That \nis where we reach our bipartisanship. That is how we fix things here in \nthe Congress. That is how we get things done. Mr. Chairman, Mr. \nSpeaker, allow or instruct the committee to do its job, to do its \nbusiness, and we will write a transportation plan for this country that \ngets this country moving again, saves lives, and builds an economy.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. \nTitus), a member of the committee.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, why are we debating an extension of the \nsurface transportation authorization instead of doing the right thing \nand passing a bill that invests in our future? We should be playing the \nlong game, not betting on the come, as they say in Nevada.\n  For the 2 million residents who live in the Las Vegas valley and the \nmore than 42 million visitors who come to our city from around the \nworld, we must commit to the passage of a long-term surface \ntransportation bill this summer. We can't do yet another extension that \ncreates uncertainty, stifles development, and puts us further behind.\n  We must pass a bill that includes investment that is real, \nsustainable, and goes beyond just maintaining our current \ninfrastructure but instead sets our Nation on a road that is built to \nlast.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nFrankel), a member of the committee.\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I just want to start by thanking \nMr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio for their bipartisan leadership. I am going \nto vote for this 2-month extension for the highway trust fund in order \nto avoid a shutdown of America's transit building and repair.\n  But with that said, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is like fixing our \nroads and bridges with Silly Putty. It is just not strong enough to \nhold our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. So I join my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to say it is time to make those long-term \ninvestments necessary for people and goods to get to their destination \nsafely and timely.\n  Mr. Speaker, transportation moves our economy. It is time for \nCongress to get going.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPascrell), a strong advocate for all things transportation, a member of \nthe powerful Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the \nchairman. I am not going to vote for this piece of legislation--not \neven close.\n  Everyone talks about how we must maintain the roads. If you listened \nover the last 45 minutes, all of these infrastructure issues are in bad \nshape, terrible shape. We know the problem. So long speeches about this \nand the problem don't make much sense.\n  Here is my question to every Member of this body: What are you \nprepared to do? Make believe you are doing something? Hide under the \ndesk in your office?\n  How much money have we used, Mr. Speaker, from the general fund to \nbail out transportation? The percentage of general funds increases each \nbudget that we are using. So without a clear source of long-term \nfunding, our States cannot plan for the future. In fact, many States \nare not putting money into their trust fund. My own State, the State of \nNew Jersey, I guess the money is going to fall out of the sky. So 2 \nmonths, 4 months, 7 months, it is all a joke.\n  Ensuring the solvency of the trust fund is not only a key component \nof meeting our transportation challenges, it is our job. The Committee \non Ways and Means has not even had one hearing, Mr. Ranking Member, Mr. \nChairman. How many States have put themselves in the same position as \nthe Federal Government?\n  I understand that some Members are already planning another short-\nterm extension in July because you say now we are ready to have a long-\nterm solution, but you are already planning for another short-term in \nJuly. In fact, we are moving towards the omnibus bill, where we will \nput everything together. It will be like a stew: trade, transportation, \nlollipops, put them all in there. Put it all in there, and then we will \nvote on it and have some of our Members vote against motherhood so that \nthey will be on the block a year from this November.\n  Look, let me suggest something novel for this group. Let's spend the \nnext 8 weeks resuscitating a system\n\n[[Page H3337]]\n\nwhere users of the system pay to maintain and grow the system. \nInternational tax can be a part of the solution. I say to the President \nand the Congress, it is not nearly enough money.\n  A group of us presented a bipartisan plan--Republicans and \nDemocrats--to fund the Federal highway trust fund. Through Democratic \nPresidents, Republican Presidents, through Democratic Houses and \nRepublican Houses, we have always been able to come to a resolution on \nthis until the last 3 or 4 years. Why? Why is this?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, neither party has the wherewithal to deal \nwith the problem. I believe our model must receive serious \nconsideration as the clock counts down on the trust fund's expiration. \nOur legislation has the support of both business and labor.\n  I am done with extensions, and I plan to vote ``no'' today. I ask my \ncolleagues to show support for a long-term bill and cosponsor the \nRenacci-Pascrell plan, because if we don't change something, we will be \nright back here in July talking to each other.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 20\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First off, I want to join in what many others have said: \ntransportation infrastructure has not been historically nor should it \nbecome a partisan issue. I appreciate the chairman's willingness to \nwork together on many aspects. We will at times disagree over elements \nof bills, but in general we agree that what makes this country great, \nwhat makes us competitive in the world is a world-class system of \ntransportation infrastructure and other critical infrastructure, and \ntoday we are deficient. I talked during my introductory remarks about \nsome of the needs. Let me just talk about the revenues.\n  Back in 1993, when the gas tax was raised by a bipartisan coalition \nin the House--actually, on the Republican side, led by the chairman's \nfather, Bud Shuster--we paid about 14 percent. Every time you went to \nthe pump, with the increase in the gas tax in 1993, 14 percent of your \nbill went to invest in the Nation's infrastructure. Yet today, some 22 \nyears later, 7 percent goes to the infrastructure. Population has \ngrown, road miles have increased, and the Eisenhower infrastructure has \naged.\n\n  Infrastructure doesn't just age a little bit each year. It reaches a \npoint where it accelerates dramatically, so a bridge that you could fix \nfor $15 million or $20 million today, 2 years from now you might have \nto totally replace for $100 million. So not delaying these needed \ninvestments, unless we want to see people detouring around all the \nrivers in America because of bridge outages, is really, really critical \nfor a just-in-time economy, for our world competitiveness, to save on \nfuel efficiency.\n  Now, a number of States have stepped in to fill the void; 14 States \nhave voted to raise their own gas taxes since 2013. As the gentleman \nfrom Oregon pointed out, six deep red Republican States have voted to \nraise their gas tax this year.\n  Just to assure my colleagues, for those who raised it before the last \nelection, nobody lost their election because they raised the gas tax in \nthose States. People recognize it as a user fee. They are tired of \nblowing out tires and car repairs because of potholes. They are tired \nof detours. The trucking industry is tired of detours, and they don't \nwant a proliferation of tolls across America. The solution is a Federal \npartnership.\n  The chairman held a hearing recently where we had the Department of \nTransportation director from Wyoming, a deep red State, talking about \nthe fact that they had increased their gas tax, but they still need the \nFederal partnership; it is critical. We had the Governor of North \nCarolina--has one of the highest gas taxes in the country, deep red \nState these days--saying the Federal partnership was more critical than \never. The same with the mayor of Salt Lake City, the Federal \npartnership is critical. No State can do it on its own.\n  I propose that we index the gas tax to construction costs, inflation, \nfleet fuel economy. That would mean next year the gas tax would go up \nby 1.7 cents. I would like to see the Member of Congress who thinks \nthey are going to lose their election over a 1.7 cent investment in \nAmerica's infrastructure to avoid those potholes, the congestion, the \ndetours, the delays, or the additional tolling to maintain what we \nhave. It won't happen. It hasn't happened recently in red States that \nhave raised it much more than 1.7 cents.\n  But if we index to inflation, fleet fuel economy, and construction \ncosts inflation, we could borrow upfront for the trust fund, let's say, \n$150 billion, a nice increase over the current levels of spending, and \nwe could pay it back in about 15 years with that increment, just the \nindexed increment that would grow a tiny bit each year.\n  And again, you drive by the gas station on your way to work, and when \nyou drive home at night, ExxonMobil has raised it a nickel because \nthere were rumors of war in the Middle East or a refinery had an outage \nor something or this. Where did that nickel go? It went into the \npockets of ExxonMobil or speculators on Wall Street. It didn't go into \nour Nation's infrastructure.\n  The American people would sure as heck rather pay 1.7 cents to \nrebuild our system and make America more competitive and put hundreds \nof thousands of people to work than another nickel in the coffers of \nOPEC or ExxonMobil or Wall Street speculators.\n  It is time to suck it up around here, act like men and women who were \nsent here to make tough decisions, to regain our legacy, to begin to \nbring America back toward a world-class infrastructure. It would take \nmany years and many tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to reclaim \nthe legacy of the Eisenhower era, but it is only a lack of will--will--\nthat prevents us from doing that. There is no major impediment. Nobody \nis going to lose their election over 1.7 cents a gallon. In fact, \npeople will thank you at home.\n  The trucking industry is begging--begging--for an increase in the \ndiesel tax. The United States Chamber of Commerce, when is the last \ntime they asked for an increase in a tax? Look, all across the \nspectrum, the retailers, the business community, all across this \ncountry people are saying: Help us; get us out of congestion; fix the \nsystem; bring it up to a state of good repair. There is another whole \ncontingent of American people who are saying: We need jobs.\n  There is no more certain way to create jobs in this country than \ninvesting in America's infrastructure. And they are not just \nconstruction jobs. They are engineering jobs. They are manufacturing \njobs. In the case of mass transit, they are high-tech jobs. They are \nsmall business jobs. They are disadvantaged business enterprise jobs. \nIt goes through the entire economy. No American will be left behind.\n  We could create hundreds of thousands of jobs and make America number \none again. All we lack is the will here in this House. Let's say this \nis the last 60-day delay. Let's work together, and let's get a real 6-\nyear bill by the end of July.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to announce we introduced the GROW AMERICA \nAct comprehensive bill with which we could begin policy discussions, \nH.R. 2410, today, with 19 cosponsors.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate the passion of the ranking member, \nmy friend, Mr. DeFazio, on these issues. I have to say that much of \nwhat has been said on this floor by both sides, I agree with. The need \nto invest in our infrastructure is real. It is critical. Our \ninfrastructure is crumbling all around us.\n  I also agree that we need to find a long-term solution to the trust \nfund to make sure it is fiscally responsible, and most importantly, I \nagree that we need to act. This 2-month extension was not my \npreference. What my preference is, is to buckle down, work hard, find \nthe dollars, and have a long-term surface transportation bill that is \nsustainable.\n  Again, I stand here today urging all my colleagues to vote for this \nessential\n\n[[Page H3338]]\n\n2-month extension to get us through to July. I am committed to continue \nto work to find the solution so we can have a long-term bill, but a \nvote against this bill is a vote in favor of shutting down these vital \nprograms, stopping the work of thousands of highway projects around the \ncountry and laying off thousands of construction workers and Federal \nemployees.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, the highway trust fund has enough \nmoney to pay for projects through the end of July, but its legal \nauthority to spend that money expires at the end of this month. I would \nhave preferred to pass an extension that lasted through the end of the \nyear, but we just couldn't come to a bipartisan agreement on how to pay \nfor it. That's unfortunate because the more time we spend on these \nshort-term patches, the less time we'll have to find a long-term \nsolution.\n  And ultimately, the only real solution is a long-term solution. At \nthe very least, this legislation will allow the trust find to continue \nto fund projects through July, while we continue to work on an \nextension for the rest of the year. But if we really want to solve this \nproblem, both parties need to confront the serious challenges facing \nthe trust fund. That's the only way we'll come up with a plan to give \nstates the certainty they need to build the roads and bridges our \nfamilies need to thrive.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nbill, H.R. 2353, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 but \nwith reservations.\n  I support Chairman Shuster's efforts to ensure the Highway Bill does \nnot expire and cost the economy jobs and cause important projects to \nstop progress.\n  I am, however, disappointed we once again face this issue.\n  We need to pass a long-term highway bill so that our communities and \nbusinesses have the certainty they need to invest in our future.\n  I understand the fiscal challenges we face but I believe that we must \ndo more to improve our nation's transportation system.\n  Transportation funding, particularly for highways and transit, is \nparticularly important for my constituents and the entirety of the \nGreater Houston area.\n  We have a congestion problem in Houston.\n  We have done a lot to reduce this congestion, but more must be done.\n  We also have the largest port for foreign tonnage and largest \npetrochemical complex in our country along the banks of the Port of \nHouston.\n  In the years ahead, we will face a much higher traffic volume due to \npopulation growth and the expansion of the Panama Canal, which will \nbring more truck traffic and economic development to the area.\n  In order for Houston and our Port to continue to be a hub for \ncommerce, we must strengthen our rail and road infrastructure.\n  Both a successful port and a growing local economy rely on well \nmaintained roads and bridges.\n  Communities around our country must improve its transportation \ninfrastructure in order to encourage businesses and economic \ndevelopment.\n  While I understand the strain the Highway Trust Fund is experiencing, \nit is important that we fund important highway projects throughout the \ncountry.\n  We are at a critical time for our nation in terms of transportation \nfunding.\n  We must fix bridges, expand highways, and increase the capacity of \nour infrastructure.\n  Highway and transit projects are important to our constituents, so \nthey can get to work and school and they are important to our \nbusinesses so they can move commerce.\n  Everyone wins when we increase our investments in our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2353 but I also urge my \ncolleagues to fix the problem and craft a long-term highway bill for \nthe benefit of all our citizens.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nopposition to H.R. 2353. This bill will mark the thirty-third time \nwe've passed a short-term extension to the Highway bill in eight years. \nEnough is enough. Our roads and bridges are crumbling. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to pass a robust long-term surface transportation bill \nand make real investments in our transportation infrastructure. These \nshort-tern extensions not only diminish our economic competitiveness as \na nation but they erode the safety of all of the folks we were sent \nhere to represent. I will not support any more short-term gimmicks and \nimplore my colleagues to join me in rejecting this proposal and instead \npass a long-term bill and once again invest in our national \ninfrastructure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. ESTY. I am, in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Esty moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2353 to the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with \n     instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, \n     with the following amendment:\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n       Subtitle E--Passenger Rail Positive Train Control Funding\n\n     SEC. 1401. PASSENGER RAIL POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL FUNDING.\n\n       Section 20158(c) of title 49, United States Code is amended \n     by inserting ``, and $750,000,000 for the period beginning \n     October 1, 2014, and ending on July 31, 2015,'' after \n     ``2013''.\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the \nmotion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Connecticut is recognized \nfor 5 minutes in support of her motion.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which \nwill not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \nbill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  My amendment provides $750 million to passenger railroads to help \nthem implement positive train control. Tragically, last week, Amtrak \n188 derailed, killing 8 people and injuring more than 200. My thoughts \nand prayers are with the victims and their loved ones.\n  Unfortunately, last week's tragic accident is just the latest in a \nseries of incidents that are unacceptable and largely preventable.\n  According to National Transportation Safety Board member Robert \nSumwalt, the lead investigator of last week's Amtrak derailment in \nPhiladelphia: ``Had PTC''--positive train control--``been installed on \nthe section of track, this accident would not have occurred.''\n  Now, what is positive train control? Positive train control, commonly \nreferred to as PTC, is a communications and signaling system that uses \nGPS technology and sensors to communicate train location, speed, \nrestrictions, and moving authority.\n  Most importantly, PTC can save lives. For instance, positive train \ncontrol technology can detect if a train is going too fast for an area \nand use onboard equipment to automatically slow or stop the train.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, last week's derailment is not the first time NTSB \nhas recommended implementing positive train control. This \nrecommendation has been made since 1969, following an investigation of \na head-on collision of two Penn Central commuter trains near Darien, \nConnecticut, in my home State. That collision killed 4 people and left \n43 injured.\n  Forty-six years after that deadly collision in Connecticut, the NTSB \nis still demanding and waiting for action. During this time, the NTSB \nhas investigated 144 accidents that would have been preventable if \nrailroads had installed PTC. Not surprisingly, positive train control \nhas been on the NTSB's most wanted list of safety improvements since \n1990.\n  144 accidents over 43 years--try and think about that, and try to \ncomprehend 6,532 preventable injuries and 288 preventable deaths.\n  This just isn't an issue only on the Northeast corridor. In 2008, a \ntragic accident in California killed 25 people and injured 102. After \nthat accident, this House enacted legislation requiring PTC on commuter \nand intercity passenger rails by December 31 of this year; but \nprotecting lives requires leadership from this Congress.\n  The American Public Transportation Association asked Congress to \nprovide Federal funding for 80 percent of the installation costs on \npassenger rails. We in Congress can help. We can and must make this \ninvestment before another terrible accident, before another life is \ntragically and needlessly lost. We can't afford to wait.\n\n[[Page H3339]]\n\n  Less than 2 years ago, a Metro-North Railroad engineer fell asleep as \nthe train he was operating sped up to 82 miles an hour through a tight \ncurve. The restriction for that section was only 30 miles an hour. As a \nresult of the derailment, 4 people died, and 61 were injured. With \ntragic predictability, the NTSB investigation determined that positive \ntrain control could have prevented that tragedy as well.\n  How many more times does the NTSB need to repeat its recommendation \nbefore PTC is implemented?\n  There is no reason why this Congress should continue to ignore its \nresponsibility to help passenger railroads implement the lifesaving \ntechnology as soon as possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to \nprovide the necessary funding to help passenger railroads implement PTC \nacross the United States.\n  Let me be clear: this funding won't prevent every single accident. \nThe fact that PTC will not prevent every accident should not--cannot--\nbe an excuse for this Congress' failure to act.\n  Failure to act today on implementing positive train control is wrong. \nIt is unworthy of a great country. A great country does not respond to \ncrises with duct tape; a great country leads with action.\n  I ask all House Members to join me to vote for this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I wish to withdraw my reservation of a \npoint of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this motion. We certainly know of \nthe tragedy that happened in Philadelphia, in my home State, but this \nreally is not the place to address this.\n  We need to pass a clean extension. We have got to pass it and get it \nto the Senate, so we make sure that these vital programs keep people \nworking, we keep projects moving forward, and that they don't shut \ndown.\n  Again, this is a clean extension. We want it to be a clean extension \nbecause we know that time is of the essence to get this over to the \nSenate, as I said, and pass it. You are talking about 4,000 people in \nthe government that will be furloughed and thousands of workers across \nAmerica. Projects will stop, and they won't be working.\n  Again, we have an immediate need to extend the highway transit and \nsafety programs. I am confident and remain committed to working with \nChairman Ryan; but this is not the time to slow this down. This the \ntime to get it done so that we can get it to the Senate as quickly as \npossible.\n  Again, I am opposed to this motion. I urge a ``no'' vote on the \nmotion and continue to ask my colleagues to support the underlying bill \nthat gets the job done and gets us past this critical time.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3339-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message in writing from the President of the United States was \ncommunicated to the House by Mr. Brian Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3339-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE \nSTABILIZATION OF IRAQ--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES \n                          (H.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization \nof Iraq that was declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, is \nto continue in effect beyond May 22, 2015.\n  Obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and \nmaintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development \nof political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq \ncontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on consideration of H.R. 2250, and \nthat I may include tabular material on the same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 271 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2250.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1516\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2250) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, with Mr. \nCarter of Georgia in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves) and the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  When I joined the Appropriations Committee a little over 4 years ago, \nI said that I wanted this committee to be known as a place where \ntaxpayer money was saved and not spent. In recent years, there has been \na major change in the perception of this committee.\n  Thanks in large part to the leadership of Chairman Rogers and the \nmembers of the committee, the process is open, and it is transparent, \nand this committee has made a priority of ensuring every taxpayer \ndollar is spent wisely.\n  In keeping with that trend, the bill that we are here to debate today \nholds the line on spending. It is a bill that honors and respects the \ntaxpayer while preserving the beauty of the Capitol campus, providing \nessential security for visitors and staff, and ensuring that we are \nable to provide the services that our constituents expect and deserve.\n  This bill is a total of $3.3 billion for the legislative branch, \nexcluding all Senate items. The bill continues the freeze on funding \nfor the House of Representatives, including leadership, committees, and \nMember office budgets. It also continues the Member pay freeze that was \nput in place in 2010.\n\n[[Page H3340]]\n\n  In all, this represents a 14 percent reduction in funding for the \nHouse of Representatives since Republicans have gained control of \nCongress in January of 2011.\n  Now, more specifically, this bill increases funding for the Capitol \nPolice and allows small increases for several other agencies while \ntrimming budgets in less critical areas.\n  This bill recognizes the continuing challenges faced by our Architect \nof the Capitol. There is a balance that must be struck between \npreserving these historic buildings and funding other critical \nprojects, including life-safety projects.\n  Overall, the Architect's budget is one that was trimmed. This bill \nputs a new emphasis on transparency and accountability in major \nconstruction projects under the Architect. That is why this bill \ntransitions to direct appropriations for the Cannon restoration \nproject, rather than continuing to use the House historic building \nrevitalization fund. This change will significantly improve the \ncommittee's ability to provide oversight for this major project.\n  Additionally, this bill includes language that places a 25 percent \ncap on the amount available for larger projects within the legislative \nbranch. In order to receive the remaining 75 percent of their \nappropriations, this new oversight feature requires a plan for any \nproject over $5 million to be submitted to the GAO and our committee \nfor approval.\n  The plan must address any projected changes to the project's schedule \nand cost, and it must include a description of the safeguards taken to \nensure that the project remains on time and on budget.\n  Now, regarding the Library of Congress, this bill includes funding to \nmeet the Library's current needs, including an increase for the U.S. \nCopyright Office to reduce claims processing and analyze possible \nprocess improvements.\n  Additionally, the committee will be working with the Library in the \nupcoming months to track its progress in addressing its critical IT \ninfrastructure problems which have been identified in a recent GAO \nreport.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz, \nChairman Rogers, Mrs. Lowey, and the members of our subcommittee and \nfull committee and staff for their hard work throughout this entire \nprocess. This is a product that we can be proud of.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3341]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH19MY15.001\n\n\n\n[[Page H3342]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH19MY15.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H3343]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH19MY15.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H3344]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH19MY15.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H3345]]\n\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by congratulating Chairman Graves on \nhis maiden voyage as a chair of an appropriations subcommittee. I know \nthat he was diligent and focused, and we found agreement where we \ncould, and where we could not agree, I appreciate his willingness to \ndiscuss it in a congenial and thoughtful manner.\n  Today, we consider the smallest of the appropriations bills; and, \nwhile that is the case, it is one that does fund an entire branch of \nour government. The bill provides, as the chairman mentioned, $3.3 \nbillion to the legislative branch, without Senate items, and is equal \nto the amount provided in fiscal year 2015.\n  Unfortunately, this represents the third year in a row of flat \nfunding for the overall legislative branch. Certain agencies--the \nArchitect of the Capitol and the Government Publishing Office--are cut \nbelow fiscal year 2015 to support increases in other agencies.\n  I know if there was overall relief in the budget allocation, we would \nsee more investment in the staff and facilities in the legislative \nbranch, but we are starting to cut into bone in some places, and it is \ntruly unwise.\n  It is regrettable that this bill is, as are all of the other \nappropriations bills, bound by spending limits set by the Republican \nbudget resolution that continues sequestration.\n  The President put forward a plan that will avoid sequestration's \nharmful budget cuts and reduce the deficit in a balanced way. \nUnfortunately, the Republican budget does not at least meet the \nPresident's plan halfway.\n  As we look to conference with the Senate later in the year on \nappropriations bills, I am hopeful that both parties and the President \ncan come together for another reasonable bargain that gives us more \nroom for discretionary programs.\n  This bill is being considered under a structured rule, as is \ntradition. Twenty amendments were filed, seven of which were filed by \nDemocratic Members. Regrettably, the Rules Committee only made three \nRepublican amendments in order, all of which would further erode the \nLegislative Branch bill's funding.\n  No Democratic amendments were made in order, even though several were \naimed at improving the lives of our restaurant workers whose plight was \nplayed out in very public display in the last several weeks.\n  Last night, in the Rules Committee, I asked the committee to attempt \nto find some parity, Mr. Chairman, between the majority and minority \nwith regard to amendments made in order; instead of parity, the \nminority was completely shut out of the process.\n  As a result of the allocation, several infrastructure projects with \nlife and safety elements are not funded in this bill, even though we \nhave been committed to funding those in past years.\n  Cutting necessary upgrades to our elevators will not get us out of \ndebt; what it will do is get people stuck in our elevators. We should \nnot be surprised if an accident happens because we didn't address \nimportant life-safety projects.\n  This bill, as I have said many times before, is not the sexiest of \nthe 13 appropriations bills, but it is one that is incredibly \nimportant, and it is important that we keep the people who visit the \nCapitol and work in the Capitol safe, and this bill makes it less \nlikely that we will be able to do that.\n  There are not many new initiatives in the bill, given the allocation, \nbut I am pleased that the bill recognized the importance of the \nNation's copyright laws by providing some of the requested increase.\n  The Copyright Office must improve the backlog of registrations, as \nwell as their business processes. Currently, customers can only submit \ndocuments on paper, which the Copyright Office turns into a digital \nformat, which is a glaring inefficiency. It is 2015, the 21st century. \nOur Copyright Office should not be conducting 21st century business in \na 20th century format.\n  The Copyright Office said it best itself in a report released in \nFebruary of this year:\n\n       There is a widespread perception that our licensing system \n     is broken. Songwriters and recording artists are concerned \n     that they cannot make a living under the existing structure, \n     which raises serious and systemic concerns for the future. \n     Music publishers and performance rights organizations are \n     frustrated that so much of their licensing activity is \n     subject to government control, so they are constrained in the \n     marketplace. Record labels and digital services complain that \n     the licensing process is burdensome and inefficient, making \n     it difficult to innovate.\n\n  I am glad to see that this bill is beginning to address necessary \nupgrades.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am also concerned with the cut to the Government \nPublishing Office in the underlying bill. This office was formerly \nknown as the Government Printing Office. Congress changed the name in \nDecember to reflect what the agency actually does in this digital \nworld. The office publishes information online and plays a vital role \nin Congress' transparency.\n  Unfortunately, GPO's request to continue to improve its online site, \nas it has been allowed to do each year before this one, even under full \nsequestration, was denied in the bill. The cut to GPO's online site \ncontinues to raise the concern from some that GPO could ultimately \ndecide to charge the public for access to legislative documents, as was \nrecommended to them by the National Academy of Public Administration in \n2013.\n  I agree with Representatives Candice Miller and Bob Brady, the chair \nand ranking member of House Administration, who wrote to GPO, stating: \n``Charging the public to access legislative data and documents would be \na colossal setback to the progress Congress has made to improve \ntransparency and access to legislative information.''\n  They also said charging the public ``would be a direct assault on our \nability to engage Americans in a process that is of great consequence \nto their livelihoods.''\n  GPO indicated at the time of the Miller-Brady letter that it had no \nplans to charge users for what should be public information; but what \nchoice are we leaving them if we don't continue investing in their \nonline systems?\n  Also included in the bill is a requirement that the Architect seek \napproval, as the chairman described, from the House Committee on \nAppropriations and the Government Accountability Office for any project \nor phase of a project over $5 million.\n  I support strong oversight, as I have demonstrated many times over \nthe last 8 years, but I do question whether or not the low threshold \nwould unnecessarily hold up the progress of essential projects.\n  We should require the assistance of GAO to review projects on the \nscale of the Cannon building restoration. I have asked GAO to come in \nand get involved very specifically in a number of things where \naccountability was a concern, but I question the use of GAO's resources \non projects as small as $5 million. That begins to micromanage beyond \nwhat is reasonable.\n  To end on a more positive note, I am pleased that we were able to \nprovide $10 million to add to the House historic buildings \nrevitalization trust fund. We have been banking funds for our large \nprojects over the last several years, which is imperative to help \nensure we avoid getting caught flatfooted if we experience unexpected \ncosts in the future.\n  As I conclude, I want to, again, thank Chairman Graves for an open \ndialogue as he crafted this bill. I did have a lot of opportunity to \ntalk with him about the details of this bill and offer suggestions, \nmany of which he took. Again, I look forward to continuing to work with \nthe chairman as the bill moves to the Senate and then on to conference.\n  I particularly want to thank our incredible staff, one of whom is \nsitting next to me, Shalanda Young, and the rest of our staff, Liz \nDawson, Chuck Turner, on the majority side; and Jenny Panone, as well \nas Jason Murphy, with Chairman Graves' personal office; and Rosalyn \nKumar, on my personal staff. Thank you so much.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, before I yield to our full \ncommittee chairman, I do want to thank the ranking member for her work \non this, her input. She worked diligently through the process and was \nsupportive in subcommittee and full committee, and I wanted to thank \nher for that publicly.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Chairman Graves, thank you for yielding the\n\n[[Page H3346]]\n\ntime, and thank you for the great work.\n  This is the first bill that Chairman Graves has brought to the floor \nof the House. He is the newest cardinal that we have, one of the 12 \nsubcommittee chairmen--they are called cardinals--and this is his first \nbill.\n  I want to congratulate him and Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz for \nputting together what I think is a pretty high standard for fiscal \nresponsibility for the House, freezing funding at last year's level, \n$3.3 billion.\n  That is the third year in a row, Mr. Chairman, that we have frozen \nthe budget of the House of Representatives, making good on our promise \nto rein in spending and do more with less.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  This level maintains the 14 percent reduction in House funding that \nbegan when Republicans took control of the House 4 years ago.\n  In addition, we have continued the freeze on Member pay that has been \nin place since 2010. We believe that in order for us to ask others to \nsacrifice throughout the government, that we have to sacrifice, \nourselves, first; and that is what this bill does.\n  The bill includes numerous provisions designed to guarantee that the \nHouse and its support agencies are spending their tax dollars \nappropriately and to keep them accountable to the taxpayers. This \nincludes enhancing oversight of the Cannon building restoration project \nand making sure that Congress approves any large-scale construction \nproject.\n  These steps will help ensure that this type of major undertaking \nstays on time and on budget and are especially important given the \nhistorical significance of our buildings and the importance of their \nuse.\n  The $3.3 billion this bill provides for the House is directed to \nsupport the most important functions of our legislative branch: keeping \nour Member and committee offices open for business, protecting the \nsafety of those who work in and visit the Capitol complex, and \nimproving the way we support our agencies--and the importance of doing \njust that.\n  For instance, the Capitol Police budget has been increased by $21 \nmillion to ensure our men in blue have the resources needed to protect \nthis hallowed building and its grounds. And where we have seen issues \nin the agencies funded by the bill--for example, IT infrastructure \nchallenges at the Library of Congress--we have taken the steps to make \nsure that these will be fixed moving forward.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Wasserman \nSchultz, and this great staff that has worked hard on this bill. They \nhave demonstrated their love of this institution and these grounds by \nthe hard work and devotion they have put into making this bill \npossible. So we want to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for \nputting together this small but mighty bill. So I thank them for all of \ntheir work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud that the House can lead by example when it \ncomes to restoring fiscal discipline to the operations of the Federal \nGovernment. This bill will allow the House to fulfill its core duties \nwithin a responsible, realistic budget and preserve the democracy that \nmakes this Nation so great.\n  I thank the chairman for the time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield such time \nas she may consume to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. \nLowey), the ranking member of the full Appropriations Committee as well \nas the ranking member of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related \nPrograms Subcommittee.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Graves and Ranking Member \nWasserman Schultz for their hard work on this bill.\n  Today, during what the majority has labeled ``Innovation Week,'' we \nconsider the smallest of the appropriation bills, which funds the \noperations of our Nation's legislative branch.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is absolutely nothing innovative about this bill. \nWithout Senate items, the bill is $3.341 billion. Despite years of \n``tightening our belts,'' the majority has, yet again, kept funding \nflat and further damaged this institution's reputation and ability to \nfunction at the highest level.\n  Member representational allowances, or MRAs, would be frozen for a \nthird consecutive year and will continue to strain the House's ability \nto serve the American people due to fewer staff for constituent \ncasework, the inability to effectively communicate with our \nconstituents, and fewer district offices.\n  Furthermore, we will consider amendments to the bill which would \ncompound the problems legislative branch agencies face: our buildings \nare crumbling, life and safety projects are postponed, and agencies \nhave hit the limits of what they can do with inadequate funding. \nFurther cuts proposed today will have even greater implications for the \noperations of the Congress.\n  I am concerned that the majority continues funding for a partisan \nlawsuit against the President. At a time when we are putting \nappropriation bills under tight budgetary restrictions, this waste of \ntaxpayer dollars only distracts us from the serious work Congress \nshould get done.\n  Notwithstanding my misgivings, I want to again congratulate the \nchairman for putting forth his first bill and working with the ranking \nmember, where possible. We need more cooperation between the majority \nand the minority.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 5 minutes \nto the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise on this bill, as a member of the subcommittee, \nwith very mixed emotions. There are some very good things in this bill, \nbut there is also some bad stuff. The question is whether the bill is \n51 percent good or 51 percent bad.\n  I came to Congress because I believe that government can play a \npositive role in American lives. Government is not the enemy.\n  But it makes me wonder then why this body refuses to invest in the \ntools to do the job of government and, by extension, to do the job of \nthe American people. This bill contains the same funding levels it did \nlast year, and that is $172 million less than the budget request.\n  Any good corporation plots its investments so the company can \nprosper. In terms of the House of Representatives, that would mean \nsetting spending at a level that would maximize its ability to serve \nthe people. By failing to make those investments, we disrespect the \nAmerican people, and we tell them that we are not worth the investment, \nnot worth the effort, not worth doing the job well.\n  This bill fails to invest in the very institution we depend upon to \nmake government function properly. This body is being given short \nshrift.\n  I am on the Appropriations Committee. I think it is our \nresponsibility to meet the needs of the Nation in every respect, and \nthat includes investing in the legislative branch of government so it \ncan do its job.\n  Those low polling numbers that Congress gets--everybody here talks \nabout how low it is--I think they are the self-fulfilled policy of a \nCongress that refuses to provide itself the tools they need to serve \nthe public.\n  Skimping isn't going to make this place work any better. Using \ntaxpayer dollars more wisely will.\n  Having said that, I am also supportive of what the committee brought \nto the floor in a program called the Open World Leadership Center. It \nis operated out of funds from Congress with the Library of Congress.\n  What Members may not know is that this program was begun as the \nbrainchild of the late Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and the Librarian \nof Congress. It was to expose young and emerging leaders--average age \nabout 38--in Russia and former Eastern bloc countries. Some of those \ncountries include Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan.\n\n  I think President Putin would love to see this program go away, the \nway USAID has left the region.\n  It makes a difference to those young leaders to visit congressional \ndistricts, to see how city councils work, to see how school boards \nwork, to see the United States, the State legislators, the judges. The \nprogram belongs in the legislative branch because peer-to-peer \nrelationships do work.\n\n[[Page H3347]]\n\n  The program reaches out to all 50 States. More than 23,000 rising \nleaders have been hosted by the United States Government since the \nprogram's inception. Eighty percent of those have met with Members of \nCongress and visited their congressional districts. This is a very \nrobust exchange program.\n  I had a group in my district out in the central coast of California, \nand one of the visitors had been a member of the Duma, their Congress. \nHe told me that he had been invited by our country to be here at least \nabout a dozen times. But only in visiting the communities and seeing \nthe local government in action did he actually understand what \ndemocracy was all about, a bottom's-up process in America that is never \nlearned just visiting Washington or getting taught in a classroom. The \nvalue of hands-on, from-the-ground-up democracy is a lesson that can't \nbe learned from a book. Open World experiences show these participants \nthat democracy is not just a dream. It is actually a working reality, \none that they can have in their home countries if they work at it. And \nAmerica shows them how.\n  There is an amendment coming up, the Ratcliffe amendment, and I hope \nthat all the Members of Congress will reject that amendment to delete \nthis program.\n  Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate the work of the gentleman from \nGeorgia, our new chairman. He has done a great job. I hope that we will \nspend, though, a little bit more money investing in this institution so \nthat we can get the job done, not just talk about how we can cut, \nsqueeze, and trim, sacrificing the ability of Congress to be its best.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume, and thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr). He is \na great member of the subcommittee and a strong advocate for a lot of \nelements within our budget. The truth is, we had tough choices to make. \nIt wasn't easy. We are held within the constraints of what current law \nis.\n  The President may have submitted a budget that didn't comply with the \nconstraints that we have to comply with, but that doesn't mean that we \ncan adhere to his budget numbers. So we are $170-something million \nbelow what the President requested or what the budget request was, but \nwe are within the limits that are provided by law that many of the \nMembers within this body voted for--excluding myself--and the President \nsigned it into law.\n  At some point, we have to grapple with that, as a House, and \nunderstand that is the law. And until that law is changed, tough \nchoices we will have to make.\n  As the chairman of the full committee so eloquently stated earlier, \nit is up to us to lead by example, and that is who we have elected to \nbe our leaders and to represent our districts by example. So these are \ntough choices, no doubt. I agree with the gentleman from California.\n  I know we had a goal, as a committee, and it was really bipartisan, \nour objective; and that was to honor and respect taxpayers today and \npreserve the institution for future generations, given the limited \nresources we had to work with.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, let me just point out that the \nchairman is right: we do have to lead by example.\n  Leading by example, as we have in the past, like last fiscal year--\nafter the President submitted his budget, we certainly could have and \nshould have, as a Congress, sat down with the President and negotiated \nan adjustment to the sequester, which we were able to successfully do \nlast year, and that was to the betterment of making sure that people \nwho are simply trying to succeed have the opportunity to do so in this \ncountry instead of living under the severe cuts and caps that \nsequestration forced us into. That is Congress' job, which we \nabdicated. That was not the choice of the minority; it was the choice \nof the majority.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Price), the ranking member of the Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I appreciate my colleague from Florida \nyielding, and I appreciate the work that she and colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle have done on this bill. I want to commend them for \ntheir work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do want to address an amendment yet to come, one that \nI hope this body will reject. This is an amendment that will be offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe). It will be an amendment to \nundo the bipartisan work of our Appropriations Committee. It would \nterminate the Open World program at the Library of Congress, which is a \nmajor outreach effort of our legislative branch in Russia and former \nSoviet and Soviet bloc countries.\n  At a time when these countries' democracies and sovereignty are under \nthreat, the Open World program, I believe, is more important than ever. \nThis isn't President Putin's favorite activity, as others have stated. \nThat puts it very mildly, believe me. But he has not been able to stop \nit.\n  It is now more important than ever, not just in Russia but in fragile \ndemocracies and would-be democracies, such as Ukraine, Moldova, \nKyrgyzstan, and Georgia.\n  This is the best program of its kind that I have ever seen. And I \nhave a lot of personal experience with Open World groups that have come \nto Washington and have come to my district.\n  This is a program unique in both scope and concept. Most participants \naren't the people who typically participate in international exchange \nprograms. They are teachers, judges, local officials, young activists, \npeople who live in rural areas and small towns. This program penetrates \ndeeply, rather than just being another run-of-the-mill exchange \nprogram.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  I invite any colleague to talk to any of our diplomats in the \nparticipant countries. You will leave with no doubt about how unique \nand how valuable the network of Open World participants is in the \nstruggle for democracy in those countries and for the way our country \nis regarded, and there is a long list of veterans of Open World who are \nnow public and private sector leaders in their countries.\n  Mr. Chairman, some may question the placement of Open World in the \nLegislative Branch Appropriations bill. In fact, I think that is a huge \nasset. Because the program is not tied to a specific administration \nwith its goals and politics, there is no hurdle to participation. There \nis no possibility that it will get lost as the State Department focuses \non our other regions or on other priorities.\n  Now, unlike the other programs in this bill, sure enough, Open World \nis not about us. It is not about our salaries. It is not about our \nstaffs. It is not about our operations. It is not about us. But I \nassure you, it is about our country. It is about what we stand for at \nhome and around the world. It is about projecting the value of our \ndemocratic principles to countries with histories of oppressive rule.\n  The Appropriations Committee included funding for Open World \nfollowing a bipartisan effort led by Representatives Fortenberry and \nFarr. Hopefully, today that wise decision will be sustained.\n  I strongly encourage this body to stand with the pro-democracy \nadvocates, many, many brave and courageous people in a critical part of \nthe world. Oppose the Ratcliffe amendment.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Point of clarification because I know these proceedings are \ndocumented well, and I know the ranking member stated that \nsequestration was a decision of the majority and not the minority. In \nsome aspects, she is very correct, because at the time sequestration \nwas implemented, the majority of the Senate was held by Democrats, and \nthe concept came from Jack Lew, which is heavily documented, from the \nPresident's administration. So just to make sure there is full clarity \nhere of majority and minority perspectives, there was a different \nmajority at the time when that was taking place.\n  If I could, just for a moment, address the Open World discussion \nhere. This is a program that has been ongoing for several years--it has \nbeen decades, quite frankly--with great intentions in the beginning. \nWhat hasn't been stated\n\n[[Page H3348]]\n\ntoday is that its intention was to be a one-time program to assist \nduring a transitional phase of the Soviet bloc countries at that time, \nback in the Bill Clinton administration, to assist them with some \ndialogue with free markets and diplomacy and such as we were \nexperiencing during that time.\n  As we know, with a lot of government programs that have good \nintentions of being one time, singular, they tend to go on into \nperpetuity. Yet we have heard claims today that there is not enough \nmoney, that we don't have enough to spend on things that are so vital \nand so critical to this body, to the institution, to meeting our \nconstituents' needs, to the $1.5 billion in deferred maintenance of \nbuildings, to MRAs not being enough, or whatever it might be. Yet there \nis still this clinging to $5 million of training Russian diplomats or \nRussian civic leaders is more important, more important than meeting \nthe critical needs that we have here as a body, whether it is the \nLibrary of Congress, whether it is making sure that there is security \nprovided through the Capitol Police, that they are fully funded where \nthey need to be, whatever it might be.\n  I would claim, Mr. Chairman, that today, if we cannot cut $5 million \nfrom a program that is duplicative, that there are 95 other programs \nthat do very similar things, a program that has not been transparent, a \nprogram that has outlived its day, that is training Russians at a time \nwhen Russia is causing aggression against our allies and it is \nassisting our enemies, if we can't cut $5 million today and the \ngentleman from Texas' amendment fails today, God help us, when can we \ncut something from this budget?\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  While I intend to claim time in opposition to the amendment that \naddresses Open World a little bit later, which I know will come as a \nsurprise to the chairman, I do want to point out now that what the \nchairman says is not quite accurate, which is why I am going to oppose \nthe amendment. Because were we--and there were a number of options \navailable to the Rules Committee--taking the $5 million that is going \nto Open World in the Legislative Branch bill now and putting it in to \nsome other place in the Legislative Branch bill, life safety programs, \nrestoring the cuts to GPO, or doing something that is going to make \nsure that the legislative branch can be competitive and has the ability \nto get our work done, then that would have been fine, because I agree \nthat Open World is actually a square peg in a round hole and shouldn't \nbe funded out of this bill, and I have made that case for many years.\n  Instead, what the majority did is they took an amendment that takes \nthat $5 million and puts it into the spending reduction account. We are \nalready $106 million below 2010 levels in our MRA, in our office \naccounts. This bill is flat-funded for 3 years in a row. We are doing \nourselves a disservice and making it difficult for us to do our jobs \nwhen we had a ripe opportunity to take that $5 million--which I would \nhave been for--and put it somewhere in the Legislative Branch bill \ninstead of sending it out of here. That is not responsible.\n  Additionally, I will point out that perhaps the chairman's comments \nabout sequestration demonstrate that he thinks that Congress' hands are \ntied and that we don't have the ability to actually make changes. The \nPresident has proposed what he believes we should do as an alternative \nto the sequester. That was his proposed budget.\n  Like last year, we also have the ability to set aside and work with \nthe administration--set aside at least part of the sequester--so we \ncould provide improved allocations for each of these appropriations \nbills and make sure that we can make life better for more Americans. \nUnfortunately, the majority continues to act as if somehow we are \nfrozen in time and that we are paralyzed by sequestration as the law. \nThe last time I checked, the Founding Fathers in the Constitution gave \nCongress the ability to change the law, which we should do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will look forward to discussing some of the \namendments that we will be debating in a few moments.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman for, really, the opportunity to \nspend some time focusing on the needs of the legislative branch and \ngiving us the ability to at least move forward in some ways towards \naddressing our role as a coequal branch of government. I think this \nbill could have been far better. It has made several positive changes, \nbut as I have outlined, we have places where we disagree, but we did it \nwithout being disagreeable.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I thank the ranking member, and I appreciate her acknowledgment of \nher opposition to the amendment that will arrive earlier. I would point \nout to you, Mr. Chairman, that I am not a member of the Rules \nCommittee. I did not make that decision as to what amendment would be \nadopted or not. There were three amendments very similar. They were \nbipartisan. So there was bipartisan opposition to this program. We have \nthe amendment before us that is before us, and, for the record, I will \nbe supporting that amendment.\n  Let me say this has been a process that has been difficult. I \nunderstand that. We have had some tough choices to make, but we have \nmade them. We made them in a bipartisan way in which we had unanimous \nsupport out of subcommittee; we had no opposition that I recall in full \ncommittee. And so I expect today that we might maintain some of that \nbipartisanship, some of that ability to get something done here for the \nAmerican people and show them that we have priorities in place that \nhonor and respect them and preserve this institution for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. Chairman, to sum up what this bill does is we are here to hold \nthe line on spending. We are keeping it flat-funded, as we have for the \nlast year or two. This is a bill that is going to honor and respect our \ntaxpayers. It is one that is preserving the beauty of this Capitol \ncampus, providing a central security for all visitors and staff, and \nensuring that we are able to provide the services that our constituents \nexpect and deserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren). All time for general debate has \nexpired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Legislative \n     Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for \n     other purposes, namely:\n\n                      TITLE I--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH\n\n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n      Payment to Widows and Heirs of Deceased Members of Congress\n\n       For payment to Tori B.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $5,700,000)''.\n       Page 37, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,700,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Graves and Ranking \nMember Wasserman Schultz for their hard work in crafting this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, in this fiscal environment, we have to be better \nstewards of taxpayer dollars, and we have to scrutinize every program \nthat we allocate money towards. We can't ever forget that every dollar \nthat we spend is a dollar taken from our constituents' hard-earned \npaychecks. It is for that reason, Mr. Chairman, that I have offered \nthis amendment to eliminate funding for the Open World Leadership \nCenter--a program started in 1999 and housed in the Library of Congress \nwith the purpose of bringing leaders from post-Soviet countries to the \nUnited States to learn about our legislative process.\n  The gentleman from California spoke passionately a few minutes ago \nabout his belief that we need to have programs like this, but his \ncomments ignore the fact that there are nearly 90 other similar or \nnearly identical programs throughout the government aimed at achieving \nthis same goal. At the same time, this program has now spent more than \n$150 million towards that duplicative purpose.\n  So when you consider that duplicative purpose alongside a national \ndebt of $18.2 trillion, we have got to honestly examine and reconsider \nwhether this is the best use of taxpayer money. This is especially true \nwhen accounts and programs across the legislative branch have seen \nreductions in recent years, but yet not a single dollar has been cut \nfrom the Open World program despite the fact that, after this \nsubcommittee's examination of this program, Chairman Graves reported \nthat, ``In light of both the lack of quantifiable results from the Open \nWorld Leadership Center and its duplications of programs more \nappropriately offered by the State Department, the program has long \noutlived its short-term intent.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I agree with the chairman's assessment, which is, by \nthe way, not a partisan one. In fact, this is the all-too-rare \nsituation and opportunity where Republicans and Democrats, alike, agree \nthat we can cut spending without hurting American citizens.\n  The American people have entrusted us with the responsibility of \nseeing that their tax dollars don't go to waste. And while Mr. Graves' \nbill allocates funds to the legislative branch to do the important work \nthat we need to on behalf of the American people, the Open World \nprogram is one area where we can and should make this spending cut.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Graves), the chairman.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nbringing this forward. He has done a lot of work on this topic. He is \nnew to the body--I think everybody knows that--and with haste he has \nmoved to find an area in which we can continue to provide savings for \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment here, and I \nappreciate his bringing it forward.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague for bringing \nthis amendment and for focusing in on areas where we can actually \neliminate spending here in Washington. Again, you have to recognize \nthat about 35 cents of every dollar spent is money borrowed from \ncountries like China, so we ought to be combing every different piece \nof this budget and finding areas where we can say that this isn't \nsomething that the Federal Government should be doing.\n  It might be a noble program to have exchanges with other countries, \nbut to be spending millions of dollars at a time when our country has \nneeds that aren't being met and that we are borrowing money from other \ncountries and sending that bill to our children, this is a time where \nwe have got to be combing through these kinds of programs, and I want \nto thank him for his leadership.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  This is a time where we have got to be combing through these kind of \nprograms, and I want to thank him for his leadership. This is something \nthat should be eliminated. We shouldn't be spending millions of dollars \nof taxpayer money to bring people over to this country. If they want to \ncome, we welcome them.\n  Many countries do send people over here to observe how democracy \nworks; we send people on occasion to other countries to spread \ndemocracy, but there are duplications in so many other areas of our \nbudget where this is already being done, and this is just one more area \nwhere we ought to be saving taxpayers' money and being fiscally \nresponsible.\n  This isn't something we can afford to do; it isn't something we \nshould be doing. I am glad the gentleman is bringing the amendment to \neliminate this spending. I support it and hope the House approves it.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to note for the Members \nthat this would be the first time that I am actually opposing an \namendment that cuts the Open World program.\n  Initially, when I became chair of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee \n8 years ago, this program was at $14 million. I have consistently tried \nto cut this program and move its funding to the State Department bill \nfor every single year since then. We have not been successful, but we \nare only at $5.7 million now, which is a more appropriate amount.\n  We are, as I said, in general debate. This funding going somewhere \nelse in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill would be more \nappropriate. Since we are sending it out of the bill in a bill that is \nalready inadequately funded, it is not an amendment I can support.\n  At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. \nFortenberry), who wishes to speak in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for the \ntime. I also want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Graves, for \nthe gentlemanly way in which we have conducted this debate.\n  This is a transpartisan issue. We have got Democrats and Republicans \ndivided on each side of the aisle, which is a bit unusual, but \nnonetheless, this is important.\n  I support the Open World Leadership Center. I am on its board. It has \nbeen mentioned that this is better nested within the State Department. \nThe State Department does have a myriad of programs. However, this is a \nlegislative branch program, and we should not outsource our \nresponsibility there.\n\n[[Page H3354]]\n\n  This program was formed in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union \nin order to give a chance for the development of legal structures, \nstabilized civil society, and the opportunity for democracy to evolve. \nWhile the primary focus was on Russia, that component has been \nsuspended, and this program has taken a very substantial cut down from \n$10 million to about $6 million now.\n  To jettison it gets rid of very important deliverables. Over 23,000 \njudges, politicians, emerging civil society leaders, and young people \nhave participated in this program, including 15 members of Ukraine's \nparliament, 15 members of Moldova's parliament, 8 Russian governors; 51 \npercent of the participants are women.\n  Mr. Chairman, the military tells me: Send us in last.\n  We will send billions and billions of dollars of lethal military aid \nto a country, but the military says: Do everything you can to build up \ngood will and trust and relationships in stable societies so that we do \nnot have to resort to what none of us wants to resort to.\n  The Open World Leadership Center fulfills that role in an effective \nway. There are changes that I hope will be forthcoming to make it more \neffective in the future. I hope we will preserve this important \nlegislative priority which cannot be replicated, essentially, by the \nState Department.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. At this time, I yield 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).\n  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding, and as someone who served as ranking member for this \nsubcommittee back several years ago, I just want to express my support \nand the work for the Open World Leadership Center than the opposed \namendment offered by the gentleman from Texas.\n  I am sure it is well intended, but I do want to say that I think that \nthis amendment is not going in the right direction. We do need to keep \nthis partnership. It is a partnership. It is a relationship that has \ndeveloped with these former Soviet countries.\n  I think it is very important. It has served us well. It is a program \nthat a lot of people say is duplicated in other agencies of government, \nbut I will say it is unique. It is a unique approach to working across \nborders to highlight the critical role of the legislative branch in \nemerging democracies.\n  I just want to say that I support this bill as it currently is and \nwould oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, can you tell me how much time we \nhave remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 1 minute \nto the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz \nfor the time.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the Ratcliffe amendment.\n  If anyone has been watching, you have seen Russia's invasion of \nUkraine. Now, more than ever, it is critical to engage with rising \nstars in the former Soviet Union because the old tactics of Soviet \nRussia are still being employed.\n  This program belongs to Congress. Yes, it is a legislative branch \nprogram, so it is small; it is efficient; it is ours. It is our one \ntool to reach out to these countries to their rising leaders to expand \naccountable governance and the rule of law. Who better to teach it than \nthose engaged, those of us who communicate with citizens in these \ncountries that so very much want to be free?\n  Open World directly connects us with changemakers in this very, very \nfluid region of the world. It reaches beyond the big cities, into the \ncountry side. I personally have greeted some of the leaders that have \ncome from several countries, including Moldova and Ukraine.\n  Let me tell you, it will be our generation and the next that will pay \nthe price if this amendment is passed. We simply must engage with this \npart of the world. We cannot leave her in the hands of the Russian \nbear.\n  I urge very strong opposition to the Ratcliffe amendment.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 30 seconds remaining. \nThe gentlewoman from Florida has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. At this time, I yield 10 seconds to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to respond that there is no \nlegislative program in the State Department like this. You can't \ntransfer it there. They are not operative in these countries, so to say \nthat this could be moved over--look, you were in professional \norganizations.\n  This is legislator to legislator, judge to judge, and we need to keep \nit that way.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, my constituents sent me to Washington to \ncut wasteful spending. The Open World program is one of many, many \nprograms that have the same purpose throughout the Federal Government. \nThis is a chance to cut $5 million in spending for a duplicative \nprogram that we simply don't need.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of passage of the Ratcliffe \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, what this \namendment is, is a missed opportunity to be fiscally responsible.\n  I also support not spending money on the Open World program any \nlonger and moving it to the State Department. Unfortunately, the \nmajority has chosen to make a rule in order that focuses on an \namendment to shift the $5.7 million completely out of the legislative \nbranch when we have plaster falling off buildings, elevators badly in \nneed of repair, we have cuts to our MRA--our office accounts--our staff \nthat isn't well paid enough; and it just not responsible.\n  This is a missed opportunity. I urge the Members, unfortunately, to \noppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Flores\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to deliver a printed copy of the Congressional \n     Pictorial Directory to the office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident \n     Commissioner to the Congress).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Flores) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a simple amendment to \nprohibit funds for delivering printed copies of the Congressional \nPictorial Directory in the House of Representatives.\n  The pictorial directory is a book with pictures of Members of \nCongress printed by the Government Publishing Office. The most recent \nedition cost over $200,000 to print and distribute. While I realize \nthis is not much money, I think with an $18 trillion debt, that we need \nto be looking for the pennies, as well as the $100 bills.\n  The most important thing is this book is no longer necessary to print \nin hard copy. We are almost 6 months into the 114th Congress, and the \nGPO has still not published the book. During the 113th Congress, it \ntook the GPO 9 months, until September, to release the pictorial \ndirectory. Here is what one of them looks like.\n\n[[Page H3355]]\n\n  Private groups make similar directories that are actually more useful \nand include contact information and biographies of Members, in addition \nto their pictures. I have a copy of the directory that was dropped off \nat my office by a trade association in the last few days, and unlike \nthe GPO directory, it is up to date, and they keep it up to date.\n  Of course, pictures of Members of Congress are readily available for \nfree online. If needed, the Clerk could ensure that appropriate \nphotographs of current Members are available to create an online \npictorial directory.\n  The language of this amendment mirrors several riders already in the \nbill that prohibit funds for the delivery of printed copies of bills \nand resolutions, printed copies of the Congressional Record, printed \ncopies of the statements of disbursements, and printed copies of the \ndaily calendar.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense \namendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I think it is worth stating for \nthe Record that this amendment would maybe save somewhere between \n$9,000 and $29,000. I mean, let's bear the full impact of that weighty \nsum, depending on how it is interpreted.\n  This is an amendment that would prevent the delivery of a printed \ncopy that I have in my hand of the Congressional Pictorial Directory--\nwhich, by the way, Mr. Flores, no offense, but some of us used this \ndirectory to identify you during the course of this discussion.\n  This is a book that is actually necessary and one that we shouldn't \nbe farming out or relying on lobbyists to print for us.\n  Every year, we seem to get an amendment that stops some sort of \nprinting or delivery of a paper copy of some document to Member \noffices.\n  Just so Members know, we have actually made real savings in this bill \nin the past--in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill--by no \nlonger delivering a printed copy of a bill unless a Member requests a \ncopy; we no longer deliver the Congressional Record to Member offices; \nwe no longer allow more than 50 printed copies of the Code to go to \nHouse offices; we no longer deliver a printed copy of the statements of \ndisbursement to Member offices; we no longer deliver a printed copy of \nthe daily calendar to Member offices--all of which cost far more than \nstopping the printing of these books.\n  It isn't really realistic to expect Members to print out a piece of \npaper--or staff--and carry around a whole bunch of printed faded copies \nof paper to help identify Members. We have new Members every 2 years.\n  My point is we are about out of low-hanging fruit here. I hope this \nis the last of this type of amendment because, if we want to change \nprinting, the Members have an opportunity to take their grievances up \nwith the Joint Committee on Printing.\n  The distribution of the Congressional Pictorial Directory is actually \nset by the Joint Committee on Printing. Maybe the gentleman is unaware \nof that, and it doesn't need to be legislated through this bill. We \ndon't need to be creating a false impression that we are actually \nsaving taxpayer dollars that would not have been saved through another \nmeans.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I think the gentlewoman from Florida made a \ngreat case for putting this book in the same stack of dinosaurs that \nshe was talking about when it comes to eliminating all other waste in \nterms of government printing.\n  I have an app that cost me $1.99 that gives me current pictures of \nMembers of Congress. I don't have to carry any paper around. I don't \nhave to carry this book around. I don't have to carry this book around. \nI just have to have an app.\n  Look, we are a 21st century Congress. Why don't we act like a 21st \ncentury Congress and get rid of the dinosaurs like this?\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield for a question?\n  Mr. FLORES. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I am wondering whether that app was privately \nproduced or was produced by taxpayers. As for the $1.99 that you spent \non it, were those taxpayer dollars you used to pay for it or from your \nown personal funds?\n  Mr. FLORES. That was my personal money.\n  Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, my point is that it would be one \nthing if a congressional tutorial directory were unnecessary, but that \nis not the case. It is necessary. What isn't necessary is for us to be \nwasting time in debate on the House floor over something that could \nactually be handled differently. If the gentleman or any other Member \nthought that the Joint Committee on Printing should handle it \ndifferently, just go talk to them.\n  Instead, what we are doing is pretending that we are actually saving \ntaxpayer dollars. This is about $9,000, and what we shouldn't be doing \nis outsourcing the things that we need in terms of the materials to do \na better job serving the public to lobbyists and the private sector. \nThat does not make sense, and it isn't necessary, and the majority \nshould not leave the impression that they are actually doing something \nfiscally responsible here.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, this has been a fascinating discussion. The \ngentlewoman from Florida claims that the savings are between $9,000 and \n$29,000 while the numbers that we have are $200,000. If you ask your \ntypical hard-working family if $9,000 is a lot of money, they will say, \nyes, it is. Is $29,000 a lot of money? They will say yes. Is $200,000 a \nlot of money? They will say yes. If you say, ``You are paying for that. \nWould you like the government to stop wasting that money?'' then they \nwould say, absolutely, yes.\n  If the gentlewoman does not want to waste any time on this and vote \n``aye,'' then let's stop.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I will point out that the \ngentleman's amendment does not actually stop the printing of the \npictorial directory. It simply stops the delivery of the directory to \nMembers' offices. So it does not provide the savings that the gentleman \nis talking about. It provides between $9,000 and $29,000 because the \nonly cost that he is saving is on the delivery and not on the printing.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nGraves), the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. Chairman, I read the amendment's intent as well. As the ranking \nmember just stated and as the argument seems to go around in a circle \nhere, it doesn't stop the printing of these items, of these \ndirectories. It just says that Members of Congress shouldn't have \nsomebody privately deliver them to their offices. If they want one, go \nget one. If they want to look it up online, look it up online. If they \nwant to spend $1.99 and get an app, they can get an app. This just says \nthat the Congressional Pictorial Directory is just not going to be \ndelivered to a Member's office. I don't know how controversial that can \nbe.\n  I thank the gentleman for his amendment.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this \ncommonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I conclude by pointing out that \nthe offerer of the amendment, and the chairman, are suggesting that now \nwe should print things that we don't use. If that isn't an example of a \nwaste of taxpayer dollars in suggesting that we should print this \ndocument but not make sure that it is delivered to Members' offices for \ntheir utilization, that pretty much sounds like government waste under \nthe classic definition.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n[[Page H3356]]\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mrs. Blackburn\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-120.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Each amount made available by this Act is \n     hereby reduced by 1 percent.\n       (b) The reduction in subsection (a) shall not apply with \n     respect to--\n       (1) accounts under the heading ``Capitol Police'';\n       (2) ``Architect of the Capitol--Capitol Police Buildings, \n     Grounds and Security''; or\n       (3) the amount provided for salaries and expenses of the \n     Office of the Sergeant at Arms under the heading ``House of \n     Representatives--Salaries, Officers and Employees''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to begin by thanking the \nsubcommittee chairman for his hard work on this effort that is in front \nof us and for the committee's identifying ways to reduce what the \nFederal Government spends, especially in the leg branch.\n  The fiscal year 2016 proposed funding level is $3.3 billion. That is \n$173 billion below the President's request. I think there is more work \nthat we could do, and my 1 percent across-the-board spending reduction \nwill save taxpayers an additional $29 million in budget authority and \n$25 million in outlays for fiscal year 2016. It is a targeted cut in \ndiscretionary spending that exempts the Capitol Police, the Sergeant at \nArms, and security maintained by the Architect of the Capitol.\n  Again, as I said, I want to recognize the work of Chairman Graves and \nhis committee. They have done several very important things that, I \nthink, we ought to highlight.\n  First, this measure continues to freeze Member pay in place, where it \nhas been since 2010. Second, it continues a 14 percent reduction in \nfunding for the House of Representatives, which Republicans began in \n2011. I appreciate that Chairman Rogers brought attention to that as \ngeneral debate began. Third, the bill cuts funding for programs such as \nthe Government Publishing Office, which we have just been discussing--\nmany programs that have outlived their usefulness.\n  We can cut more, and a penny on a dollar is worth the effort. We are \na country that has over $18 trillion in debt. Financial security has \nbecome an issue of national security. Admiral Mullen said the greatest \nthreat to our Nation's security is our growing national debt. That is a \nreason for our getting our fiscal house in order and looking to future \ngenerations and saying, let's go in and cut one more penny out of a \ndollar. This effort that I bring before you would do just that--one \nmore cent--and do it for future generations.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  It takes a meat-ax approach to cutting this bill by over $29 million \nwith an across-the-board cut of 1 percent. I want to point out that it \nalso exempts the Capitol Police and its buildings, as well as the \nSergeant at Arms.\n  If the gentlewoman, who I know offers these amendments over and over \nagain, were truly committed to an across-the-board cut, then she would \njust simply offer an across-the-board cut.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), the minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this.\n  This is a mindless but easy cut. Tough words. By the way, this is \nsequester, which is a Republican proposal. It started in about 2011 \nbut, really, before that with all of these across-the-board cuts \nbecause you don't have to make any choices, and you don't have to make \npriorities. You just say, Oh, let's save money.\n  Frankly, so many of the people in this country want this Congress to \nhave vigorous oversight of the executive department, which has expanded \nvery substantially while the legislature has continued to undermine its \nability to function as an effective oversight agency of the American \npeople. The legislative branch is underfunded. We do not have the \ncapacity to do the effective oversight as we ought to be doing. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is a perfect example of that where we \nwere not vigorous enough in oversight to ensure that money was being \napplied properly.\n  If you want to cut and if you want to say something--this is not \ngood; that is not good; we are wasting money there--then specify it. \nDebate that issue up or down. That is why sequester is so abysmally \nwrong and why the chairman of the committee called it unrealistic and \nill-conceived. This is not Obama's proposal of a sequester. I am not \ntalking about this amendment, but to say, as you repeatedly say on your \nside of the aisle, that this is Obama's proposal is baloney. In fact, \nthe only reason Jack Lew suggested that to Reid as an option was \nbecause you--and I refer to the Republican friends on the other side of \nthe aisle--were threatening not to honor the Nation's debt.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HOYER. That is the only reason we passed sequester, and nobody \nintended sequester to go into effect. It was always a backup. Because \nwe have failed to come to an agreement on a fiscally responsible, \nsustainable path, we have repaired to this ill-conceived, unrealistic \nconcept of sequester. This 1 percent across the board is exactly that. \nIt puts intellect on hold and judgment on hold. That is not why the \nAmerican people sent us here.\n  Reject this amendment. Respect this institution, and respect our \nresponsibility to the American people.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute and 15 seconds \nto the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to say a few words about one part of the bill \nthat I find very troubling. This is a cut that is a penny-wise and \npound-foolish.\n  Last year, we named the GPO as the Government Publishing Office, and \nthat is because of the range of digital services that it provides. This \nyear, the Legislative Branch Subcommittee voted to cut those operations \nby eliminating the appropriated funding for the GPO's Federal digital \nsystem, which provides free digital access to more than a million \ncongressional and other government document titles that have been \ndownloaded by the public more than 1 billion times over the past 5 \nyears. It does not make sense. Cutting this will severely eliminate \nmoney to upgrade the GPO's Federal digital system and the new search \nand retrieval system.\n  In recognition of the fiscal pressures we all face, the GPO came in \nwith a flat budget request this year, asking only that we support the \ncommitment to their digital transformation. We said ``yes'' to it last \nyear, and I am hopeful that we can restore that funding this year. It \nmakes no sense to cut this. There are millions of people in local \nlibraries all across this country who depend on this digital system, \nand we do not need to cut it. This is penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n  Mr. Chair, as a former Member of the House Legislative Branch \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I wanted to say a few words about one part \nof this year's spending bill which I find very troubling.\n  A year ago, Congress and the President agreed to rename GPO as the \nGovernment Publishing Office, based on the broad range of\n\n[[Page H3357]]\n\ndigital services the agency now provides. The Subcommittee supported \nthis legislative change.\n  This year, the House Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee \nvoted to cut those operations by eliminating appropriated funding for \nGPO's Federal Digital System, which provides free digital access to \nmore than 1 million congressional and other Government document titles \nthat have been downloaded by the public more than 1 billion times over \nthe past five years. This cut just doesn't make sense.\n  It will severely curtail GPO's ability to add new digital documents \nto its Federal Digital System. It will zero out the funding for \ninitiatives that support the missions of congressional and legislative \nbranch organizations such as the Clerk of the House of Representatives, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, and the Library of Congress who rely on \ninformation from the Federal Digital System to feed websites such as \nCongress.gov and Docs.House.gov.\n  GPO's Federal Digital System, though just 5 years old, is already \nbeginning to show its age. The rapid changes in today's digital \ntechnical environment remind us why it's essential for GPO to keep up \nwith the times.\n  But this funding cut will eliminate money to upgrade GPO's Federal \nDigital System with a new search and retrieval system, an improved user \ninterface, and other needed hardware and software improvements, \nincluding migrating the system to the cloud. Due to the critical role \nthe Federal Digital System plays in making our legislative information \ntransparent and available online, we need to make this investment.\n  In recognition of the fiscal pressures we all face, GPO came in with \na flat budget request this year, asking only that we support their \ncommitment to their digital transformation. We said yes to that \ntransformation last year, and I am hopeful that we can restore this \nfunding in the final legislation.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I find it so interesting that this is \ncalled a ``meat-ax approach.'' Yes, I do come regularly to offer these \namendments, because I care what happens with our Nation. I care about \nour future, and I want to make certain that we are on solid financial \nfooting. We have a responsibility to be good stewards of the taxpayers' \nmoney. It is their money.\n  To say this is mindless and easy, how interesting that is. Go tell \nall of the Governors from coast to coast--Democrat and Republican--who \nuse across-the-board spending cuts to get budgets in balance. Tell that \nto mayors who use this same process. The reason it is done is it works. \nIt helps the bureaucracy hold itself accountable, and that is \nabsolutely what we ought to be doing at this point in time.\n  As you can see, cutting is a very emotional issue. Cutting brings \nforward a lot of emotions. Talking about doing more with less, being \nresourceful, that is what we should do every single day. In order to be \na good steward of the taxpayers' money, we should want to do more with \nless. We should do it in the name of freedom, for freedom's sake--for \nthe sovereignty of this Nation.\n  Ill-conceived and unrealistic? When is operating by a balanced budget \nand spending and living within the means the taxpayers have said they \nare going to have for this Federal Government ever considered ill-\nconceived? When would it be considered unrealistic? It is what we ought \nto be doing. Indeed, if every department did what the legislative \nbranch did of cutting 14 percent, we would be getting close to budget.\n  To say that we are suspending intellect and judgment, do you know \nthat is almost frivolous and almost silly to say.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  We spend less and should be spending less and should try to continue \nto spend less and reform this government and hold it accountable to the \ntaxpayer who is footing the bill because, yes, the Nation's future \ndepends on it; our national security, yes, depends on it; and respect, \nit is respecting future generations and the taxpayer to be a wise \nsteward.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I yield 30 seconds of my remaining time to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chair, I wish the gentlewoman had made that same speech \nwhen we were discussing defense, the biggest spending bill we have, but \nshe didn't offer this amendment at all.\n  I happen to come from a State where the legislators didn't have \nenough guts to raise taxes, so the people went out and did it because \nthey want their government to run wisely and smartly, and they knew \nthey didn't have enough money to do it.\n  Look, we are cutting this budget; yet the Senate, which we don't vote \non their bit, is increasing their budget by 12 percent. They are going \nto be able to give cost-of-living adjustments to every one of their \nMembers. Nobody sitting in this room who works for us is going to get a \ncost-of-living adjustment because of cuts like this. This is \nridiculous. We are penalizing our whole House, not the Senate. This is \nnot a smart way to make legislative business.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I \nhave remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. To close, Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is \nthat what would be fiscally responsible and responsible in general is \nto not further take a meat ax to a bill that has already been flat-\nfunded for the last 3 years. Our employees deserve a raise. We deserve \nto be able to be a coequal branch of government, funded well enough to \nbe able to hold the administration accountable and make sure we can do \nour jobs. This bill does not allow us to achieve that.\n  I urge the Members to oppose this irresponsible amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    announcement by the acting chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in part B of House Report \n114-120 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following \norder:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. Ratcliffe of Texas.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Mrs. Blackburn of Tennessee.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the time for any electronic vote \nafter the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Ratcliffe\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nRatcliffe) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the \nayes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nHultgren) for taking the initiative on this issue.\n  DOE's Advanced Scientific Computing Research program is the primary \nFederal research and development program for innovation in computing \ntechnology. High-performance computing has paved the way for \nbreakthroughs in medical imaging, genetics research, manufacturing, \nengineering, and weapons development.\n  Faster computing speeds have revolutionized the energy sector, \nimproved the efficiency of energy production, and aided in distribution \ntechnologies. Advances in computer modeling offer opportunities for \nscientific discovery in fields where experiments are too difficult, \ncostly, or dangerous to conduct. These advances reduce costs and open \nthe door to more innovative discoveries.\n  The country with the strongest computing capability will host the \nworld's next scientific breakthroughs. Unfortunately, China currently \nholds the world's fastest computer, not the United States. This bill \nshould reverse this trend and help advance American competitiveness.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), as \nwell as the gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell), the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nEsty), and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for their \ninitiative on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cosponsor H.R. 874, the American Super \nComputing Leadership Act. This is bipartisan legislation that I have \nhad the pleasure of working on with my colleague, Mr. Hultgren, as well \nas others from both sides of the aisle in developing, including, as the \nchairman said, Mr. Swalwell, Ms. Bonamici, and Ms. Esty. This bill \nwould authorize an exascale computing program to ensure that the \nfastest computers in the world, as well as their software and \nalgorithms, which will help us use these machines to the maximum \nefficiency, are developed here in the United States.\n  The term ``exascale'' is often used to refer to the next generation \nof supercomputers in general and is used interchangeably with ``extreme \nscale.'' This term is often applied to computing systems that are \ncapable of carrying out a million trillion operations per second. That \nrate is approximately 50 times faster than the current fastest computer \nin the world.\n  Through this legislation, the Secretary of Energy would be empowered \nto significantly increase the computing power that is accessible to \nscientists from Federal agencies as well as industry and academia. \nThese investments would have a wide range of impacts by giving the \nNation's best scientists the resources and support they need to \nflourish.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are numerous fields of research in both the \nacademic and industrial areas that would be greatly aided by this \nincreased computing power. Fields such as pharmaceutical development, \naerodynamic modeling for aircraft and vehicle design, advanced nuclear \nreactor design and fusion plasma modeling, combustion simulation to \nassist in the design of fuel-efficient clean engines, and high \ntemperature superconductivity to significantly reduce energy losses \nwhile transmitting electricity.\n  As a result of this legislation, the Department of Energy would be \nrequired to submit regular reports as well as a management plan to \nCongress describing how DOE intends to institute this program and its \ncurrent projects. Lemont, Illinois' Argonne National Laboratory is a \nworld leader in developing this new capability, so I am happy that just \nlast month the Department of Energy announced a major award to support \nand significantly upgrade Argonne's advanced computing research and \nfacilities. This bill will ensure that these investments are part of a \ntransparent, long-term, coordinated strategy to keep the United States \non top in this field. I also anticipate that the benefits that we will \nsee from this legislation may well surpass the impacts that we can even \nimagine today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 874, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who is a sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I also would like to thank my good friend \nand distinguished chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee, Chairman Smith from Texas, as well as my good friend, \nCongressman Lipinski from Illinois, as well as my other good friend, \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell) all for helping to bring \nthis legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 874 will help ensure that America stays at the \nforefront of supercomputing technology by getting to the exascale level \nof computing--close to the speed of the human brain. These capabilities \nare vital for our national security, the economy, and, more broadly, \nthe research capabilities of our Nation.\n  While America and American companies are still leading the way for \nmuch of this current technology, it is important to point out that the \nNational University of Defense Technology in China now houses the \nworld's fastest computer.\n  One of the Department of Energy's primary responsibilities within the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration is the maintenance of our \ncurrent nuclear stockpile. This stockpile stewardship responsibility is \ncarried out with increasingly complex simulations as our stockpile \nages. The need for improved parallelism capabilities and decreased \nenergy requirements are spelled out in this legislation to ensure the \nDepartment carries out a targeted basic research program to overcome \nthe most pressing needs.\n  I would like to point out, however, that I believe, in agreement with \nthe Secretary, that exascale is not the end point. It is just a step \ntowards the greater goal of American leadership in this field.\n  This legislation will ensure that the broader scientific community \nhas access to these facilities on a competitive merit review basis. The \nscientific drivers and the national security responsibilities should be \nthe primary focus for computing research, but we must also make sure \nthat the crosscutting benefits of this research are not left at the \nwayside.\n  H.R. 874 would create partnerships with universities, industry, and \nthe national labs to conduct this research, ensuring that the Nation, \nas a whole, benefits from this research more quickly and efficiently. \nWith all parties at the table, businesses will be better able\n\n[[Page H3363]]\n\nto utilize the new technologies and algorithms that will result.\n  Having the pleasure to represent the great State of Illinois, I have \nbeen able to witness how an ecosystem of innovation can best be \nfostered. For our Nation to reap the greatest yields from our research, \nour research facilities must be open to the public when it makes sense \nand does not interfere with the core missions of our Federal agencies \nand the labs.\n  The user facilities in our national labs already serve over 30,000 \nresearchers every year, with university researchers taking precedence \nover others. And other user facilities, such as the Advanced Photon \nSource at Argonne, Illinois, have given a tremendous research \ncapability to industry partners, such as pharmaceutical companies, \nwhere research that once took weeks is now done in hours, with samples \nspending more time in overnight mail.\n  Mr. Speaker, the computing capabilities this legislation will help \nbring about will similarly have tremendous application in health care \nand drug development. We are just now getting to the point where \ncomputer simulations are giving us higher resolution images at the \nmolecular level than we can get with microscopes when trying to \nunderstand how diseases, our bodies, and new treatments interact. And \nthe modeling simulations these systems make available also allow \nmanufacturers to build better prototypes that have already been tested \nthousands of times virtually before they come off the line.\n  But perhaps most importantly, these capabilities will keep America \ncompetitive on the global scale. And the graduate students and postdocs \nthat learn on these machines will take what they know wherever they \ndecide to go, whether it be business or the Department of Defense.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  He said the best form of technology transfer wears shoes. That is why \nI thank my colleagues for helping me bring this similar legislation to \nthe floor again this Congress, and I recommend all my colleagues \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire, does the gentleman from \nTexas have any more speakers on this bill?\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers on this \nside, so I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time after the \ngentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto close here.\n  I want to thank Mr. Hultgren again. He represents Fermilab. I \nrepresent part of Argonne National Laboratory. It is good to work with \nhim on this legislation and others to advance science in the United \nStates. Even though there are few people who really understand what \nthis means, we will all see the results of it.\n  I thank the chairman for moving this bill forward. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my \ntime as well.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 874.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3363-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3363-H3365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SCIENCE PRIZE COMPETITIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 1162) to make technical changes to provisions \nauthorizing prize competitions under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \nInnovation Act of 1980, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on H.R. 1162, the bill now under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 1162, the Science Prize Competitions Act, promotes increased \nutilization of prize competitions within the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page H3364]]\n\n  I want to thank the ranking member of the Oversight Subcommittee, Mr. \nBeyer, for introducing this legislation. I also thank the bipartisan \ncosponsors, which include the vice chair of the Oversight Subcommittee, \nMr. Bill Johnson, as well as the full committee ranking member, Ms. \nEddie Bernice Johnson.\n  Prize competitions help spur innovation. They give innovators \nincentives to produce groundbreaking, outside-the-box ideas. Used \neffectively, prize competitions can be a tool to generate revolutionary \nresults that wouldn't happen otherwise.\n  For example, after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the X Prize \nFoundation sponsored a competition to elicit new oil removal \ntechnologies that needed to be better than state of the art. With the \nincentive of a million-dollar prize for first place, the winning team \ndesigned technology capable of extracting 89 percent of the oil from \nthe water.\n  Thanks to the incentives provided by the competition, the winner, in \na few months, blew the competition and the then best available oil \nskimmers out of the water.\n  Another example of a novel idea for a prize involves the Head Health \nChallenge. This is a joint effort by the National Football League, \nUnder Armour, General Electric, and the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology to produce ``viable materials that will result in \nincreased safety and protection for athletes, the warfighter, and \ncivilians.''\n  This is a competition that could yield a solution that would benefit \na diverse section of the population, from athletes to soldiers.\n  H.R. 1162 makes important changes to the prize competitions section \nof the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. It better \ndefines the role of the private sector in various aspects of prize \ncompetitions. H.R. 1162 will have a positive impact on science prize \ncompetitions, which have bipartisan support.\n  A letter from the Director of the Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy proclaims the values of such competitions by stating:\n\n       This report details the remarkable benefits the Federal \n     Government has reaped from more than 400 prize competitions \n     and challenges implemented by over 72 agencies to date, the \n     steps the administration has taken to establish a lasting \n     foundation for use of the COMPETES prize authority, and \n     detailed examples from fiscal year 2014 of how the COMPETES \n     prize authority is increasing the number of agencies that use \n     prizes to achieve their missions more efficiently and \n     effectively.\n\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Beyer of Virginia and Mr. Johnson of Ohio \nfor introducing this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to thank two Texans, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member \nJohnson, for their leadership on this important issue and remind them \nthat Samuel Houston and Stephen Austin were both born in Virginia. I \nalso would like to thank my esteemed colleague, the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Johnson) for cosponsoring.\n  The 2010 COMPETES reauthorization granted all Federal agencies the \nauthority to hold prize competitions as an incentive for scientific and \ntechnological innovations.\n  This authority supports agencies' increased use of prizes to \nincentivize more high-risk, high-reward research and reach out to a new \naudience of researchers and innovators across all areas of science and \ntechnology.\n  Prize competitions go back at least 300 years, to the 1714 Longitude \nPrize offered by the British Government to develop a practical method \nto precisely measure a ship's longitude. The 1919 Orteig Prize spurred \nCharles Lindbergh to make the first transatlantic flight. Of course, it \ntook 8 years from the prize to the flight itself.\n  In more recent years, prize competitions have accelerated \ntechnological development for space exploration, public health, \nautomobiles, lighting, and much more. Many of these competitions have \nbeen privately sponsored, but several have been sponsored by our \nFederal agencies, including NASA, DARPA, and the Department of Energy.\n  Prize competitions have also proven to be an effective tool to \ninvigorate our Nation's brightest innovators from all corners. They \nallow our science agencies to case a wide net to draw in new talent.\n  I think one of the most interesting facts is that NASA found that \nover 80 percent of NASA prize competitors have never before responded \nto NASA or other government requests for proposals. We are bringing in \nour best and brightest to solve these problems.\n  If we are to continue leading the world in science and technology, we \nmust draw up on all of our Nation's talent, whether they are \nresearchers in a university lab, owners of a technology start-up, or \nindependent innovators working in their own garages.\n  Imagine if more of our Federal science agencies took full advantage \nof the potential of prizes to address some of our Nation's most \npressing technological challenges. How might the world be changed in \n2025 from a prize offered today?\n  Private organizations have spent years perfecting the design of prize \ncompetitions to address big challenges. We hope that our science \nagencies will see this same success, and we must continue to support \nFederal agencies as they implement this authority.\n  The legislation we are considering today addresses some real and some \nperceived hurdles in the 2010 authority that were identified once \nagencies began to implement prize competitions.\n  It also aligns the terminology with the industry standard to \neliminate any confusion in the interpretation of the law. These are \ntechnical amendments, which should make it easier for all agencies to \nmake full use of the 2010 authority. In trying to rebalance our Federal \nbudget, we have had to make very hard choices about where to cut \nfunding, including in R programs.\n  While prize competitions should never be used as an excuse to cut our \ninvestments in R, prizes do allow the Federal Government to continue \nto fund high-reward research with minimal risk to the taxpayer. They \nare another valuable tool for agencies to deploy to meet their critical \nmission responsibilities.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill and ask my colleagues for their \nsupport. I am very grateful for the chairman for his bipartisan \nleadership on this issue.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for reminding me that \nStephen Austin and Samuel Houston were born in Virginia, and I have to \nconfess, I have a number of ancestors who came from Virginia as well, \nand I am told one of them may have even been the Governor of Virginia, \nbut that is as much as I am going to say about the great Commonwealth \ntonight.\n  I will say that I have no other requests for time; and I, again, \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe I misspoke. I would love to acknowledge my \ncolleague from Illinois.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Virginia ask \nunanimous consent to reclaim his time?\n  Mr. BEYER. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I just was going to say I concur and \nagree to yield to the gentleman from Illinois as well.\n  Mr. BEYER. As I slowly develop my mastery of this parliamentary \nprocedure, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Beyer for yielding and for his \nintroduction, his authorship of this bill on prize competitions.\n  I want to add my voice in strong support of this bill. I have long \nbeen a strong supporter of prize competitions to spur innovation not as \na substitute for Federal grants in other aid, but as an additional \ntool.\n  Back in 2007, I wrote language in the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act that directed DOE to create a hydrogen energy prize, a \ncompetition now called the H-Prize that is currently ongoing and, \nhopefully, will yield some results\n\n[[Page H3365]]\n\nin innovation in using hydrogen as a transportation fuel.\n  In the 2010 COMPETES bill, I added language to that bill that \nauthorized prize competitions at the National Science Foundation. I \nbelieve that these prize competitions are an excellent way to unlock \nthe innovative potential of researchers, the private sector, and even \nhobbyists working in a garage, all while protecting taxpayer dollars.\n  This bill will clarify prize competition authority so that more \nagencies of the Federal Government will be able to run competitions. It \nis a good bill. I thank Mr. Beyer, again, for introducing it; I thank \nChairman Smith for moving it and Ranking Member Johnson for moving it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The working \n     group shall be responsible for reviewing Federal regulations \n     affecting research and research universities and making \n     recommendations on how to--\n       (1) harmonize, streamline, and eliminate duplicative \n     Federal regulations and reporting requirements;\n       (2) minimize the regulatory burden on United States \n     institutions of higher education performing federally funded \n     research while maintaining accountability for Federal tax \n     dollars; and\n       (3) identify and update specific regulations to refocus on \n     performance-based goals rather than on process while still \n     meeting the desired outcome.\n       (c) Stakeholder Input.--In carrying out the \n     responsibilities under subsection (b), the working group \n     shall take into account input and recommendations from non-\n     Federal stakeholders, including federally funded and \n     nonfederally funded researchers, institutions of higher \n     education, scientific disciplinary societies and \n     associations, nonprofit research institutions, industry, \n     including small businesses, federally funded research and \n     development centers, and others with a stake in ensuring \n     effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability in the \n     performance of scientific research.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 3 years, \n     the Director shall report to the Committee on Science, Space, \n     and Technology of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate on what steps have been taken to carry out the \n     recommendations of the working group established under \n     subsection (b).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on H.R. 1119, the bill now under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), the Science \nCommittee's Research and Technology Subcommittee chairwoman and the \nsponsor of this legislation.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \n1119, the Research and Development Efficiency Act, which I introduced \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the House Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee, as well as the ranking member of the Research and \nTechnology Subcommittee earlier this year.\n  H.R. 1119 requires the Director of the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy to establish a working group under the National \nScience and Technology Council to review Federal regulations that \naffect research and research universities.\n  The working group is tasked with making recommendations on how to \nharmonize, streamline, and eliminate duplicative Federal regulations \nand reporting requirements and make recommendations on how to minimize \nthe regulatory burden on research institutions.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a long history to support the need for this \nlegislation. In 2012, the National Academies issued a report that \nincluded a key recommendation to ``reduce or eliminate regulations that \nincrease administrative costs, impede research productivity, and \ndeflect creative energy without substantially improving the research \nenvironment.''\n  Last year, the National Science Board referenced the results of two \nFederal Demonstration Partnership surveys on faculty workload--one in \n2005 and one in 2012--that, on average, researchers spend 42 percent of \ntheir time on meeting administrative requirements. This drain on \nresearchers' time and resources to answer Federal regulatory and \nreporting requirements leaves less time for researchers to spend on \nactual scientific work.\n  To be clear, H.R. 1119 does not eliminate reporting requirements, \nbecause there is a need for such information for the purposes of \noversight and transparency. Instead, the bill would initiate the \nprocess that should ultimately help researchers and research \nuniversities by reducing redundant regulations. This is accomplished by \npromoting efficiencies and getting the most out of our research \ninvestments.\n  The National Academies is currently conducting a study of Federal \nregulations and reporting requirements, paying particular attention to \nthose directed at research universities. H.R. 1119 would ensure that \nmore of our Federal research dollars are spent on research and not on \nregulatory requirements. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1119, the Research and Development \nEfficiency Act.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I want to thank \nCongresswoman Comstock and Ranking Member Johnson for their leadership \nin introducing the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all agree that administrative requirements serve an \nimportant purpose. They ensure transparency, the protection of human \nand animal subjects, and the wise use of Federal resources. But \nsometimes they\n\n[[Page H3366]]\n\ngo too far, so we need to find a much better balance than we currently \nhave.\n  The statistic often cited is that federally funded researchers spend \nan average of 42 percent of their time on administrative tasks. That is \ntime and money spent not doing science. It is not an efficient use of \nsome of our Nation's greatest scientific brain power, nor is it an \nefficient use of Federal research funds, especially as Federal spending \nfor R continues to decline as a share of the overall budget.\n  Back in the 112th Congress, the Research Subcommittee, which I served \non as ranking member and which was led by then-Chairman Mo Brooks, held \nan important hearing on this matter to help get the ball rolling, which \neventually led to this bill.\n  H.R. 1119 requires the Office of Science and Technology Policy to \nconvene an interagency working group to review the requirements \ngoverning the conduct of federally funded R at our Nation's research \ninstitutions. The working group is further charged with making \nrecommendations on how to best streamline and harmonize such \nrequirements across the government in order to minimize the \nadministrative burden on universities while maintaining full \naccountability for Federal funds.\n  This administration has long recognized the problems that this bill \naddresses. An interagency working group will not be starting from \nscratch. The Office of Management and Budget took some small steps in \nthe right direction in their recent rewrite of the Federal regulations \ngoverning research grants. Agencies have also taken steps to harmonize \nthe grant proposal process and are exploring additional ways to reduce \nthe paperwork burden associated with grant proposals.\n  I applaud these efforts. Last Congress, I helped further them by \nwriting a letter to OMB, urging them to make some of the reforms they \nhad agreed to. However, there is still room to go. The National \nAcademies have begun a detailed review of administrative burdens on \nfederally funded research. I hope that this review will yield specific \nrecommendations for the agencies on how to proceed. While it may be \npreferable to wait for this report to be published before the \ninteragency committee begins its own work, the Academies' review does \nnot preclude the need for an interagency group.\n  I understand that there may be bureaucratic hurdles to overcome. This \nwill take some time. However, we cannot afford to delay action any \nlonger. The vitality of our Nation's research universities and of our \noverall competitiveness will suffer if we do not reduce the \nadministrative workload on our Nation's scientific talent. H.R. 1119 is \nan important step in that direction.\n  Once again, I want to thank Chairwoman Comstock and Ranking Member \nJohnson of the Research and Technology Subcommittee for introducing \nthis legislation, and I thank Chairman Smith for bringing it to the \nfloor. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairwoman Comstock, Chairman Smith, and \nRanking Member Johnson for moving this bill.\n  I used to be a university researcher. I know of the heavy burdens in \nterms of administrative tasks that need to be done. I would say some of \nthese are absolutely necessary, but we now know that we can reduce the \nburden without reducing the protections that they provide. I am very \nhappy to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, really quickly, I want to thank Mrs. \nComstock for introducing this bill and Mr. Lipinski for cosponsoring \nit. As well, it is a great bipartisan piece of legislation, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend \nthe rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1119, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3366-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3366-H3367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COOPERATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 1156) to authorize the establishment of a body under the \nNational Science and Technology Council to identify and coordinate \ninternational science and technology cooperation opportunities, as \namended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 1156, the International Science and Technology Cooperation Act \nof 2015, directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to \nestablish a working group to identify and coordinate international \nscience and technology efforts to strengthen the U.S. research \nenterprise.\n\n[[Page H3367]]\n\n  I thank the ranking member of the Research and Technology \nSubcommittee, Mr. Lipinski, for introducing this bill. I also thank the \nsubcommittee's vice chair, Mr. Moolenaar, the ranking member of the \nfull committee, Ms. Johnson, as well as our colleagues Mr. Hultgren, \nMs. Esty, and Mr. Swalwell for being bipartisan cosponsors.\n  The Office of Science and Technology Policy, in coordination with the \nState Department, represents the United States in bilateral and \nmultilateral meetings with foreign nations. It works closely with \ngovernment science agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and \nindependent research and scientific institutions to promote science and \ntechnology initiatives and to strengthen global science cooperation.\n  H.R. 1156 improves our Nation's collaborative efforts with \ninternational partners on scientific issues. While many Federal \nagencies are engaged with international partners on science and \ntechnology projects, there is a need to coordinate these projects \nacross the Federal Government. Better collaboration with our partners \nwill strengthen U.S. scientific activities and further promote the free \nexchange of ideas with other nations. Interagency coordination ensures \nthat taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and that U.S. priorities are \nconsistently addressed when working with our international partners on \nscience and technology issues.\n  Science and technology research addresses some of the major \nchallenges that face our Nation, including public health, energy \nproduction, national security, and economic development. Coordinated \ninternational collaboration on scientific issues, which H.R. 1156 \npromotes, also will improve economic and national security and support \nU.S. foreign policy goals.\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Lipinski for his continued hard work on \nthis issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1156, the International Science and \nTechnology Cooperation Act, which I reintroduced earlier this year.\n  A similar bill, which I authored in the last Congress, passed the \nHouse with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 346-41. I am \nhopeful that we can do the same this week and then work to get this \nbill through the Senate and onto the President's desk.\n  I want to thank Mr. Moolenaar for cosponsoring this bill with me, and \nI thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson for helping advance \nit through the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and for getting \nit to the House floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, the laws of science know no political boundaries. While \nthe United States arguably has the most brilliant scientists in the \nworld and has developed some of the greatest technology, no country has \na monopoly on great minds in science and technology. So, if we want to \nadvance science in ways that benefit Americans and the rest of the \nworld, we need to encourage international collaboration.\n  Improvements in areas such as energy security, infectious diseases, \nspace exploration, telecommunications and the Internet, and many more \nare due, in part, to international cooperation, to the benefit of all \nnations involved. By collaborating with international partnerships on \nscience, we also strengthen the U.S. scientific enterprise, which helps \nus get the best return on our research investment.\n  In addition, international collaborations make possible research \nendeavors on a grander scale than the U.S. can accomplish on its own. \nFor example, CERN, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National \nScience Foundation signed a cooperative agreement 2 weeks ago expanding \ntheir collaboration on particle physics. Not only will this provide for \nour scientists to continue work at the highest energy accelerator in \nthe world at CERN, it will also allow CERN to provide equipment to an \nupcoming neutrino experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois.\n  CERN was the site of one of the most significant technological \nadvances that impacts us every day. At CERN in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee \nwas working on the problem of allowing international researchers to see \ndata instantaneously around the globe. The solution that was developed \nwas the World Wide Web, which has completely transformed the way we \ncommunicate and get information today.\n  H.R. 1156 makes more collaborations like this possible. It requires \nthe National Science and Technology Council at the White House to \ncontinue to maintain a working group to coordinate the U.S. interagency \nstrategy for international science and technology cooperation. Many \nFederal agencies already work with international counterparts on \nscientific and technological issues, but, until recently, there was no \ncoordinating body to identify new partnerships and to fully leverage \nexisting collaborations.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important that we find ways to collaborate with \nother countries on scientific discoveries that push the boundaries of \nknowledge and improve our lives. This bill will do that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman for his support on this. As I \nsaid, we have passed this bill before with wide bipartisan support. I \nam very hopeful we can do that again today.\n  International cooperation is very critical to doing more than we \nalone can do. We have, arguably, the best researchers in the world, \nproducing the most advanced technology, but in working together with \nothers, we can do even more than we have. The impact that it can have \non the everyday lives of Americans is tremendous, so I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas, \nChairman Smith, for his continued leadership on the Committee on \nScience, Space, and Technology.\n  H.R. 1561, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of \n2015, prioritizes the protection of life and property at the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration by focusing research and \ncomputing resources on improving weather forecasting, quantitative \nobserving data planning, Next Generation modeling, and an emphasis on \nresearch to operations technology transfer.\n  I echo Chairman Smith's concerns that severe weather greatly affects \nlarge parts of the country, and as a Representative from Oklahoma, I \nunderstand the need for improvement firsthand. In 2013, the deadly \nstorms in my home State were a stark reminder that we can do better to \npredict severe weather events and provide longer lead times to protect \nAmericans in harm's way.\n  I am proud that this legislation has a dedicated tornado warning \nimprovement Program. The goal of this program is to reduce the loss \nfrom tornadoes by advancing the understanding of fundamental \nmeteorological science, allowing detection and notifications that are \nmore accurate, effective, and timely.\n  Constituents in my home State will benefit greatly from longer \ntornado warning lead times, which will save lives and better protect \nproperty. H.R. 1561 makes clear that NOAA will prioritize weather \nresearch and protect lives and property through a focused, affordable, \nattainable, and forward-looking research plan at the agency's research \noffice.\n  This bill also helps encourage innovation and new capacities \ndeveloped through NOAA's Weather Research Program, like creating a \njoint technology transfer from the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric \nResearch. This transfer is essential to get new forecasting models and \ntechnologies out of the research side of NOAA and into our operational \nforecast.\n  This bill directs NOAA to develop plans to restore our country's \nleadership in weather forecasting. It is no secret that many people in \nour weather community are distraught that our forecasting capacities \nhave deteriorated in recent years. While other countries are making \ngreat strides in weather advancements, Americans are paying the price \nfor lost leadership with their lives and their wallets. This is another \nreminder that we can do better.\n  This bill prompts NOAA to actively consider new commercial data and \nprivate sector solutions to further enhance our weather forecasting \ncapacities. This legislation includes a pilot program which will \nprovide NOAA a clear and credible demonstration of the valuable data \nfrom commercial technologies available today.\n  This legislation is substantially similar to last year's bipartisan \nWeather Forecasting Improvement Act, which passed the House by a voice \nvote. The bill before us today updates authorization numbers to reflect \ncurrent spending levels, adjusts dates to reflect current operating \nstatus, and incorporates minor additions and technical changes to \nimprove the bill's clarity and intent.\n  This legislation is the result of a bipartisan agreement last year \nand again this year. I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nBridenstine), the Subcommittee on Environment chairman, for his active \nleadership on this issue in the last Congress and for getting us here \ntoday.\n  I also want to thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nEnvironment, the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), for her \nefforts in crafting a bipartisan agreement and joining in this most \nworthwhile initiative to save American lives and property through \nbetter weather forecasting.\n  Finally, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act has \nreceived numerous letters of support which I would like to mention, \nincluding letters from Utah State University, Space Environment \nTechnologies, Metro Weather, Utah Science Technology and Research \nInitiative.\n\n[[Page H3371]]\n\n  Once again, it is a good bill. It has been worked on diligently. We \nneed to pass it.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1561, the Weather Research and Forecasting \nInnovation Act of 2015. This bill, introduced by my friend, Mr. Lucas, \nbuilds on the work that subcommittee chairman Mr. Bridenstine and \nformer subcommittee chairman Mr. Stewart and I did in the last \nCongress.\n  The language before us today is the result of a truly bipartisan \neffort with extensive discussions and negotiations across the aisle. \nAlthough the bill is not perfect, it is a good bill and a better bill \nthan the one that passed in the last Congress, and I ask all my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has many \nimportant tasks at the cutting edge of science and service. The \nagency's responsibilities for weather forecasting are critical to our \ncountry.\n  We are proud of the good work of NOAA and its dedicated employees. \nThey are a committed workforce, responsible for keeping our communities \nsafe during inclement weather.\n  But with the increasing frequency of severe weather events, there can \nand should be improvements in weather forecasting. For example, \nforecasts can be more precise regarding what will happen and when. \nForecasts can provide more lead time, especially of severe weather \nevents, to allow people to prepare. Forecast information can be \ncommunicated more effectively to the public and those in harm's way so \nwe can reduce the loss of life and property.\n  This bill is designed to make sure that NOAA achieves these important \ngoals. H.R. 1561 draws upon the model of innovation used by the \nmilitary services where researchers work hand in hand with those on the \nfront lines to develop innovations that have real-world practical \nreturns.\n  The bill connects the research side of NOAA, the Office of Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Research, more effectively with the forecasting needs \nof the National Weather Service. The bill contains several provisions \nthat will improve interactions and information sharing between OAR and \nNWS. It also establishes new ways for NOAA to hear from and work with \nthe broader research and private weather communities.\n  NOAA is not the only agency that researches weather or has \nresponsibility for communicating forecast information, so the bill \nestablishes interagency coordination, through the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy, across the agencies that have these \nresponsibilities. This coordination will leverage our limited resources \nand more rapidly spread the adoption of best tools and practices across \nagencies.\n  H.R. 1561 recognizes that the best forecasts in the world will not \nfully serve the public's needs unless we have an effective \ncommunications system. The bill directs NOAA to do more research, \nlisten to experts, and improve its risk communication techniques. The \nbill also reestablishes a program that allows NOAA to make awards to \npeople who save the lives of others through reliance on NOAA's Weather \nRadio All Hazards program.\n  This bill also establishes a pilot program at NOAA to look to the \ncommercial sector for weather forecasting data. This is an overdue \neffort to ensure that Federal dollars are spent effectively and \nleveraged appropriately.\n  Additionally, the bill requires NOAA to run simulations of the effect \nof different configurations of instruments and datasets on forecasting \naccuracy so the agency can look at the benefits and costs of different \narrays of sensors. It is important to make sure that these requirements \nare not too prescriptive so that NOAA is able to use the most \nefficient, accurate, and cost-effective model for the situation. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on \nhow we can make these provisions work well.\n  In summary, the changes in this bill will bring about advances that \nresult in better development and deployment of forecast innovations and \ntechnology. Importantly, most of these changes are coming at little or \nno cost. The bill is focused on changes to internal processes rather \nthan simply spending more money. To the degree that the bill does \nexpand the agency's authorization for weather research, it is done in \nline with anticipated needs in this area.\n  Again, I want to thank the Members on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir input and support. I am particularly grateful to Ms. Johnson for \nher support during negotiations as well as Mr. Lucas and Mr. \nBridenstine. Also, I want to thank the hard-working staff on both sides \nof the aisle for their efforts to keep coming back to the table and \nhelping to move this forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, we also received many letters of support for H.R. 1561 \nfrom more than 20 different organizations, including the Weather \nCoalition; the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which \nrepresents more than 100 research institutions; the Global Weather \nCorporation; the American Weather and Climate Industry Association; the \nAmerican Commercial Space Weather Association; and many others. \nAdditionally, we received letters of support from a number of \nindividuals who serve on the Environmental Information Services Working \nGroup, which is one of NOAA's scientific advisory bodies.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the \ngentlewoman from Oregon for her work on this bill. She has been a \nstrong advocate and an initiator on the benefits that this bill does \npromote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine), the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEnvironment of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to just echo the comments \nof my colleague from Oklahoma, the vice chairman of the Committee on \nScience, Space, and Technology, Mr. Lucas, and of course the ranking \nmember, Ms. Bonamici. I think your summation of this bill is right on \ntarget.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to attest that H.R. 1561, the Weather \nResearch and Forecasting Innovation Act, is the very first step in what \nwill lead us to a day when we have zero deaths from tornadoes. I want \nto repeat that. This is the very first step of what is necessary to \nmove us to a day where we have zero deaths from tornadoes. Those of us \nfrom the great State of Oklahoma understand this all too well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to first thank Chairman Smith, Vice \nChairman Lucas, and the Subcommittee on Environment Ranking Member \nBonamici for their tireless efforts to see this bipartisan legislation \nmove forward.\n  The burgeoning commercial private sector for space-based weather data \nand aviation-based weather data has voiced its support for this \nlegislation. I would like to mention letters to the Committee on \nScience, Space, and Technology from PlanetiQ, Tempus Global Data, \nPanasonic Avionics Corporation, GeoOptics, and Spire Global.\n  H.R. 1561 builds on the foundation laid by my House-passed Weather \nForecasting Improvement Act from last Congress and directs NOAA to \nprioritize activities that will save lives and protect property. This \nis critically important to my State, which is in the heart of Tornado \nAlley.\n  In fact, I just went home for the weekend. Saturday night, about \nmidnight, all of the tornado sirens started going off. My wife and I \ngot up. We got our kids out of bed. We brought them downstairs. We set \nup their beds in my closet. My wife and I turned on the TV, and we \nsurfed the Internet trying to find out where the tornadoes were and \nwhere they were touching down.\n  This is critically important, and I am sure my experience this \nweekend, which is not unique to this weekend, is also an experience by \nmany of my constituents and others throughout the State of Oklahoma. We \nmust do all we can to improve our ability to predict the weather.\n  H.R. 1561 will help NOAA to develop more accurate and timely warnings \nfor not only tornadoes, but also hurricanes and other high-impact \nweather events. It calls on NOAA to develop a plan to regain and \nmaintain our forecasting capabilities that are second to none in the \nworld because right now we, unfortunately, are lagging behind our \ncounterparts in Europe, the U.K., and Canada. The bill encourages \nbetter cooperation across NOAA offices and enhances collaboration with \nuniversities such as the University of Oklahoma,\n\n[[Page H3372]]\n\nwhich is a national leader in weather research.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am particularly proud of a new section in this year's \nversion that we have worked closely with industry, NOAA, and other \nMembers of Congress to include. H.R. 1561 authorizes a pilot program \nfor NOAA to purchase commercial space-based weather data and test it \nagainst NOAA's proprietary data. It also calls on NOAA to publish \nstandards it expects from any purchased data from the commercial \nsector.\n  Mr. Speaker, this has the potential to be a major paradigm shift \nprovision. This is the first step towards changing the business model. \nI believe we need to change the business model, moving to a day where \nthe government does not purchase, own, and operate huge monolithic \nbillion-dollar satellites but, rather, utilizes the innovation of the \nprivate sector to provide the data necessary to feed our data \nassimilation systems and our numerical weather models.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  This will ultimately allow NOAA to focus its resources on the \nresearch and development necessary to improve our modeling \ncapabilities, computing capacity, and warning lead times outlined in \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe there will come a time when there will be zero \ndeaths from tornados. I think this bill will help us implement the \nnecessary steps to get there.\n  I, once again, thank my colleagues on the Science Committee for all \ntheir hard work, and I look forward to working with our counterparts in \nthe Senate to move this legislation to the President's desk.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1561 has received overwhelming \nsupport from the weather enterprise and industry. I would like to \nmention letters of support from AccuWeather, The Weather Company, \nScience and Technology Corporation, and Carmel Research Center as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will insert in the Record a full list of the 25 \nletters of support the Science Committee received for this legislation.\n\nLetters of Support for H.R. 1561--The Weather Research and Forecasting \n                         Innovation Act of 2015\n\n\n                               Companies\n\n       AccuWeather, American Commercial Space Weather Association, \n     Atmospheric & Space Technology Research Associates, American \n     Weather and Climate Industry Association, Carmel Research \n     Center, GeoOptics, Global Weather Corporation, MetraWeather, \n     Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Planet IQ.\n       Space Environment Technologies, Spire Global, Science \n     Technology Corporation, Tempus Global Data, The Weather \n     Company, University Corporation of Atmospheric Research, Utah \n     Science Technology and Research Initiative, Utah State \n     University, Weather Coalition, Weather Decision Technologies.\n\n\n Individual Members of the Environmental Information Services Working \n                                 Group\n\n       Walt Dabbert--Vaisala, Philip Ardanuy--Raytheon, Waren \n     Qualley--Harris, Jean Vieux--Vieux Hydrology, Julie Winkler--\n     Michigan State University.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other request for time, \nbut I just want to thank the three original cosponsors we have on the \nfloor tonight--Mr. Lucas, Mr. Bridenstine, and Ms. Bonamici--for \nsponsoring such an important piece of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, let me say, again, that this is a good \nbill that will improve weather forecasting innovation and services.\n  The results of the changes contained in this legislation? The public \nwill be safer because of more timely and more accurate forecasts that \nwill protect lives and property. We will also be growing our economy \nand creating jobs through this bill.\n  Researchers have found that annual variations in weather can produce \nbillions of dollars in reduced U.S. gross domestic product. With stakes \nthat large, we owe it to our Nation to improve weather forecasting.\n  H.R. 1561 takes intelligent steps to support NOAA and to drive needed \nchange in how we harness research to forecasting needs.\n  Again, I want to thank the many leaders in the research community and \nthe private weather sector who provided advice to the committee as we \nworked on this bill. I also want to extend my appreciation to the Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, Dr. Kathy Sullivan, \nfor her cooperation and advice.\n  I will continue working with my colleagues across the aisle and in \nthe other body until we have a good, final bill. Again, I thank my \ncosponsors, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nH.R. 1561, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015.\n  I want to take a moment to acknowledge that getting to where we are \ntoday was not easy. This is an update to a bill the House passed two \nyears ago, and we have spent several months in this Congress \nnegotiating over how to rework that legislation.\n  I want to especially recognize the efforts of Environment \nSubcommittee Chairman Jim Bridenstine and Ranking Member Suzanne \nBonamici as well as the bill's sponsor, Mr. Lucas. Their leadership and \ncommitment has really driven this process forward. Today's bill is a \ntestament to their dedication and represents one very positive step \nforward on the long and continuous road to improving the American \nweather forecasting system.\n  America has some of the most diverse and dangerous weather events of \nany country. From my home state of Texas, all the way to Maine, \nhurricanes and tropical storms annually batter our coasts. Likewise, \nthe central portions of our country, from Texas to Illinois are the \nmost tornado prone areas in the entire world.\n  Unfortunately, all you've had to do over the last few weeks is pick \nup a newspaper or turn on the television to see the true impact \ntornadoes can have on American families. To help our citizens cope with \nthese potentially devastating events, we need to have the very best \nweather forecasting and warning capabilities.\n  The National Weather Service and the Office of Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Research at NOAA play a central role in protecting the \nlives and property of every American.\n  The bill before us today will help accelerate innovation and the \ntransition of cutting-edge weather research into essential weather \nforecasting tools and products.\n  The legislation accomplishes this goal by breaking down the barriers \nthat exist between the weather research community, our nation's \nforecasters, and the private-sector weather enterprise. Improving \ncollaboration and cooperation within NOAA, but also between the agency \nand the broader weather community will extend the accuracy and timing \nof our weather predictions. Such improvements will ultimately save \nlives and make our communities safer.\n  Mr. Speaker, the weather is a central part of everyday life and \nresiliency to severe weather events is an important part of \nstrengthening the nation's economic security. H.R. 1561 will advance \nour weather forecasting capabilities and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its passage.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 1561, ``The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of \n2015,'' will greatly improve our severe weather forecasting \ncapabilities. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, the Vice \nChairman of the Science Committee, for introducing this bill.\n  Severe weather routinely affects large portions of the United States. \nThis year we already have seen the devastating effects of tornados \nacross our country, especially in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, \nAlabama, and Mississippi among other states.\n  The deaths and the damage from severe weather underscore our need for \na world-class weather prediction system that helps protect American \nlives and property.\n  Unfortunately, our leadership has slipped in severe weather \nforecasting. European weather models routinely predict America's \nweather better than we do. We need to make up for lost ground.\n  H.R. 1561 improves weather observation systems and next generation \nmodeling capabilities.\n  This bill prioritizes weather research at the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) research agency. This will \nimprove forecasts and warnings.\n  It prompts NOAA to actively engage new commercial data and private \nsector weather solutions through a corrimercial weather data pilot \nproject.\n  The bill requires a cost-benefit analyses for the procurement of \nobserving system data.\n  It increases forecast warning lead times for tornadoes and \nhurricanes. And it creates a joint technology transfer fund in NOAA's \nOffice of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research to help speed technologies \ndeveloped through NOAA's weather research into operation.\n\n[[Page H3373]]\n\n  The enhanced prediction of major storms is of great importance to \nprotecting the public from injury and loss of property.\n  In addition to Mr. Lucas, I also want to thank the Chairman of the \nEnvironment Subcommittee, the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Bridenstine, \nand the Environment Subcommittee Ranking Member, the gentlewoman from \nOregon, Ms. Bonamici, for their sponsorship of this bipartisan bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1561, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3373-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3373-H3377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY LABORATORY MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER \n                              ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas.

Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, H-204 of the \n         Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the \n     American Energy Innovation Council (AEIC), we write to urge \n     the prompt consideration of H.R. 1158 Department of Energy \n     Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act. Similar \n     legislation (H.R. 5120) easily passed the House during the \n     last Congress. The bill enjoys strong bipartisan support and \n     was co-sponsored by both Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) and \n     Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) of the Committee \n     on Science, Space and Technology.\n       The AEIC is a group of America's top business executives \n     who came together starting in 2010 to recommend ways to \n     promote American innovation in clean energy technology. We \n     are united in our belief that technology innovation--\n     especially in energy--is at the heart of many of the central \n     economic, national security, competitiveness, and \n     environmental challenges facing our nation. We believe strong \n     support for robust, public investments in energy innovation \n     is critical to a vibrant American economy.\n       H.R. 1158 gives the National Labs needed flexibility to \n     enter into more effective partnerships with businesses and \n     universities, particularly with respect to early-stage \n     technology demonstration. We anticipate that H.R. 1158 will \n     unlock more private investment in clean energy technology \n     R, and we endorse this bill.\n       Accelerating technology innovation is a smart investment \n     for America's future. We look forward to working with you to \n     once again secure House passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chad Holliday,\n       Co-Chair, American Energy Innovation Council.\n     Norm Augustine,\n       Co-Chair, American Energy Innovation Council.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    Third Way,\n\n                                                    March 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Randy Hultgren,\n     Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ed Perlmutter,\n     Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Hultgren and Congressman Perlmutter, we \n     write in support of H.R. 1158, the Department of Energy (DOE) \n     Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2015. \n     It is critical that the United States maximizes the ability \n     of our national labs to partner with the private sector to \n     develop and commercialize new energy technologies, \n     particularly around advanced nuclear power. Your bipartisan \n     bill, which has been approved by the Committee and sent to \n     the House, will begin a vital assessment of the labs' \n     capabilities and offer ways to get the best return on \n     taxpayers' investment in energy innovation.\n       The world faces a profound paradox: ever-increasing global \n     energy demand and the need to dramatically reduce carbon \n     emissions. That's why Third Way strongly believes that the \n     development of advanced nuclear reactors is critical. With \n     dozens of reactor projects underway in the United States, \n     this country has the opportunity to create enormous economic, \n     national security, and environmental benefits if we can \n     provide the right platform for private companies to develop \n     and commercialize these advanced nuclear technologies. \n     Public-private partnerships of the type envisioned in your \n     legislation can help industry to transcend some of the \n     technological and regulatory barriers it faces and bring this \n     promising energy source to market\n       We applaud your leadership in the sponsorship of this bill. \n     There is pent-up demand in the private sector to work with \n     the national labs to develop innovative advanced nuclear, \n     carbon capture, and other energy solutions. H.R. 1158 is a \n     very important step to ensure that happens. We look forward \n     to supporting it as it moves through the House and Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Josh Freed,\n     Vice President for the Clean Energy Program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Nuclear Society,\n\n                               La Grange Park, IL, March 23, 2015.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space & Technology, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space & Technology, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Johnson: I write on \n     behalf of the 11,000 members of the American Nuclear Society \n     to express our support for H.R. 1158, the Department of \n     Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act \n     of 2015.\n       We appreciate your efforts to harness the intellectual \n     assets of our national laboratories through broader \n     technology commercialization and public-private partnership \n     initiatives. We are especially grateful for Section 104 which \n     directs the Department of Energy to assess its ability to \n     ``incubate'' privately-funded advanced research and test \n     reactor prototypes at national laboratories.\n       ANS strongly supports expanded federal engagement in \n     advanced, non-light water nuclear research and development. \n     It is becoming increasingly clear that the U.S. and the world \n     will need to significantly expand its nuclear generating \n     capacity in the coming decades to address growing energy \n     demands while reducing harmful emissions.\n       Historically, the U.S. led the world in developing new \n     reactor technology. However, several other nations, including \n     Russia and China, have moved aggressively to develop so-\n     called Generation IV reactors which offer distinct advantages \n     over their light water counterparts. As such, the U.S. must \n     recommit itself to improving its advanced reactor technology \n     portfolio in order to maintain its influence over global \n     nuclear safety and nonproliferation norms. This legislation, \n     if enacted, would provide needed support toward that \n     objective.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael Brady Raap,\n                              President, American Nuclear Society.\n\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished \nchairman, Mr. Smith, as well as the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nPerlmutter) for helping bring this legislation to the floor again this \nCongress.\n  H.R. 1158, the Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and \nTechnology Transfer Act, ensures that the Department of Energy has the \ntools it needs to allow new startups, small businesses, universities, \nand the general public at large to do what they do best: react to \nmarket signals and innovate.\n  The Federal Government and the national labs play a vital role doing \nthe basic research needed to maintain America's position as a safe and \ninnovative nation. Their ability to build large research tools at our \nuser facilities is the crown jewel in our Nation's research \ncapabilities. This is the model other nations, like China, are copying.\n  Far too often, however, the discoveries made in our labs get stuck in \nthe labs. This is due to a number of reasons, and this bill seeks to \nbreak down some of the barriers that make this happen.\n  Many of these problems are also outlined in chapter three of the \n``Interim Report of the Commission to Review the Effectiveness of the \nNational Energy Laboratories.''\n  I quote from the report: ``Over 50 prior studies and reports \npublished over the past 40 years detail shortcomings in the \nrelationship between the DOE and its laboratories.''\n  It continues:\n\n       They present a strikingly consistent pattern of criticism \n     and recommendations for improvement.\n\n  The committee and I have reviewed many of these prior reports, and \nthis bill attempts to act on a few of these consistent, \nnoncontroversial recommendations.\n  By extending the pilot for ACT agreements within DOE, the labs are \ngiven the ability to negotiate more flexible contracts with non-Federal \nentities that would like to take the labs' research and turn it into \nviable products.\n  Section 201 in the bill also allows researchers using Federal funds \nto enter into these agreements, so long as any Federal funds are used \nexclusively for their intended research purposes.\n  Section 203 of the bill will continue to chip away at what many call \nthe valley of death, what many startups never make it through because \nthey cannot prove their concept.\n  This section would allow DOE to use their tech transfer funds for \nearly-stage, precommercial proof of concept demonstrations so the \nprivate sector can finally pick up technologies and develop them with \nprivate funds. This legislation would also grant to the directors of \nnational labs the signature authority for many agreements with non-\nFederal entities.\n  These are decisions that the Secretary of Energy must make under \ncurrent law, meaning decisions a lab director can make over a phone \ncall in the course of a day must weave their way through the agency's \nbureaucracy before it lands on the Secretary's desk.\n  This bill also seeks to improve the Department's relationship with \nsmall businesses that can take part in the SBIR-STTR program, and it \nencourages the Secretary to enter into agreement with the I-Corps \nprogram at NSF.\n  While I do understand that DOE has begun a similar pilot, called Lab \nCorps, I am worried that this pilot housed in EERE is so narrow in \nfocus that it will\n\n[[Page H3376]]\n\nnot be applicable for most of our labs' advancement. An accelerator \ntechnology being developed for medical treatments, for instance, would \nnot be able to access the current pilot.\n  Section 103 of this legislation will also require DOE to undertake an \nhonest assessment of its capabilities to authorize, host, and oversee \nprototype reactors at DOE sites. This is a critical issue for the \nUnited States' position as a nuclear technology leader. The United \nStates has not hosted a new research reactor in decades, and there are \nnot any current applications under review at the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. has become so risk averse that we have \nregulated ourselves out of business for building the concept reactors \nthat might some day lead to commercially deployable, safer, and more \nefficient nuclear technologies. We are driving companies overseas. I \nlook forward to seeing the results of this report from DOE.\n  Our national labs have been at the cutting edge of technological \ndevelopment, and we must always ensure that it is in the national \ninterest. This bill helps to ensure that is the case because a \ndiscovery lost in the labs is a discovery wasted.\n  That is why I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1158, the Department of Energy \nLaboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2015.\n  I would like to thank Mr. Hultgren, Mr. Perlmutter, and my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle for working together to produce a strong \nbipartisan bill. I would like to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking \nMember Johnson for getting this bill through committee and to the floor \nhere tonight.\n  DOE's national labs are responsible for some of the greatest research \nbeing conducted in the world, both basic and applied. Some of this \nresearch has great potential to become new commercial technologies if \nour labs provide the type of support that increases the likelihood of \ntechnology transfer.\n  This could have enormous beneficial impacts for our Nation, not just \nin new technologies, but by making the most of our investments at these \nlabs. That is why improving technology transfer from American research \nfacilities, both national labs and universities, has been one of my top \npriorities on the Science Committee for the past decade.\n  H.R. 1158 ensures that our national labs have the resources needed to \nfacilitate the transfer of new technologies to the private sector. It \ngreatly increases the breadth of companies that are eligible to engage \nin a new pilot program that provides for more flexible partnerships, \nsimilar to those in the private sector, and lengthens the program for 2 \nyears. This was an important issue that came up at a hearing 2 years \nago, and I am happy that we are getting that done in this bill.\n  This bill also empowers labs to utilize technology transfer funds on \nprojects that demonstrate commercial applications for their research \nand technologies, and it asks the Department of Energy for a report on \nactivities related to the congressionally mandated technology \ncommercialization fund which the Department is implementing through the \nnewly formed Office of Technology Transitions.\n  I personally asked Secretary Moniz about past use of this fund, and \nso I am pleased by the recent actions of DOE in the direction of the \nTCF at this time. This bill has impacts beyond labs as well. It would \nsignificantly decrease financial obstacles that prevent nonprofit \nresearch organizations, including many universities, from working with \nthe Department.\n  The bill includes language that I wrote that would make the National \nScience Foundation's highly successful Innovation Corps Program, which \npairs up grant recipients with motivated entrepreneurs to help get \ntheir ideas in the commercial arena, available to the DOE through a \npartnership with the NSF.\n  Finally, the bill ensures that effective reporting and accountability \nsystems are in place so we are able to clearly determine the \nperformance of these new tools, as well as any further steps that will \nneed to be taken.\n  Mr. Speaker, the innovations that have come out of DOE's national \nlaboratories and research programs are second to none. Argonne National \nLab, which is located in my district, is one of the best.\n  All these federally funded institutions and initiatives have been a \ncritical component of our knowledge-based economy, and this bill will \nensure that they not only continue, but they improve their incredible \ntrack record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have no other requests for time \non this, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Perlmutter).\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Lipinski for \nhis work on this bill and for yielding me this time.\n  I rise today to support H.R. 1158, the Department of Energy \nLaboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act. I want to thank \nmy friend from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) for sponsoring this bill and \nworking with me and our colleagues on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  This legislation provides tools to spur and accelerate the transfer \nof new technologies developed at our national labs. It extends the \nAgreements for Commercializing Technology, or ACT, pilot program for 2 \nmore years and also significantly broadens the range of companies able \nto participate in the program, allowing for more flexible partnership \nagreements.\n  The bill will allow labs to use their technology to transfer funds \nfor activities which identify and demonstrate commercial opportunities \nfor their research and technologies.\n  This legislation also removes burdens which currently prevent many \nuniversities and other nonprofit research institutions from working \nwith the Department of Energy. This will encourage further \ncollaboration between university researchers across the country and our \nwealth of knowledge at the national labs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent Golden, Colorado, and the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory. Quite simply, NREL is the premier energy efficiency \nand renewable energy lab in the world. For more than 40 years, NREL has \nled the charge in research and design of renewable energy products \ndirectly affecting the way we utilize and secure American energy.\n  This bill will help provide labs like NREL with important tools so \nthey can best lead our country's research on renewable and sustainable \nforms of energy and transportation and, ultimately, bring these life-\nchanging innovations to consumers. I have seen the great work being \ndone at NREL, and I know this great work is happening at other national \nlabs all across the country.\n  Last year, DOE signed an agreement for commercializing technology \nwith the Wells Fargo Foundation to utilize NREL and other DOE national \nlabs to further research in energy-efficient buildings-related \ntechnologies, and this bill allows that agreement to be extended for at \nleast 2 more years.\n  DOE's 17 national laboratories and research programs have been the \nbirthplace to some of our most revolutionary technologies. When this \nresearch is harnessed by entrepreneurs and business leaders, startups \nwith one or two employees can grow into companies employing dozens, if \nnot hundreds, of people.\n  We want to make sure these federally funded institutions and \ninitiatives remain an important foundation of our knowledge-based \neconomy. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan \nlegislation with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), giving \nscientists and researchers in both the public and private sector tools \nand freedom they need to unlock a new wave of innovation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Hultgren and Mr. \nPerlmutter for their leadership on this important issue.\n  This bill helps foster opportunities for entrepreneurs to more easily \naccess technologies coming out of the Department of Energy and connect \nthe brilliant minds to the equally brilliant\n\n[[Page H3377]]\n\nminds in the private sector who can then commercialize this technology.\n  Federal R is responsible for many of the industries and \ntechnologies that now drive our national wealth--the most earth-\nshattering example, the Internet, developed by government scientists at \nDARPA.\n  Federal research spawned the biotech and semiconductor industries; \ngave us tools like the laser, GPS, and MRI; and, through the World Wide \nWeb and the Internet, has entirely changed the way we find a \nrestaurant, talk to our children, and sell cars.\n  The role of the private sector in developing technology is vital, and \ngovernment must lead the way in innovation, providing the patient \ncapital necessary to perform research without any known commercial \napplication or concern for profit.\n  I am reminded of the fascinating idea that mathematicians who develop \nthings in their heads, in their offices, with no application to \nanything, so often, within weeks, will find that that mathematical new \nidea applies to real-life situations.\n  Einstein marveled at the power of pure mathematics, and he said, \n``How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human \nthought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate \nto the objects of reality?''\n  In 1959, the physicist Eugene Wigner described this problem as ``the \nunreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.''\n  H.R. 1158 helps bring these pieces together, mathematics, physics, \nchemistry, biology, and technology; and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Thank you, Chairman Smith, Mr. Hultgren, and Mr. Perlmutter.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I wrap up on the bill we are debating right now, \nI just wanted to thank Chairman Smith for his work on this, along with \nRanking Member Johnson. Working together, we were able to get these \nbills done here on the floor tonight.\n  I know that tomorrow we will have a little bit more of a contentious \ndebate on a bill coming out of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee; but I just wanted to, again, commend the chairman and \nRanking Member Johnson for our work together on these bills.\n  We know there are important things that we can get done and we need \nto get done and will be very helpful to our Nation, and I am glad that \nwe were able to do those things on these bills that we have brought \nforward here tonight, a good bipartisan mix of bills showing bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by asking my colleagues to support \nH.R. 1158, the Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and \nTechnology Transfer Act.\n  I want to thank Mr. Hultgren and Mr. Perlmutter for their work on \nthis bill. I think there are many things that we can't even see right \nnow that will come out of this, but I am certain that our national labs \nand the great value that they are to our Nation will continue, and this \nwill allow them to continue to not only do their research, but to do an \neven better job of producing new technologies that will be a great \nbenefit to all of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1158, the Department of Energy \nLaboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2015, enables \nthe Department of Energy (DOE) to better form partnerships with non-\nfederal entities and transfer research to the private sector.\n  I thank the gentleman from Illinois, Rep. Randy Hultgren, for his \ninitiative on this issue, and the gentleman from Colorado, Rep. Ed \nPerlmutter, for it cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  The Department of Energy is the largest federal supporter of basic \nresearch and development and sponsors 47 percent of federal basic \nresearch in the physical sciences.\n  The Department's science and energy research is conducted at over 300 \nsites nationwide. More than 31,000 researchers take advantage of DOE \nuser facilities each year.\n  This includes the Department's 17 National Labs, which provide the \nfoundation for the Department of Energy's research and development \ninfrastructure.\n  These labs keep America at the forefront of global technological \ncapabilities. They ensure that we continue to conduct critical research \nin high energy physics, advanced scientific computing, biological and \nenvironmental research, nuclear physics, fusion energy sciences, basic \nenergy sciences, and applied energy research and development in fossil, \nnuclear and renewable energy.\n  The innovative early stage research performed at the labs can have \ngreat value for the private sector, but often goes unnoticed.\n  Because of a communication gap between the labs and the private \nsector, ideas and technology are often slow to reach the market. And \nfederal government red tape discourages the private sector from using \nthe unique state-of-the-art facilities the national labs offer.\n  This bill grants lab directors signature authority for agreements \nwith private sector entities valued at less than $1 million. And it \nextends a pilot program that allows for more flexible contract terms \nbetween companies and lab operators.\n  This bill also requires DOE to assess its capability to authorize, \nhost, and oversee privately funded fusion research and next generation \nfission reactor prototypes.\n  Due to regulatory uncertainty from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nthe private sector currently has little incentive or ability to build \nreactor prototypes.\n  This legislation represents a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to \nmodernize and increase the productivity of the DOE national lab system.\n  I again thank Mr. Hultgren and Mr. Perlmutter for their initiative on \nthis issue and encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Nepal was devastated by two major \nearthquakes, resulting in the loss of over 8,500 lives, and Virginia \nTask Force 1 was there to help.\n  With their incredible skill and teamwork, they were able to rescue a \n15-year-old boy trapped in the rubble for 5 days.

They also medically treated countless others.\n  When they returned home on Saturday morning, they were \nenthusiastically greeted by their relatives and families. Those \nfamilies also endure countless hours of worry while their family \nmembers and loved ones are halfway around the world in unfamiliar and \ndangerous circumstances.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Members of Virginia Task Force 1 are truly fabulous \nand wonderful ambassadors for the Commonwealth of Virginia and our \ncountry, and it is an honor and a privilege to thank them for their \ncourageous service to the people of Nepal and to the work they do every \nday in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3378-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3378-H3382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MANDATED FIXED WHEELCHAIR LIFTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I am going to do a budget presentation \nin a couple of moments, but I wanted to actually come up here and, with \nmy good friend from South Carolina, Mick Mulvaney, talk about a little \narticle that popped up in The Economist last week, and there is the \nissue.\n  This place has fairly short memories, but about 2 years ago, there \nwere a handful of us coming here and talking about sort of an esoteric \nissue, something called--what is it--wheelchair lifts.\n  For those of us who represent resort areas, I am blessed to represent \nthe community of Scottsdale, a wonderful area. I had one of my resort \nowners call me, and in a fairly gruff voice, saying: ``David, do you \nknow what the Justice Department is doing to me? I have seven pools and \nJacuzzis, and apparently, I have to put permanent fixed wheelchair \nlifts at every pool and Jacuzzi.''\n  He said: ``I want to be sensitive and caring to my mobility-\nchallenged guests.''\n  He went on to tell me the story that for 10 years, he had had a \nportable wheelchair lift, and it had never been requested. Here we are, \n2 years later. He has torn up his landscaping; he has put in the units. \nGuess what is now happening?\n  He has called me and told me that now his insurance rates are \nstarting to really bounce up because of unattractive nuisance. The very \nthings Mick Mulvaney predicted, I like to say I predicted 2 years ago, \nare coming true.\n  I would like to yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. \nMulvaney). Tell us the other side of the story of what is going on.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Schweikert, thank you for the opportunity to talk \nabout this a little bit without the pressures of the 2-minute timer or \na 3-minute timer, actually talk about something in detail for a change \nin this House because it merits the discussion.\n  My experience with it, Mr. Schweikert, was exactly the same as \nyours--they are not exactly the same. I am not from the resort part of \nSouth Carolina. Mr. Sanford and Mr. Rice get that. I am from the more \nrural inland part of the State; but we have got a lot of freeways and a \nlot of small businesses operating hotels, a lot of them owned by Asian \nAmericans.\n  I was approached by a group of Indian American hotel owners last \nyear. These are folks, mom-and-pop operations, that might own one \nhotel, they might own two. They told me the same story you just told \nabout these pool lifts having to go in.\n  A lot of them, like your friends with the resorts, had the portable \nlifts, so if anybody ever asked for help getting into and out of a pool \nby themselves, they had the ability to do that. Of course, similar to \nyour story, none of them had ever been asked.\n  The Department of Justice came in and said: You know what, we are \ngoing to require you, under the terms of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, to put these fixed pool lifts in every single body of \nwater that you have; so if you have a regular size pool, a kiddie pool, \nand a hot tub, that is three of these fixed lifts.\n  It was a tremendous burden on these small businesses who, as you \nmentioned, wanted to help folks who needed help in getting in and out \nof the pool, but just wanted to do it with a portable machine, as \nopposed to a standard machine.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  They came in, and they said: Look, Mr. Mulvaney, we have seen this \nact before. This is how we got rid of diving boards. This is why we \ndon't have any diving boards.\n  Years ago, people said they were an attractive nuisance. Kids were \njumping off of them and hurting themselves, so now that entire \ngeneration of Americans has grown up without diving boards.\n  What is going to happen now is that the next generation of Americans \nis going to grow up without swimming pools at hotels for the exact \nreason that you have just mentioned.\n  We spent 40 years getting rid of these things that children could \nclimb up on and jump off of into the pool, and now the Department of \nJustice has required these hotel owners to come in and put the exact \nsame thing back in.\n  It is no longer a diving board. Now it is a mechanical chair. But to \nan 8-year-old, it looks like something to climb up and jump off of. So \nthey were lamenting the fact not only that their business is going to \nbe hurt but that part of the enjoyment of coming to the hotel would be \ngone and not available to their customers, and that eventually, you \nwould see them start filling in their swimming pools. Unfortunately, I \nthink that is the way that we are moving.\n  But they also talked about something--and this is to the point of the \narticle that you just mentioned, The Economist from April 25, which is \nthat there was a private right of action in the regulations that came \nforward. And what this means, to folks who aren't familiar with what \nthat means, is that anybody can sue. In fact, in the United States of \nAmerica, when anybody can sue, typically, anybody does sue.\n  The article goes into great length about one very, very energetic \nplaintiff who filed 529 lawsuits against small-business owners at \nhotels throughout the southeast. In fact, in one particular period of \ntime, they hit 50 hotels in a row shortly after the regulation became \neffective so that they could file their lawsuit against the hotel \nowners.\n  I will read one of my favorite passages in the article, which is \nsomething that should be enlightening for all of us: ``There is \nevidence that lawyers explicitly target small businesses, which are \nmore likely to pay up without a fight.''\n  There we go. That is what we have done in the name of helping people \nwhom folks were already trying to help. But in the name of having the \ngovernment tell small business and large business how to help people, \nwhat do we end up with? Essentially a jobs bill for the plaintiff's \nbar.\n  Before we started today, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) \nand I were talking about why we were going to take a few minutes to \ntalk about this.\n  As my friend from Massachusetts, Barney Frank, said before he left: \n``Everybody always says, `I hate to say I told you so,' but the truth \nof the matter is, people love saying, `I told you so.'''\n  This is exactly what we said would happen. And why the Department of \nJustice saw fit to single out small business hoteliers who were already \ntrying to help people and say, You know what, we know better than you \nhow to help people. You think these portable units are good? Well, we \nthink the fixed units are better. And trust us because we are from the \ngovernment, and we are here to help you.\n\n[[Page H3379]]\n\n  What do we end up with as a result of the government trying to fix \nthe problem? We end up with small businesses making less money. And I \nknow not a lot of people are sympathetic to that. I certainly am. I \nused to be a small-business person. And believe me, the people who \nworked for me liked it when I made money. So did I. But I recognize the \nfact that a lot of people are not sympathetic to small business. But \nsmall business makes less money.\n  Kids are going to have less access to swimming pools as they travel \nthe country. Think about that for a second. How absurd is that, that we \nare going to end up filling in swimming pools in order to prevent \nlawsuits.\n  And then lastly, and the worst is, you will end up with a situation \nwhere all we have done is empower a small group of overzealous trial \nlawyers and their plaintiffs.\n  It is a sad story but one that we hear again and again in America. \nAnd I only hope that the next time the government comes up with an idea \nlike this on how to fix things, they will look to what is happening now \nto the small-business hotel owners as an example of government gone \nwrong.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I remember you and I having this conversation on the \nfloor and particularly Members from the left coming to the microphone \nand basically scolding me on how insensitive I was.\n  Now I realize that my father may have been right about something. He \nsaid: ``It is almost always about the money.''\n  When you look at The Economist article, you start to realize that \nthis was a jobs act for the Democrat supporters and the trial bar \nbecause they are running up and down our communities, suing small \nbusinesses.\n  And I believe you are absolutely correct: our future will be hotels \nand resorts without pools at all.\n  Once again, the folks in the opposition questioned our sensitivity, \nour love for our brothers and sisters. And we were trying to say, This \nis the economic argument, and here is the litigious argument. And we \nlost.\n  The administration basically gave into the trial bar, and now we do \nhave the ``I told you so.''\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I would suggest to you, Mr. Schweikert, that you were, \nin fact, being insensitive: you were being insensitive to the trial \nbar.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Darn it. I knew I was doing something wrong.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Listen, I had the same experience as you did, Mr. \nSchweikert. I was in the Longworth House Office Building a couple years \nback. You and I wrote a bill together to try to either delay or prevent \nthe DOJ from putting this regulation into effect, and we had people \nliterally protesting outside of our office, folks from the disability \ncommunity who wanted this particular accommodation. And I am completely \nsympathetic to that.\n  What I think they failed to see at the time and failed to grasp was, \nnumber one, they were already being accommodated. My guess is that 99.9 \npercent of the people who came to protest had never asked to use one of \nthese portable lifts at hoteliers, so they were not aware of the fact \nthat they were there but, at the same time, they never gave any thought \nto the unintended consequences of this particular piece of regulation \nthat the DOJ promulgated. And I think that, again, is a lesson to be \nlearned.\n  A government that is big enough to give you everything that you want \nis big enough to take from you everything that you have. And this, in a \nvery small way, is what we saw in the promulgation of this particular \nregulation.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. The closing thought on this colloquy:\n  We are already seeing the insurance world starting to charge higher \nand higher and higher fees for apartments, hotels, resorts that have \nthese lifts, these permanent platforms. It is because they are already \nmodeling the risk that someone--hopefully not with alcohol involved--\nbut someone is going to crawl up on top of one and jump in. The same \nlitigation profile that removed diving boards 20, 30 years ago, the \nother side basically has driven us to. And they are going to be our \nbrothers and sisters out there. There are going to be some that are \ngoing to be hurt, maybe hurt severely, and ultimately, what is our \nfuture? The removal of the swimming pools.\n\n  We have got to thank the folks on the left that weren't willing to \ndiscuss rational economics and the DOJ, once again, for making a bunch \nof money for their trial bar friends.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. We will get equality, Mr. Schweikert. We will have \nequal access to the swimming pools under this regulation because no one \nwill have the access. That will be the ultimate result here.\n  In an effort to make it accessible to everybody, we will end up \nmaking it accessible to no one, and in the final analysis, that is a \nsad state of equality that I don't think anybody should applaud.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. This is not a petty little issue. This is just a \nsimple example that we talk about here almost every day of the runaway \narrogance of Washington believing they are going to run our businesses, \nrun our lives, and sort of the obvious outcomes that turn out to be \nfairly disastrous.\n  So, Mr. Mulvaney, I appreciate you coming down and giving us some of \nyour time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Schweikert, thank you for the opportunity.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I am going to set up here in a second. I \nam going to actually walk through something we have been working on in \nour office now for the last month, and that is, what is really going on \nin budget numbers.\n  We did a budget town hall about 2 weeks ago in Scottsdale. And I \nalways like to start it with a simple question that says, How many of \nyou are tired of seeing us in Congress fight with each other? And the \nhands always go up, and they say, Yes, you have to stop fighting with \neach other.\n  And I always try to make the point: it is about the money. You need \nto understand how bad the underlying financial data is and what is \nreally going on in the scale of debt and deficits and just the sheer \nscale of spending but also where that spending is going because we have \nso many of my brothers and sisters here, we go out and campaign and say \nthings like: We are going to take care of waste and fraud. We are going \nto take care of this and foreign aid. We are going to do this and that. \nAnd they are not providing an honest picture of where the money is and \nwhere it actually goes.\n  So we are going to do about 10 of these boards. I know it is going to \nget technical.\n  When you run for Congress, one of the first things that happens, if \nyou are a numbers guy, the pollster and the consultants sit you down \nand say, You can't use big numbers. People won't understand them.\n  In this presentation, I am going to treat everyone like adults--these \naren't Republican numbers; they are not even Democrat numbers, though \nthe majority of these slides actually do come from the White House--to \nunderstand what is actually underlying in the data and how quickly it \nis eroding.\n  Two points of reference: For decades, we used to talk about how we \nwere going to hit this inflection point when baby boomers began moving \ninto retirement and what was going to happen to the debt curve and what \nwas going to happen to the curve of consumption of the entitlements.\n  Guess what. We are now well into that inflection point. It has begun, \nand Congress has done very, very, very little in regards to mandatory \nspending. You are going to see on these boards that that is actually \nwhat may take us down as a Republic.\n  So this is 2010. Let's just do this as a reference. And remember, \n2010 was a year when there was still lots of stimulus money, lots of \nother spending out there.\n  You see the blue. The blue is what we refer to as mandatory spending. \nIt is primarily Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, some transfer \nprograms, interest, veterans, and the new health care law.\n  Okay. In 2010, about 63 percent of our spending was in that blue \narea; 37 percent was what we call discretionary. That is what we get to \nvote on here because what is in the blue is in formulas.\n  I have been here a little over 4 years. I have really had absolutely \nno influence on that blue area. It is a formula. You hit a certain age, \nyou get a certain benefit.\n  But I want you to watch what is happening in that entitlement, in \nthat\n\n[[Page H3380]]\n\nmandatory spending. And, yes, this is the very discussion that gets \npeople unelected because people get very upset, but we have to have an \nadult conversation of what is really going on here.\n  So we are going to do a couple of these slides just to sort of create \na reference.\n  Here is where we are this year. And you remember, on that slide, I \nthink the blue area was about 63 percent of our total spending. This \nyear, it is 69 percent of our total spending. And obviously then the \ndiscretionary, what we get to vote on as Members, has now gone down to \n31 percent.\n  Do you notice the movement? And that is just in the last 5 years.\n  So where are we going? Well, right now, to give you a different way \nof looking at this, this is our 2015 modeling from the White House. \nThis green area is our revenues. That is the total revenues coming into \nyour Federal Government. That purple area is our debt. That is what we \nare going to borrow this year to make up for our shortfalls, though you \nwill be happy to know that, as of about 48 hours ago, the \nadministration changed the debt number from $576 billion for the 2015 \nfiscal year to--now it is going to be $582.5 billion. This continues to \nerode.\n  We are going to talk about that at the end here, what is actually \ngoing on in GDP, on economic growth in this country. And if we do not \ndevelop a growth-oriented agenda, we can't meet our obligations. We \ncannot keep those promises we have made.\n  And with that, I stand here in shock of how often we engage in these \ndebates, and it is not a growth-oriented focus.\n  So one thing on this slide I really want you to get: blue over here \nis mandatory spending. The red is discretionary, with defense. Defense \nis considered discretionary. We have to borrow either every dime of \ndefense or every dime of everything else, other than defense and \nmandatory or discretionary--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \ninterest on the debt, veterans benefits, and the new health care law.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we have to borrow either every dime of defense or every \ndime of discretionary other than defense, and that is in this year's \nbudget. That is how quickly this is moving away from us.\n  So what happens if we look way off into the future, like 4 years from \nnow? 2020 is only 4 years from now. When I first got elected in 2011, I \ndid a presentation here. The numbers I am going to show you that happen \nin 4 years were not supposed to happen until 9 years from now. This is \nto give you an idea of how quickly the numbers are eroding. Yet I hear \nalmost no one talking about it.\n  So we are going to be working on that budget in 4 years. Do you \nremember that 2010 slide? Sixty-three percent of our spending went to \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security, interest on the debt, veterans' \nbenefits, and the new healthcare law. Well, it is going to be 76 \npercent--76--three-quarters of all of our spending. We are only going \nto be voting on 24 percent of the budget, and half of that will be \ndefense.\n  I don't know if anyone knows, because these numbers are small and it \nis hard to watch, what we will be spending in 2020 on discretionary. So \ndefense and all the litany of programs you think of are basically going \nto be almost identical to what we were spending 10 years earlier. I \nwill hold that up as one of the successes of the Republican House. We \nhave been very disciplined on spending on what we had the ability to \ninfluence, which was the discretionary budget, but the formulaic \nportion of our budget, entitlements, continues to explode. It is almost \nas if Washington, D.C., did not know that there was a baby boom, did \nnot know people were going to be turning 65, did not know that 76 \nmillion of our brothers and sisters were born in about an 18-year \nperiod of time, and now we are into the third year of baby boomers \nbeginning to retire, and that inflection has begun.\n  So just as a reference, because I often get asked for this slide--and \nwe are putting these slides up on our Web site--there is the spending \npie chart for this year. You will see the blue area is all the way to \nhere: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the transfer programs also \nincluding the new healthcare law, interest on the debt, veterans' \nbenefits.\n  Two weeks ago when we were doing a budget presentation in my hometown \nof Scottsdale-Phoenix, I had one woman who was absolutely positive, if \nwe would cut foreign aid, we would be just fine here. It is important \nto understand. Do you see this little red area here? Foreign aid would \nbe ultimately nothing but a small sliver within that. Yes, it is \nsomething, but in many ways, it is theater.\n  If you have a politician standing in front of you and they are not \ntalking about the mandatory spending and the speed of its growth, you \nare not having an honest budget discussion. It is hard because in many \nplaces around the country, when you stand behind a microphone and hold \nup these boards and start to say that we need to have an honest \nconversation about the math underlying Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, and what is going to happen on interest on the debt, the new \nhealthcare law and its cost projections blowing through the ceiling, \nand veterans' benefits, often those Members who have tried to have that \nconversation get unelected.\n  But if you have someone walk in to our door here and say, ``David, we \nso desperately need new spending on this,'' we often pull out our \ncharts and say, ``You are absolutely right. This would be wonderful. Do \nyou have a solution to help me refine and deal with and manage the \nexplosion of the cost in Medicare?'' And they just stare at you like we \nare not allowed to talk about that. But that is what is going on here.\n  So let's do another slide to just sort of see how the numbers really \nare exploding. If I came to you and said, hey, in 4 years, that 3.8--\nand it is actually a $3.75 billion budget we are going to have this \nyear. So 3.756 trillion--sorry, not billion, trillion. So we are going \nto spend $3.8 trillion this year. In 4 years, we are going to be \nspending an additional $1 trillion on top of that, an additional \ntrillion, and every dime of that is going into mandatory spending. It \nis not going into health research; it is not going into new parts; it \nis not going into building a new aircraft carrier; and it is not going \ninto all these programs that we all talk about because it is easy \npolitics. Every dime of that additional trillion dollars in 4 years \nfrom now will be in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, interest on \nthe debt, veterans' benefits, and the new healthcare law.\n  How many times have you heard that? This is right in front of us. \nThis is what is going on. Your government is growing at an exponential \npace, but it is not in the area where we, as Members of Congress, get \nto vote because it is in the formula areas, the mandatory spending.\n  Are you starting to see a theme in this discussion and on the slides? \nI am trying to build an understanding out there with both my brothers \nand sisters here in Congress and the public out there that if we are \nnot willing to have honest conversations, particularly with this coming \nPresidential election, about entitlements, mandatory spending, and ways \nwe can manage them--and it is not cuts, but there are much better ways \nwe can deliver these.\n  You put all the programs, all the promises we have made at risk \nbecause just pretending everything is going to be fine means you are \nbasically dooming them to a really ugly future, or the country to an \nugly future. So, Mr. Speaker, this gives you an interesting projection.\n  Now, if we go beyond that 2020 slide, if we go 9 years out--9 years \nout--we will be running over trillion-dollar deficits, and that is \nusing the current GDP projections for the future, which we are going to \ntalk about that model on the very end slide. There is something \nhorribly wrong in how we are modeling our future income growth into \nthis country.\n  The math is real. I know it is uncomfortable and it is almost \nsacrilegious to many of the political people here, saying: Well, we are \nnot allowed to talk about that. David, why are you such a downer? Don't \nyou want to get reelected? Why aren't you doing happy talk?\n\n[[Page H3381]]\n\n  I am optimistic about the country. I am optimistic about some things \nhappening out there in the economy despite government. But you have to \nunderstand, in 9 years, interest will be $1 trillion. And think about \nthis: it is almost going to be approaching all discretionary. At that \ntime, in 9 years, we will be about $1.4 trillion in interest. Our best \ninterest projection is over $1 trillion.\n  The chart, when you go a couple years out, we will be spending more \nmoney on interest than all of defense, all of discretionary, all of \neducation, all of parts, all of health research, everything else. That \nis what we are doing. We are creating this trap where, as we build more \nand more debt and build more and more debt and build more and more \ndebt, that becomes our Achilles heal. That becomes our fragility in \nthis country.\n  So once again, remember that earlier slide where I went over there \nand marked that now this year's deficit projection is $582.5 billion, \nand that is coming from the White House as of about 2 days ago.\n  We had someone in our office earlier today. We were trying to do some \nmodeling. If GDP continues to do what we think is happening right now, \nwe could be having a discussion this coming October that the 2015 \nshortfall was almost $600 billion. You do realize that is approaching \ndouble what the optimistic projections were last year for 2015.\n\n  There is something horribly wrong out there. It is a combination of \nlack of economic growth and, let's be honest, the mandatory spending, \nthe entitlements, are growing faster than the underlying models we have \nbuilt.\n  So this is an interesting slide just to give you the point of talking \nabout inflection. It is a fancy word that a lot of the statisticians \nlike to use, and we politicians will use it. But there it, and it has \nbegun. We are well into it.\n  Do you see where those blue lines start to explode? But do you notice \nsomething interesting? The red lines, from about here over basically \nstay substantially flat. That is the discretionary spending. That is \nwhat we get to vote on. That is your defense. That is everything else \nother than the mandatory spending.\n  But what is exploding through the ceiling? It looks like Washington, \nD.C., failed to understand the demographic issues that were heading \ntowards this country and systematically avoided them, because I am sure \nit had nothing to do with my brothers and sisters often caring more \nabout their next election than having to go through the painful process \nof educating our voters to understand this is your greatest threat, I \nbelieve, to our Republic.\n  One more slide to put this in perspective. The blue line is interest. \nThe red line is all--all--of defense spending. Do you notice something, \nthat in about 7 years, 6\\1/2\\ years, we are now spending more money in \ninterest than all of defense? All of defense. It is 6 years away. \nActually, in reality, my math is closer to 5\\1/2\\, but we will use the \n6 years.\n  Think about that. We will be spending more money in interest on U.S. \nsovereign debt than we are spending on all defense of the Nation. It is \nabsurd. And this is what we are about to hand to our kids. As a matter \nof fact, this is no longer about our kids. This is about us now. The \nnumbers have eroded so fast, it is here. And the happy talk that we \nwere doing just 1 year ago, particularly coming from the \nadministration, has not turned out to be true.\n  So one of the things that is going on out there, can you regulate \nyourself to prosperity? Can you tax yourself to prosperity? Can you, in \nan arrogant fashion, have a bureaucracy that is so inept, its ability \nto even when we do bipartisan, pro-growth pieces of legislation like \nthe JOBS Act--we all got together here 3 years ago and did the JOBS \nAct. You do realize there are still substantial portions of that piece \nof legislation that are still sitting at the SEC that still don't have \ntheir rules because of the underlying politics behind them? They are 3 \nyears beyond their due date, but we still don't have them.\n  There is something horribly wrong in this government if we don't have \nan honest discussion and actually then do something about our Tax Code, \nour regulatory code, access to opportunity, and then the difficult one, \nthe design within our entitlement state, which is something the \nRepublicans for the last 4 years, 5 years, have been putting into our \nbudget.\n  Do you all remember the television commercial of the Paul Ryan look-\nalike throwing grandma over the cliff? Great politics, horrible math, \nbecause the Republicans, Paul Ryan and the rest of us, stood up and \nsaid that we are willing to actually propose a model that saves \nMedicare and deals with this curve that consumes everything in our \npath. It is really bad politics; it is honest math. And we get the crap \nkicked out of us for telling the truth.\n  So now we get to look at a slide like this. We were projecting 3.1 \npercent GDP for this year. As of a few hours ago, the Atlanta Fed, \nwhich actually does this really interesting modeling of collecting \ncurrent statistics and constantly adjusting their GDP projections, now \nhas us not at 3.1 percent GDP for this year--and remember, every point \nof GDP is--it matters what velocity model you use--about $80 billion to \n$100 billion of revenue. So you start to realize that a couple of \npoints of GDP is a big deal. The Atlanta Fed's GDP calculation on their \nWeb site now is 0.7 percent GDP coming in in this quarter, and the \nindicators look like we are going to get additional downward revisions \non the first quarter.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are in trouble. Yes, the politicians will get up here \nand blame each other and blame each other, but it doesn't make the math \ngo away.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  The other thing is also--and this is one of my pet peeves here--we \nsystematically do not tell the truth, and this is a Republican and \nDemocrat problem. Some of it is because we use really bad modeling \ndata, really bad underlying statistics; we underestimate the swings \nduring boom times and slowdowns. We systematically have blown our GDP \ncalculation; but understand, that GDP calculation has a lot to do with \nwhat we model as our spending, has a lot to do with what ends up \nhappening on our debt.\n  If you look at this chart, the red is what real GDP turned out to be; \nthe blue was our projection, and systematically, we are dramatically \nunder the projection. It looks like this year we are crashing and \nburning. I am desperately hoping the third quarter and the fourth \nquarter get really healthy, but there is something horribly wrong out \nthere.\n  Is this administration, are my brothers and sisters on the left, \nfinally willing to have that conversation about the Tax Code, about our \nregulatory state, those very things that--let's face it--are stymying \nfuture growth and our ability to save this country?\n  One last slide just to sort of provide an opportunity--for those of \nyou who have an interest in watching some of these numbers, and there \nare those out there who are also sort of numbers geeks, this is that \nGDPNow. Yes, it is often a pessimistic calculator; except for the small \nproblem is, the last couple of years, it has actually been the accurate \ncalculator of actual GDP growth. This is right off the GDPNow Web site \nfrom the Atlanta Fed, showing it looks like, now, we are all the way \ndown to a .7 percent GDP growth in the second quarter.\n  A little bit else on this and then I will stop this thing I am doing, \nwhich may be bordering on a tirade. If you are particularly geeky, last \nweek, you would have seen the Journal of Economic Perspectives did an \nentire report on Social Security calculations.\n  There is a handful of folks here with all sorts of letters behind \ntheir names, mostly Ph.D., talking about Social Security is actually in \nworse shape than we tell people, that they are close to $1 trillion \nadditional underfunded in the latest projections, and that some of the \nmodeling are simple things like we are actually using really bad life \nexpectancy tables.\n  Now, I have incredible respect for the actuaries over at Medicare and \nSocial Security; I think they deal with some amazing data sets, but \nsome of the Nation's finest economists and Ph.D. economists are \nstarting to write public articles, saying: We are in real trouble here.\n  Remember, last year, when the Mercatus did their detailed projection \non unfunded liabilities and debt for the United States, they came in \nwith a number that scared me half to death. They actually came in with \na number\n\n[[Page H3382]]\n\nof $205 trillion, as if you did GAAP standard accounting, not \ngovernment accounting, standard accounting for the debt of this Nation \nand our unfunded liabilities.\n  Go on the Internet right now, and look up what is the wealth of the \nworld. Some of the best models say the wealth of the world is about \n$180 trillion. We have universities out there modeling that U.S. \nsovereign debt and unfunded liabilities are over $200 trillion. Our \nunfunded liabilities are greater than the wealth of the world.\n  We are better than this. This is the greatest issue in front of us, \nand we spend so little time actually having an honest discussion about \nthe math.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3382-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3382-H3385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CAMPAIGN SPENDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poliquin). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk a little bit about \nspending today, like my friend and colleague from Arizona, but I am \ngoing to talk about spending of a different kind. I am going to talk \nabout campaign spending.\n  Campaign spending is quite an issue, and I want to spend about an \nhour or less talking about its effect, and I want to talk about some of \nthe solutions that we have out there that might make a big difference.\n  First, I want to say I truly believe in my heart of hearts that the \nUnited States of America is the greatest country in the world, probably \nthe greatest country that the world has ever seen and may see in the \nfuture. You can just see that by some of the markers.\n  The notions of freedom that this country has had in the past have \ninspired nations; they have inspired individuals around the world. Our \neconomic strength is unrivaled. Our cultural influence reaches every \ncorner of the world. Our military power is absolutely unrivaled.\n  However, again, I truly believe that we can do better, and I will \ntell you some of the big challenges that we are facing right now, that \nif we take on these challenges, we will even be a greater Nation.\n  First of all, we need massive investments in our Nation's \ninfrastructure, our highways, our bridges, our ports, our airports. We \nneed it in our broadband. We just need a massive amount of investment \nin our Nation's infrastructure.\n  Our Nation's education is falling behind. Yes, we have some of the \ngreatest schools, some of the greatest universities in the entire \nworld, some of our public schools, some of our charter schools and \nprivate schools unrivaled; but there are a lot of schools that are \nstruggling and producing students that really can't compete in today's \nworld.\n  We need to do immigration reform. We have 12, 15 million people in \nthis country that are undocumented that live in the shadows that may or \nmay not pay taxes that contribute to our economy but are always afraid \nof being deported.\n  We have climate change. Climate change is here; it is progressing; it \nis going to get worse. We need to do something about it as soon as \npossible.\n  We have a vanishing middle class. There is a huge disparity in \nincomes between the richest and the poorest in this country, and it is \nincreasing. Our middle class is vanishing. They are feeling more and \nmore insecure. They are unable to send their kids to college. We have a \nhuge challenge in that regard.\n  We have a need to establish background checks for purchase of weapons \nand to close the gun show loopholes.\n  We need to create a sustainable economy.\n  These are huge challenges that we need to attend from the Congress, \nfrom this body, from the House of Representatives, from the United \nStates Senate, from the State legislatures, from local governments; but \nwe are unable to attack these problems, in a large part, because of the \nway campaigns are financed.\n  Now, we see a growing perversion of Presidential campaigns. We have \nsuper-PACs. We have dark donors, and they are having meetings with \nPresidential candidates, which are allowed by the laws because the \ncandidates are not official candidates.\n  No one knows what is legal and enforceable right now in Presidential \ncandidate financing; and worse than that, foreign money is probably \ncoming into all of these campaigns now.\n\n  I just want to say elections up and down the ballot are being more \nand more perverted each election. All Americans should be concerned.\n  While I was waiting to speak this evening, I just read an article in \nthe National Journal Daily today that stated: ``According to data \ngathered in 21 states by the National Institute on Money in State \nPolitics, $175 million was spent by them in 2006''--that is local \npolitics; that is city council and school boards--``a number that \nballooned to $245 million four years later.''\n  That is a delta of $70 million increases in local campaign financing \nin just 4 years, and that is a fraction of the total expected to be \nspent in future local races.\n  Before I go further, what I would like to do is take a break and \nyield to my friend and colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Jones). He \nwants to say a few words.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. McNerney, thank you very much, and I want to thank you \nfor taking the lead tonight to be on the floor. I know you have other \nMembers of Congress to join you in your hour, but I have been here for \n20 years, and I must tell you that, since I have been here, I have \nnever seen as much influence by the special interests as I do now, and \nthat is because of money.\n  Actually, both parties--and that is why you are a Democrat, I am a \nRepublican--but both parties seem to succumb to the influence of money \nto get bills to the floor.\n  I am a strong supporter of John Sarbanes, who is from Maryland. You \nhave your bill that I have joined today, by the way, to sign my name to \nyour resolution, and I am on John Sarbanes' bill, which is H.R. 20. The \ntitle is the Government By the People Act.\n  I will touch on four quick points. One is building a government of, \nby, and for the people. The second part of the bill says empower the \nAmericans to participate. The third part is amplify the voice of the \npeople and then fight back against Big Money special interests.\n  In my few minutes, Mr. McNerney, what I would like to talk about is \nthe influence of money. I am a Republican and proud to be one; you are \na Democrat and proud to be one, but I will tell you that I have seen so \nmany bills this year get to the floor of the House because, in my \nopinion, it is because of the influence of special interests.\n  You and I recently had a bill on the floor that basically said that \nwe would change the law that would allow the mobile home companies that \nsell mobile homes--many people in my district, 45,000 people own mobile \nhomes, and there will be others buying mobile homes--but they will \nchange the contract to say that it would go from 8 to 12 percent.\n  Well, who did it benefit? It was Warren Buffett. I don't deny Warren \nBuffett his success. He is a very successful man, and I am happy for \nhim. What this bill did was to say to the average person that maybe in \nCalifornia or North Carolina that needs to buy a mobile home, because \nthat is the best they can do: we are going to let you pay more in \ninterest.\n  I was the only Republican to vote ``no'' on that bill. I said this \nback in my district, and quite frankly, I was pleased that the majority \nof people agree with me that we should be considerate of those people \nwho cannot afford to buy better than a mobile home; but there, again, \nthat special interest influence, that is what you just said a moment \nago.\n  I am of the firm belief that if we do not change the system--you have \nan H.J. Res. that you have introduced. I talk about John Sarbanes' H.R. \n20. That will create an alternative to the system that we have.\n  You and I both know that Citizens United that said that a corporation \nis an individual has created a lot of the problems that we face today. \nI will say that the American people need to get behind what you are \ntrying to do, what Mr. Sarbanes is trying to do--and I, in a lesser \nway--to return the power of the people to the people because, too\n\n[[Page H3383]]\n\nmany times, decisions here in Washington are made because special \ninterests, whether it be a Democrat or Republican leadership, puts it \non the floor.\n  I believe that the people, as you believe, have a right to let this \nbe the people's House and not the special interests House.\n  I am delighted to be on the floor with you tonight. I will stay just \na few minutes, if you want to call back on me in a couple of minutes. I \nwill be here until a little bit after 8, but I wanted to thank you for \ngetting on the floor tonight to speak about this issue because, if we \nare going to let the people own the government, then we must give the \npower back to the people.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Jones.\n  I just want to point out, again, that this is bipartisan. Mr. Jones \nis a Republican; I am a Democrat. We both see the corrosive influence \nof money here in Washington, and we want to do something about it.\n  A lot of our colleagues agree with us wholeheartedly but are actually \nafraid to say it. They are afraid to get up here because they know, if \nthey do, they are going to be targeted by this special interest money, \nby super-PAC money, by dark money.\n  The sad thing is that you don't know that it is coming. You could be \nrunning a good, solid, healthy campaign arguing the issues and, all of \na sudden, see a $2 million television ad against you, and they would be \ngoing after you for very personal misleading ads, which could destroy \nyou and your family, for no reason other than you don't want to see so \nmuch money in campaign spending.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Let me look at some of the specific risks and problems that we see \ntoday because of the way campaigns are financed.\n  First of all, campaign financing makes elected officials less \neffective in their jobs because of the time you have to spend raising \nmoney.\n  Here in Congress, it is not unusual to see a Member of Congress spend \n2, 4, 6 hours a day on the phone, begging people for money. That \nlessens your effectiveness. You can't spend the time you should be \nspending on studying legislation, in talking to colleagues, in finding \nways to compromise on issues.\n  The second item is negative campaign ads turn off voters and suppress \nvotes.\n  Boy, we saw in this last election a turnout of 40 percent, 35 \npercent, and 30 percent in some districts, and a lot of that has to do \nwith the negativity that people see on TV. They don't know what to \nbelieve. They think they are both bums, and they just close their noses \nand vote for the least worse or they don't vote at all. That is the \nsecond.\n  The effect of campaign financing makes for wasteful government \nspending.\n  This is an issue that, I think, folks like my predecessor here \ntonight was talking about. The Tea Party folks should be interested in \nthis issue because the way campaigns are financed causes wasteful \ngovernment spending. Boy, I will tell you that I sympathize with the \nTea Party objectives. Government seems big. It seems wasteful. It seems \nloaded. It seems ineffective. There is wasteful spending. There are \nprojects that shouldn't be funded. A lot of that has to do with the way \ncampaigns are financed.\n  The next one is a big one. This is important. It is kind of what I \nmentioned before. It is the threat of negative campaign ads causes \nelected officials to avoid important and controversial issues:\n  Now, I do not care if you are a Republican or a Democrat. If you are \na Republican, you have risk in your primary elections. If you are a \nDemocrat, it is of big money coming in and trying to trash you \npersonally in election campaigns. If you are a Democrat, you have more \nrisk coming in in general elections. So it doesn't matter what party \nyou are in. It doesn't matter whether you are conservative or liberal. \nThe way campaigns are financed is causing our government to be \nwasteful, and it is causing it to be ineffective. I think that needs to \nbe improved.\n  There is another problem that I mentioned earlier. Foreign money is \ncoming into these campaigns now. Do you want to see foreigners, do you \nwant to see folks from Russia or from China or from any country besides \nthe United States having an influence on our elections?\n  The amount of money coming into elections continues to grows election \nby election. We had $6.2 million in 2010 versus $3 billion in 2012. I \nthink I have gotten a million or a billion mixed up there. Sorry about \nthat. Elected officials respond more to wealthy donors than they do to \nnonwealthy donors. It is simply a matter of access. Someone gives you \nmoney, and they are more likely to have access, and that means that you \nare more likely to be sympathetic to their legislative goals.\n  Judicial races are getting more expensive and tainted as well. Do you \nwant to have a judge in a case that you may be bringing to court to \nhave gotten his seat or her seat because of the way the campaign \nfinance trashed his opponent? I do not think so.\n  In general, people have become very cynical about government because \nof the negative advertising, and people lose faith in our government. \nTo have the greatest country in the world and the things that this \ncountry has accomplished--the innovation, the science, the freedoms \nthat we have established throughout the world--and then have people \ncynical about our government because of the campaign financing is more \nthan a tragedy. Campaign spending is a zero-sum game. Let me tell you \nwhat I mean by that.\n  Consider that you are in a meeting. You have got a 1 hour, and you \nhave got 12 people, so everyone has 5 minutes to speak. Now, what if \nsomebody takes 10 minutes? Then somebody else is going to lose out. \nCampaignspeak is like that too because people in this country are only \nwilling to listen to a certain amount of campaign rhetoric, and then \nafter that point, they turn off their minds. They don't want to hear \nany more. The folks with the biggest money get out there. They fill the \nairwaves, and they fill your mailboxes, and they have people knock on \nyour doors. Pretty soon, you don't want to hear any more, so the guy \nwith the lesser money is losing freedom of speech. So I think it is a \nfreedom of speech issue. Those are some of the issues I have.\n  With PACs and Super PACs and dark money--this is an interesting one--\ncampaigns are no longer going to be controlled by the candidates. You \ncould have a situation in which Super PACs and PACs have five times \nmore money than the candidate himself or herself, in which case they \nare controlling all of the levers in the campaign. So those are some of \nthe issues that, I think, are caused by the excessive spending in our \ncampaigns.\n  I again yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) to \ntake up the case here.\n  Mr. JONES. I thank the gentleman. I appreciate listening to you, and \nit reminds me of a conversation I had on the floor of the House last \nweek.\n  As you know, I have been here 20 years. I came with Newt Gingrich, \nand Bill Clinton was the President. We did some good things for the \nAmerican people, so I am kind of an older man, so to speak. I vote my \nconscience up here, and it gets me in trouble. I voted twice against \nthe Speaker of the House, and it got me in trouble, but I do what I \nthink is right.\n  I was sitting on the floor, and this gentleman--I will not say his \nname or where he is from because I don't have permission to do that. He \ncame up to me and said, ``Walter, I am probably going to--'' He is 20 \nyears younger than I am. I am 72 now. He said, ``I am probably going to \nbe like you,'' and he is a Republican. He said, ``I will probably be \nlike you and will never be a chairman or a ranking member of anything \nbecause I cannot do anything that would dampen or threaten my \nintegrity.''\n  I said, ``What do you mean?''\n  He said, ``Well, in January, I was told that I could be a \nsubcommittee chairman, but I would have to raise $300,000.''\n  The point that you are trying to make tonight--and you are doing a \ngood job--with John Sarbanes' bill, H.R. 20, which I hope people look \nup, as well as with your resolution, is that too oftentimes--and I will \nsay in both parties--we have people in leadership who say you have to \nraise X amount of dollars if you want to be a chairman. What happens to \nthat person in eastern North Carolina, where I am from, who\n\n[[Page H3384]]\n\nmakes $35,000 or $40,000 a year who can't buy influence in Washington?\n  That is what you are trying to do tonight, and that is why I wanted \nto be with you, and I admire you for taking the floor tonight. Where \nare their spokesmen? We are the people's House, and all of a sudden, \neverything is about money, winning reelections with money--big money. \nThe average citizens are beginning to be turned off by the fact that \nthey don't have much influence, and that is why what you are doing \ntonight is very special.\n  I was thinking about the gentleman who said to me, ``I will be like \nyou, Walter Jones. I will probably never be a chairman or a ranking \nmember because you are trying to keep your integrity in place.'' If we \nhad a system that you are proposing and John Sarbanes is proposing that \nwould have a system for those who don't want to be bought and paid for \nby special interests, they would have an alternative by raising their \nmoney in the State and in the district, and they would be rewarded for \nraising their money in that State. Then their allegiance would be to \nthe State and the district.\n\n  Again, I am going to stay a few more minutes, but I want to \ncompliment you on what you are doing tonight.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I thank the gentleman. I don't know of anyone who has \nmore integrity in this institution than you do, so I am honored that \nyou would come down here and talk with me tonight about this important \nissue.\n  Now, the American people, as far as I can tell, are clearly in favor \nof reducing campaign money, campaign spending. I have some Gallup Poll \nnumbers here that were taken by The Huffington Post from November 7 \nthrough November 9, 2014, which was during the last election or right \nafter the last election.\n  The first question:\n  Would you support or oppose amending the Constitution to give \nCongress more power to create restrictions on campaign spending?\n  In favor of that was 53 percent; opposed was 23 percent; and not sure \nwas 22 percent. So it was a very strong majority in favor of a \nconstitutional amendment like I am going to discuss in a little while.\n  The second question:\n  Do you think limiting contributions to political campaigns helps to \nprevent corruption in politics, or does it have no impact on \ncorruption?\n  The question is will corruption be curtailed by limiting campaign \nspending. The answer that it helps prevent corruption: 52 percent; no \nimpact on corruption: 28 percent; and not sure: 20 percent. Again, \npeople feel strongly about this issue.\n  The last question that I will read is:\n  Which of the following statements do you agree with more: Elections \nare generally won by the candidate who raises the most money? The \nanswer is 59 percent of Americans believe that; 18 percent don't \nbelieve that; and 23 percent are unsure. So I think this is a strong \nissue that we should be talking about.\n  How do we move forward?\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court appears to have a strong bias toward \nmore money in politics, and it has consistently issued rulings to that \neffect. The Supreme Court even sought out, they even asked for, the \ninfamous Citizens United case to be brought forward to them. Then, \nultimately, they ruled that corporations have the same rights--free \nspeech--as individual citizens do, as individual people do. The meaning \nof that decision is that corporations can use their treasuries to \nfinance campaigns.\n  I can't think of anything more corrosive or destructive to our \ndemocracy than that. The system was already bad before the Citizens \nUnited decision, but this thing made it much worse. Unfortunately, the \nCitizens United decision is just one of a series of decisions that \nallows more and more money into politics, and I truly believe that this \nis a threat to our cherished democratic and republican institutions.\n  This trend is not confined to the Supreme Court. Earlier this year, \nthe Republican-controlled Senate, in concurrence with the Republican-\ncontrolled House of Representatives, passed legislation that increased \nthe total individuals could contribute to political parties by a factor \nof 10--going from $35,000 to over $300,000.\n  What can we do about it?\n  The good news is that there are really a number of very good ideas \nthat have been proposed, and I think it is important for us to go over \nsome of those ideas. My friend Walter Jones has mentioned John \nSarbanes' idea, and I will go into that in a little bit of detail. But \nthere are others, and I think it is important that the American people \nbe aware of some of these proposals out there and what they might offer \nand to let them decide, let the American people decide.\n  Do they want to see a legislative approach like John Sarbanes' great \napproach?--I support it--or a constitutional amendment like mine and \nothers that I will bring up as we go forward tonight? These proposals \nall have merit. They are all worth studying and thinking about, and I \nwould be happy to support any of the ones that I am going to talk about \nthis evening and to consider other ones that may not have been brought \nforward yet. The proposals, again, fall into two categories--\nlegislative proposals and constitutional amendments.\n  Legislative proposals are a little bit easier to enact, but they are \nsubject to Supreme Court and lower court overturning. So you can work \nhard, and you can get it passed and then have the Supreme Court or some \nother court overturn it. The constitutional amendment has a very high \nbar. It is very difficult to get a constitutional amendment passed, and \nit should be. You don't want people just willy-nilly passing an \namendment to change the Constitution. It requires a two-thirds vote in \nthe House of Representatives, a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and \nthree-quarters of the State legislatures throughout the country to pass \nthat amendment for it to become part of the Constitution; but once it \nbecomes part of the Constitution, the courts can't touch it. They can \ninterpret it, but they can't overturn it.\n  There is legislation that I would like to talk about, but some of my \ncolleagues who were going to be here tonight couldn't be because of a \nchange in schedule. I think one of the important approaches, mostly \nchampioned by Chris Van Hollen from Maryland, is the disclosure and \ntransparency approach, which is that people who donate ought to be \ndisclosed quickly and broadly so that people know where money is coming \nfrom. That is a very important idea.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Also, Government By the People, John Sarbanes' approach, which I will \ntalk about in a little while; and there is also legislation that would \ncreate public finance, and I think that is a very good approach, too.\n  There are two constitutional amendments, one by Donna Edwards, a \ncolleague of mine from Maryland, that overturns Citizens United, and \nthere is one by Ted Deutch, a colleague of mine from Florida. Ted \nDeutch from Florida would basically allow Congress to enact laws on \ncampaign financing that could not be overturned by the Supreme Court. I \nthink that is a good approach. I support that. In theory, it has got a \nbeauty to it.\n  Then there is my approach, which basically would eliminate PACs and \ndo other things. I would like to talk in some detail about my \nresolution now, and we will get the board up to talk about it. This is \ncalled H.J. Res. 31, and again, it is a proposed constitutional \namendment. As you can see, it has four parts.\n  The first part, I think, is probably the most important, and it says \nbasically that money that comes in to political election campaigns to \nsupport or oppose a candidate for office can only come from individual \ncitizens and only go to the campaign controlled by the candidate or the \nprincipal campaign controlled by the candidate or from a system of \npublic election financing.\n  So what does that mean? That means that when money comes in, it can \nonly come from individual citizens. It can't come from corporations; it \ncan't come from any other sources. It just comes from individual \ncitizens, and it can only go to the campaign controlled by the \ncandidate. That means that it can't go to political action committees, \nPACs; it can't go to super-PACs; it can't be dark money. The only money \nthat can influence elections directly or indirectly to support or \noppose a candidate has to come from individual\n\n[[Page H3385]]\n\ncitizens. It has to go only to the candidate, to the campaign \ncontrolled by the candidate. That is a very strong requirement. It is \nprobably the strongest requirement out there right now, but I think it \nis important.\n  By the way, the first requirement applies to elections for individual \ncandidates at all levels of government, from the President on down to \nthe Congress, the Senate, State governments, city governments, and so \non.\n  The second measure is similar to the first. This requirement, money \nto support or oppose a State ballot initiative to change a State \nconstitution or for other purposes can only come from individuals who \nare able to vote for the measure or from a system of public election \nfinancing. I think that is important because you have ballot \ninitiatives in my home State of California, for example, and you see \nmillions of dollars coming in from out of State. Why would somebody \nfrom out of State have an opportunity to influence a State ballot \ninitiative in California? I think it is wrong, and I think that this \nwould take care of that problem.\n  The third requirement is that Congress, the States, and the local \njurisdictions must establish limits that an individual can contribute \nto any one election campaign, including limits on the amount a \ncandidate may contribute to his or her own campaign. Now, for that \nparticular requirement, we already have that in the U.S. House and U.S. \nSenate. The limit at this point in time is $2,700 per election. So \nevery time your voters can go to the booth for you, people can \ncontribute, individuals can contribute $2,700, so the primary election \nand the general election. In the House of Representatives elections are \nevery 2 years, so you can collect an amount of $5,400 over the election \ncycle for your campaign.\n  Now, if you collect $5,400 before the primary and you lose the \nprimary, then you are going to have to give back the money that was \ndonated for the general election. So that would be you would have to \ngive $2,700 back to the donors that gave that to you.\n  Also, it is important that it requires governments to limit the \namount a candidate can spend on their own campaign. Some of our \ncandidates are extremely wealthy. They have millions or hundreds of \nmillions or more. They can buy their seat in Congress easily, and this \nwould limit that. I think, again, this is very, very important.\n  The last is probably one of the more controversial of the four, but \nit says that the total of contributions to a candidate's campaign from \nindividuals who are not able to vote for the candidate cannot be \ngreater than the total of contributions from individuals who can vote \nfor the candidate. Now, geographically what that would mean is that \nmoney coming from outside of your congressional district, or from your \nState if you are a Senator, can't exceed money that comes from inside \nyour district if you are a congressional candidate or State if you are \na Senator. It wouldn't affect the Presidential race as much because \neverybody in the United States is in the President's district, but it \nwould also affect local districts as well. With that, that wraps up the \ndiscussion of my proposed constitutional amendment.\n  I want to talk a little bit about John Sarbanes' bill, and I think it \nis a fine bill. It is not a constitutional amendment. What it does is \nit gives you a tax credit for money that you can contribute to a \ncampaign. So if you can contribute $50 to a campaign, then you get a \ntax credit of $50, which means money back on your income tax return; \nthe same amount that you contribute, you get back. But also it matches \nthat contribution by 6 to 1. So you will end up giving the candidate \nquite a bit more than you are actually contributing. It is a good \nmeasure. It is a good proposal. It would sort of even out the effect of \nPACs. I find myself supporting that.\n  Again, my colleague, Ted Deutch, has a couple of constitutional \namendments in the 114th Congress. One of them is called Democracies for \nAll, H.J. Res. 119, and also H.J. Res. 22 that creates funding limits \nand creates a distinction between individuals and corporations, but \nwhat it really does is allows Congress to limit, to enact laws that \nwill be enforceable and not overturned by the Supreme Court.\n  We have Van Hollen in the 114th Congress, H.R. 430, and what this \ndoes is it requires disclosure so that when campaign contributions are \nmade, we can determine who made those contributions--very important. I \nthink it would make a big difference.\n  Then we have a number of proposals to create public financing. My \ncolleague from Kentucky, John Yarmuth, had one in the 113th Congress, \nFair Elections Now Act. In the 114th Congress, which is this Congress, \nDavid Price has H.R. 424, which establishes a system of public \nfinancing.\n  These are all good. I think I would be supportive of any of these \nkinds of approaches. I think the American public needs to be protected. \nI think our cherished Democratic and Republican institutions are a \nthreat here, whether it is because candidates are bombarded by negative \nads, whether it is because candidates are influenced by big donors, \nwhether it is because more and more money is coming in to these \nelections every single cycle. There is a lot of reasons why we need to \nlook at campaign financing and select one of these approaches and go \nwith it and change the system that we have to a system that really does \nrespond to the American public.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3385-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Chaffetz (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and the \nbalance of the week on account of an unscheduled medical procedure.\n  Mr. Donovan (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and the \nbalance of the week on account of the birth of his first child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/house-section/article/H3385-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
