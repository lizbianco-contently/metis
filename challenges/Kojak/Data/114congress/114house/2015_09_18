Madam Speaker, last week, the House of \nRepresentatives thoughtfully voted three times to oppose the Iranian \nnuclear deal. This bipartisan effort represented the will of the \nAmerican people, where the majority oppose this deal. The first vote \nwas a sense of Congress that the President failed to comply with the \nlaw to submit all agreements to Congress. The second vote was to defeat \nthe deal, and the third vote was to prevent the President from lifting \nsanctions on Iran until 2017.\n  I am grateful to Chairman Ed Royce for his leadership in holding \nhearings and advancing legislation to fight this dangerous deal. Sadly, \nthey are blocked in the Senate by Democrats who fail to see the threats \nof ``death to America,'' ``death to Israel.''\n  This is a historic mistake. The President is flooding billions of \ndollars to the Iranian regime to fund terrorist attacks and has paved \nthe way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. The President's legacy in \nthe Middle East, failing to enforce the red line in Syria, has led to \nthe refugee crisis and chaos, with children drowned at sea. American \nfamilies deserve peace through strength.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n[[Page H6142]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6142-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING MIKE HARPER ON HIS 88TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  (Mr. ASHFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Mike \nHarper, on his 88th birthday. Mr. Harper served as the CEO of ConAgra, \nan agricultural giant and Fortune 500 company headquartered in the \nheart of my district.\n  In 1975, Mike came to Omaha to take the helm at ConAgra and presided \nover a massive expansion of business in Nebraska. By 1987, though, \nNebraska was emerging from the farm crisis and feared the loss of \nsignificant corporate presence. Mike personally spearheaded the effort \nto reform State taxes and regulations that made corporate investment \nburdensome.\n  Between 1975, when Mike took over as CEO of ConAgra, and 1987, the \nprofits of ConAgra soared, as did the fortunes of business in Nebraska. \nThanks to Mike's leadership in business and politics, Nebraska now has \none of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. My district in \nparticular enjoys a well-balanced economy, including manufacturing, \nagriculture, and a wide array of services.\n  On this day, I wish to rise to applaud this giant of the agriculture \nindustry and a major contributor to the expansion and preservation of \nNebraska's local economy.\n  Happy birthday to Mike Harper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6142-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING NAPPANEE MAYOR LARRY THOMPSON ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Nappanee \nMayor Larry Thompson on his retirement. A devoted husband and proud \nfather, Mayor Thompson has dedicated his life to serving his community. \nHe and his wife, Linda, grew up in the Nappanee area and, along with \nhis two children, run their family funeral home business.\n  Since his election in 1995, he has been instrumental in making \nNappanee one of the most vibrant cities in the State of Indiana. He \nhelped establish the Boys and Girls Club of Nappanee and created the \nWest Industrial Park.\n  In the aftermath of an F3 tornado that struck Nappanee in 2007, \nThompson led a coalition of community leaders to help rebuild the parts \nof the city that had been destroyed or damaged.\n  In addition to his work in the public sector, Mayor Thompson is an \nactive member of the community, involved with Kiwanis and the American \nRed Cross. He has dedicated his life to public service.\n  God bless you, Larry, in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6142-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REPUBLICAN CALENDAR OF CHAOS\n\n  (Mr. ISRAEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, House Republicans are giving us a fall \ncalendar of chaos. We have 5 legislative days before they shut the \ngovernment down.\n  Madam Speaker, this is a bad rerun of bad policy. Two years ago, \npeople said they would never shut it down, and they did it. When they \nshut it down, it cost the economy $24 billion, and 120,000 jobs were \nlost; and they are going to do it again in 5 days.\n  That is not the only deadline, Madam Speaker, in this calendar of \nchaos. They have missed a deadline for the highway trust fund, costing \nmore jobs. We are careening towards another fiscal cliff with the debt \nceiling. They missed the deadline for the Export-Import Bank, which \ncost a bunch of jobs, 500 lost jobs, as a result of this calendar of \nchaos.\n  And there is more. Madam Speaker, the American people, everyday \nAmericans, do not deserve this Republican calendar of chaos.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6142-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FEDERAL WILDLAND FIREFIGHTER RECOGNITION ACT\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, this year, 8\\1/2\\ million acres so far \nhave been consumed due to wildfire. This is approaching the record that \nwe don't want to break of 10 million that happened in 2006.\n  Recently, the Forest Service in this year's wildland fire season has \nspent $243 million just in the last week of August alone. We have \n30,000 American firefighters deployed, as well as hundreds from \nAustralia, New Zealand, and Canada. Despite this dedication, the \ncurrent Federal firefighters are given erroneous job titles, such as \nwildland technician or forestry technician.\n  H.R. 3363, the Federal Wildland Firefighter Recognition Act, would \ngive them the proper title of wildland firefighters and allows those \nwho risk their lives to be recognized properly and given the respect \nthey deserve. Let's pass H.R. 3363 to give them their proper title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6142-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STOP PUTTING WOMEN'S HEALTH AT RISK\n\n  (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Speaker, we have less than 5 legislative days here \nin Washington before the end of this fiscal year, but instead of \nfunding the government, House majority leadership is focused on \ndefunding Planned Parenthood.\n  For nearly a century, Planned Parenthood has been one of the Nation's \nleading providers of high quality, affordable health care for women. It \nhas fundamentally changed attitudes towards women's reproductive \nfreedom, which has been essential to women's health and given women \nmore control over their health care decisions.\n  One in five women has relied on a Planned Parenthood health center \nfor care in her lifetime. They are often one of the few affordable \nplaces for women to turn when they are searching for care. Cutting \nFederal funds to Planned Parenthood means taking away money for \ncervical cancer screenings, breast care screenings, and other types of \nnecessary care.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to \ncome to the table and negotiate a way to fund the government and to \nstop these political games that put women's health at risk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6142-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6142-H6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING CHRISTOPHE JEANNIN AND HIS FAMILY ON BECOMING U.S. CITIZENS\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Citizenship Day, \nobserved yesterday, September 17, to recognize all who have become \ncitizens of our great Nation.\n  The 10th Congressional District in Illinois is a place where \nthousands of immigrants have started and grown their businesses, raised \ntheir families, and achieved the American Dream.\n  Madam Speaker, I believe America is a place where goals can be \naccomplished and the doors of opportunity are always open for those who \nwork hard.\n  Earlier this week, I had the privilege of attending a Naturalization \nOath Ceremony for some very good friends, the Jeannin family in \nChicago. It was a ceremony in Judge Sam Der-Yeghiayan's chambers, and \nChristophe, Natalie, Audrey, and Alex all raised their right hand to \nswear allegiance to the United States of America.\n  Madam Speaker, Christophe came to the United States with his family \nin the late seventies. His mother and father--Gerard and Madeline--and \nhis sisters--Dominique, Sophie, and Ann--were all here and were \ncontributing members of our community. They have all since left, but \nChristophe has remained.\n  Madam Speaker, the Jeannin family is just one example of immigrants \nwho have made a tremendous impact in our community. We are stronger and \na more diverse community because of immigrants that call our Nation \nhome.\n  I want to congratulate Christophe, Natalie, Audrey, Alex, and all of \nthe citizens this week that have become United States citizens. \nCongratulations.\n\n[[Page H6143]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6143-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, last night, nearly 80 of my colleagues \njoined me in sending a letter to Speaker Boehner urging him to keep the \nHouse in session every day until we reach a solution that prevents a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  In 2013, we saw how badly a shutdown damaged our economy: $24 billion \nin lost economic activity, 120,000 fewer private sector jobs created \nduring the shutdown, and 20,000 veterans disabilities claims per week \nthat were stalled. And yet even though we have nearly 2 weeks left \nbefore a shutdown would happen, there are only 5 days of scheduled \nactivity in this House Chamber.\n  The American people can't afford another self-inflicted Washington \nwound on our economy. The stakes are just too high to take even a day \noff. We owe it to working families, seniors, and veterans across our \nNation to get the job done right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6143-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF IRANIAN TERRORISM ACT\n\n  (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to seek justice for victims of \nIran's state-sponsored terror.\n  One of those victims is Chief Petty Officer Robert Stethem. In June \n1985, Petty Officer Stethem, 23 years old, was murdered by Hezbollah \nterrorists aboard hijacked TWA Flight 847 in Beirut. He was executed \nwhen the hijackers realized he was a United States servicemember. They \ntortured him, and then they murdered him in cold blood before leaving \nhis body on the tarmac below the plane.\n  Madam Speaker, Hezbollah is one of Iran's most lethal terrorist \nproxies. In 2002, a Federal judge ordered Iran to pay more than $320 \nmillion to Stethem's family and other victims of Flight 847's \nhijacking. It is one of the more than 80 judgments that require Iran to \npay $43 billion to victims of its radical allies. Not one dime has been \npaid.\n  Despite Iran's refusal to compensate its victims, it will soon get a \n$150 billion windfall from the end of the sanctions under the proposed \nnuclear deal. In short, Iran's hardliners will get a payday while their \nvictims await billions of dollars in compensation.\n  Madam Speaker, I have introduced legislation, the Justice for Victims \nof Iranian Terrorism Act, which prohibits the removal of sanctions \nuntil Iran pays every penny it owes. It is the least we can do for \nvictims like Chief Petty Officer Stethem and the families that suffered \nat Iran's hands, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6143-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GALLEGO.

Requirements pertaining to born-alive abortion survivors.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Judy Chu) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 3504, \ncurrently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Millions of people have viewed videos of representatives of the \norganization Planned Parenthood, which performs some 40 percent of all \nabortions each year. Those videos, recorded undercover, include \ndiscussions of instances in which during the course of an attempted \nabortion a baby is born ``intact.''\n  As one doctor caught on tape said: ``Sometimes . . . if someone \ndelivers before we get to see them for a procedure, then they''--the \nbabies--``are intact. But that's not what we go for.''\n  Another business executive said: ``If you had intact cases, which \nwe've done a lot, we sometimes ship those back to our lab in its \nentirety.''\n  A procurement manager says on a video: ``I literally have had women \ncome in and they'll go in the OR''--the operating room--``and they're \nback out in 3 minutes, and I'm going, `What's going on?' `Oh, yeah. The \nfetus was already in the vaginal canal whenever we put her in the \nstirrups. It just fell out.' ''\n  A former employee of the same company told investigators that she was \nshown the results of one abortion by a doctor, and she recalls: ``This \nis the most gestated fetus and the closest thing to a baby I've seen . \n. . and she''--the doctor--``taps the heart and it starts beating . . . \nThe nodes were still firing and I don't know if that means it's \ntechnically dead or it's alive. It had a face. It wasn't completely \ntorn up. Its nose was very pronounced. It had eyelids . . . Since the \nfetus was so intact, she said, `Ok. Well, this is a really good fetus \nand it looks like we can procure a lot from it. We're going to procure \na brain . . . That means we're going to have to cut the head open.' She \ntakes a scissors and she makes a small incision right here''--at the \nchin--``and goes, I would say, maybe a little bit through the mouth, \nand she's like, `Ok. Can you go the rest of the way?'. . . And so she \ngave me the scissors and told me that I have to cut down the middle of \nthe face. And I can't even describe what that feels like.''\n  The House Judiciary Committee, which I chair, is undergoing a \ncomprehensive investigation of the issues raised by these videos. But \nas that and other investigations continue, Congress must move \nimmediately to protect any children born alive during the course of a \nfailed abortion.\n  The bill before us today is simple, yet profound, insofar as it might \nbe a reflection of the Nation's conscience.\n  Its operative provisions provide that, in the case of an abortion \nthat results in a child's being born alive, any healthcare practitioner \npresent must exercise the same degree of professional care to preserve \nthe life of the child as he or she would render to any other child born \nalive at the same gestational age. The bill also provides that the \nchild must be immediately transported and admitted to a hospital.\n  If a baby born alive is left to die, the penalty can be up to 5 years \nin jail. If the child is cut open for its body parts or some other \novert act is taken, the punishment is that for first degree murder, \nwhich can include life in prison or the death penalty.\n  Babies are born alive during failed abortions. Just last week, the \ncommittee heard direct testimony by two grown women who, as babies, \nsurvived attempted abortions. The mother of one of them, Gianna Jessen, \nwas advised by Planned Parenthood to have an abortion.\n  But, as Ms. Jessen testified, ``Instead of dying, after 18 hours of \nbeing burned in my mother's womb, I was delivered alive in an abortion \nclinic in Los Angeles.'' Her medical records state clearly that she was \n``born alive'' during an abortion.\n  She continued: ``Thankfully, the abortionist was not at work yet. Had \nhe been there, he would have ended my life with strangulation, \nsuffocation, or leaving me there to die. Instead, a nurse called an \nambulance, and I was rushed to a hospital. Doctors did not expect me to \nlive. I did. I was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which was \ncaused by a lack of oxygen to my brain while surviving the abortion. I \nwas never supposed to hold my head up or walk. I do. And cerebral palsy \nis a great gift to me.''\n  Just think of that for a moment. Ms. Jessen says cerebral palsy is a \ngift to her because it came with the gift of life. Ms. Jessen presented \na picture at the hearing, showing the results of the sort of abortion \nshe survived.\n  Today, I ask the Nation to see in its collective mind the body of a \nbaby, much like this one, on the floor, born alive during a failed \nabortion. I ask that we collectively reach down into our hearts and, \nalso, reach down to the floor.\n  As we vote today, I ask that we, as a nation, grasp the value of life \nand, also, grasp that baby's back, lift its tiny body off the ground, \nand take it to a hospital--and not leave her with the abortionist.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Contrary to its misleading title, this bill is not about protecting \nchildren born alive. Its real intent is to further undermine a woman's \nright to choose, a right that has been constitutionally guaranteed for \nmore than 42 years by Roe v. Wade.\n  Not only does this bill attempt to politicize women's health and to \nlimit women's access to abortion, it would interfere with the sacred \ndoctor-patient relationship and substitute a physician's best judgment \nwith the judgment of a handful of politicians'.\n  We must not forget that this bill has come to the floor at the same \ntime as the push to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  This attack on a venerable and respected provider of high-quality \nhealth care would have a devastating impact on women, especially women \nin rural communities, low-income women, and women of color, and it \nwould deny women access to preventive care, life-saving cancer \nscreenings, and family planning services.\n  Approximately one woman in five has relied on Planned Parenthood for \nhealth care at some point in her lifetime. It is a blatant attack on \nwomen and families to defund an organization that uses Federal funds to \nprevent abortions and to help families stay healthy and cannot even use \nFederal funding for abortion.\n  It would be the saddest of ironies that, by defunding Planned \nParenthood's critical contraception and other reproductive health \nservices in the name of opposing abortion, we would see more unintended \npregnancies and, therefore, more abortions.\n\n  Among its flaws, H.R. 3504 proposes a standard of care for abortion \nproviders that could interfere with the ability of physicians to make \nmedical decisions for their patients.\n  In doing so, the bill represents an unprecedented level of intrusion \nby the government into medical decisions.\n  For instance, the bill requires an abortion provider to immediately \ntransport a fetus to a hospital in some cases even if the fetus is not \nviable under existing law and under the standards of care applicable to \nneonatal physicians.\n  This requirement is so broad and the penalties so severe--up to 5 \nyears in prison--that one can only conclude that the real purpose of \nthe bill is to intimidate abortion providers out of service.\n  The bill also requires doctors and employees of hospitals and clinics \nthat provide abortion services to report any violations of the bill's \nstandard of care\n\n[[Page H6145]]\n\nto State or Federal law enforcement authorities.\n  Any person who fails to comply with these requirements is threatened \nwith fines and up to 5 years in prison. This is not just the doctors \nbut the cleaning crew and the receptionists.\n  On top of this, the language in this bill completely fails to \ndistinguish between a viable and non-viable fetus, which is the \nconstitutional line that separates abortions that may be performed \nwithout restrictions from those that may be regulated or prohibited.\n  The bill's vague and broad mandates, combined with severe penalties, \nwill effectively intimidate doctors and ultimately drive them away from \nthe abortion practice, which appears to be the true intent of this \ntroubling bill.\n  This is why so many organizations are opposed to this bill, those \nlike the National Women's Law Center, the AAUW, the ACLU, and \nPhysicians for Reproductive Choice and Health.\n  In fact, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nwhich represents 58,000 physicians, opposes H.R. 3504 because it \nrepresents a gross interference in the practice of medicine, inserting \na politician between a woman and her doctor.\n  By intimidating doctors and thereby making abortion unavailable as a \npractical matter, abortion opponents seek to accomplish, in fact, what \nthey have not accomplished in the courts or in public opinion. Simply \nput, H.R. 3504 is yet another attack on women's health and rights.\n  When the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act, or BAIPA, became law 13 \nyears ago, the bill's sponsors clarified that the law was not intended \nto affect abortion practice or a woman's right to choose.\n  We did not want to constrain or chill medical decisions regarding \npatient care. That is why Judiciary Committee Democrats voted to \nsupport it.\n  The bill before us today appears to directly contradict those \nassurances. Let's not forget that politicians are not doctors.\n  We should be concerned about doing our jobs and fully funding high-\nquality women's health care instead of trying to keep doctors from \ndoing theirs. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous \nbill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Franks), the chairman of the Constitution and Civil \nJustice Subcommittee and the author of this legislation.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman. I also thank the \ngentleman for his commitment to protecting these little babies.\n  Madam Speaker, the United States of America is an exceptional nation, \nwhose unique core premise is that declared conviction that we are all \ncreated equal and that each of us is endowed by our Creator with the \ninalienable right to live.\n  Abraham Lincoln called upon all of us in this Chamber to remember \nthose words of America's Founding Fathers and ``their enlightened \nbelief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent \ninto the world to be trodden on or degraded and imbruted by its \nfellows.''\n  He reminded those he called posterity that ``when in the distant \nfuture some man, some factions, some interests should set up a doctrine \nthat some were not entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness that `their posterity' ''--that is us, Madam Speaker--``might \nlook up again to the Declaration of Independence and take courage to \nrenew the battle which their fathers began.''\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Madam Speaker, the sincerest purpose of the Born-Alive Abortion \nSurvivors Protection Act is to renew that noble battle to respect and \nprotect those little fellow human beings among us who are this moment \nbeing trodden on and degraded and imbruted by their fellows.\n  Not long ago, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, \nauthorities entered the clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell and found a \ntorture chamber for little born-alive babies that defies description \nwithin the constraints of the English language.\n  The grand jury report at that time said, ``Dr. Kermit Gosnell had a \nsimple solution for unwanted babies: he killed them. He didn't call it \nthat. He called it `ensuring fetal demise.' The way he ensured fetal \ndemise was by sticking scissors in the back of the baby's neck and \ncutting the spinal cord. He called it `snipping.' Over the years there \nwere hundreds of `snippings'.''\n  Ashley Baldwin, one of Dr. Gosnell's employees, said she saw babies \nbreathing, and she described one as 2 feet long that no longer had eyes \nor a mouth, but, in her words, was making like this screeching noise \nand it ``sounded like a little alien.''\n  And now, in recent days, Madam Speaker, numerous video recordings \nhave been released that demonstrate that Kermit Gosnell was just the \ntip of the iceberg of the abortion industry's unspeakable cruelty to \nthese little children of God.\n  The veil has now been pulled back, and all of us now see the walls \nbehind the abortion industry and the horrifying plight of its little \nhuman victims, who we must not forget, are also the least of these, our \nlittle brothers and sisters.\n  Our response, as a people and a Nation, to these horrors shown in \nthese videos is vital to everything those lying out in Arlington \nNational Cemetery died to save.\n  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, Madam Speaker, \nprotects little children who have been born alive. No one in this body \ncan obscure the humanity and the personhood of these little born-alive \nbabies, nor can they take refuge within the schizophrenic paradox Roe \nv. Wade has subjected this country to, for now, more than 40 years.\n  The abortion industry has labored all these decades to convince the \nworld that unborn children and born children should be completely \nseparated in our minds, that while born children are persons worthy of \nprotection, unborn children are not persons and are not worthy of \nprotection.\n  But, Madam Speaker, those who oppose this bill to protect born-alive \nbabies now have the impossible task of trying to join born children and \nunborn children back together again and then trying to convince all of \nus to condemn them both as inhuman and not worthy of protection after \nall.\n  To anyone who has not invincibly hardened their heart and soul, Madam \nSpeaker, an honest consideration of this absurd inconsistency is \nprofoundly enlightening.\n  Because, you see, this country has faced such paradox and self-\nimposed blindness before. There was a time that our own House rules \nbanned any discussion or debate in this Chamber about the effort to end \nhuman slavery in America.\n  But, Madam Speaker, that debate did come and with it came a time when \nthe humanity of the victims and the inhumanity of what was being done \nto them became so glaring even to the hardest of hearts that it moved \nan entire nation of people to find the compassion and the courage in \ntheir own souls to change their position.\n  Now, to this generation, Madam Speaker, that time has come again.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), an outstanding and leading member \nof our Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, God bless the United States Supreme Court \nfor its Roe v. Wade decision that liberated the women of this country \nto make their own decisions, to exercise their own consciences in the \nmost intensely private matter of whether they should carry a pregnancy \nto term.\n  Now, I recognize, of course, that there are those who hold the \nreligious conviction that a one-celled organism--one cell, two cells--\nis a fully formed human being.\n  They are entitled to religious conviction. They are not entitled to \nimpose that religious conviction on all the women of this country who \nmay not share it. That is essentially the abortion debate.\n  We are not debating abortion today, although some people would like \nto. We are debating this ridiculous Born-Alive Survivors Protection \nAct.\n  Fifteen years ago, I stood on this floor and supported the Born-Alive \nInfants Protection Act. I said it was unnecessary. It simply repeated \nexisting law.\n  It has always been the law that, if an infant is born, whether that \nbirth was\n\n[[Page H6146]]\n\nintentional or not is irrelevant, that that is a person. If you kill \nthat infant, you are guilty of murder or manslaughter, as the case may \nbe. You certainly may not do so intentionally.\n  The Born-Alive Infant Protection Act did not change that. It just \nadded superfluous language to the law. Its only purpose was to try to \npaint people who support the right to choose and supporters of \ninfanticide.\n  So we said, no, it is silly because it doesn't add anything to the \nlaw. It simply duplicates the existing law, but we will support it so \nwe cannot be slandered that way.\n  Now we have this bill, which does essentially two things. One, it \nrepeats, in different language, exactly the same provisions from 15 \nyears ago.\n  It doesn't change the law that we enacted 15 years ago, and it \ndoesn't change the law that preexisted in every State of the Union. If \nyou kill a child, it is murder, period.\n  Dr. Gosnell, I would point out, is in jail for life because he \ncommitted multiple murders. Nobody, but nobody, supports what he does \nand nobody, except in some of their fantasies that Mr. Franks says, \nthinks that Planned Parenthood or anybody else supports such actions.\n  This bill, however, cannot be supported because it does one harmful \nthing. This bill says that the born-alive child must be given the same \nstandard of care whether he is born alive in an attempted abortion or \nfrom a regular birth.\n  That is already the law. Of course, it is the law. It ought to be the \nlaw. It must be the law. It always has been the law.\n  What it also does is it says that, as soon as the doctor has given \nthat child the proper standard of care, he must rush him to the \nhospital, regardless of whether that might be good or bad for the \nchild, regardless of the standard of care, regardless of whether the \nnearby hospital has neonatal intensive care units.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. NADLER. Of course, everybody associated with the doctor, under \nexisting law, has the duty of giving the best possible medical care \nunder any circumstances. That may be to transport the baby to the \nhospital. It may be that the baby is too frail to transport.\n\n  But along comes this bill that says: We don't care about the real \nsituation that doctor faces with that infant. We know how to practice \nmedicine in every situation--we, in Congress--so we are going to say it \nmust be brought to the hospital even if that might kill the child.\n  It is just stupid, and that is why this bill must be opposed, not \nbecause it changes the standard of law or has anything to do with born-\nalive infants, but because it mandates that a child be brought to the \nhospital when medical care might indicate that that child in that \nsituation should not be brought to the hospital. It may kill children. \nThat is why we must oppose this bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Fleming).\n  Mr. FLEMING. Madam Speaker, as a physician, a father and a \ngrandfather, let me first respond and say that, in the process of a \nbirth, an abortion, there is no way one can tell whether that child is \nviable until you actually apply health-saving tools and techniques to \nthat baby. So that argument that viability and all of that made in \nadvance really makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Look, committing abortions is not health care for women. The baby \ndies a horrifically painful and ghastly death. Her tiny hands and feet, \nbrain, and spinal tissues are dissected and sold to the highest bidder, \nand her mother is agonizing over the loss of a child.\n  What happens if a child survives this barbaric and inhumane murder \nattempt? Abortionists have been known to snip babies' spines, throw \nchildren into plastic bags, or leave the infant to die, away from a \nhuman touch and healing care.\n  Today's bill, however, will put a stop to the double murder attempt \non a baby's life. It will protect children, infants, who are born \nalive, affording these tiny patients immediate medical attention.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I stand in strong \nopposition to this punitive and intrusive bill. I am both disturbed and \noffended that this latest attempt to restrict women's access to \nreproductive health care is based on a series of videos that have been \nfound to be grotesquely deceptive and purposefully misleading.\n  This is politics at its most manipulative, and politics should never \nbe permitted to come between a patient and her doctor.\n  This bill attempts to criminalize legal medical care and punish \nmillions of women by rolling back reproductive choices. It wages a kind \nof guerilla warfare against Roe v. Wade by threatening doctors with \njail time for providing care to their patients.\n  The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls the \nvague requirements and drastic penalties--unnecessary requirements like \ngoing to the hospital--scare tactics that are unnecessary and wrong.\n  This bill would have the Federal Government threaten doctors who do \ntheir job taking care of their patients with up to 5 years' \nimprisonment.\n  To make it all even more outrageous, this bill is based on a series \nof unsupported allegations and it ignores the fact that there has been \nno evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood.\n  In fact, five States have now conducted their own investigations into \nthe charges against Planned Parenthood and have found that no laws have \nbeen broken.\n  Instead, the backers of this bill rely on misleading, badly doctored \nvideos released by an extreme antichoice group as the basis for a slew \nof legislation to decrease access to care for women in this country who \ncan least afford it. Millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood for \ntheir basic health care.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. There is no choice in this \ncountry which has been guaranteed by our Supreme Court without access \nto choice. This bill attempts to stop the access to choice by putting \ndoctors in jail by absurd requirements.\n  I urge my colleagues to respect the relationship between women and \ntheir doctors, respect their need for affordable and available health \ncare, and vote ``no'' on this punitive and intrusive bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Roskam).\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, my heart is heavy with this debate. My \nheart becomes very heavy when I hear the descriptions of this awful \nprocedure.\n  My heart becomes even heavier, Madam Speaker, when I listen to the \ntwisted logic and the distortions of people who find themselves \nimplicitly defending this.\n  President Obama has said that he will veto this because it is related \nto abortion services. Yet, Mr. Nadler moments ago said this has nothing \nto do with abortion, that everybody agrees that these babies are born \nand deserve the protections of the law. He says, basically, it is a \nsideshow. It is either one or the other, Madam Speaker, and they don't \nget to argue it both ways.\n  But I think we ought to be able to agree on this, that we are talking \nabout people who are born, who are breathing, whose hearts are pumping, \nwhose fingers are twitching, who have full feeling and deserve every \nbenefit of the doubt and every protection of the law.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), a leading physician in our \nCongress.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, as an emergency physician I am deeply \ndisturbed by the provisions in this legislation. The Born-Alive Infants \nProtection Act was signed into law in 2002. The pro-choice community \ndid not oppose it, and it passed the House by a voice vote under \nsuspension of the rules. It was consistent with the already high \nmedical and ethical standards within the physician community.\n\n[[Page H6147]]\n\n  This new bill, however, is unnecessary and dangerous. It criminalizes \nphysicians who make serious and compassionate decisions based on their \ndeep desire to do what is best for the mother, her health, and life. It \ncreates a police state and forces healthcare staffs that do not have \nmedical training to inform law enforcement of their nonmedical \nquestioning of a physician's sound judgment under the threat of \nprosecution and imprisonment. This also gives anti-choice lawyers the \nability to bully, threaten, and harm a physician's reputation and \npractice.\n  Infanticide is already illegal in this country. This bill is highly \nintrusive to the patient-doctor relationship. Let's be clear. This is \nyet another attempt by anti-choice bully politicians to restrict a \nwoman's right to choose and doctors' ability to provide sound, \ncompassionate, and safe care for women. It is an aggressive, bullish \nscare tactic that puts the relationship of the woman and her physician \nin jeopardy and forces politicians in the middle of decisions that they \nhave no business being involved in.\n  I agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nand other physician groups in opposing this legislation. I stand with \nthe women across this great country that have continued to fight for \ndecades to defend their legal right to choose.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Smith), a champion of this cause.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, undercover videos by The \nCenter for Medical Progress have again brought into sharp focus that \nsome babies actually survive abortion.\n  Dr. Ginde, medical director of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains, \nsays: ``sometimes we get--if somebody delivers before we see them for a \nprocedure that they are intact . . .'' That is, Madam Speaker, born \nalive, breathing, crying, gasping for air. One fetal tissue broker \ndescribes in the video watching a fetus that just ``fell out'' and was \nleft to die.\n  We have a duty to protect these vulnerable children from violence, \nexploitation, and death. Humanitarian due diligence requires that born-\nalive babies be taken to a hospital to obtain care and enhance his or \nher prospects of survival. Abortion clinics, to the contrary, do not \nhave neonatal intensive care units. They are not equipped to protect \nthose children. They are in the business of killing those children--not \nsaving them.\n  The grand jury in the abortionist Kermit Gosnell case said: ``Gosnell \nhad a simple solution for unwanted babies. He killed them.'' He \neuphemistically called ``snipping'' the born-alive baby's spinal cord \n``ensuring fetal demise.''\n  Last week, Gianna Jessen, as Bob Goodlatte noted earlier, an abortion \nsurvivor, told his Committee on the Judiciary she had survived a \nPlanned Parenthood late-term, multihour abortion because ``the \nabortionist had not yet begun the work. Had he been there, he would \nhave ended my life with strangulation, suffocation, or leaving me there \nto die.''\n  The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, authored by pro-\nlife champion Trent Franks, simply says any child who survives an \nabortion must be given the same care as any other premature baby born \nat the same gestational age. This legislation builds on the landmark \nBorn-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, authored by Steve Chabot, by \nadding important enforcement provisions.\n  Tragically, President Obama, the abortion President, has vowed to \nveto this pro-child, human rights legislation, a position that is \nextreme, antichild, inhumane, and indefensible.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the ranking member of our \nSubcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, these are very important bills--this bill \nand the next bill--to the women of this Nation and to the people in \nAmerica because these are rights that are being under attack. There is \nthis Born-Alive bill, which came to the floor through the Committee on \nRules, and the next bill, which stops funding of Planned Parenthood, \nbut they are all part of the same thing. They are the same bill. They \nare the same message. Because what we are doing here in this Congress \nis messaging, and the message is the Republican Party wants to defeat \nRoe v. Wade. They think that that was a bad bill and that it is wrong \nto have legalized, in America, for women to have choice. Most of the \nDemocrats don't think that.\n  Neither of these bills went through the committee process, which is \nreally abhorrent. In fact, yesterday, we passed a bill about new and \nnovel ideas, saying that you get sanctions, you would be sanctioned as \na lawyer, if you brought some case that was frivolous and didn't really \ncome through the proper procedures.\n  If we had that kind of rule in Congress, these bills wouldn't be \nallowed to be on the floor, because they are supposed to go through \ncommittee where the public has notice, the public has an opportunity to \nhave a witness. The majority side has three witnesses; the minority \nside has one witness. There is a discussion; there are questions; there \nare answers; there are statements; there is thought; there is input; \nthere is due process; there is petitioning grievances.\n  All of this has been abrogated--no due process, no regular order. \nThese come straight to the floor because these are messaging bills for \nthe American public. The Republican Party and parts of the Republican \nParty often say: We want our country back. What they want back is a \ncountry that is pre-1971, before Roe v. Wade. What they want is a \ncountry that is pre-Brown v. Board of Education. What they want is a \ncountry that is pre-Voting Rights Act, which has been limited by the \nSupreme Court and which has not been renewed by this Congress, nor has \nit gotten a vote. What they want is a country that is free of many of \nthe immigrants who have come to this country and made it great, \nparticularly from South America, the Caribbean--and that country is not \ngoing to come back.\n  In my State of Tennessee, the Republicans have filed a bill to \ndeclare the Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage as illegal in \nTennessee, nullification dripping from their lips, as George Wallace \nwould say, in the courthouse door.\n  It is the same thing today: Take our country back--no Hispanics, no \nwomen's choice, no civil rights, no voting rights, Dwight D. \nEisenhower's 1950 America. And Dwight D. Eisenhower wasn't at fault. He \ntried to bring us forward.\n  These bills are part of that same attack on the progress that we have \nmade in America. They have not gone through the proper process, and \nthey are attempts to change America in a way that would affect American \nwomen adversely. This bill has a definition of abortion that is new, \nshouldn't be done.\n  I oppose both bills and the rule.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, a few years ago, a so-called doctor in \nPhiladelphia by the name of Kermit Gosnell was killing babies--\nliterally. He ran an abortion clinic there, and as can happen in these \nhouses of horror, some of these innocent, unborn children were actually \nborn alive before they could be exterminated in the womb.\n  So there you have a little now-born baby squirming, kicking, \nsometimes crying right there in front of you on the table. So what did \nGosnell do? He would take a pair of scissors, plunge them into the \nbaby, and sever his or her spinal cord. No care whatsoever about the \npain involved. One of Gosnell's employees who witnessed this barbarism \ndescribed the baby's scream as follows: ``I can't describe it. It \nsounded like a little alien.''\n  Well, this wasn't an alien. It was a human being, just like you and \nme, although in an earlier form of development. Gosnell, thank God, is \nin prison. But we have now learned that the largest abortion provider \nin this country, Planned Parenthood, is not only destroying the lives \nof little unborn children, but selling their body parts for profit.\n  I might add that Planned Parenthood aborts more babies each year in \nthis country than the population of the city of Cincinnati that I \nrepresent. That is every single year, the population of a city, \nCincinnati.\n\n[[Page H6148]]\n\n  We have got to stop this slaughter. I introduced a bill called the \nBorn-Alive Infants Protection Act, which was passed by the House and by \nthe Senate and signed into law by President Bush back in 2002. It \nhelped. The legislation before us today, introduced by Congressman \nTrent Franks, improves that law and will protect more innocent babies.\n  Please, for God's sake, let's pass it today and protect those among \nus who cannot protect themselves.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  I would like to reiterate, this is a bill that has been introduced \nwith virtually no process. This was introduced less than 48 hours ago, \nwith no hearings and no expert testimony. In fact, those on the other \nside of the aisle are citing, as evidence, videos that have been shown \nto be highly edited, that are misleading and fraudulently obtained. \nThere were 47 edits in the video that are shown. Even though Planned \nParenthood doctors said 10 times that such procedures were not done for \nprofit, that was all edited out.\n  This is legislation based on sound bites and anti-choice rhetoric and \nnot on facts.\n  I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Huelskamp).\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Madam Speaker, earlier this year, many of my \ncolleagues and I stood on this floor condemning abortionist Kermit \nGosnell for his barbaric murder of babies born alive during attempted \nabortions. Instead of providing compassionate care for these precious \nlittle babies, Gosnell muffled their cries by snipping the back of \ntheir necks with scissors, and we have people on the floor today \ndefending that.\n  No child should be treated with such violence, and no man or woman \nshould be free to perform such heinous acts of murder.\n  As an adoptive parent of four incredible children, I cannot help but \nthink of the countless couples across America who would have given \nanything to care for these babies.\n  This bill rightly affirms the humanity of all babies born alive, \nrightly affords them the full protection of the law, and punishes any \nabortionist who denies these infants their dignity and right to life.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 12\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 12\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Stutzman).\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Madam Speaker, what does it say about this Congress \nthat today we are here on the House floor debating the killing and \nharvesting of aborted babies? How can there possibly be two sides to \nthis? I don't understand. How can we not take a step back and look at \nthis objectively?\n  The gentlewoman from California mentioned that these videos were \nhighly edited. I don't know if they have watched the videos, but if you \nwatch the videos, how can you say that the doctor who is pulling salad \nfrom a salad bowl and mentions that she can take the babies and crush \nthe top and the bottom parts of the babies and harvest the body parts \nin between is highly edited? This is not. These are not. This \ninformation on these videos shows the barbaric activity.\n  These bills before us today deal with this problem. Madam Speaker, I \nimplore that this Chamber take a step back and look at what is on these \nvideos and the information that we have on these videos and realize \nthat we must move forward on these two bills and stop this barbaric \naction.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).\n  Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, this is a fundamental American value. For \nour Founders, life was the first right. They understood that there is \nan order to things that even nature teaches us. They understood and \nfully embraced that the first and foremost right is life because, \nwithout life, there is no liberty; without life, there is no pursuit of \nhappiness; without life, there is no discussion of a right to privacy \nor a right to choose; because, without life, there is nothing to \nchoose.\n  Life presupposes and precedes all other rights. Our Founders \nunderstood this, but somewhere along the way to where we are now, we \nhave gone from protecting the right that is the basis of all rights to \ndeciding that unborn children and even children born alive can have \ntheir lives taken because their organs and tissues are more valuable \nthan they are.\n  It is inconceivable that a nation founded on the idea that life is \nthe indispensable right, the indisputable right, could be at this place \nin our history when living children in their mother's womb--and even \nsome who have been born alive--can be killed with the callousness and \ncold-bloodedness that none of our forefathers would have dreamed could \nexist in America.\n  This decision whether to continue funding this barbaric practice is \nreally about exposing the charade of the Federal Government supporting \nwomen's health care, when in fact it is really about subsidizing the \nkilling and mutilation of babies with taxpayers' money. This has to \nstop.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Bera), an outstanding doctor.\n  Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, as a doctor, I find these bills troubling. \nThe oath I took is to do what is best for my patients.\n  One of these bills that is coming up today criminalizes the practice \nof medicine and questions doctors' judgments. It attempts to intimidate \ndoctors from providing safe, evidence-based medicine and from doing our \njob, which is to sit with our patients, answer their questions, and \ngive them the best medical advice and let them make the decisions that \naffect their lives.\n  This is unprecedented. It sets a precedent where those without any \nmedical training can dictate medical practice and make choices for \npatients. This definitely oversteps any legal bounds. These are choices \nthat should be made between doctors and patients.\n  Congressional interference into how we practice is overreach. It is a \ndramatic overreach, and it is dangerous because it sets a dangerous \nlegislative precedent.\n  What makes the healthcare delivery system in America so great is that \nit is accessible to folks and that we understand and protect the \ndoctor-patient privilege. That is at the very foundation of the oath we \ntake when we enter the profession of medicine.\n  Now, the other bill that we are voting on today also dramatically \nrestricts access. If you think about the number of women in America who \nget their care from Planned Parenthood, the preventive health services \nthat Planned Parenthood provides is remarkable.\n  One in five women in this country have used a Planned Parenthood \nfacility. It is a remarkably effective way for women to get their \nhealth care--and it is not just women; many men also use Planned \nParenthood.\n  We should be having the exact opposite debate. We should be talking \nabout how we can improve access to care, how we can make sure every \nAmerican has access to all of their reproductive options. We should \nwant to be talking about how we strengthen the doctor-patient \nrelationship, how we take the government out of the exam room, how we \nleave some of the most intimate choices to the doctor and the patient.\n  Again, the oath that I took when I entered the profession was to sit \nwith my patients, answer their questions, but then empower them to make \nthe choices that fit their life circumstances. That is what we should \nbe fighting for. Those are our principles. That is who we are as \nAmericans with those freedoms.\n  Madam Speaker, let's talk about how we improve access to care. Let's \ntalk about how we strengthen the doctor-patient relationship. This is \nabout protecting people.\n\n[[Page H6149]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, last week, the Judiciary Committee heard \ntestimony from people who had survived abortions. They spoke as part of \nthe House's ongoing investigation into the practices depicted in the \nhorrific videos that we have all seen.\n  One of these people who spoke was Gianna Jessen. She told the \ncommittee that, when her biological mother was 7\\1/2\\ months pregnant, \nshe went to Planned Parenthood, where they advised her mother to have \nan abortion. That is what her mother did.\n  By a miracle--and despite the best efforts to end her life--Gianna \nwas born alive; and because she was born before the abortionist had \ngotten into work, a nurse called an ambulance. Gianna was rushed to the \nhospital--and she lived--though she suffers from cerebral palsy because \nof the attempted abortion.\n  There are so many others who aren't as lucky as Gianna. The Born-\nAlive Survivors Protection Act--that is what we are voting on today--\nwill help save the lives of those children. It would impose criminal \npenalties on any medical professional who fails to give the same \nmedical attention to children born after an abortion as they would to \nany other premature newborn baby.\n  The simple fact is that, when a baby is born alive, it doesn't matter \nhow he or she was born. They are living human beings who deserve our \ncare.\n  We are also here today, Madam Speaker, to talk in particular about \nPlanned Parenthood, the organization that tried to take Gianna's life. \nI think, for the purpose of this debate, it is very important to \nunderstand what this organization is.\n  Many on the other side say that they are just devoted to women's \nhealth. The facts say something different. In the last year on record, \nthey performed 327,653 abortions. That was in 1 year. Anyone who tells \nyou that they are not in the abortion business doesn't know that \nnumber.\n  Some defend them because they provide women's health services, but \nthey don't have a monopoly on women's health. There are tens of \nthousands of alternatives all across the country for women, from \ncommunity health centers to pregnancy health centers to maternity \nhomes, medical clinics, and more. Community health clinics actually \noutnumber Planned Parenthood clinics by the thousands, and they offer \nthe same health services to women, if not more.\n  If we know that this organization performs hundreds of thousands of \nabortions per year and we know that women have access to other sources \nfor care, the question is: Should we force taxpayers to fund a business \nthat spends its money aborting 372,653 children per year? Should we \nforce taxpayers to fund an organization whose barbaric practices, as \nvividly shown in those videos, disregard and devalue the sanctity of \nthe most innocent human lives?\n\n  The gruesome videos that we have seen opened the eyes of America. As \nwe struggle to understand how something so barbaric could happen in \nthis country, we need to get all the facts. Are patients giving \nsufficient informed consent? Were the body parts of babies sold for \nprofit?\n  These--and more--are the questions we need to answer. While we find \nthose answers, we have a moral responsibility to put a moratorium on \nthe funding. There is no reason the American people should be forced to \ngive their money to such an organization. There is no reason--\nabsolutely no reason--that we must choose between funding women's \nhealth and compelling taxpayers to support abortion.\n  As we approach this vote, I want every Member to ask themselves a \nsimple question: In the face of these videos and with all the \nalternatives women have for health, why would you want to force your \nconstituents to pay for something so evil?\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, to reflect on what the gentleman from \nCalifornia was saying, recalling the testimony last week of survivors \nof abortion, their stories are remarkable. They show the deep \nappreciation that they have for their lives, and they are so grateful \nto have survived the attacks on their life. So many others who did not \nsurvive will never have the chance to express such gratitude.\n  We also know that ultrasound technology allows us to see how unborn \nchildren grow and develop; their humanity is abundantly clear and so \nshould be their right to life.\n  Our Declaration of Independence recognizes that the right to life is \ninalienable. It is given by our Creator. Indeed, President Kennedy, 54 \nyears ago, pushed back against those who would undermine this \nfundamental precept of our Nation when he recognized that ``the same \nrevolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue \naround the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the \ngenerosity of the state but from the hand of God.''\n  Giving abortion survivors the same care and legal protection that any \nother child born at the same level of gestation would receive at birth \nis humane and essential. It also complies with the equal protection \nbedrock of our country.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Messer), the chairman of the House Republican Policy \nCommittee.\n  Mr. MESSER. Madam Speaker, Proverbs 31:8 calls us all to speak for \nthose who can't speak for themselves. That is why I am here today.\n  I refuse to say nothing while Planned Parenthood executives are \nrevealed casually putting a price tag on human life and haggling over \nthe dollar value of an aborted child's lungs, kidneys, and heart. These \nactions are unthinkable.\n  This legislation is actually a modest proposal that would place an \nimmediate 1-year moratorium on all Federal funding of Planned \nParenthood. It also funds women's health by taking the half-billion \ndollars that taxpayers send to Planned Parenthood every year and \nputting it instead in the hands of community organizations and health \nclinics that focus on saving lives, not ending them.\n  Madam Speaker, no matter where you fall on the abortion debate, we \ncan all agree that no unborn child should be dismembered and sold part \nby part. Where that is happening, let's stop it and join together to \nspeak for those who can't speak for themselves.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Deutch).\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nreject these bills and to get to work. The U.S. Federal Government is \nset to shut down in a matter of days. Shouldn't we be working together \nto stop a preventable crisis that will hurt our economy and tarnish our \nNation's image? It is our job. That is what we are here to do.\n  Instead, we are debating a bill that is based on a false premise. I \nam not talking about some debunked and discredited viral videos on the \nInternet, nor am I talking about the lie that defunding Planned \nParenthood will prevent Federal dollars from funding abortion.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  As many of my colleagues have already pointed out, our laws have long \nprohibited Federal dollars from being used to pay for abortion.\n  What I am talking about, Madam Speaker, is the 28 men who wrote \nSpeaker Boehner this summer demanding--demanding--that we either defund \nPlanned Parenthood or stop funding the Federal Government: 28 men who, \nI guarantee you, have never relied on just one health provider in their \ncommunity to get a Pap smear; 28 men who, I guarantee you, have never \nhad to end a sentence about their educational goals or their financial \nor career aspirations with the phrase, ``unless I get pregnant''; 28 \nmen who hatched this plan to deny basic health care to millions of \nwomen--millions of women, I might add, that have been marginalized by \nthis Congress. Their voices are not being heard today nor are they \nbeing represented, not in these bills.\n\n[[Page H6150]]\n\n  Why?\n  Because Speaker Boehner would rather let 28 men set the agenda for \nthis entire House than seek out bipartisan support needed to fund \neducation programs, health care, veterans programs, and services for \nour seniors. That is what we should be doing.\n  Madam Speaker, these bills defund access to health care that has \nnothing--absolutely nothing--to do with abortion unless, Madam Speaker, \nI should say that we are talking about the more than 350,000 abortions \nthat Planned Parenthood prevents every year by providing contraception \nand health care and education.\n  I understand that my colleagues don't recognize the reproductive \nrights of women. I understand that is their view. I, Madam Speaker, \nrecognize that women have those rights, and I urge my colleagues to \nreject these bills.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, we must pass this bill today, the Born-\nAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.\n  We have seen the gruesome videos. They are not doctored.\n  I dare say, none of these folks that we are hearing from the other \nside of the aisle have watched them all. How can they make a \nrecommendation or an appraisal?\n  They show senior Planned Parenthood officials, former employees, and \na tissue procurement company discussing the sale of ``intact'' unborn \nbaby parts. This is disgusting. It is inhumane.\n  A society and culture that refuses to stand up and say this will not \nbe tolerated is a society that is in grave danger.\n  A child born alive during an abortion procedure is the most \nvulnerable living human being on Earth, and they should be granted full \nlegal protections. Medical practitioners who fail to provide necessary \ncare for that baby must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, \nand this bill does just that.\n  While it is so sad that an act of Congress is required to ensure such \ncompassionate care, we must do all we can to provide for the safety of \nbabies that are born alive as a result of failed abortion procedures. \nIt is absolutely necessary that we end this inhumane practice today.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support today of the Born-Alive \nAbortion Survivors Protection Act. I would like to thank the chairman \nand Mr. Franks for their leadership on this issue.\n  This issue is very personal to me. My mother chose life, and I was \nadopted as a newborn.\n  When a baby is born alive after an abortion, healthcare professionals \nonly have seconds to react. These children deserve the same level of \ncommitment and care as a child facing any other medical emergency.\n  This bill holds healthcare professionals accountable for making the \nhealth and well-being of a baby who survives an abortion their first \npriority and for making every effort to provide the resources needed to \nkeep that child alive.\n  This bill should not divide us. It is about saving lives. We all talk \nabout giving voice to the most vulnerable children in our communities \nand to the elderly with disabilities. Who is more vulnerable than a \nchild whose life begins just as someone tries to end it?\n  My mother gave me the gift of life, and I believe every child should \nreceive that same gift.\n  This is not about the ``Wizard of Oz'' strategy the other side wants \nto portray and that doesn't pay any attention to the man behind the \ncurtain. This is about the true sense of protecting life.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Foxx). The gentleman from Virginia has \n5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Brady).\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, my wife and I are adoptive \nparents. We have a family only because two women in very difficult \nsituations chose life. So this issue of protecting the unborn is dear \nto me and my family, which is why, whether you are pro-choice or \nstrongly pro-life, as I am, I think Americans can agree, we should \nnever use taxpayer dollars to fund these abortions, and we should never \nuse taxpayer dollars to reward organizations that harvest the unborn \nlives or tissues for profit or compensation. These are gruesome \npractices.\n  It is time to defund any organization, Planned Parenthood or others, \nand to begin to seek criminal penalties against those who profited from \nthe sale of body parts of unborn children. This is the true human \nrights issue of our time, and those who defend this funding or these \ngruesome practices are on the wrong side of history.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I do thank the distinguished \ngentleman for yielding and, again, I want to thank Chairman Bob \nGoodlatte for doing such an extraordinarily effective job as chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, a true human rights champion and a man who \nreally understands these issues.\n  Last week's hearing with Gianna Jessen and another abortion survivor \nunderscores the fact that there are abortion survivors. I remember, \nyears ago, there was a Philadelphia Inquirer article, called, ``The \nDreaded Complication,'' and it was all about all of the children who \nsurvived later-term abortions.\n  And do you know what the response of the abortion lobby was? We need \na better death ensuring method of abortion, a more effective and \nefficacious method, to destroy those babies. That was part of the \ngenesis of the hideous partial-birth abortion method--a method that \nactually suctions out the brain tissue of a child before birth, thus \nensuring there won't be a child born-alive.\n  Let me also say, people on the other side were talking earlier about \nthe relationship between doctor and patient. What about the new \npatient, that unborn child who is now a newly born child? Where is the \ndoctor-patient relationship to help that child?\n  Abortion clinics are in the business of exterminating children \nthrough dismemberment and chemical poisoning. That is what abortionists \ndo. Getting this child to a hospital ensures that lifesaving care will \nbe provided. Healers have a mindset that says we need to save these \nchildren, the means to do so, including intensive care capability. \nAbortionists believe abortion means dead baby--born or newly born.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Roe).\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Having spent over 30 \nyears as a practicing OB/GYN physician, delivering almost 5,000 babies \nand trying to save every life of every mother and every baby, I don't \nsee why this is not something that brings us all together.\n  Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, if a baby survives an \nabortion, we should do everything we can to save that baby's life and \nto give it the same chance that everybody else has.\n  I am getting emotional here because it is an emotional issue for me. \nI cannot imagine, as a physician, standing beside a baby that has been \ndelivered--no one in this room can; I don't believe there is another \nperson in this room that has done what I have--and not try to save that \nbaby's life.\n  I strongly support this bill. It should pass overwhelmingly, and it \nshould be the law of the land.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n\n[[Page H6151]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I have just one speaker remaining, and \nI believe I have the right to close.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I have one speaker \nremaining, and then I will be prepared to close.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois \n(Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.\n  Madam Speaker, I just want to say that there is the implication in \nthe testimony and in the speeches that are made here that the other \nside of the aisle is somehow more concerned about the life of a child \nborn alive, that somehow Democrats just don't care about that, and I \njust want to tell you I resent that so very, very much.\n  We unanimously voted to protect that life. And if, in fact, a baby is \nborn into this world and can survive and is alive, it is considered \nhomicide to kill that baby. There are laws. There are laws that would \nprotect the life of an infant, a real child that is born that can \nsustain life.\n  I just want to tell you that somehow making this division about \npeople who really care about a living person that is born is just \nfalse. And I think I am speaking for all people, for all Democrats and, \nclearly, for all Republicans, that we need to make sure that we protect \nthat life. But I believe that we have every law in place.\n  What this bill does is go further and create fear among physicians, \nhealers, people who are educated and committed to health and life, and \nput fear into them that if they don't provide for the exact procedures \nthat you are talking about, that they could spend 5 years in jail for \nproviding the healthcare services that a woman needs. That is, I \nbelieve, part of this ongoing effort to say that we should end the full \nrange of health services that are available to women. This is a further \nattack on women's health.\n  We all agree on what the outcome should be, and let's not get into \nthis ongoing fight against women's health.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill politicizes women's health and limits \nwomen's access to abortion. It interferes with the sacred doctor-\npatient relationship and substitutes a physician's best judgment with \nthe judgment of a handful of politicians--and, in fact, male \npoliticians. I would note that not a single woman on the other side of \nthe aisle has spoken on this bill.\n  Let me note, it is already illegal to fail to provide care to an \ninfant born alive. There was a bill passed 13 years ago, the Born-Alive \nInfants Protection Act, and that bill was not intended to affect \nabortion practices or a woman's right to choose. In fact, that is why \nJudiciary Committee Democrats voted to support it.\n  But what this bill does is to vilify abortion providers. This bill is \nso broad and the penalties are so severe--up to 5 years in prison--that \none can only conclude that the real purpose of this bill is to \nintimidate abortion providers out of practice.\n  This bill requires doctors and employees of hospitals and clinics \nthat provide abortion services to report any violation of the bill's \nstandard of care to State or Federal law enforcement authorities, and \nany person--remember, we are talking doctors, cleaning crew, \nreceptionists--that fails to comply with these requirements is \nthreatened with fines and up to 5 years in prison.\n  That is why the 58,000 physicians of the American Congress of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists oppose this bill and says: ``This \nlegislation represents gross interference in the practice of medicine, \ninserting a politician between a woman and her trusted doctor.''\n  Let us not forget, politicians are not doctors. We should be \nconcerned about doing our jobs and fully fund high-quality women's \nhealth care instead of trying to keep doctors from doing theirs.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the House majority whip for \nthe purpose of closing our debate.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Born-Alive Abortion \nSurvivors Protection Act offered by my friend and colleague from \nArizona, Trent Franks.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill is about standing up for the sanctity of \nlife. Specifically, this bill deals with babies that are born alive.\n  Whether it was the result of an abortion or a normal birth, all \npeople in this country deserve that same protection. Madam Speaker, why \nshould a baby that is born alive be denied that same right?\n  Our Founding Fathers, in the Declaration of Independence, made it \ncrystal clear: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men \nare created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit \nof happiness.''\n  Madam Speaker, the first unalienable right mentioned by our \nFounders--and these were not rights given to us by our Founders; they \nwere given to us by our Creator--that first right is life.\n  If a baby is born alive, they ought to have that protection. That is \nwhat this bill is about. It is about giving that protection that is \nenumerated in the Constitution and in the Declaration of Independence \nitself to say they ought to have that protection in law, that if they \nare born alive, that they ought to have that same medical protection.\n  So, Madam Speaker, when you saw the President come out yesterday and \nsay that he would veto this bill, how extreme can somebody be to say \nthey would not stand up for a baby that is born alive to have the same \nprotection that the Declaration of Independence enumerates as an \n``unalienable right''?\n  This should be a place where we can all come together, a place where \nwe can all agree that we, as a House, can come together and stand up \nand give that protection in law to those babies that are born alive.\n  I would hope that all of my colleagues would join in, that we could \nsend this bill over to the Senate, that they can have the same debate \nand agree to pass that on, and that, ultimately, the President would \nrecognize that this is a bill that ought to become law.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3504, \nthe ``Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.''\n  Contrary to its misleading title, H.R. 3504 is not about protecting \nchildren born alive. Its real intent is to further undermine a woman's \nright to choose, a right that has been constitutionally guaranteed for \nmore than 42 years by Roe v. Wade.\n  H.R. 3504 constitutes an unprecedented level of intrusion by the \ngovernment into medical decision making.\n  It also completely fails to distinguish between a viable and a non-\nviable fetus, which is the constitutional line that separates abortions \nthat may be performed without restriction from those that may be \nregulated or prohibited.\n  These restrictions, in conjunction with the bill's draconian criminal \npenalties, will effectively intimidate doctors, thereby making abortion \nservices unavailable as a practical matter.\n  Further yet, there is absolutely no need for this legislation. No \nevidence has been uncovered that necessitates congressional \ninterference in the doctor-patient relationship.\n  Even if wrongdoing were to occur, many federal and state laws already \nprotect babies ``born alive.''\n  In truth, abortion practice is safe, legal, and humane and any \nevidence of wrongdoing can and should be handled under existing law. \nFor example, the criminal Kermit Gosnell, who ran an illegal abortion \nfront in Philadelphia, was prosecuted under existing law and is \nrightfully in prison serving multiple life sentences.\n  In sum, the bill's vague and broad mandates, combined with its severe \npenalties, will undermine the ability of women to access safe \naffordable abortion services, which unfortunately appears to be the \nunderlying intent of this flawed legislation.\n  As the Administration, in its Statement of Administration Policy, \nwarns ``H.R. 3504 would impose new legal requirements related to the \nprovision of abortion services in certain circumstances, which would \nlikely have a chilling effect, reducing access to care.''\n  In addition, this legislation is opposed by Planned Parenthood, which \nstates that H.R. 3504 would ``add new criminal penalties against \ndoctors and clinicians as a scare tactic that serves the sole purpose \nof scaring women away from seeking safe, legal, abortion.''\n  Further, NARAL Pro-Choice America correctly observes that H.R. 3504 \nis ``part of an unprecedented assault on reproductive rights.''\n\n[[Page H6152]]\n\n  And, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nexplains that this ``legislation represents gross interference in the \npractice of medicine, inserting a politician in between a woman and her \ntrusted doctor.''\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 3504, \nan anti-choice, anti-woman, and thoroughly unnecessary measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 421, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 421, I \ncall up the bill (H.R. 3134) to provide for a moratorium on Federal \nfunding to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., and ask for \nits immediate consideration in the House.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 421, the \namendment printed in House Report 114-262 is adopted and the bill, as \namended, is considered read.\n  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Defund Planned Parenthood \n     Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) State and county health departments, community health \n     centers, hospitals, physicians offices, and other entities \n     currently provide, and will continue to provide, health \n     services to women. Such health services include relevant \n     diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child \n     care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family \n     planning services (including contraception), cervical and \n     breast cancer screenings and referrals, and sexually \n     transmitted disease testing.\n       (2) Many such entities provide services to all persons, \n     regardless of the person's ability to pay, and provide \n     services in medically underserved areas and to medically \n     underserved populations.\n       (3) All funds that are no longer available to Planned \n     Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. and its affiliates and \n     clinics pursuant to this Act will continue to be made \n     available to other eligible entities to provide women's \n     health care services.\n       (4) Funds authorized to be appropriated, and appropriated, \n     by section 4 are offset by the funding limitation under \n     section 3(a).\n\n     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON FEDERAL FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD \n                   FEDERATION OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n       (a) In General.--For the one-year period beginning on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, subject to subsection (b), \n     no funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law may be \n     made available for any purpose to Planned Parenthood \n     Federation of America, Inc., or any affiliate or clinic of \n     Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., unless such \n     entities certify that Planned Parenthood Federation of \n     America affiliates and clinics will not perform, and will not \n     provide any funds to any other entity that performs, an \n     abortion during such period.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to an \n     abortion--\n       (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or \n     incest; or\n       (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical \n     disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as \n     certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death \n     unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering \n     physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy \n     itself.\n       (c) Repayment.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture shall seek repayment of any \n     Federal assistance received by Planned Parenthood Federation \n     of America, Inc., or any affiliate or clinic of Planned \n     Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., if it violates the \n     terms of the certification required by subsection (a) during \n     the period specified in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 4. FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--There is authorized to be appropriated, \n     and appropriated, $235,000,000 for the community health \n     center program under section 330 of the Public Health Service \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), in addition to any other funds made \n     available to such program, for the period for which the \n     funding limitation under section 3(a) applies.\n       (b) Limitation.--None of the funds authorized or \n     appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) may be expended for \n     an abortion other than as described in section 3(b).\n\n     SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to reduce overall \n     Federal funding available in support of women's health.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce or their designee.\n  The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida (Ms. Castor) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on H.R. 3134.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood \nAct of 2015.\n  Madam Speaker, we all remember the images of Kermit Gosnell killing \nbabies who were born alive after a botched abortion.\n  We know that those are sickening, and we know that they have renewed \nthe demand for accountability from the American people. That is why we \ncome before you today with H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act \nof 2015.\n  New documentation of these heinous practices that we have seen in \nvideos, videos that have come out of Planned Parenthood abortion \nclinics of harvesting the body parts of babies as part of the abortion \nprocess, have raised serious questions about the possible systematic \nand repeated violation of State and Federal laws.\n  H.R. 3134 provides a 1-year moratorium, a freezing--a freezing--on \nthe Federal funding to Planned Parenthood Federation of America and all \nof its affiliates while investigations are ongoing regarding the \npractices of the abortion industry.\n  Madam Speaker, most people think that is common sense. If there is \nreason to investigate, then there is reason to withhold taxpayer \ndollars during that period of time. Those dollars would be given to \nother facilities that provide women's health services.\n  The American taxpayer has been very clear for a long time that they \ndo not want taxpayer money spent on abortion; 68 percent of Americans \noppose it. What is so interesting to me is that we know that 71 percent \nof all millennials oppose this.\n  I would remind my colleagues, Madam Speaker, there is no difference \nbetween men and women on this. There is bipartisan opposition from men \nand women to this practice. Additionally, the majority of Americans are \nopposed to the sale of body parts of babies obtained after abortion.\n  So the discussion today is not about videos or women's health access. \nWe know there are other ways to get that access. It is about our most \nbasic right. It is about the right to life.\n  It is also about doing what the taxpayers sent us to D.C. to do. It \nis also about continuing the process to protect our most vulnerable \ncitizens, innocent little babies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the ``Deny Women Health \nCare Act.''\n  Madam Speaker, congressional approval ratings are at an all-time low, \nand here is another example of why:\n  Republicans in Congress have failed to fulfill their fundamental \nresponsibility to our great Nation again.\n  Republicans have pushed America to the brink of another government \nshutdown, and we are a mere 5 legislative days away.\n\n[[Page H6153]]\n\n  Republicans in Congress have refused to sit down and negotiate a \nbipartisan appropriations plan despite the urging of Democrats, \nbusiness leaders, military servicemembers, and citizens all across \nAmerica.\n  The bill brought to the floor today is an attempt by Republican \nleaders to distract the American public from their failure to do their \njob.\n  Last spring, we urged Republicans in Congress to sit down and hammer \nout an appropriations plan. They refused.\n  Instead, the Congress adjourned at the end of July. Nothing happened \nin August. Nothing has happened since the Congress has returned after \nLabor Day.\n  Now the Republican dysfunction in this House will have very serious \nconsequences for our neighbors back home.\n  A Republican shutdown would hurt thousands of disabled veterans, \ndisadvantaged children, small businesses, working families, and \ntaxpayers.\n  The last time Republicans shut down the government for 16 days, the \neconomy lost $24 billion and 120,000 private sector jobs.\n  Here is what happened: The Republican shutdown stalled veterans \ndisability claims, creating additional needless delays for our heroes \nseeking help.\n  Hundreds of critically sick Americans were prevented from enrolling \nin the NIH clinical trials, with 98 percent of the National Science \nFoundation, nearly three-quarters of NIH, and two-thirds of CDC \nemployees furloughed.\n  Head Start grantees, serving thousands of children, were forced to \nclose. American entrepreneurs and small businesses were cut off from \nmillions of dollars in SBA loans.\n  Small businesses with government contracts faced abrupt payment \ndelays and cutbacks. Almost $4 billion in IRS refunds were delayed.\n  The Republican Congress' continuing dysfunction and inability to \ngovern are having real impacts on hard-working Americans. The American \npeople are tired of their relentless failure to govern and the culture \nof crisis.\n  Again and again Republicans have chosen to put their radical special \ninterest agenda ahead of the priorities of hard-working Americans.\n  The American people deserve better, especially in this case, because \nthe Deny Women Health Care Act is a cynical attack on the ability of \nwomen across America to receive the health services that they need at \ntrusted Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  I know many are passionate about these personal issues. That is why \nthe Republicans advance this bill on this topic. They know it is sure \nto inflame passions. But to date, despite congressional inquiries into \nthese false videotapes, there has been no wrongdoing uncovered \nwhatsoever, no evidence to substantiate the allegations. What has \nemerged since the false videos were posted on YouTube is a coordinated, \nbroad-based smear campaign based upon false, manufactured videos that \nare full of distortions and misinformation.\n  The bill is one more assault in the long list of Republican assaults \non women's health care over the last two decades because simply \ndefunding Planned Parenthood would leave millions of American women \nwithout key preventative services, including birth control, family \nplanning, lifesaving cancer screenings, testing and treatment of \ninfections, well-women exams, and advice on family planning.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I was beginning to think that we were \noff on a different bill there for just a moment.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to myself to respond.\n  Madam Speaker, we are not on a bill about a government shutdown. We \nare on a bill that will make certain that women have access to health \ncare, H.R. 3134. I will remind my colleagues that it does remove the \nfunds from Planned Parenthood, and it does enable them to go to women's \nhealth clinics.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee \n(Mrs. Black), who is the author of this legislation and has been such \nan advocate for addressing women's healthcare needs.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, as a nurse for more than 40 years and a \nbeliever in the God-given purpose of every human being, I am \npassionately pro-life. But do you know what? You don't have to agree \nwith me to support this bill. No matter our views on abortion or the \nparty label beside our name, we should all have an interest in ensuring \nthat laws are followed and that the taxpayer dollars are spent \nresponsibly. If a law is broken, particularly by those receiving \ngovernment money, that should be remedied. That is not a political \nstatement. That, quite literally, is our job here in Congress.\n  Two months ago, Madam Speaker, a series of undercover videos were \nreleased implicating Planned Parenthood in the illegal trafficking of \naborted baby tissue and organs. Now, some of my colleagues have tried \nto dismiss these videos even without ever watching them. I get it. It \nis easier to try to discredit the source than to defend what is \nhappening on these tapes.\n  Well, Madam Speaker, I did watch these videos, and I saw full \nconversations of Planned Parenthood employees in their own words \ndiscussing potentially lawbreaking activities. Congressional \ninvestigations are underway, but there are more than enough lingering \nquestions to stop the flow of money--taxpayer dollars--to this abortion \ngiant until our work is complete.\n  For this reason, I have introduced the Defund Planned Parenthood Act \nof 2015. This legislation enacts a 1-year moratorium on all Federal \nmoney going to Planned Parenthood. It does not reduce women's health \nfunding by a single dime. As a matter of fact, we actually increase \nwomen's healthcare funding by over $200 million. Instead, this \nlegislation reallocates the funding to more than 13,500 facilities \nnationwide that provide true preventative care to those who need it the \nmost, and they do not perform abortions.\n  What is more, Planned Parenthood can get their money back. Read the \nbill. They can get their money back if they fully commit to what they \ntalk about in doing women's health care and stop performing abortions \nfor this year.\n  Madam Speaker, if there exists even a possibility that Planned \nParenthood violated our laws, as I believe they did, then pro-life and \npro-choice Members of Congress alike must act to reallocate the funds \nnow so that we are not trying to chase down the taxpayer dollars that \nalready went out the door later on. This is ensuring that our laws are \nfollowed, that Americans know how their money is being spent, and that \nthe conscience rights of taxpayers are respected.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 3134.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I will reiterate again, there \nis no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing, and I maintain that this \nis a distraction from the Republican's fundamental failure to pass a \nbudget 5 legislative days before a government shutdown.\n  Madam Speaker, I am honored to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I listened to the previous Republican \nspeaker, and the deception that she poses to this Congress is \nunbelievable in my opinion.\n  First of all, she talks about these videos which we know have been \nmisleading--edited, all kinds of changes have been made to them. The \naccuracy of them is totally unacceptable. They are not accurate. Then \nshe says, well, just because they may be accurate that we should pass \nthis bill defunding Planned Parenthood.\n  Well, when did this Congress get into the business of saying, well, \nbefore we decided whether you have actually broken the law and before \nwe have any evidence that you have done so, we are just going to shut \nyou down? That is not the way we operate. That is not due process. That \nis not the American way.\n  Then, Madam Speaker, she suggests that somehow this money is going to \nbe given to other providers. I think she is probably talking about \ncommunity health centers. Well, I will tell you, from my own experience \nwith community health centers, that they don't have the ability to \nprovide the women's health needs that are being proposed here that are \nactually provided\n\n[[Page H6154]]\n\nby Planned Parenthood. That is not going to happen. Those women are \ngoing to be deprived of health care.\n  So let's not continue with this deception about what is actually \ngoing on here. The Republicans just want to shut the government down if \nwe don't defund Planned Parenthood. That is what they are all about.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee \nand vice chair of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3134.\n  This bill would defund Planned Parenthood and its clinics for 1 full \nyear. This summer, a series of disturbing videos shined a light on the \ngruesome practice being done in clinics across the country. No one has \never disputed that the employees of Planned Parenthood said what they \nsaid in the video. These videos have shocked and appalled countless \nAmericans.\n  Federal dollars should not be going to an agency that is involved in \nsuch a horrific and disturbing practice. I have voted in the past to \ndefund Planned Parenthood, and I will do so again today.\n  Madam Speaker, life is a precious gift, and I firmly believe we \nshould do all we can to advance and support it. Today, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation to stop Planned Parenthood from \ncontinuing these practices.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. We are \nhere because some have again chosen to reignite the same tired battles \nof years past--and bring our government to the brink of shutdown--to \nrestrict women's control over their own health and bodies. I should not \nbe deciding what is best for a woman's health. She should, and her \ndoctor should.\n  That we are even having this debate--based on contrived, \nunsubstantiated allegations--about an organization that provides \ncritical care to more than 2 million Americans is not only outrageous, \nit is downright irresponsible.\n  More than half of Planned Parenthood centers are in rural or \nmedically underserved areas where access to health care is already too \nlimited. Yet my colleagues want to make it even harder for women and \nmen there to access HIV and STI tests, breast cancer screenings, \ncervical cancer screenings, and other lifesaving services.\n  Madam Speaker, this attempt to demonize Planned Parenthood is \ndisgraceful.\n  Again, it is important to underscore that Federal insurance coverage \nof abortion is already restricted, so to defund Planned Parenthood is \nto defund the preventative services that keep our constituents healthy. \nI urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to myself to \nrespond.\n  Again, Madam Speaker, refocusing us on the bill, we are talking about \nbeing certain that there is access to health care. Cancer screenings \nand prevention services from Planned Parenthood have been cut in half \nover the past 7 years. They do not perform mammograms. They perform \nover 300,000 abortions annually.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nBilirakis), the vice chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a \nmember of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Defund \nPlanned Parenthood Act, a bill I am proud to cosponsor.\n  Madam Speaker, as the Energy and Commerce Committee continues its \ninvestigation into the troubling Planned Parenthood videos, it is \ncrucial we do everything in our power to protect human life and hold \norganizations such as Planned Parenthood accountable.\n  With this legislation, we have the opportunity to both save lives and \nrespect the rights of the American people. Taxpayers should not be \nforced to financially support organizations whose behavior is at best \nunethical and possibly illegal.\n  When it comes to defunding Planned Parenthood, the issue should not \nbe partisan. This is about protecting the rights of taxpayers, but \nalso, more importantly, protecting the basic right of human life.\n  Madam Speaker, I will continue to give a voice to our most fragile \nAmericans who cannot speak for themselves. I thank Representative Black \nfor her efforts on this important piece of legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, Planned Parenthood provides basic health \nservices to millions of Americans: Pap smears, breast cancer \nscreenings, family planning, and birth control. In fact, there were \nover 4 million visits to Planned Parenthood clinics last year, and over \n90 percent of this was basic women's health care and not abortions.\n  So why are we talking about this today? Why are we talking about this \nlegislation?\n  Planned Parenthood does these services and no Federal funds are spent \non abortion services that Planned Parenthood does provide, but yet the \nmajority will take the radical step of denying women the basic health \ncare they need. This radical agenda is wrong. It is wrong for American \nwomen, and it is wrong for us when the Federal budget expires in just \n13 days.\n  Madam Speaker, I, too, have reviewed the videotapes. Our committee \nreviewed the videotapes, and, as Ms. Castor said--and it bears \nrepeating--no wrongdoing was shown. There are no criminal charges. \nThere are no charges at all that are pending whatsoever against Planned \nParenthood.\n  Madam Speaker, yesterday in the Energy and Commerce Committee, my \nRepublican colleagues in their radical effort went so far as to show a \nphoto of a stillborn baby, implying that that baby was a fetus being \nused for fetal tissue development. What is worse, that photo was shown \nwithout the woman's consent. It had no relation to Planned Parenthood. \nIt was used without the mother's consent.\n  What I want to know from the majority: Is this the evidence that you \nare using to decide that you are going to deny funding for Planned \nParenthood and all the well-women visits women use?\n  Madam Speaker, my colleagues ought to be ashamed of showing this, and \nmy colleagues ought to be ashamed of putting this bill on the floor \ntoday. We are seeing shamelessness right here on the floor today.\n  My colleagues on the other side are trying to do everything they can \nto insert themselves between American women and their right to make \ntheir own healthcare decisions. It is wrong, and I urge a ``no'' vote \non this legislation.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I will never be ashamed of standing up \nand defending life--ever--and I find it so interesting that our efforts \nto protect life are termed ``radical.'' That is an interesting turn of \nevents, if I say so myself.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nBucshon), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, with all due respect, a radical agenda is \nprotecting an organization that dismembers body parts and sells them \nfor profit.\n  For the record, I am probably the only Member of this body to have \noperated on babies as young as 23 weeks' gestation. In fact, the \nsmallest baby I operated on weighed only 650 grams.\n  As a physician, I spent my career caring for patients regardless of \ntheir situations. So I take access to health care very seriously.\n  I find it troubling that those on the other side, most of whom have \nnever spent a day caring for patients, continue to mislead the American \npeople about the facts of Planned Parenthood.\n  Here are a few: By its own statistics, Planned Parenthood only treats \n2 percent of the Nation's women for any reason.\n  Planned Parenthood doesn't offer women some of the most basic primary \ncare. It doesn't provide services like mammograms, cardiovascular blood \ntests, or bone mass measurements.\n\n[[Page H6155]]\n\n  Over the past 10 years, Planned Parenthood cut cancer screenings by \nhalf while it increased abortion services by 40 percent.\n  Across the country, we have 13,000 federally qualified or rural \nhealth centers that can provide basic health services compared to only \n700 Planned Parenthood facilities that really don't provide these \nservices at all.\n  Madam Speaker, taxpayers should not be forced to fund this \norganization when we have so many other alternatives.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, the previous speaker said something \ncompletely false. Planned Parenthood does not sell fetal tissue.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I object.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Illinois will suspend.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I withdraw.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, a complete falsehood was just stated. \nPlanned Parenthood does not sell any body parts for profit. That is a \nfact.\n  So here we go again: Republicans threatening to shut down the \ngovernment in order to deny women access to health care. When the \nRepublicans took control of the House in 2011, the first thing they did \nwas nearly shut down the government over funding for Planned \nParenthood, and 4 years later, Republicans are once again seriously \nconsidering shutting down the government over the exact same thing.\n  This time, they have manufactured a witch hunt based on heavily \nedited videos that were clearly intended to mislead the public and the \nCongress. They have wasted time and resources on futile investigations \nthat have produced absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of \nPlanned Parenthood. In contrast, there is growing evidence that The \nCenter for Medical Progress broke several laws.\n  I recently sent a letter to the Department of Justice and to the \nCalifornia Attorney General, asking them to investigate the practices \nof this organization.\n  My letter raises concerns about fake identification that was used to \ngain access to Planned Parenthood facilities, fraudulent tax documents \nthat were filed to create a fake corporate entity, and violations of \nCalifornia's Invasion of Privacy Act.\n  In response, the California Attorney General has initiated an \ninvestigation. There are also several legal actions pending against The \nCenter for Medical Progress.\n  Enough is enough. I urge my colleagues to oppose this harmful bill \nfor women's health.\n  Here we go again--Republicans threatening to shut down the government \nto deny women access to health care.\n  When the Republicans took control of the House in 2011, the first \nthing they did was nearly shut down the government over funding for \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Four years later, Republicans are once again seriously considering \nshutting down the government over the exact same thing.\n  This time, they've manufactured a witch hunt based on heavily edited \nvideos that were clearly intended to misled the public and Congress.\n  They've wasted time and resources on futile investigations that have \nproduced absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of Planned \nParenthood.\n  In contrast, there is growing evidence that the Center for Medical \nProgress broke several laws.\n  I recently sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the \nCalifornia Attorney General asking them to investigate the potentially \nillegal practices of this organization.\n  My letter raises concerns about fake identification that was used to \ngain access to Planned Parenthood facilities, fraudulent tax documents \nthat were filed to create a fake corporate entity, and violations of \nCalifornia's Invasion of Privacy Act.\n  In response, the California AG has initiated an investigation. There \nare also several legal actions pending against the Center for Medical \nProgress.\n  But we all know that Republicans are not really interested in the \ntruth here. This entire charade is a thinly veiled attempt to erode a \nwoman's ability to make decisions about her own body.\n  For proof, look no further than their budget proposal.\n  Their budget eliminated Title X, the only federal grant program \ndedicated to providing women with family planning services, and cuts \nthe Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program by over 80 percent--programs that \nwould reduce the need for abortion.\n  Republicans have made it clear that women are fair game. They can't \neven pass a continuing resolution without interfering in the personal \nlives of American women.\n  Republicans can't overturn Roe v. Wade so they try every other way \npossible to erode this fundamental right.\n  They try to cut off funding to the clinics that provide abortions, \nthey try to criminalize doctors who perform abortions, and they \nrestrict access for millions of women every year through the Hyde \nAmendment.\n  Enough is enough. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this \nterrible bill and to stop interfering in the personal lives of American \nwomen.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers), a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee and the chairman of the Republican Women's Policy Committee.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the gentlewoman from \nTennessee for holding this important discussion today.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Upton, Chairman Pitts, and the full \ncommittee and staff of Energy and Commerce for their hard work.\n  Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3134, and I proposed an amendment to be \nincluded within that bill, which redirects $235 million to health \ncenters across this country.\n  I am a nurse, and my husband is a general surgeon. One of our \nfavorite places in the world is our back porch in Dunn, North Carolina, \nwhere we sip scuppernong wine and have a wonderful time, and we discuss \ngood health care in this country. Let me tell you and the American \npeople that Planned Parenthood is not good health care.\n  You can see that this chart clearly shows that the 13,000 federally \nqualified healthcare centers in this country provide comprehensive \nhealth care for women.\n  You can see this chart is just a mere example of 17 provided basic \nhealthcare services for women to Planned Parenthood's 6.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Basically, what you have been told and what women in this country \nhave been told is a false choice for American women from Planned \nParenthood.\n  That false choice says that, if one Planned Parenthood facility is \ndefunded, thousands of women and children who are in need will go \nwithout health care.\n  Let me tell you, if that false logic follows in Dunn, North Carolina, \nit basically says, if there are 18 grocery stores and 1 closes its \ndoors, thousands of families, including my own, will starve.\n  This is absolutely untrue. We need to support everything we can in \nthis country for good women's health care. This chart provides the \nactual truth--the truth. Good health care takes care of the whole \nwoman, not just parts.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has established that not \nall services currently provided by Planned Parenthood could be \nfurnished by other health clinics and medical practitioners if Planned \nParenthood were defunded.\n  A George Washington University professor confirmed this in a column \nthis week. The reason is that so many of the services provided relate \nto gynecological services and personal female healthcare needs.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleague from Florida for the recognition.\n  Madam Speaker, it is important that we do get our facts straight.\n  This year, over 2 million babies will be born to women on Medicaid. \nThat is nearly half of all of the births in this country.\n  At the same time, more than half of the Medicaid providers in our \ncountry are not accepting new patients. That leaves hundreds of \nthousands of expectant mothers without access to essential prenatal \ncare and treatment, and\n\n[[Page H6156]]\n\nthat is where Planned Parenthood comes in.\n  Beyond just prenatal care, they provide life-saving cancer \nscreenings, STD tests, and compassionate counseling to millions of \nwomen, men, and families who often have nowhere else to turn for their \nbasic health needs.\n  Eighty percent of the patients that Planned Parenthood serves have \nincomes at or below 150 percent of the poverty line.\n  Those patients are sitting inside waiting rooms at Planned Parenthood \ncenters across the Nation at this very moment who are facing some of \nthe most emotional decisions and challenging tests of their entire \nlives.\n  The practitioners and nurses who will treat them won't just tend to \ntheir immediate medical needs. They will make sure that the patient \nknows that he or she is not alone.\n  If we pass this bill, we are turning our backs on those patients. We \nare telling low-income families in every corner of this country that we \ncount their health and happiness less.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider those patients and the impact of \nthis legislation.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 5 seconds to respond.\n  For 98.5 percent of the pregnant women who received a pregnancy-\nrelated service at Planned Parenthood, that service was an abortion.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), a \nmember of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Madam Speaker, North Dakotans affirm life every day \nthrough strong, stable family structures and a culture that values life \nand that, frankly, values ending the circumstances that cause a woman \nto believe that her best option is an abortion.\n  We have over 70,000 square miles and thousands of women who need \nhealthcare services, but we don't have a Planned Parenthood clinic \nbecause North Dakota women somehow don't meet its business model.\n  There are, however, compassionate providers offering more \ncomprehensive services across my State. This map shows the localities \nof 71 federally qualified health centers that provide quality care to \nunderserved and low-income women in rural and urban communities \nthroughout my State.\n  The patients who go through the doors of these clinics are treated as \nvalued community members, not as a fee for service and certainly not as \na $45 specimen.\n  This Congress and its relevant committees must complete a thorough \ninvestigation of the disturbing accusations evidenced--yes, evidenced--\nin the Planned Parenthood videos that we all have seen before another \ntaxpayer dollar goes to this controversial organization. These funds \ncan be better used to provide legitimate health services for women in \nplaces like North Dakota.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).\n  Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, \nthe Defund Planned Parenthood Act, but we should call it the \n``Depriving Women of their Health Care Act.''\n  This bill is just the latest political attack on millions of American \nwomen. This bill is a step backward for our Nation's healthcare system.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood would deprive American women and their \nfamilies of access to preventative services like cancer screenings and \naccess to contraception and to prenatal counseling that helps women \nmaintain healthy pregnancies.\n  Sadly, I am not surprised that my Republican colleagues continue this \nrelentless attack on the autonomy of women. We have seen it countless \ntimes before: Congress telling this country that a politician's \njudgment is superior to that of an American woman's.\n\n  What does surprise me, however, is that now Republicans are willing \nto shut down our government and put our economy at risk in order to \ndeny women access to the healthcare providers of their choosing.\n  We can't allow Members of Congress to substitute their judgment for a \nwoman's right to make decisions about her own body.\n  This bill does nothing more than take away healthcare options for \nlow-income women because of a difference in beliefs over just 3 percent \nof the many vital services that Planned Parenthood provides.\n  Congress needs to get back to work on the real issues facing American \nwomen and their families.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Pro-Life Caucus.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, undercover videos show and expose Planned Parenthood \ndirectors cheerfully talking about dismemberment and crushing babies to \ndeath all while altering abortion methods in a way that preserves \norgans and body parts for sale.\n  Watch the videos.\n  One senior director who talks about preserving a liver says they use \nultrasound guidance because that is where they will know where to put \nthe forceps. Of course, forceps are used to literally rip the child to \npieces in what is called a dismemberment abortion.\n  One technician, Holly O'Donnell, talks about getting brain tissue. \nShe said her supervisor ``gave me the scissors and told me that I had \nto cut down the middle of the face. I can't even describe,'' she says, \n``what that feels like.''\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side have said that there is no \nevidence. Watch the videos. There is ample evidence.\n  I would suggest and I would ask Congresswoman Castor to join us in a \nletter that asks the Attorney General of the United States to \ninvestigate this. Will you?\n  I yield to the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, the repeated reference to these \nfalse videos is a true disservice to this Congress and to the people \nall across America. These false claims against Planned Parenthood have \nbeen widely discredited.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Again, the repeated references to these false videos do a real \ndisservice to this Congress and to people all across America. The false \nclaims against Planned Parenthood have been widely discredited.\n  The videos that so many have referenced are heavily edited. They have \nedited content out, and they have edited false images in.\n  Politicians who are latching onto this smear campaign do so to \nfurther their personal agendas to the detriment of women's health care \nacross America.\n  What has happened here since these videos were released in July is a \ncoordinated smear campaign against trusted Planned Parenthood clinics. \nLet me give you some evidence directly from my home State of Florida.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  In July, with absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing, Florida \nRepublican Governor Rick Scott ordered investigations of Planned \nParenthood clinics. It had all the trappings of a witch hunt.\n  In August, after the Agency for Health Care Administration had \ndetermined and written a draft press release that said: ``However, \nthere is no evidence of the mishandling of fetal remains at any of the \n16 clinics we investigated across the State.''\n  That didn't fit Governor Scott's political narrative, so his office \nscrubbed the press release of that language.\n  I submit for the Record a copy of the press release that was drafted \nby the Agency for Health Care Administration for Florida before \nGovernor Scott's office scrubbed the language on the finding.\n\n                 [For Immediate Release--Aug. 5, 2015]\n\n      Original Proposed Release From AHCA to the Governor's Office\n\n\n      Planned Parenthood Inspections Find Deficiencies at Clinics\n\nAgency findings include issues with the record keeping of fetal remains \n   at one clinic and unlicensed procedures being performed at three \n                                clinics\n\n       Tallahassee, FL.--Our investigations last week into Planned \n     Parenthood clinics found three facilities performing \n     procedures beyond their licensing authority, as well as one \n     facility not keeping proper logs relating to fetal remains. \n     However, there is no evidence of the mishandling of fetal \n     remains at any of the 16 clinics we investigated across the \n     state.\n\n[[Page H6157]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                 [For Immediate Release--Aug. 5, 2015]\n\n             Final Versions That Was Released to the Media\n\n\n      Planned Parenthood Inspections Find Deficiencies at Clinics\n\nAgency findings include issues with the record keeping of fetal remains \n   at one clinic and unlicensed procedures being performed at three \n                                clinics\n\n       Tallahassee, FL.--Our investigations last week into Planned \n     Parenthood clinics found three facilities performing \n     procedures beyond their licensing authority, as well as one \n     facility not keeping proper logs relating to fetal remains.\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. In fact, the press secretary for the agency \nsaid: ``I would have thought a line on no handling of fetal remains \nwould be included, as that is what questions will be on.''\n  The agency's secretary wrote back, and she said she agreed.\n  Reporters subsequently obtained the scrubbed press release. \nApparently, these had to go to the Governor's office to be purified and \nsanctified.\n  What happened earlier this week is that the communications director \nfor the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration resigned. This is \nanother example of the coordinated smear campaign based upon the false \nvideos that have captured attention. They are outrageous, but they are \nfalse, and they have been proven to be false.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to respond.\n  We are hearing words such as ``denied,'' ``deprived,'' ``detriment'' \nto women's healthcare. We are increasing women's health care. Tennessee \nhas four Planned Parenthood clinics and 26 federally qualified health \nclinics.\n  Also, I would remind my colleagues the investigation is ongoing. It \nis ongoing. It started yesterday at Energy and Commerce. We will \ncontinue through this to get to the bottom of it.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the \nchairman of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, life, liberty, the pursuit of \nhappiness, as a people, we have no more sacred values; and the right to \nlife is foremost among these.\n  Recently, shocking, appalling, horrific videos have come to light \nthat show senior employees at Planned Parenthood casually discussing \nthe harvesting and selling of organs of aborted children in ways to \nalter their procedures in order to ``obtain intact fetal cadavers,'' \nwhich they refer to as ``line items.''\n  In perhaps the most chilling video, we see one of these so-called \nintact fetal cadavers with its heart still beating. Madam Speaker, its \nheart was still beating.\n  Madam Speaker, whether one considers themselves pro-life or pro-\nchoice, can we not agree that the harvesting and trafficking of baby \norgans violates the sanctity with which every child created in the \nimage of God is entitled to? How can a fair, civilized, and \ncompassionate society come to any other conclusion?\n  Madam Speaker, today I rise to plead with my colleagues to speak up \nfor the voiceless and the defenseless by voting to deny Planned \nParenthood further taxpayer subsidies for the harvesting of baby body \nparts.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  Ms. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in staunch opposition to this \ndangerous bill. Planned Parenthood provides exactly the types of \ninterventions that prevent unintended pregnancies and the need for an \nabortion in the first place, like birth control options and medically \naccurate sexual health education.\n  If this bill becomes law, these important services Planned Parenthood \nbrings to our communities will disappear, and the health of our \ncommunities will pay the price.\n  We keep hearing that the work of Planned Parenthood would be done by \nother healthcare providers, mostly community health centers, and while \nthat might sound like an easy shift, it doesn't work that way.\n  Madam Speaker, I have a letter here from the California Primary Care \nAssociation. In it, they write: ``Eliminating Planned Parenthood from \nour State's comprehensive network of care would put untenable stress on \nremaining providers. We do not have the capacity for such an increase \nin care.''\n  This is the direct quote from the health centers that the majority \nexpects to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood is defunded. It \nwould be untenable.\n  Supporters of this bill are willfully putting their heads in the \nsand. They think it is no big deal to shut down hundreds of clinics \noffering essential services that are not available anywhere else. They \nthink it is worth shutting down the government to achieve this goal. \nThis political theater has to stop.\n  We need to trust women and their healthcare providers to make their \nown medical decisions. It is not the government's business.\n  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this dangerous bill.\n  I insert the letter from the California Primary Care Association into \nthe Record.\n\n                                                California Primary\n\n\n                                             Care Association,\n\n                               Sacramento, CA, September 17, 2015.\n     Hon. Lois Capps,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congresswoman Capps: The California Primary Care \n     Association has recently become aware of new legislation, \n     H.R. 3134 combined with the Ellmers amendment, by \n     Congresswoman Diane Black that would redirect federal funding \n     from Planned Parenthood to federally qualified health \n     centers. The purported goal of such legislation is to prevent \n     a decrease in federal funding for women's health services, \n     while putting a moratorium on Planned Parenthood as a \n     healthcare provider for a year while Congress conducts a full \n     investigation of the organization's activities.\n       As the state-wide representatives of community clinics and \n     health centers in California, who serve 5.6 million patients \n     annually, we believe this action would negatively impact the \n     health of our community.\n       Planned Parenthood currently operates 115 health centers in \n     California and serves nearly 800,000 patients through 1.5 \n     million encounters annually. Eliminating Planned Parenthood \n     from our state's comprehensive network of care would put \n     untenable stress on remaining health centers. We do not have \n     the capacity for such an increase in care, even for a year, \n     and should Congress seek to extend the moratorium building \n     such capacity would require significant capital investment on \n     par with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     expansion.\n       Even then, the legislation would still eliminate patient's \n     ability to choose the provider with which they feel most \n     comfortable. Planned Parenthood is seen by many as women's \n     health centric, which provides their patients with a level of \n     comfort that cannot be easily replicated. The women's health \n     focus allows them to be a provider of choice to hundreds of \n     thousands of women who seek out a variety of services that \n     include well woman exams, breast exams, birth control and \n     sexually transmitted disease testing.\n       In 2013 alone, Planned Parenthood conducted 733,641 tests \n     for Chlamydia--the leading cause of preventable infertility--\n     that resulted in 37,014 positive results and follow-up \n     treatment.\n       Planned Parenthood is a vital component of the health care \n     system in California and for that reason, we are opposed to \n     legislation that will diminish their capacity to provide care \n     in our state. We respectfully request that you oppose this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                              Carmela Castellano Garcia, Esq.,\n\n                                                President and CEO,\n                              California Primary Care Association.\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nBoustany), who chairs the Subcommittee on Human Resources at Ways and \nMeans.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, as a newly minted physician fresh out of \nmedical school, I took an oath to protect life. As a cardiovascular \nsurgeon, I worked day and night performing thousands of cardiovascular \noperations on premature infants, all the way up to the elderly. Now, in \nCongress, I intend to uphold that oath that I took to save life.\n  The practices we have seen described recently released in the \nundercover videos of top Planned Parenthood executives detailing the \nmethods they employ to harvest tissues and organs during abortions \nperformed at these clinics is nothing short of atrocious.\n  After the release of the first video in July, I joined my pro-life \ncolleagues to call immediately for thorough investigations into this \nactivity, and now, these investigations are underway. The American \npeople deserve and they need to know the truth. While these \ninvestigations are ongoing, it is important that we take action to \nprevent taxpayer dollars from going to this type of activity.\n\n[[Page H6158]]\n\n  I have long supported legislation to end funding for Planned \nParenthood and am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. It is \na very important bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to defend the culture of life in this country, \nand let's vote in favor of this bill.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).\n  Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, Planned Parenthood provides 865,000 pap \nsmears and breast exams a year. That is more than the entire population \nof States like Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota.\n  I want to introduce you, Members on the other side of the aisle, to \nColleen from Albany, New York, who is 27 years old. I want you to look \ninto her eyes, and I want you to tell me that you would rather see her \ndead because Colleen went to Planned Parenthood because she was in \nbetween jobs and sought health care.\n  She received a breast cancer exam at Planned Parenthood. She had \nstage II breast cancer, and she is alive today because it was \nidentified at a Planned Parenthood clinic. They operated, and she is \nhealthy.\n  She is not the only one. There are 86,000 men and women who seek \nservices at Planned Parenthood every year for breast cancer or for pap \nsmears for cervical cancer who are identified as having a positive test \nresult. As a result, they get care--86,000. What you are saying is that \nit is okay for 86,000 people to die because that is how they were \naccessing their health care.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to respond \nto some of the comments and to remind my colleagues this investigation \nthat we are conducting is ongoing.\n  Cancer screenings and prevention services have been cut in half at \nPlanned Parenthood over the past 7 years. They do not perform \nmammograms; they outsource it. They perform over 300,000 abortions \nannually; that is their own number.\n  Madam Speaker, 98.5 percent of the pregnant women who go there go for \nan abortion.\n  At this time, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Pitts), the chairman of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, this morning we are debating, actually, two \nbills. One is the delay of funds to Planned Parenthood until the \ninvestigation is over and redistributing that money to the rural and \nfederally qualified community health clinics of which there are over \n13,000--only 656 Planned Parenthood clinics--and they actually do \nwomen's health, like mammograms, as we have heard, and other issues, \nnot just refer. I would urge support for that.\n  The other bill we are debating, which is sometimes infants are born \nalive after an abortion. We had two witnesses last week before the \nJudiciary Committee who were survivors. One of them said she was in \ncontact with 203 other abortion survivors.\n  All we are doing is putting enforcement language, some penalties in \nthere because born alive is the law, but it is not enforced, and this \nwould permit that to be enforced.\n  Finally, with Pope Francis coming next week, he said: ``The defense \nof the unborn life is closely linked to the defense of each and every \nother human right. It involves the conviction that a human being is \nalways sacred and inviolable in any situation, every stage of \ndevelopment.''\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, while the investigation may be \nongoing, there have been no cases of born alive. The one case from some \ntime ago, a doctor is in prison for that. This simply is not accurate. \nNow, what we know from ongoing investigations here currently is there \nhas been no substantiated allegation against Planned Parenthood.\n  What we have seen is this Center for Medical Progress that posted \nthese YouTube video. They have made a number of misrepresentations that \nmay have broken several Federal and State laws, including violating \nFederal tax laws, violating criminal laws, violating the Invasion of \nPrivacy Act out of California, violating California's penal code by \nmaking false charitable solicitations.\n  Now, we have heard that the attorneys for the director, Mr. Daleiden, \nfor CMP, his attorneys have advised a Federal district court that he \nintends to invoke his Fifth Amendment in the investigation of him for \nhis violation of Federal and State laws.\n  At this time, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nWasserman Schultz).\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong \nopposition to the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015. This bill is \npossibly the most dangerous bill for women's health to come to the \nHouse floor of this Congress.\n  State and Federal investigations of Planned Parenthood have produced \nno evidence of violations of laws or medical standards, and independent \nauditors confirm the videos referenced were heavily altered.\n  What really happens in Planned Parenthood clinics every year is this: \n2.7 million Americans receive critical health services, 78 percent of \nwhich live below the poverty level; doctors deliver approximately \n400,000 pap smear exams; and women receive nearly half a million breast \nexams, including screenings to 88,000 women whose cancer was detected \nearly.\n  This legislation threatens those services and the health of patients, \nincluding 7,000 women in my district annually who rely on Planned \nParenthood for health care.\n  As a woman, mother, and breast cancer survivor, I refuse to take that \nthreat lying down. Republicans' own investigations turned up nothing; \nyet some of their Members are willing to risk women's lives just to \nscore political points. Enough is enough.\n  I urge all Members who truly value women's health to vote against \nthis outrageous witch hunt.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015.\n  Recent videos released by brave whistleblowers have definitively \nshown that it is well past time to defund Planned Parenthood. For far \ntoo long and to the tune of one-half billion dollars a year, taxpayers \nhave been forced to subsidize Planned Parenthood's abortion on demand.\n  Thanks to these unsettling revelations, we now know that taxpayers \nhave also been subsidizing the trafficking of aborted baby body parts. \nThis is not health care, Madam Speaker.\n  There are over 13,000 publicly supported health centers in our \ncountry that do provide excellent women's health care. In my home State \nof Colorado, there are 240 such healthcare alternatives versus 21 \nPlanned Parenthood locations.\n  This important legislation will not remove funds from women's health \ncare, but shift it to responsible providers. Taxpayers won't have to \nfund Planned Parenthood's deplorable barbarism.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen).\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, this legislation is the latest attempt \nto take essential healthcare services away from women.\n  Our Republican colleagues know that none of the Planned Parenthood \nFederal funds are used for abortion, per the Hyde amendment. They know \nthere is no evidence that Planned Parenthood has violated any Federal \nlaws. They know that 90 percent of Planned Parenthood services go to \nessential cancer screenings, family planning counseling, pregnancy \ntests, contraceptive care, and other things.\n  This bill will deny women those services. When this bill fails in the \nSenate, our Republican colleagues are apparently prepared to shut down \nthe government in order to shut down those women's health services.\n  Madam Speaker, our Republican colleagues are entitled to their views, \nbut they should not harm our economy; they should not harm America's \nwomen; they should not shut down the government to try to impose their \nviews on the country.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise to raise my opposition to H.R. 3134, Defund \nPlanned Parenthood\n\n[[Page H6159]]\n\nAct of 2015. This bill would prohibit all federal funding for Planned \nParenthood health centers for one year.\n  Instead of using their majority to pass a clean budget and govern \nresponsibly, the Republicans are willing to hold our country hostage to \nfurther their harmful agenda against women.\n  The Defund Planned Parenthood Act is just another shameful attempt to \ntake essential healthcare services away from women. Republicans are so \nfocused on defunding Planned Parenthood that they are willing to shut \ndown the government again, and cause billions of dollars of damage to \nour economy.\n  Planned Parenthood has been investigated multiple times and each \ninvestigation has shown that Planned Parenthood has not violated any \nfederal laws. Moreover none of Planned Parenthood's federal funds are \nused to perform abortions, in accordance with the Hyde Amendment. \nRepublicans are ignoring facts and relying on doctored footage to \ncontinue their crusade against women's healthcare.\n  This bill will have a devastating impact on women. Approximately one \nin five American women, in her lifetime, has relied on a Planned \nParenthood center for care. It serves a total of 2.7 million patients \nper year--women and men.\n  More than ninety percent of their much-needed services go toward \nproviding essential health services that includes contraceptive care, \nfamily planning counseling, pregnancy tests, prenatal care, and \nessential cancer screenings.\n  There are not enough community health centers to care for all of \nthose who would lose access to healthcare if this bill is passed. A \ndirect threat would be posed to seventy-eight percent of Planned \nParenthood patients who earn incomes of 150 percent of the federal \npoverty level or less.\n  It is time to focus on this country's real concerns and stop trying \nto deprive women of essential health services. I strongly oppose this \nbill and any other efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to respond.\n  Madam Speaker, they sure want that government shutdown. I do want to \nremind them that we have over 13,000 community health centers in the \ncountry. Planned Parenthood has cut their cancer screening and \nprevention services in half in the past 7 years, and they do not \nperform mammograms, but they do over 300,000 abortions.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. \nRoe).\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015.\n  As an OB/GYN physician who has delivered close to 5,000 babies, I was \nsickened and disturbed by the release of several videos showing Planned \nParenthood executives casually discussing the dismemberment of babies \nto sell body parts.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill isn't about whether you are pro-life or pro-\nchoice, though I am proud to say that I will always be a defender of \nthe right to life. This is about the gruesome practices of an \norganization that receives over $500 million a year from the Federal \nGovernment. As legislators, we carry the responsibility and the \nprivilege to protect those who do not have a voice and to ensure that \ntax dollars are supporting organizations that truly provide health care \nfor women.\n  I have seen the videos, and I can tell you, that is not health care. \nI have spent my entire life caring for patients, and it is important to \nnote that there are alternatives for women to receive care besides \nPlanned Parenthood. I strongly support withholding tax dollars from \nPlanned Parenthood until congressional investigators have had a chance \nto review the matter. I am proud to encourage my colleagues to support \nthis important bill.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, may I please inquire how much \ntime is left on each side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 11\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Again, the videos keep being referenced here on the floor. I want \nMembers to understand, I want the American public to understand that \nthe first four short videos released on YouTube have 40 separate \nsplices and edits that remove crucial context. They remove exculpatory \nstatements like, ``Nobody should be selling tissue; that is not the \ngoal here,'' and, ``This is not a service they should be making money \nfrom. It is something they should be able to offer to their patients in \na way that doesn't impact them,'' or, ``We are not looking to make \nmoney from this. Our goal is to keep access available.'' In one of the \nvideos there are at least 16 substantial unexplained edits, including \nthe removal of nine instances where Planned Parenthood staff said there \nis no profit related to tissue donation.\n  Doesn't that seem misleading and fundamentally dishonest to remove \nstatements like that, and then base a smear campaign and bring it to \nthe floor of the United States Congress for policymaking? I think so.\n  That is why these videos have been denounced across the country by \nindependent editorial writers. They have called them distorted and \nunfair, dishonest, grossly misleading, and politically irresponsible \nand swift boating.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPayne), my friend\n  Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. \n3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.\n  There is nothing thoughtful about this legislation. This is a \nshameful and shocking sham. This has always been about Republicans \nwanting to restrict the right of women to make their own healthcare \ndecisions.\n  Let me say, you know, these doctored videos on YouTube, my children \nwatch YouTube, and you can see whatever you want on YouTube. You can \nsee a man punt a basketball through a basket from 500 feet. You can see \nwhatever you want. So I am not surprised that these doctored videos are \non YouTube.\n  Mammograms are done in imaging centers, so no health center does an \nactual mammogram. So let's stop trying to mislead the American people \nwith this sham.\n  If you like YouTube so much, and that is where you are going to get \nyour information, I have another video you can watch right now on \nYouTube. It is called, ``Dumb and Dumber.''\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, it has been said that none are so blind \nas those who will not see, and so I rise today on behalf of the unborn \nbabies who can't stand up for themselves.\n  Many of my colleagues have already described the horrifying videos \nthat shock the conscience and have sparked several congressional \ninvestigations.\n  No matter what party you belong to, we should all agree that taxpayer \ndollars should not be used for harvesting baby parts for profit. The \ndebate today is about more than these barbaric practices. It is about \nthe very character of our Nation. Will we turn a blind eye to this \ncallous disregard for human life? Is this the country we want to be?\n  Two weeks ago today, my newest granddaughter, Naomi Gail, was born \nafter an emergency C-section from a doctor who understood the need for \nlife for both the mother and the child. Holding her in my arms was a \nvivid reminder that all life is sacred, and every child deserves \ndignity, respect, and a chance for a full life.\n  America was founded on the values of life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness. Madam Speaker, it all begins with life.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Castor for her \ntremendous leadership.\n  I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3134, which is nothing more than \nyet another ideological attack on women's health care. It would defund \nPlanned Parenthood for a year, leaving millions of women across the \ncountry without access to critical healthcare services.\n  Planned Parenthood centers often serve as a primary care health \nfacility for women seeking birth control, cancer and STI screenings, \nand other critical preventive care. In 2013 alone, Planned Parenthood \nprovided healthcare services to more than 800,000 Californians and \nprovided more than 93,000 Pap tests and 97,000 breast exams.\n  Denying access to the healthcare services such as Planned Parenthood \nprovides will harm those who most need these services, including low-\nincome women and women of color. This\n\n[[Page H6160]]\n\nbill is shameful. It is disrespectful. It is wrong. Politicians \nshouldn't be interfering, anyway, in a woman's personal healthcare \ndecisions.\n  It is past time Republicans stop their war on women and stop these \nideological attacks and stop using women's health care to divert \nattention from a looming government shutdown because Republicans refuse \nto pass a budget.\n  Vote ``no'' on this deceptive and dishonest bill.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds to respond \nto something.\n  Our colleagues across the aisle have a colleague from New Jersey who \npreviously spoke. I want to reference a press release that was sent out \nAugust 15 from his office on community health centers:\n\n       Community health centers attend to hard-to-reach \n     populations and are a vital resource that have a significant \n     impact in improving health in New Jersey.\n\n  Talking about reaching hard-to-serve populations, this is what we are \ndoing. Let's put the money where it meets the most needs.\n  I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), who \nis the author of H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act, \nand commend him for his commitment in those efforts.\n  Mr. DUFFY. ``It is a boy,'' or, ``it is a girl''; any parent knows \nthat phrase. It is one of the most memorable moments that they will \never have in their lives.\n  Recently, we heard that same phrase, but it was said by an abortion \nprovider at Planned Parenthood, and it was as that provider--we will \nuse that term loosely--was siphoning through the body parts of a little \nbaby, taking hearts and lungs for sale, but noticed it is a boy.\n  What a perversion. What a perversion of who we are as a people. I \nthink it calls into question this debate. This is not a debate about \nwomen's health. We are providing the same amount of money for women's \nhealth to great clinics that provide great care. It is about Planned \nParenthood.\n  Why is it about Planned Parenthood? If you watch this debate, you \nhave to ask, how could anybody defend the practices at Planned \nParenthood, harvesting body parts? How could anyone defend that? It is \nan easy answer. Look in political season. Millions of dollars--millions \nof dollars--are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the \nHouse of Representatives and to the Senate. This isn't about babies. \nThis is about money.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).\n  Ms. DelBENE. Madam Speaker, this feels like deja vu. Once again, the \nHouse is ignoring the challenges facing our Nation in order to attack \nwomen's health. Already this year, the House has voted to restrict \nreproductive health care in private insurance, enact a sweeping 20-week \nabortion ban, and allow employers to discriminate against their workers \nfor using birth control.\n  Now, with just 5 legislative days before a shutdown, we are wasting \nour time on a bill the President has said he will veto. It is past time \nfor Congress to stop focusing on ideology and start focusing on the \nfacts. The fact is defunding Planned Parenthood would have a \ndevastating effect on women's access to health care. That care includes \ncancer screenings, immunizations, and birth control.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, current law already prevents Federal \nfunding for abortion services. It is shameful that the House is \nallowing the reckless actions of a few extremists to jeopardize the \ncritical safety net provided by Planned Parenthood. We can't let that \nhappen.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, we have seen in the videos released this \nsummer the horrific practices of harvesting the body parts of aborted \nchildren for profit. We have also known that Planned Parenthood \nprovides abortion procedures, and the pro-life movement has for years \nworked very hard to ensure that no taxpayer dollars will be used to \nfund the procedure of abortion.\n  Planned Parenthood is not about women's health care. We know this \nbecause not one clinic performs mammograms. The despicable actions that \nwere uncovered in these videos show the true nature of Planned \nParenthood. It shows their complete disregard for life. It shows how \ncareless they are with the responsibility to treat our most vulnerable \nand innocent with respect.\n  We cannot give taxpayer dollars to an organization that profits from \nthe sale of organs from aborted children. Planned Parenthood officials \nhave been caught haggling over the price of body parts from aborted \nchildren, and they have been recorded on camera fearing the \nconsequences if their actions were revealed to the world. We have two \nHouse committee investigations. We have an obligation to suspend \nFederal funding to Planned Parenthood while the investigations are \nbeing conducted.\n  Now is the time for all Americans to reflect on the fragile nature of \nlife and how we treat the unborn. I want to thank Congresswoman Black \nfor leading the efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I stand before you today not as a \nRepublican and not as a Member of this House, but as a fellow human \nbeing, and I wonder: How did we get to this point? How do we somehow \ncompromise in our mind what it is that we are talking about today?\n  I want you to disconnect from any organization or agency and \nconcentrate on the act of what is taking place.\n  This is not a blob of tissue. This is one of America's sons or \ndaughters waiting to be born. They are taken from the safety of their \nmother's womb and they are taken out very carefully so they can harvest \ncertain body parts: hearts, lungs, heads.\n  You can sit here and try to make it something about an agency and \nturn a blind eye to the act that is taking place in a country that will \ngo to any length to protect life, in a people that believes in the \nsanctity of life from its very conception to its natural death.\n  And somehow harvesting the parts from these little baby boys and \ngirls has become a political issue?\n  This is an issue human being to human being. This is an issue of \nconscience and conviction. Please, do not make it a political battle.\n  This is about our sons and daughters. This is about a horrific act \nthat is repulsive and repugnant and has no place in America. America's \ntaxpayers refuse to pay for that type of act. Wake up.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I thank the many colleagues who stood \nhere and stand with me now to rise in support of ensuring that hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars do not go to private entities that are \ntrafficking in fetal baby parts.\n  We have to put a stop to this heinous practice. We have to ensure \nthat this problem is investigated. We have to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment is not condoning these actions.\n  I believe that we need to ensure that Planned Parenthood understands \nthat the money that they have access to from the Federal Treasury is \nnot mandatory money that is given to that agency.\n  We need to ensure that women's health is a priority, but let's put \nthe tax dollars into the agencies and the community health centers that \nare providing access to women's health care every day throughout this \ngreat Nation. We can do that.\n  Let's stand together. Let's ban this heinous practice. Let's make \nsure we move forward.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Frankel).\n\n[[Page H6161]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the \nDefund Planned Parenthood Act. I want to say this as respectfully as \npossible, but this bill is dumb, it is foolish, and it is mean-\nspirited, with only one purpose, and that is to punish one of our \ncountry's premier health organizations because it provides women access \nto an array of services that we need to lead healthy lives. The bill is \nbased upon lies and exaggerations.\n  Now, if you want to have a truthful debate, then let's talk about the \n400,000 Pap smears, the 500,000 breast exams, and the 4.5 million STD \nand HIV tests that Planned Parenthood does each year. Now, that is \nsaving lives. That is the truth.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Madam Speaker, many years ago, I was in London with my \nfamily at the British Museum and watched a little movie about the \ndevelopment and growth of a baby inside a mother's womb. The video was \nall about life, tracking the baby's development week by week.\n  Recently, we have all watched videos where Planned Parenthood \nexecutives candidly talked about death. How can anyone defend the sale \nof a little baby's body parts? Why should Federal taxpayers support \norganizations that rob little ones of their right to life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness?\n  Planned Parenthood has betrayed the rights and life of America's most \ndefenseless. Today I am asking that you join me in supporting the \nDefund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, which effectively halts Federal \nfunding of Planned Parenthood for 1 year or until they can certify that \ntheir affiliates and clinics are not and will not perform abortions.\n  I thank Congresswoman Diane Black for her leadership on this issue. \nThe character of our Nation is at stake. We must restore the value and \nsanctity of every life and fight back against those unfathomable acts. \nLife is precious. Let's cherish each and every one.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, what we have learned about Planned \nParenthood through these videos is appalling, barbaric, and \nindefensible. Here are some of the quotes:\n\n       We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver . . . so \n     I'm not gonna crush that part.\n       Using a ``less crunchy'' technique to get more whole \n     specimens.\n       We're going to procure brain . . . so what you do is you go \n     through the face . . .\n\n  And when discussing the sale of body parts, a Planned Parenthood \nofficial asks:\n\n       Well, why don't you start by telling me what you're used to \n     paying?\n\n  Madam Speaker, our Nation is so much better than this. The cold \nindifference shown in these videos is the inevitable result for an \norganization that does hundreds of thousands of abortions every year.\n  Federally funded clinics that serve women's health and do not perform \nabortions outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics by between two to one. \nLet's send the funds to those clinics.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Ms. CASTRO of Florida. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. I don't think anybody on your side has read the bill. It \ndoesn't do anything that you have talked about.\n  It doesn't stop abortions. It doesn't stop any of those other issues \nthat are already illegal. It does one thing: It shuts down Planned \nParenthood clinics.\n  I represent the largest affiliate of Planned Parenthood in the United \nStates. And guess what. Twenty-two percent of the patients are men. So \nyou are going to deny access not only to women, but to men.\n  You say: ``Oh, we will shift the money somewhere else.'' There is \nnowhere else. These are the only clinics around in many of the \ncommunities.\n  So what you are doing is taking this angry white man's caucus on the \nRepublican side that have been for years trying to use this as a \npolitical issue, using a bill that says you are going to do all these \nthings. It only does one thing: it penalizes Planned Parenthood.\n  Penalizing Planned Parenthood penalizes us all. It is about access to \nhealth care, particularly, access to health care for women.\n  Stop beating up on women. Stop trying to make this a political issue. \nThe reason we haven't been able to legislate against abortion is \nbecause you can't find a law that can enforce it.\n  This is really a moral issue and a medical issue that ought to be \ndiscussed with women and their doctors. Congress Members ought to stay \nout of this.\n  We haven't been successful in solving these problems. This only hurts \npeople, particularly in rural areas, because the majority of Planned \nParenthood clinics are in rural areas.\n  Stop being so mean. Solve problems, not create them.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their \nremarks to the Chair and not to other Members.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  I would encourage all Members to read the bill. It is very short. It \nis about three pages. What it will do is freeze this funding for a year \nso we can do the investigation, and it sends it to some of the 13,000 \ncommunity health centers that are in the country.\n  We have even got a press release from one of their colleagues \nextolling the values of these community health centers.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  The appalling videos that have been released revealing Planned \nParenthood's horrific activities should spur deep concern in every \nAmerican.\n  In a recent hearing with Secretary Burwell, I asked her whether the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services would probe into these \nallegations, but she refused to commit to an investigation.\n  We have a moral responsibility to act to investigate this \norganization's actions and hold them accountable.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 3\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nJody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, the recent allegations \nand videos that have come forth have literally shocked the world by \nshowcasing the morally bankrupt practices of Planned Parenthood.\n  I am honored to stand with my colleagues to try to prevent tax \ndollars from going to this organization that has now stooped to the \npractice of trafficking innocent baby parts, they say, for the purpose \nof advancing medical research, but we all know that there is no excuse \nthat can possibly be given to provide for the moral bankruptcy of \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  It is time to defund this while the investigation occurs. The blood \nand body parts of children should be looked at as a sacred entity \nrather than an industry.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine \n(Ms. Pingree).\n  Ms. PINGREE. I thank my friend for yielding and for her excellent \nremarks on the floor this morning.\n  Madam Speaker, defunding Planned Parenthood would have a real, \nprofound, negative impact on the 10,000 people in Maine who get health \ncare from Planned Parenthood every year, many of whom have no other \naccess to care.\n  Planned Parenthood provides basic health care like cancer screenings, \nvaccinations, wellness exams, and STD testing, basic care that will \nmean the difference between health and sickness, prosperity and \npoverty, or even life and death for women in my State.\n  Let's be clear. Who is really behind the attempts to defund Planned \nParenthood? Radical antiabortion groups who want to shut down Planned \nParenthood and deny women access to safe and legal abortions. These are \ngroups who want to deny women the right to make a private, personal \nmedical decision.\n  In the process, they want to take away the access to birth control, \nfamily planning services, and even basic\n\n[[Page H6162]]\n\nhealth care. They have orchestrated a false, misleading smear campaign \nto try and accomplish their goal, a campaign we have heard a lot today \nabout here on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and stand up for women's rights \nto make their own decisions about health care and protect their access \nto basic medical services.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Speaker, during the recent Presidential debates \nCarly Fiorina called and dared President Obama and Hillary Clinton to \nwatch these appalling videos.\n  I realize we only have a few minutes left, but I want to dare Members \non the other side to watch these videos, too. There are computers in \nthe cloakroom where they can watch them.\n  If they want to send one taxpayer dime to Planned Parenthood after \nwatching it, shame on them. There are much better places to send it, \nlike these community health centers created under President Obama's \nbill. There are lots of places women can go for health care, not just \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Go watch the videos.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I am pleased to yield 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. It is bizarre to watch the manufactured controversy \nsurrounding ambush-type, heavily edited filming used to discredit \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  These attacks do not reflect my experience and knowledge of the \namazing, dedicated, civic-minded men and women--pillars of our \ncommunity--who have built, supported, and led Planned Parenthood in my \ncommunity.\n  There is no question that, because of their efforts, tens of \nthousands of abortions never occurred. Because of their efforts, 70,000 \nwomen in Oregon last year received services.\n  They are people who know their communities, Planned Parenthood \nleadership understands that this heated rhetoric, outrageous claims, \nand attack against service to low-income women is not just false, it is \nwrong.\n  It is bizarre to watch the manufactured controversy surrounding \nambush-type, heavily-edited journalism used to discredit Planned \nParenthood.\n  It's not just the blatantly manipulative and misleading tactics that \nare being used, which should be enough for most people to reject the \nallegations on their face. These attacks do not reflect my experience \nand knowledge of the amazing, dedicated, civic-minded men and women who \nhave built, supported, and led Planned Parenthood in my community.\n  For decades, I have admired these pillars of community, leaders in \neducation, religion, business, and other civic affairs that provided \nthe vision, the volunteer effort, and personal contributions to women's \nhealth and reproductive freedom. There is no question that because of \ntheir efforts, tens of thousands of abortions never occurred in our \ncommunity and those that did occur, did not result in harm to women.\n  Because of their efforts, Oregon's 11 Planned Parenthood centers \nprovided care to over 70,000 women in 2013, including over 25,000 \nbreast and cervical cancer screenings. Nationally, Planned Parenthood \nservices over 2.5 million women annually. Planned Parenthood centers \nserve a greater share of safety-net clients than any other type of \nsafety-net providers. Nearly 80 percent of women using Planned \nParenthood have incomes at or below 150 percent of poverty--these \nclinics offer affordable health care options for women who may have no \nalternate source of care.\n  The fact that we are engaged in a concerted assault against the \nprovision of essential services to women, especially women of color and \nlow-income status is appalling. If people would take the time, as I \nhave, to visit these facilities, meet the employees, and most \nimportantly, know these community leaders that have made it possible to \nprotect women's health, to prevent countless abortions, and to promote \nwellbeing and education, they would see the lies behind this heated \nrhetoric and misguided attacks.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I serve on the board of health in \nCincinnati, Ohio, and I am very familiar with FQHCs. I might say that \nFQHCs provide services, expansive services, not only to women, but men \nand children as well.\n  My wife and I are currently in the process of adoption, and it \nsickens me to see these parts of young children sitting there, knowing \nthat we could take them, love them, and nurture them into a wonderful \nlife. I don't know how people look at themselves in the mirror and \nthink that this is okay.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  The Republican Congress has fundamentally failed to fulfill its basic \nresponsibility to work out an appropriations plan that will keep this \ngovernment open. This bill, to inflame the passion that is based on \nfalse videos, distorted clips that was part of a coordinated smear \ncampaign all across the country, is being used as the foundation to \nclose the government.\n  I hope it doesn't happen, but it appears that the dysfunction in the \nRepublican Congress is going to lead us down that path, at the expense \nof women's health care, their basic fundamental services all across \nthis country.\n  Last spring, we asked the Republicans in Congress to sit down and \nhammer out an appropriations plan. They refused. They adjourned at the \nend of July. Nothing happened in August. Nothing has happened here in \nSeptember, except for these inflammatory bills based upon false YouTube \nvideos.\n  This Republican Congress' continuing dysfunction and inability to \ngovern are having real effects on hard-working Americans. This ``Deny \nWomen Health Care Act'' is a cynical attack on the ability of women to \nreceive the health services they need.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote, and I urge my Republican colleagues to keep the \ngovernment open for hard-working Americans.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, where have we gone? Where is the \nmoral compass of the United States? Do we want to continue the issue of \ntaking body parts of babies and selling them on the open market and \nprotecting that enterprise? Or do we want to back up and say, if that \nis occurring, we are not funding it?\n  All this legislation does is say: Wait a minute, if that is occurring \nin America, we are not going to tolerate it. Until we find out, no more \nmoney, and it should go to other agencies that don't harvest the body \nparts of babies.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I am going to close and draw to an end this debate. I do want to \nremind all my colleagues that we are not discussing government \nshutdown. What we are talking about is a bill that would withhold funds \nfrom Planned Parenthood for a period of a year, while we have an \ninvestigation.\n  Now, I know they have called this a smear campaign. We are \ninvestigating the operations of Planned Parenthood.\n  Why are we doing this? Planned Parenthood is big abortion in this \ncountry--300,000 abortions a year, as opposed to 1,800 adoption \nservices; 98.5 percent of all women who go there for a prenatal \nservice, it is an abortion. Think about that, 98.5 percent.\n  There is reason to review how they use taxpayer funding, and we are \njustified in withholding taxpayer funds until we finish that.\n  Now, our colleagues have chosen to say that we are radical, dumb, \nshameful, disrespectful, foolish, extremists, deniers, deprivers, mean-\nspirited, and beating up on women. Think about that. All because we \nstand for life, for liberty. We stand for life rights, a first right, \nand these are the names that you attach to people who defend those \nrights.\n  Saturday, I went to a baby shower. An excited grandmother said, Meet \nmy granddaughter. It was an ultrasound, a 3-D ultrasound. Her name is \nJessica. That is a baby with a life, and Planned Parenthood is aborting \n300,000 of those lives each year.\n  It is time for taxpayer money to be withheld. I support the bill.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, today I speak in support of H.R. 3134, \nthe Defund\n\n[[Page H6163]]\n\nPlanned Parenthood Act of 2015, to terminate taxpayer support of this \ndeplorable organization.\n  I'd like to thank my good friend, Congresswoman Diane Black for her \nleadership on this issue and her unwavering support for the lives of \nthe unborn.\n  This summer, we have learned of the shocking nature of Planned \nParenthood's practice of selling babies' hearts, lungs, livers, brains \nand other organs, often for a profit, to the highest bidder.\n  We were disturbed by what we learned about these practices, but \nperhaps even more so by the cold indifference in which countless \nemployees dehumanized unborn children, effectively turning them into \nline item revenue sources, rather than human life in its most precious \nform.\n  After discovering the grotesque nature of these practices, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives responded to these abhorrent activities by \nlaunching investigative hearings, the first of which began in the House \nJudiciary Committee last week.\n  Yet the very same week we began investigating the extent of the \nwrongdoing, the Executive Branch, through the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, awarded Planned Parenthood of Missouri, Iowa and \nMontana with over $1 million in taxpayer support.\n  The only response to this unthinkable action is for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, the legislative body with constitutional authority \nover federal funds, to pass legislation expressly prohibiting the \nfederal government from supporting Planned Parenthood.\n  Madam Speaker, it is not enough for the U.S. House of Representatives \nto deny funds from a single continuing resolution or omnibus spending \npackage.\n  Instead we must do so permanently and Congresswoman Black's \nlegislation gives Congress an opportunity to continue our \ninvestigations into Planned Parenthood and work toward the day when we \nare no longer funding this abhorrent organization.\n  In the short term, there is much work to be done.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives is responsible for acting on behalf \nof the American people and investigating the extent to which Planned \nParenthood's has profited from this activity.\n  Furthermore we must make sure that Planned Parenthood has not been \nengaging in illegal partial birth abortions.\n  We must determine whether or not Planned Parenthood has been breaking \nthe law by altering abortion procedures to preserve certain organs for \nsale.\n  We must protect women and unborn children from these dangerous \nprocedures that are designed to increase revenue for this group and \nprofit from the destruction innocent life.\n  And perhaps most importantly, we must provide funding for other \norganizations that provide women's health care support and services--\nwithout also offering abortions.\n  And we must not continue taxpayer funding for groups like Planned \nParenthood that believe they are above the laws of the United States.\n  We have a duty, as elected Representatives to stand up for the most \nvulnerable among us, to lend a voice to the voiceless, and fight back \nagainst injustice.\n  And so I lend my full support to H.R. 3134, so that we may defund \nPlanned Parenthood and provide vulnerable women with better options for \ntheir health care needs.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in \nstrong opposition to H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.\n  This bill is partisan politics at its worst. The attacks on Planned \nParenthood are nothing more than political witch-hunts led by anti-\nabortion extremists. Their efforts to mislead the public and tarnish \nthe reputation of Planned Parenthood are downright shameful.\n  Here are the facts: millions of American families, particularly in \nunderserved areas, rely on Planned Parenthood for family planning \nservices and basic women's healthcare. Seventy-eight percent of Planned \nParenthood patients live with incomes at 150 percent of the federal \npoverty level or less, and almost half a million of their patients are \nLatinos. Were it not for Planned Parenthood, these families, including \nover 25 thousand in my district, would have nowhere to turn for basic \nhealth care needs.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood has implications for the 2.7 million \nAmericans across the country who count on Planned Parenthood for STD \nand STI testing, cancer screenings, contraceptive care, and other \nhealth services. These basic and critical healthcare services which \naccount for 97% of those provided at Planned Parenthood, are what is \nreally being defunded here.\n  It's been 42 years since the United States Supreme Court ruled that a \nwoman has the constitutional right to choose what is best for her \nhealth and her body. Since then, anti-abortion extremists have been \nworking tirelessly to chip away at this constitutional protection. This \ntime, Madam Speaker, the ramifications of their efforts extend far \nbeyond abortion. They threaten the health and well-being of millions of \nhard-working American families in my district and across the country.\n  The majority always argues for small government. I guess this time \nthey want a government small enough to fit inside the exam room with a \nwoman and her doctor.\n  Madam Speaker, I'd like to submit a letter signed by 13 Latino \nadvocacy groups in opposition to defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\n                                                   August 3, 2015.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members of Congress: As organizations committed to the \n     civil and human rights, health equity, and well-being of \n     Latino/as, our families, and our communities, we the thirteen \n     undersigned organizations urge you to oppose all efforts to \n     defund Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) or \n     other healthcare providers that Latinos/as rely on for high \n     quality care.\n       The recent manipulated and misleading attacks on PPFA are \n     yet another political attempt to target providers of \n     reproductive health services. The real agenda behind these \n     attacks is to block access to basic health services, \n     particularly for low-income communities, women of color, and \n     young people. These tactics also create an atmosphere of fear \n     and shame intended to intimidate women who seek abortion and \n     those who provide the much needed care.\n       Such attacks on PPFA, a critical provider of vital health \n     services to low-income women and women of color, threatens to \n     unravel the reproductive health safety net that our Latino/a \n     community relies on. We have already seen such efforts as in \n     Texas when the state legislature authorized the ``affiliate \n     rule'' that barred all Planned Parenthood health centers from \n     receiving state funds. In 2012, the first full year following \n     the devastating cuts to family planning funding and \n     implementation of the ``affiliate rule,'' Texas met only 13 \n     percent of the need for publicly funded contraception--less \n     than half of national totals for the same year.\n       Furthermore, defunding PPFA would have a devastating impact \n     on the Latino/a community which experiences higher rates of \n     reproductive cancers, unintended pregnancy, and sexually \n     transmitted infections than most other groups of people in \n     the U.S. In fact, according to the latest statistics from the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Latinas have the \n     highest cervical cancer incidence rates. Latinos/as, \n     including LGBTQ Latinos/as, immigrant women, and women of \n     color experience system barriers such as cost, lack of \n     available clinics, insufficient culturally and linguistically \n     competent health systems, and discriminatory immigration \n     policies that make it difficult for individuals and \n     communities to access routine healthcare. For decades, \n     Latinos/as have been the most uninsured racial and ethnic \n     group.\n       That is why our communities rely on Planned Parenthood for \n     quality healthcare. In 2013, PPFA's clinics served 575,000 \n     Latinos/as, which was 22 percent of their overall patients. \n     We will not tolerate any attempts to cut Latinos/as off from \n     this care.\n       We strongly urge you to oppose all proposals to defund PPFA \n     and stand with the undersigned organizations to protect the \n     right to health care for Latinos/as and other persons of \n     color. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact Ann Marie Benitez, Senior Director of Government \n     Relations, at National Latina Institute for Reproductive \n     Health.\n           Signed,\n         Casa de Esperanza, Farmworker Justice, Hispanic \n           Federation, Labor Council for Latin American \n           Advancement, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, League of United \n           Latin American Citizens, Mexican American Legal Defense \n           and Educational Fund, National Alliance of Latin \n           American and Caribbean Communities, National Hispanic \n           Media Coalition, National Latina Institute for \n           Reproductive Health, Presente, U.S.-Mexico Foundation, \n           VotoLatino.\n\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this brazen \nassault on women's health, which would harm lower income women around \nthis nation.\n  The legislation we are debating today would mean that women with \nlimited health options will find it harder to secure lifesaving \nservices--like breast exams and pap tests. In New York alone, cutting \nPlanned Parenthood funding would mean that nearly 50,000 fewer breast \nexams would occur. 37,000 women would no longer receive pap tests. \nMillions of women nationwide would no longer have access to STI \nscreenings and treatments, to say nothing of additional unplanned \npregnancies.\n  These are just some of the critical treatments and procedures Planned \nParenthood provides--some of which save women's lives. If you want to \nproclaim yourself ``pro-life'' then you should care about women's \nlives--not focus on depriving them of health care services and \ncontraception.\n  Today, we have just a few legislative days left before another \nRepublican-fueled government shutdown. We know this misguided bill\n\n[[Page H6164]]\n\nwe are debating is going nowhere. It will not pass the Senate. If it \ndid, the President would veto it.\n  Yet, House Republicans remain obsessed with attacking Planned \nParenthood and reducing women's healthcare options--to the point where \nthey are ready to engender another government shutdown.\n  We need to reject this legislation so we get back to the serious \nbusiness of governing. Support women's health care, vote no on the \nbill.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I stand in strong \nopposition to H.R. 3134, Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015.\n  This debate and vote are another attempt to deny women basic health \ncare, including reproductive health services. 2.7 million patients--\nboth men and women--all across America depend on Planned Parenthood for \ncritical medical services every year. In my district, if you go to a \nPlanned Parenthood clinic at the end of the day, women, many of modest \nmeans, will be lined up through the waiting room and, often, down the \nstreet, waiting to be seen.\n  While supporters of this bill claim women will have other comparable \noptions, the experts tell us that is simply not the case. The non-\npartisan Congressional Budget Office found that if this bill is passed, \nas many as 630,000 Planned Parenthood patients could lose access to \nbirth control, STD screening, and other reproductive health services. \nAnd researchers at the Guttmacher Institute estimate that in 103 of \nAmerica's 491 counties, Planned Parenthood is the only safety-net \nfamily planning clinic.\n  I am outraged by this attempt to use a heavily edited and thoroughly \ndiscredited video to vilify an organization that plays a vital role in \ncommunities across the nation. Planned Parenthood should be celebrated, \nnot demonized, and I hope my colleagues reject this dangerous and \ndisingenuous piece of legislation.\n  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I come to the House floor to stand \nup for women's health.\n  Republicans are using a heavily edited, agenda-driven series of \nvideos that falsely portray Planned Parenthood's participation in \ntissue donation programs that support lifesaving scientific research. \nThese outrageous and false claims about Planned Parenthood have been \ndiscredited. Edited and distorted video should not undermine the \nincredible work that Planned Parenthood does across this country in \nproviding critical health care to millions of women.\n  This bill to defund Planned Parenthood would not defund abortion. \nOnly three percent of all health services provided by Planned \nParenthood are abortion services, and these services already cannot be \npaid for with federal funding. What this bill would defund is basic \nhealth services for millions of women. Planned Parenthood provides \nfamily planning counseling and contraception to 2.1 million patients, \n400,000 lifesaving screenings for cervical cancer, nearly 500,000 \nbreast exams, and nearly 4.5 million tests and treatments for sexually \ntransmitted infections, including HIV.\n  Despite news this week that the number of uninsured Americans \ndecreased by 8.8 million last year thanks to the Affordable Care Act, \n33 million Americans still have no health insurance. Perhaps hardest \nhit by this defunding effort will be the women who live in one of the \n20 states that have declined the Medicaid expansion provided by the \nAffordable Care Act and who rely on Planned Parenthood for lifesaving \nhealth care.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood would also be devastating for low-income \ncommunities, women of color, and young people. It would unravel our \nnation's reproductive health safety net. Planned Parenthood health \ncenters comprise 10% of all publicly funded family planning centers, \nand serve 36% of all clients who obtain care from the nation's network \nof family planning providers. The view of some Republicans that federal \nfunding could simply be redistributed to other health care centers and \nproviders ignores where Planned Parenthood health centers are located. \nThey are not typically on Main Street, but rather in areas and \nneighborhoods where they are most needed. For example, a new Planned \nParenthood center currently under construction here in D.C. is located \nin a underserved area in Ward 5 whose population greatly needs access \nto the health services that Planned Parenthood provides.\n  Unfortunately, we in the District of Columbia know all too well this \ntype of assault on women's reproductive health and Planned Parenthood. \nWhenever Republicans have controlled the House, they have imposed a \ndevastating rider on the District that prevents us from spending our \nlocally raised taxes on abortion services for low-income women, \nsingling us out as the only jurisdiction in the country that cannot \nspend its local tax dollars for such purposes. We were successful in \ngetting that rider removed from the Senate's fiscal year 2016 D.C. \nAppropriations bill, and we will continue to fight to have the rider \nremoved from any final spending bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this hyper-partisan bill, which \nwould devastate women's access to health services, most drastically in \nlow-income and minority communities.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise to express several serious \nconcerns with the flawed process that led to a flawed product, H.R. \n3134, the ``Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015.''\n  Ten shocking videos released over the last few months document what \nmany already knew was happening at Planned Parenthood facilities around \nour nation--the selling and trafficking of fetal organs for a profit. \nFor the vast majority of Americans who view human life as sacred, these \nvideos halve caused righteous anger and disgust that the taxpayer-\nsubsidized ``non-profit organization'' is not only extinguishing human \nlife but also making money off of human parts--at the taxpayers' \nexpense.\n  This is the moment for the pro-life movement to hold this evil \norganization accountable by completely and unequivocally defunding \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Rather than fighting to protect life and actually defunding Planned \nParenthood, we are voting today on a weak bill, without teeth, that \ndoes not defund Planned Parenthood.\n  H.R. 3134 only places a one-year moratorium on federal funding of \nPlanned Parenthood. Furthermore, it includes exceptions to continue to \nallow taxpayer dollars to go to Planned Parenthood and its abortion \nfactories.\n  With all we know about what goes on at Planned Parenthood's abortion \nfactories, why are we voting on a bill to ``defund'' Planned Parenthood \nfor one year?\n  What's worse, H.R. 3134 does not defund Planned Parenthood. The \nexceptions included in this bill allow taxpayer dollars to be used to \nfund abortions performed at Planned Parenthood. In effect, this bill is \na proactive vote by the GOP-controlled House of Representatives to \naffirmatively fund abortions at Planned Parentlgd facilities. The very \nbill leadership has promoted as the solution to this grisly problem--\nthe taxpayer funded mutilation of fully formed children--actually \nrubber stamps the existing situation.\n  Furthermore, the certification process in this bill is ripe for fraud \nand abuse. All Planned Parenthood needs to do is certify it is already \nfollowing federal law and the Hyde Amendment to continue to receive \nfunding. Who ensures this certification? Once Planned Parenthood \nreceives federal funding and is found to violate this Act, what is the \nprocess for the executive branch to seek repayment of this money? H.R. \n3134 does not go far enough to address concerns for fraud and abuse.\n  Because of my serious concerns with the substance of H.R. 3134, I \noffered an amendment to the Rules Committee on Wednesday, September 16, \n2015. My amendment states:\n  ``No funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law may be made \navailable for any purpose to--(1) Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica, Inc.; (2) any affiliate or clinic of Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, Inc.; or (3) any successor of Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, Inc. or any such affiliate or clinic.''\n  My amendment is simple: no federal funds to Planned Parenthood. \nPeriod. No one-year moratorium. No exceptions. That should be the goal \nof this debate and any legislation to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  Unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not approve my amendment for \ndebate on the floor or adopt it as part of the underlying bill. If my \namendment was considered on the floor, I am confident that my \ncolleagues would have overwhelming support and adopted my amendment \ninto the underlying bill.\n  The funding fight starts now--this is our marker--H.R. 3134 is not a \nsufficient vote to defund Planned Parenthood. I expect much stronger \nlanguage than this in the CR coming up in the next few weeks. Innocent, \nunborn babies deserve more than just a show vote.\n  For these reasons, I will cast a present vote.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 421, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n[[Page H6165]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. ESTY. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. ESTY. I am, in its current form.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Esty moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 3134, to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. NO IMPACT ON FUNDING FOR ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING \n                   WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 3, nothing in this Act shall impact \n     the amount of funding available for any organization that \n     provides women's health services, such as preventive care and \n     cancer screenings, in appropriations legislation for fiscal \n     year 2016, including any continuing resolution.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.\n  Ms. ESTY. Madam Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill \nwhich will not stop the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthis bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  I rise today as a mother, as a woman, and as a Representative to \noffer this straightforward amendment to protect women's access to vital \nhealth care.\n  Contrary to what many Americans have been led to believe, the bill \nbefore us today is not about abortion. This bill would, however, \nrestrict women's access to health care all across the country by \nentirely eliminating all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n  Let's be very clear. No Federal tax dollars go towards abortions, and \nnone have since 1976. That is not what this bill is about.\n  We all know a woman who has been diagnosed with cancer--cervical \ncancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer. It may be your mother, your \nneighbor, or your wife who sought preventive care or cancer screening \nfrom a doctor of her choice.\n  Yes, we all know a woman who has received quality medical care at \nPlanned Parenthood. In fact, one in five American women have sought \nmedical care from Planned Parenthood. It may be your daughter. It may \nbe your boss. It may be your colleague.\n  My amendment will ensure that any qualified organization that \nprovides women's health services can receive funding. It is simple, and \nit is fair.\n  We need more access to quality health care, not less. We need to stop \ntrying to restrict access to lifesaving cancer screenings, birth \ncontrol, and well-woman exams. We need to stop fighting 40-year-old \nbattles on women's rights.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood would have a devastating impact on \nwomen, especially low-income women, women in rural communities, and \nwomen of color.\n  It is not only women who receive health care at Planned Parenthood. \nMen receive health care at Planned Parenthood, too.\n  Here are some facts about Planned Parenthood's critical role in \nproviding health services to Americans every year.\n  Planned Parenthood provides family planning counseling and \ncontraceptive care to 2.1 million Americans, more than 1.1 million \npregnancy tests, nearly 400,000 Pap smear tests, and nearly 500,000 \nlifesaving breast exams.\n  Let's remember that, in many areas, Planned Parenthood is the only \nsource of family planning services. That is why, in 1976, as a college \nfreshman, I volunteered for Planned Parenthood because I had seen the \nimpact on young women in my rural high school who had no access to \nfamily planning services. Too many got pregnant, dropped out of school, \nand never pursued their dreams.\n  Today, with only 5 legislative days left, we should be focusing on \navoiding a reckless and unnecessary government shutdown.\n  Do you remember the last government shutdown, the one that cost us \n$24 billion? No wonder some don't think America is great right now. \nDysfunction in this Congress is undermining the American people's faith \nin democracy.\n  We, in Congress, have the power to act. We have the opportunity, and \nwe have the duty to set aside ideological battles and, instead, take up \nthe urgent business of the American people.\n  We should reauthorize the Export-Import Bank and pass a long-term, \nwell-funded highway trust fund bill, investing in America's \ninfrastructure, to ensure that America will continue to be great \nthroughout the 21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to ensure that American \nwomen have access to vital health care, no matter where they live and \nno matter how much they earn.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point \nof order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \nmotion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, we all know that Planned Parenthood \nreceives hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. For them to get that \nmoney, while they are under investigation for profiting off the sale of \nbody parts, baby body parts, is just absolutely abhorrent.\n  What this bill does is to put a 1-year moratorium while we conduct \nthe investigation. Let's be real clear about that, a 1-year moratorium \nwhile we do our due diligence. That is what you call smart business, \ndoing your due diligence, being a steward of the taxpayers' money.\n  Now, I have found it so interesting that they continue to say this \nwill cut access to women's health care. No, it will not.\n  Do you know Planned Parenthood sees less than 2 percent of all \nAmerican women in a given year? There is an amendment on this \nlegislation by Mrs. Ellmers, it redirects $235 million to the FQHCs, \nthe federally qualified health centers.\n  It will increase access because we have more of those centers in more \nunderserved areas, and they are required to provide services which \ninclude diagnostic lab and radiological services.\n  Planned Parenthood has cut those screenings and cancer screenings and \nthose services in half over the last few years, while they have \nincreased their abortions to 300,000 a year.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  We are right in restricting these funds to Planned Parenthood while \nwe conduct this investigation. We are right to be a steward of the \ntaxpayer money.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit and a \n``yes'' vote on the passage of H.R. 3134.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. ESTY. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by \n5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and passage of H.R. \n3504.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 183, \nnays 245, not voting 6, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 504]\n\n                               YEAS--183\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n\n[[Page H6166]]\n\n\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

It is 6 legislative days, Mr. Speaker.\n  The Export-Import Bank has been allowed to essentially go out of \nbusiness for new loans, and we are losing jobs, Mr. Speaker, but there \nis no schedule.

Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick and tired of \ntalk. They want action.\n  For 3 years now, Senate Democrats have blocked votes on bills \nimportant to all Americans. They have blindly supported the President's \nfailed policies and have shielded him from having to defend his \npolicies to the American people.\n  House Republicans have heard the American cry for help. We fought to \nrepeat ObamaCare. We fought to stop the reckless Iranian nuclear \nagreement. Once again, we are fighting to defend the defenseless. We \nhave passed budgets that will reduce our national debt, stop job-\nkilling regulations, provide for our national defense, and get \nAmericans working again.\n  Republicans control Congress. We have better solutions to the \nproblems that face our Nation. It is time for the President to go on \nrecord for his opposition to commonsense solutions that put America \nfirst. This can only happen if the Senate employs the nuclear option. \nIt is time to change the Senate rules and force this President and the \nSenate to work for the American people instead of against them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6168-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CALLING FOR BIPARTISAN BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  (Mr. TAKAI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TAKAI.

Mr. Speaker, unless we act soon, our government's \nfunctions will cease in 10 days. At the end of October, transportation \nand highway constructions will halt. Instead, Congress can do the right \nthing to create jobs for millions of Americans across this country.\n  This summer, the regular process for funding the government broke \ndown because the majority couldn't figure out its stance on the \nConfederate flag. Today, partisan extremists are threatening another \nshutdown over women's health care that would be a self-inflicted hit to \nour economy.\n  We know that shutting down the government would be devastating for \nour economy. Standard & Poor's estimated that the 2013 shutdown cost \nour economy $24 billion in economic activity; so instead of flirting \nwith the government shutdown disaster, we should be investing in our \nfuture.\n  Twice this summer, Congress did the bare minimum by passing multiple, \nshort-term extensions to the highway trust fund, mostly through \naccounting gimmicks. Across the board, from workers organizations to \nbusiness groups, there is opposition to a government shutdown and \nsupport for long-term investments in infrastructure.\n  We should get to work, making it easier for Americans to grow their \nbusinesses and to create high-quality jobs instead of punishing our \ninfrastructure, our military, and our economy with foolish \npartisanship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6168-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6168-H6169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WELCOME POPE FRANCIS\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, in just a matter of days, we will welcome \nPope Francis to the Nation's Capital.\n  Pope Francis is the 266th Bishop of Rome, following a line of \nsuccession that goes all the way back to St. Peter 2,000 years ago. The \nsixteenth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew teaches that Jesus told \nPeter that he would be the rock on whom Jesus would build his church.\n  Now, for the first time in history, Peter's successor will address \nCongress.\n  Here is an interesting perspective: America remains a young Nation \ncompared to the 2,000-year-old Catholic church. While we have had 44 \ndifferent Presidents--President Obama is the 45th President because \ncount Grover Cleveland as the 22nd and 24th President--just 16 of the \nchurch's 266 popes have governed the church since 1776.\n\n[[Page H6169]]\n\n  The Pope's visit offers all Americans, Catholics and non-Catholics \nalike, a chance to reflect on the great issues of the day, including \nthe sanctity of life, threats to the family, religious freedom, \neconomic justice, care for the less fortunate, war and peace, and \nstewardship of the Earth.\n  Pope Francis' visit is an invitation to dialogue, and I look forward \nto his address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6169-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, this week, one of the largest employers in my \ndistrict, General Electric, announced it would be cutting hundreds of \njobs nationwide due to Congress'--due to the leadership in this House--\ninability to renew the Export-Import Bank.\n  This politics over people and Republican dysfunction has plagued this \nbody since the GOP won the majority. It has led to a government \nshutdown, obsession with blocking the President at every turn, and now \na loss of hundreds of jobs in my district, Schenectady, New York.\n  The blame game is played all too often in Washington and at the desks \nof cable news pundits.\n  This, however, is a fact: hundreds of jobs in my district are gone \nbecause Republican House leadership decided it was more important to \nappease the extreme conservative flank of their own party than to renew \nan agency that creates jobs while cutting the deficit.\n  As the Albany Times-Union accurately phrased it: ``This is the price \ntag of a Congress ruled by drown-government-in-the-bathtub ideologues \nwho have no regard for facts: 500 American jobs bound for France, \nHungary, and China.''\n  I invite anyone in this body to visit Schenectady, New York. There, \nthey will find families that work hard and play by the rules and don't \nexpect a handout. In this case, a dysfunctional Congress shut down a \nprogram that lost families in my district their jobs. That is morally \nreprehensible and completely unacceptable.\n  Let's do our job and not have other people lose their job because of \ninaction in this House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6169-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FEDERAL AGENCIES NEED MORE OVERSIGHT\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, Congress has a duty to ensure that taxpayer \ndollars by hard-working Americans are spent wisely and responsibly. \nHowever, too often, we have seen Federal agencies that have acted in a \nway that waste taxpayer money by holding excessive conferences with \nextravagant gifts, luxuries, and perks.\n  We all remember the lavish Las Vegas GSA conference that cost \n$823,000 for 300 employees, including tens of thousands of dollars \nspent on gifts. The IRS spent a whopping $50 million--taxpayer \ndollars--on conferences alone during a 3-year period.\n  These agencies need more accountability. That is why my colleague, \nRon Kind, and I have introduced the bipartisan TRACE Act. This \nlegislation simply requires the head of a Federal agency who is hosting \na conference to submit a summary of that event to Congress for review.\n  This initiative will hold agencies accountable. It will improve \noversight and transparency. It will save hard-earned taxpayer money, \nand it will create a more efficient and effective government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6169-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        STANDING UP FOR AMERICA\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this Nation has a great history, and I \nwould ask the question: What would Franklin Delano Roosevelt do, \nPresident Eisenhower, or Ronald Reagan, or John F. Kennedy, when a \nquestion from someone in the room attacked and presented a negative \nattitude about Muslims or Catholics or those in the Jewish faith or \nProtestant?\n  Well, it happened in a townhall meeting of a Presidential candidate. \nThis person thought that they were maligning and deriding the President \nof the United States when they called him Muslim and that he was not a \ncitizen; yet no voice rang out in this townhall meeting to oppose that \nheinous and horrific attitude toward individuals of the Muslim faith, \nwho actually have fought on behalf of the flag of the United States of \nAmerica. We malign no people for a general issue that all of us know we \nare all against, the world family is against.\n  Now, I ask this Congress to likewise fund this government because the \nlast time, when the Republicans shut the government down in 2013, we \nlost $24 billion.\n  Because you are denying women health care, you now want to defund the \ngovernment and, at the same time, keep jobs away from the American \npeople by not reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  Not only were 300 jobs lost, but 400 jobs may be lost by a \nbusinessman in Kenya who was waiting for the Export-Import Bank. He is \nan American, and he had 400 jobs.\n  I say, Mr. Speaker, stop the foolishness.

Mr. Speaker, under the President's nuclear deal, \nthe United States agreed to give the world's largest state sponsor of \nterrorism a billion-dollar oil boom. The United States will allow Iran \nto export its crude oil, but ironically, it still bans exports of our \ncrude oil.\n  The administration has the power to lift the American ban on crude \noil exports, but the White House seems to be more worried about playing \nthe Chamberlain and appeasing Iran than helping the United States \neconomy.\n  The United States is the largest crude oil producer in the world. \nThere is a world demand for this oil, but the White House will not \nallow exports, so the oil stays stagnant in the ground.\n  This ban is one factor that has led to 70,000 jobs being lost in the \nenergy sector in America. Exporting U.S. crude oil will lower gas \nprices, create jobs, and increase our influence worldwide.\n  If the President won't act, Congress must. It is time to stop putting \nthe interests of the mullahs and the haters of the United States above \nAmericans citizens.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we have talked about a lot this week. There \nhas been a lot going on in Congress. We haven't gotten to spend much \ntime recognizing that yesterday was Constitution Day, September 17, \ncelebrating that summer in 1787 where they worked all summer long and \nall the way up until September 17 to craft this document that I would \nargue has preserved our freedoms for over 200 years. I want to talk \nabout what I would argue is a national threat, a bipartisan threat to \nthose principles embodied in that Constitution.\n  By way of background, Mr. Speaker, I want to put up a quote from \nJames Madison. You can't see it from where you are, but James Madison \nsays this:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and \n     judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, \n     and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may \n     justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about tyranny in different governments \naround the globe. What James Madison says is we are not talking about \none evil dictator.\n  Mr. Kinzinger was down here just a moment ago talking about how one \nevil dictator can change the entire makeup of regional peace and \nstability. James Madison portrays it even larger. He says it does not \nmatter whether it is one person or a few people or even many people. It \ndoes not matter whether it is hereditary or self-appointed or elective. \nWhen you have all of the power located in any one place, tyranny is the \nresult.\n  We learn at an early age in our schools, Mr. Speaker, about \nseparation of powers. We learn about checks and balances. We learn \nabout the legislative branch on Capitol Hill, the Supreme Court right \nbehind us, the executive branch headquartered at 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue, and the natural tension that is created within those branches.\n  John Adams said, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       A question arises whether all the powers of government, \n     legislative, executive, and judicial, shall be left in this \n     body.\n\n  They were struggling at that time trying to create our form of \ngovernment. He says:\n\n       I think a people cannot long be free, nor ever happy, whose \n     government is in one Assembly.\n\n  Constitution Day yesterday, Mr. Speaker, represents the culmination \nof all of the challenges, all of the thoughts, all of the prayers to \nspawn a new nation. But what they grappled with for the entirety of \nthat summer was how to create a system that would prevent a return to \ntyranny.\n\n       The accumulation of all powers in the same hands, whether \n     one, few, or many, whether hereditary, whether self-\n     appointed, whether elective, may justly be pronounced the \n     very definition of tyranny.\n\n  James Madison.\n  I talk about that, Mr. Speaker, here, the day after Constitution Day, \nbecause this is something that I have seen come up over and over again \nin my lifetime in a bipartisan and a bicameral way.\n  So often we find ourselves talking about President Obama, Mr. \nSpeaker, and I will certainly do that later on in this hour, but I want \nto begin by talking about President Bush. The headline I have here \ncoming from The Washington Post, Mr. Speaker, says: ``Bush's Tactic of \nRefusing Laws is Probed.'' The Washington Post says this:\n\n       The President is indicating that he will not either enforce \n     part or the entirety of congressional bills, according to the \n     ABA president, a Massachusetts attorney. ``We will be close \n     to a constitutional crisis,'' the ABA president says, ``when \n     the President of the United States' use of signing statements \n     is left unchecked.''\n\n  This is where you are signing a bill into law. We have all seen the \n``I am just a bill sitting here on Capitol Hill.'' We all know how laws \nare made. Congress deliberates, crafts, passes, sends to the President \nfor his signature. Well, a signing statement is when you sign a bill \ninto law and say: Oh, but by the way, this particular part of the law I \ndon't recognize as being valid. Well, the veto pen gives you an \nopportunity to reject a law if you don't like it. A signing statement \nsays: I like this part, and I am going to enforce it, but I don't like \nthis part, and I am not.\n  Another headline, ``Bush Challenges Hundreds of Laws'':\n\n       President Bush has quietly claimed the authority to disobey \n     more than 750 laws enacted since he took office, asserting \n     that he has the power to set aside any statute passed by \n     Congress when it conflicts with his interpretation of the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, you and I were not in Congress during the Bush \nadministration. You and I did not have an oversight role of the Bush \nadministration, but I would tell you that Republicans and Democrats are \neach complicit in their own way in allowing the people's power, not the \nHouse's power, but the people's power to slowly drift down Pennsylvania \nAvenue, away from the people's representatives on Capitol Hill and into \nthe hands of a Chief Executive.\n  This was going on during the Bush administration. This was a part of \nthe national conversation during the Bush administration, but most \nRepublicans remained silent. This is not a Republican or a Democratic \nissue. This is an American issue. This is a constitutional issue. If we \nare to prevent tyranny, we have to stand and be counted.\n  Mr. Speaker, Barack Obama was in Congress during the Bush \nadministration. While you and I were not, Barack Obama was, and he says \nthis in March of 2008:\n\n       I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest \n     problems that we are facing right now have to do with the \n     President--\n\nthen President Bush--\n\n     trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch \n     and not go through Congress at all. And that is what I intend \n     to reverse when I'm President of the United States.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, that is almost laughable, as we sit here in September of \n2015. The words of then-Senator, now-President Barack Obama:\n\n       I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest \n     problems that we are facing right now have to do with the \n     President trying to bring more and more power into the \n     executive branch and not go through Congress at all, and \n     that's what I intend to reverse when I'm President of the \n     United States.\n\n  May of that same year, Mr. Speaker, then Senator Obama, now President \nObama says this:\n\n       We have got a government designed by the Founders so that \n     there would be checks and balances. You don't want a \n     President who is too powerful or a Congress who is too \n     powerful or a court that is too powerful. Everybody's got \n     their own role. Congress' job is to pass legislation. The \n     President can veto it or he can sign it. I believe in the \n     Constitution, and I will obey the Constitution of the United \n     States. We are not going to use signing statements as a way \n     of doing an end run around Congress.\n\n  When President Obama was Senator Obama, he saw separation of powers \nclearly; he saw the checks and balances clearly. On the campaign trail, \nwhile he was seeking to be the next President of the United States, he \nrecognized the transgressions of the Bush administration, and he said:\n\n       Not on my watch, I will not follow in that path.\n\n\n[[Page H6171]]\n\n\n  That was an election year, 2008. It seems laughable as we sit here in \nSeptember of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I take you to a press conference by President Obama in \nAugust of 2013. The Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, was in all the \nheadlines. The President says this:\n\n       In a normal political environment, it would have been \n     easier for me to simply call up the Speaker, then Speaker \n     Boehner, and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn't \n     go to the essence of the law--it has to do with, for example, \n     are we able to simplify the attestation of employers to \n     whether they're already providing health insurance or not.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, if you don't recall this press conference, the \nPresident, having just begun to implement the Affordable Care Act--\nremember, it was jammed through Congress, completely partisan vote, \nwasn't quite ready for prime time, but they lost the Senate election; \nthey had to move through the unfinished product. As that bill is being \nimplemented, obviously there are problems because it was not a \nconference bill. It was not a bill that had worked its way through the \ncommittee process. The President says: Well, ordinarily, when you are \ntrying to fix these kind of problems, I would have just called up the \nSpeaker. I would have said, Mr. Speaker, the law didn't work out quite \nthe way we wanted it to. We need a few tweaks to make the law work.\n  The President continues. He says: It looks like there may be some \nbetter ways to do this, better ways than the way the law was drafted. \nLet's make a technical change to the law, the President says, what he \nwould have asked for, had he called Speaker Boehner. The President \nsays: That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do, but we \nare not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to ObamaCare. \nWe did have the executive authority to do so--by doing so, he means \nwaiving parts of the Affordable Care Act--and we did so.\n  As candidate Obama, he saw clearly that the Bush administration was \noverstepping its bounds as the executive, failing to either veto a law \nor pass a law, failing to recognize the separation of powers, Mr. \nSpeaker. The President recognized that when he was a United States \nSenator. He recognized that while he was on the campaign trail, but \nwhen he was sworn into the office of President of the United States of \nAmerica, upholder and defender of the United States Constitution, he \nsays:\n\n       What I would have liked to have done was follow the law. \n     What I would have liked to have done was to contact the \n     Speaker and try to change the law, but we are not in normal \n     circumstances around here. So I just did it myself. I had the \n     authority, and I did it myself.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, that was one press conference in August of 2013, but the \nlist goes on. I am not having this conversation today to pick on the \nPresident of the United States, not this President of the United States \nin particular, but something happens when you have all of the power and \nthe responsibility that is vested in the White House--it happened to \nPresident Bush; it has happened to President Obama--where you say: I \nhave all of this responsibility, and I am just going to do it. As long \nas the ends are correct, the means don't matter.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  That is not okay. It is not okay for any of us, Republican or \nDemocrat. You may like the way that goes today. As a Republican, we may \nhave liked it when President Bush was doing it. As a Democrat, you \nmight like it when President Obama is doing it.\n  But it is not the right way to run this country, and it is \ndangerous--dangerous--to the folks who actually hold the power, and \nthat is each individual citizen of the United States.\n  I will use the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Speaker, as one minor \nexample. The individual mandate delay said every American must go out \nand buy health insurance. Well, the plans weren't available.\n  Again, the law wasn't ready for prime time. We all knew it wasn't \ngoing to work. The President knew it wasn't going to work.\n  Congress introduced not one bill, not two bills, not three bills, but \nfour different bills to fix the individual mandate. These were not \nRepublican bills. These were bipartisan bills.\n  But the President, in the press conference that we talked about from \nAugust 2013, decided by himself to act unilaterally to change the law. \nIt wasn't that Congress wouldn't do it. Congress wanted to do it.\n  The President said:\n\n       No. I don't want to work with Congress to do it. I am going \n     to do it on my own.\n\n  He didn't just do it in October of 2013. He waived it again in March \n2014 and again in February 2015, all on the one very specific section \nof the individual mandate.\n  We could have worked together. The Constitution requires that we work \ntogether. The Constitution requires that the law either be followed or \nbe changed.\n  Changes of the law have to come through Congress, have to be signed \nby the President. In the case of Barack Obama, neither happened.\n  The employer mandate delay, Mr. Speaker, again, it is not that the \nHouse didn't want to deal with this issue. As you recall, the employers \nwere not ready for this.\n  Again, this was not a fully baked idea. The White House knew this \nwasn't going to work. The Congress knew this wasn't going to work.\n  And so the House, of which I was a Member at that time, didn't just \ncome up with a bill. We passed a bill. There wasn't just one bill.\n  There were three bills--House bills and Senate bills--to solve this \nproblem that the White House knew existed, that Congress knew existed, \nand that the American people knew existed.\n  But the President didn't work with Congress. He went off and acted \nalone in July of 2013, waiving it once, and in February of 2014, \nwaiving it again. Where is the outcry? Not the outcry over the policy, \nbut the outcry over the process.\n  There are things that happen in this country, Mr. Speaker, that you \nand I may agree with the ends. But if the means are not the correct \nmeans, we have to stand up and say no.\n  Any American who works in manufacturing knows that, if you have a \nflawed process, you are going to produce a flawed product.\n  Process matters. It matters most when we are talking about protecting \nindividual liberty. But Americans have become so frustrated, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Americans have put that label on Washington, D.C., as either being \ninept or ineffective, intransigent, not able to work together, not able \nto move things forward. They have come to a place where they say the \nends justify the means. It is a dangerous place to be.\n  Mr. Speaker, going back to the Affordable Care Act, ``The renewal of \nnoncompliant plans'' is the headline I have here. I am sure you \nremember that from May, Mr. Speaker.\n  These were the plans that the President said are so bad, they are so \ndamaging to American families, we have got to outlaw them. If you have \none of these plans, we are going to outlaw these plans, because they \nare unworthy of Americans.\n  Well, when it actually came time for that part of the law to go into \neffect, it turns out there was a reason these plans existed: because \nfolks couldn't afford more of an insurance policy than that. They \nneeded these plans.\n  So what the President did is he said:\n\n       We know this isn't going to work. We know this part of the \n     law is flawed. We have to fix it.\n\n  Congress said:\n\n       You are absolutely right.\n\n  House bill, Senate bill, bipartisan bills to solve the problem. The \nPresident acted alone, first in November of 2013, then in March of \n2014, waiving the law, saying:\n\n       I advocated for this law. I signed this law. I made this \n     language the law of the land. But now I don't like it. Rather \n     than seeking a solution from Congress--which Congress had--I \n     am going to act alone.\n\n  And, finally, on the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Speaker, the penalty \nwaivers where you were going to be fined. If you didn't do what the law \nsaid you were supposed to do, you were going to be fined by the law. \nThat wasn't going to work.\n  The system was not in place for Americans to follow the law. The \npaperwork trail, as you know, is amazingly burdensome. Folks could not \ncomply with the law.\n  The White House knew it. The Congress knew it. The American people \nknow it. That is why we had not one bill, not two bills, not three \nbills, but four bills, not just in the House, but in\n\n[[Page H6172]]\n\nthe House and Senate, not just Republicans, but bipartisan bills to \nsolve that problem.\n  But the President didn't work with the Congress. The President didn't \ncall the Speaker. The President went and acted alone, first in January \n2015, again in February 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not down here to argue about the results of what \nthe President did. I supported this legislation to achieve all of the \ngoals that the President achieved by acting alone. But the President \ncannot write the law. The Congress must write the law.\n  We, as the American people--not we, as the House of Representatives--\nwe, as the American people, cannot support a President amassing all of \nthat authority to do whatever that President likes alone.\n  Our Framers knew it. John Adams knew it. James Madison knew it. They \nworked throughout the summer of 1787 to prevent it from ever taking \nroot here in America. If we fail to keep watch, it is going to be on \nour watch that those liberties slip away.\n  I will go back to President George Bush. Because it makes me sad, Mr. \nSpeaker, that when we try to have a conversation where we are critical \nof the White House, it sounds like we are just picking on a President \nthat is not of our party. Nonsense.\n  I am not saying that doesn't go on. Of course that goes on. I am just \nsaying that is not where we are today. So I want to take it back to \nPresident Bush one more time.\n  President Bush worked on immigration reform. Goodness knows we need \nimmigration reform. I support immigration reform. We have a system that \nis broken.\n  Folks who need to get here can't get here. Folks who shouldn't be \nhere are able to get here. Anyway, it is a problem and challenge that \nAmerica has been facing not just this year, not last year, but for \ndecades.\n  President Bush said this:\n\n       Legal immigration is one of the top concerns of the \n     American people. And Congress' failure to act on it is a \n     disappointment.\n\n  The American people understand the status quo is unacceptable when it \ncomes to our immigration laws. A lot of us worked hard to see if we \ncouldn't find common ground, but it didn't work.\n  President Bush, wanting to achieve immigration reform, chastised \nCongress for not acting on immigration reform, championing the cause, \nasking for Congress to do more, but understanding what his limitations \nare.\n  President Obama, March 2011:\n\n       With respect to the notion that I can just suspend \n     deportations through an executive order, that is just not the \n     case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has.\n\n  In March of 2011, when asked about deportations and what is going on \nwith immigration law and why won't Congress move forward, the President \nsays:\n\n       The notion that I can just suspend deportations just isn't \n     the case because there are laws that govern deportations.\n\n  President Obama, October 2010:\n\n       I am President. I am not king. I can't do these things just \n     by myself. We have a system of government that requires the \n     Congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, these are the words of President Obama shortly after he \nbecame President. These are the sentiments of President Obama echoing \nthe sentiments of then-Senator Obama when he said there is a way that \nthis government is supposed to run and it takes all three branches to \nmake it happen. Nobody can do it alone.\n  President Obama, May 2010:\n\n       Comprehensive reform. That is how we are going to solve \n     this problem. Anybody who tells you it is going to be easy or \n     that I can just waive a magic wand and make it happen hasn't \n     been paying attention to how this town works.\n\n  He knows that it has to be a collaborative effort in order to change \nthe law.\n  July 2010, President Obama:\n\n       There are those in the immigrants' rights community who \n     have argued passionately that we should simply provide those \n     who are here illegally with legal status or at least ignore \n     the laws on the books and put an end to deportations until we \n     have better laws.\n\n  That is what folks were asking of President Obama:\n\n       Can't you just ignore the laws? If you can't ignore the \n     laws, won't you just put deportations on hold?\n\n  The President responded with this:\n\n       I believe that such an indiscriminate approach would be \n     both unwise and unfair. It would suggest to those thinking \n     about coming here illegally that there will be no \n     repercussions for such a decision, and this could lead to a \n     surge in more illegal immigration.\n\n  Did you see that was a little different conversation than what the \nPresident was talking about a little earlier?\n  Statement after statement, speech after speech, conversation after \nconversation, the President said:\n\n       No, I can't do this because it is against the law. No, I \n     can't do this because the Constitution doesn't give me these \n     powers. No, I can't do this because that is not what a \n     President in the United States of America is allowed to do.\n\n  But then the conversation begins to change. What I just read to you, \nMr. Speaker, was a quote about policy:\n  Well, I just don't think it is a good idea to do it.\n  It is not it is illegal, not it is unconstitutional to do it.\n\n       I just don't think it is a good idea to do it.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, fast-forward to November of last year. The President \ntalked about his unilateral actions to suspend deportations, exactly as \nhe said years earlier he was not allowed to do under the law.\n  He says this:\n\n       The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the \n     kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President, \n     every single Democratic President of the past half-century.\n       And to those Members of Congress who question my authority \n     to make our immigration system work better or question the \n     wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one \n     answer: Pass a bill.\n       I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent \n     legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, \n     the actions I take today will no longer be necessary.\n\n  That is pretty powerful, Mr. Speaker.\n\n       I wanted Congress to do what I wanted Congress to do, but \n     they didn't. It didn't. So I'm going to do it myself. I have \n     said that I couldn't. I said it was illegal to do. But I have \n     rethought it. I now think it is perfectly legal to do, and \n     I'm going to do it. But goods news, Congress, good news, \n     American people. As soon as Congress does do what I want \n     it to do, I'm going to stop doing what I'm not allowed to \n     do.\n\n  Where was the outcry? Not the outcry over the policy, Mr. Speaker. \nThe outcry over the process. We heard the outcry from Democrats when \nPresident Bush was overreaching. We heard the outcry from Republicans \nas President Obama has been overreaching.\n  But where is the outcry from America that says:\n\n       You know what? There might just be some wisdom in what John \n     Adams and James Madison had to say. You know what? There \n     might just be some merit to this whole separation of powers, \n     checks and balances idea. You know what? Perhaps the ends \n     don't justify the means. Let's stick with constitutional \n     authority.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not just a congressional or an executive branch \nissue. I quote Jonathan Turley, law professor, one of the eminent \nconstitutional scholars of our time.\n  He says this:\n\n       Our government requires consent and compromise to function. \n     It goes without saying that, when we are politically divided \n     as a Nation, less tends to get done.\n\n  I don't believe that shocks you, Mr. Speaker. It certainly doesn't \nshock me.\n\n       However, such division is no license to go it alone, as \n     President Obama has suggested. You have only two choices in \n     our system when facing political adversaries. You can either \n     seek to convince them or you can replace them.\n\n  That is pretty powerful. As we talked about Constitution Day \nyesterday, Mr. Speaker, that is pretty powerful.\n  When we disagree in this country, we have two options. We can either \nchange one another's minds or we can replace the people that we put in \nauthority to make those decisions.\n  Jonathan Turley continues:\n\n       This is obviously frustrating for our Presidents and their \n     supporters who want to see real change and to transcend \n     gridlock. However, there is nothing noble in circumventing \n     the Constitution. The claim of any one person that they can \n     get the job done unilaterally is the very siren's call that \n     our Framers warned us to resist.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  The very notion that anyone can get the job done alone, Mr. Speaker, \nis the siren's call that our framers warned us to respect. Jonathan \nTurley continues:\n\n       It is certainly true that the Framers expected much from \n     us, but no more than they demanded from themselves.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this was November of 2014, when the President did his \nlast\n\n[[Page H6173]]\n\nround of unilateral immigration changes. Headline of the Washington \nPost, ``President Obama's Unilateral Action on Immigration Has No \nPrecedent.'' February of this year, headline, ``Federal Judge Blocks \nObama's Executive Actions on Immigration.''\n  These aren't issues for the courts, Mr. Speaker. If Congress passes a \nlaw and the President signs a law and that law is unconstitutional, \nthat is the issue for the courts. The issue of whether or not we want \nPresidents to be able to amass all the power so that they can get the \njob done alone is not an issue for the courts. It is an issue for every \nsingle one of us as citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, I went through the Affordable Care Act. I went through \nimmigration. It is not like the list is short.\n  Climate change, do you remember the climate change bill when \nDemocrats had complete control of the U.S. House and the United States \nSenate and the White House the first 2 years of President Obama's first \nterm? They worked and worked and worked and worked and worked to pass a \nclimate change bill. They couldn't do it. It was rejected in a \nbipartisan way on Capitol Hill.\n  Headline from the Washington Post, last month, August, 2015, ``What \nYou Need to Know About Obama's Biggest Global Warming Move Yet, His \nClean Power Plan.'' This is an editorial from Laurence Tribe, another \nconstitutional law professor recognized by absolutely everyone on both \nsides of the aisle for his knowledge. I would tell you he is not a \nparticularly conservative law professor. I would tell you that he \nstands with my liberal friends more often than he stands with my \nconservative friends.\n  But he is not talking about liberalism. He is not talking about \nconservatism. He is not talking about public policy. He is talking \nabout constitutional law, and he says this:\n\n       As a law professor, I taught the Nation's first \n     environmental law class 45 years ago; and as a lawyer, I have \n     supported countless environmental causes. And as a father and \n     grandfather, I want to leave the Earth in better shape than \n     when I arrived.\n\n  All of his policy goals support the environment, support those \ncauses--want to leave the Earth in better shape than I found it. He \nsays:\n\n       Nonetheless, I recently filed comments with the \n     Environmental Protection Agency urging the Agency to withdraw \n     its Clean Power Plan, a regulatory proposal to reduce carbon \n     emissions from the Nation's electric power plants. In my \n     view, coping with climate change is a vital end.\n\n  Hear that. In his view, solving the problem that the President aims \nto solve is a vital end.\n  Laurence Tribe continues:\n\n       But it does not justify using unconstitutional means.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't admire the men and women in this Chamber who \nrise to their feet to cheer the causes that they support. I admire the \nmen and women in this Chamber who do the right thing, even when it is \nhard to do so.\n  I admire the men and women who stand up to their party leadership \nwhen it is hard to do so. I admire the men and women who put their \nobligation to their constituents above their obligation to party, who \nput their obligation to the Constitution above their passions for the \ndirection of public policy.\n  Taught the first environmental law class 45 years ago. Coping with \nclimate change is a vital end, but it does not justify using \nunconstitutional means.\n  I go on, Laurence Tribe:\n\n       Even more fundamentally, the EPA, like every administrative \n     agency, is constitutionally forbidden to exercise powers \n     Congress never delegated in the first place.\n\n  The brute fact is that the Obama administration failed to get climate \nlegislation through Congress, yet the EPA is acting as though it has \nthe legislative authority to reengineer the Nation's electric \ngenerating system and power grid. It does not.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are going to have this case litigated, and nine men \nand women in black robes across the street are going to decide this \nissue. And we know how they are going to decide this issue.\n  My fear is not that we are not going to get the right decision. We \nare. This isn't our first rodeo here, Mr. Speaker. Remember the recess \nappointments from January 2012, where the President stood, and he was \ngiving a speech in a high school in Ohio. He was giving a speech to \nhigh school students, and he went and he told the tale, Mr. Speaker, of \nhow there was gridlock in Washington, D.C. He told the tale of how he \nwanted to get the people's business done and how Congress was standing \nin the way.\n  Every time he spoke up and talked about how there was gridlock in \nCongress, there were boos in the crowd. Every time he spoke up and \nsaid, ``But don't worry, I'm going to go it alone,'' there was applause \nthroughout the crowd.\n  Our students who are studying constitutional principles today, our \nstudents who are being trained to be that next generation of leader, \nthat citizen who sits on the board of directors of the United States of \nAmerica, 330 million of us, stood and applauded when the President said \nCongress won't do it, so I will do it without them.\n  He was applauded by Democrats, Mr. Speaker. He was criticized by \nRepublicans. He went right ahead and did what he said he would do. He \nbrought out a legal memorandum that still sits on the Justice \nDepartment Web site outlining why it was absolutely permissible to do \nwhat he was doing, even though the Constitution clearly said it was \nnot.\n  That case made its way through the Supreme Court, Mr. Speaker. It was \nthe NLRB v. Noel Canning case, and it was decided 9-0.\n\n  If you were a Supreme Court Justice appointed by President Reagan, \nyou told President Obama that he was violating the law. If you were a \nSupreme Court Justice appointed by President Clinton, you told \nPresident Obama he was violating the law. It does not matter whether \nyou were a Clinton, Reagan, Bush, or even Obama appointee, nominee to \nthe Supreme Court. Every single one of them agreed that the President \noverstepped his bounds.\n  My question, Mr. Speaker, is: You remember that spring of 2012, but \nhow many American citizens do, those cheering high school students in \nOhio, that campaign stop at a high school auditorium to say, I'm going \nto go it alone. Do they remember when nine Supreme Court Justices said: \nNo, you won't; no, you won't.\n  Where does it stop, Mr. Speaker?\n  Congress says: No, you won't. Congress says: This is our \nresponsibility. The President says: You are not getting it done my way; \nI'm going to go it alone. So it goes to the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt says, unanimously: No, Mr. President, you are not going to go it \nalone.\n  It is only one short step between the executive branch ignoring the \ncoequal branch of the government that is the legislature and the \nexecutive branch ignoring the coequal branch of government that is the \nFederal courts.\n  That burden lies on us, Mr. Speaker. It is not a Republican burden or \na Democratic burden. It is an American burden.\n  I signed up to be on the Oversight Committee, Mr. Speaker. You know \nthe Oversight Committee here on Capitol Hill. It has jurisdiction over \nabsolutely everything, and its job is to make sure the executive branch \nis doing what the executive branch is supposed to do.\n  I signed up to be on the Oversight Committee because I thought Mitt \nRomney was going to win the last election, and I wanted to be the guy \nwho said to the next Republican President: No, Mr. President, you can't \ndo that. We are Article I of the Constitution; you are Article II of \nthe Constitution. There is a process here, and process matters.\n  Well, Mitt Romney didn't win that election, so we are doing oversight \nover the Obama administration; and every single legitimate issue the \nOversight Committee took up, headlines in the papers about just \npolitical hacks going after their political opposition. It is not true, \nand it is too important to dismiss in that way.\n  James Madison, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and \n     judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one or few or many, \n     and whether hereditary, self-appointed or elective, may \n     justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  This President has just over a year left in the White House, Mr. \nSpeaker. I am not here to talk about President Obama. I am here to talk \nabout our responsibility as 435 Members of the\n\n[[Page H6174]]\n\nHouse. I am here to talk about America's responsibility as 330 million \nindividual members of America's board of directors.\n  Does process matter or do the ends justify the means? Hold \nRepublicans accountable for not standing up to President Bush. Hold \nDemocrats accountable for not standing up to President Obama. Hold your \nfriends and your neighbors and your coworkers accountable if you hear \nthem say the ends justify the means.\n  We can only imagine how dangerous these times were. We can only \nimagine the summer of 1787 as the entire future of the Republic hung in \nthe balance. We can only imagine 1776 when we were declaring our \nfreedom from the world's largest superpower. We can only imagine what \nit meant to sign our name on a document pledging our lives, our \nfortunes, and our families' lives to the cause.\n  And as they grappled with those decisions in 1776, in 1787, they knew \none thing with certainty: having all of the power accumulate anywhere, \nwith anyone, was a threat to individual liberties and freedoms.\n  The President disagrees with me on a lot of public policy, and I \nwelcome him to come down here to Congress and advocate for it; and if \nyou get the votes in this body and you get the votes across the way and \nyou beat me on public policy, fair and square. That is the way it is \nsupposed to be. But when any one of us decides that our priorities, our \npolicy preferences, are so important that the Constitution takes a \nbackseat, we are not long for this form of government, this greatest \nexperiment the world has ever known in self-governance.\n  It is easy to talk about health care, Mr. Speaker. It is easy to talk \nabout environmental policy. It is easy to talk about water policy. The \nlist goes on and on and on. What is hard is changing that policy, and \nit is deliberately so. It is deliberately so.\n  As the Courts have taken these challenges on, Mr. Speaker, 9-0, \nreining in the President from his overreach. And in that 9-0 case, Noel \nCanning, just 2 years ago, the Supreme Court said this:\n\n       The recess appointments clause--that was what they were \n     arguing about at the time--is not designed to overcome \n     serious institutional friction. It simply provides a \n     subsidiary method for appointing officials when the Senate is \n     away during a recess.\n\n  Here, as in other contexts, global warming, health care, water \npolicy, on and on and on, here, as in other contexts, friction between \nthe branches is an inevitable consequence of our constitutional \nstructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I challenge you to go home to your constituents, as \ntownhall meeting after townhall meeting after townhall meeting talks \nabout the gridlock in Washington, D.C. Friction between the branches is \nan inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure. We must \ncelebrate that friction, Mr. Speaker.\n  We have two ways to change policy in this country: You can either \nchange your neighbor's mind, or you can replace your delegate to \noffice. Changing minds and changing people are the only two methods we \nhave in this country. It is the consequence of our constitutional \nstructure.\n  I do not fear gridlock. I am not concerned that we cannot find a \npathway forward. I do fear one man, one group, one party having all of \nthe control.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  I do fear folks short-circuiting a process that our Founders put in \nplace to keep us safe for generations to come.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me, as Constitution Day has just \npassed, in celebrating the wisdom in that summer of 1787 and committing \nourselves--Republicans and Democrats alike, House Members and Senate \nMembers alike--to ensuring that policy does not trump process, to \nensure that we get to where all of America wants us to be, but that we \nget there the right way, not just because it matters, but because that \nis what the Constitution and the law requires.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6174-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6174-H6175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SURVIVORS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ratcliffe). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Franks) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I have a special guest with me \ntonight, my son Joshua, who was allowed the privileges of the floor. He \nhas given me a speech tonight, and I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States of America is an exceptional Nation \nwhose unique core premise is that declared conviction that we are all \ncreated equal and that each of us is endowed by our Creator with the \nunalienable right to live.\n  Abraham Lincoln called upon all of us in this Chamber and beyond to \nremember those words of the Founding Fathers and ``their enlightened \nbelief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent \ninto the world to be trodden on or degraded and imbruted by its \nfellows.''\n  He reminded those he called posterity that ``when in the distant \nfuture some man, some factions, some interests should set up a doctrine \nthat some were not entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness that `their posterity' ''--that is us, Mr. Speaker--``that \ntheir posterity might look up again to the Declaration of Independence \nand take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the sincerest purpose of the Born-Alive Abortion \nSurvivors Protection Act that we voted on today is to renew that noble \nbattle, to respect and protect those little fellow human beings among \nus who are at this moment being trodden on and degraded and imbruted by \ntheir fellows.\n  Not long ago, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, \nauthorities entered the clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell and found a \ntorture chamber for little born-alive babies that defies description \nwithin the constraints of the English language.\n  The grand jury report at the time said, ``Dr. Kermit Gosnell had a \nsimple solution for unwanted babies: he killed them. He didn't call it \nthat. He called it `ensuring fetal demise.' The way he ensured fetal \ndemise was by sticking scissors in the back of the baby's neck and \ncutting the spinal cord. He called it `snipping.' Over the years, there \nwere hundreds of 'snippings.' ''\n  Ashley Baldwin, one of Dr. Gosnell's employees, said she saw babies \nbreathing and that she described one as 2 feet long that no longer had \neyes or a mouth, but, in her words, was making like this ``screeching'' \nnoise and that it ``sounded like a little alien.''\n  Now, in recent days, Mr. Speaker, numerous video recordings have been \nreleased that demonstrate to the world that Kermit Gosnell is just the \ntip of the iceberg of the abortion industry's unspeakable cruelty to \nthese little babies.\n  The veil has now been pulled back, Mr. Speaker, and all of us now see \nbehind the walls of the abortion industry and the horrifying plight of \nits little human victims who, we must not forget, are also the least of \nthese, our little brothers and sisters.\n  Our response, as a people and a nation, to these horrors shown in \nthese videos is vital to everything those lying out in Arlington \nNational Cemetery died to save.\n  Before any Senator, Mr. Speaker, decides to join a Democrat \nfilibuster in the Senate against legislation that would protect little \nborn-alive human babies, I hope they ask of themselves one question in \nthe core of their own souls: Is filibustering against a bill to protect \nborn-alive human babies from a torturous death at the hands of monsters \nlike Kermit Gosnell who I truly am?\n  Now, I know that legislation like this has been attacked by President \nObama and even others because of the many obvious similarities these \nborn-alive children have with late-term, pain-capable, unborn children.\n  Mr. Speaker, this was an unborn child, but she was born alive and she \nsurvived. As hard as it is to consider that that could happen, she did.\n  President Obama explained his reasons for voting four times--Mr. \nSpeaker, let me say that again. President Obama explained his reasons \nfor voting four times against the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, \nwhich would have protected children born alive.\n  He was afraid it might give born-alive babies personhood under the \nEqual Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\n[[Page H6175]]\n\n  He said:\n\n       It would essentially bar abortions because the Equal \n     Protection Clause does not allow somebody to kill a child. \n     And if this is a child, then this would be an antiabortion \n     statute.\n\n  It is impossible to deny that President Obama had a very sad and \nironic, if also completely merciless, point.\n  Indeed, it does require enormous deliberate self-deception to say \nthat those who deliberately kill a child who is born alive after 5 \nmonths of pregnancy are guilty of murder and deserve prison, but those \nwho deliberately kill the same exact pain-capable child at the same \nexact age and development, but are not yet born--those individuals are \nmerely furthering freedom of choice and should actually get paid for \ndoing it.\n\n  But it still bears repeating, Mr. Speaker. The Born-Alive Abortion \nSurvivors Protection Act that we voted on today and passed out of this \nChamber protects little children who have been born alive.\n  No matter how blind opponents try to make themselves or convince \nothers to be, no one can truly obscure the humanity and personhood of \nthese little born-alive children of God, nor can they take refuge \nwithin the schizophrenic paradox Roe v. Wade to which this country has \nbeen subjected for now more than 40 years.\n  The abortion industry has labored for all these decades to convince \nthe world that born children and unborn children should be completely \nseparated in our minds, that while born children are persons worthy of \nprotection, unborn children, on the other hand, are not persons and are \nnot worthy of protection.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, those who oppose this bill today or those who might \noppose it in the Senate that protects born-alive children now have the \nimpossible task of trying to rejoin born children and unborn children \nback together again and then trying to convince us all that to condemn \nthem both as inhuman and not worthy of protection after all is the \nthing to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, to anyone who has not invincibly hardened their heart \nand soul to this absurd inconsistency, there is an opportunity for a \nprofoundly enlightening moment because, you see, Mr. Speaker, this \ncountry has faced such paradox and self-imposed blindness and \nheartlessness before.\n  There was a time that our own House rules banned any discussion or \ndebate in this Chamber about the effort to end human slavery in \nAmerica. But, Mr. Speaker, that debate did come.\n  And with it came a time when the humanity of the victims and the \ninhumanity of what was being done to them became so glaring that even \nthe hardest of hearts began to see the truth, and it moved an entire \ngeneration of people to find the compassion and the courage within \ntheir own souls to change their position. And now to this generation, \nMr. Speaker, that time has come again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/18/house-section/article/H6175-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2015, TO TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, \n 2015; AND ADJOURNMENT FROM TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2015, TO THURSDAY, \n                           SEPTEMBER 24, 2015\n\n  Mr. WOODALL.
