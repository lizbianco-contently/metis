He had a passion and a deep admiration for America's heroes \nand valued Team Red, White, and Blue's great work in enriching the \nlives of veterans in need.\n  I had the great privilege of knowing Ted personally and was inspired \nby his kindness, his humor, and his love for his family and country. \nTed will always be remembered as an honorable young man who touched \nmany lives, having a lasting positive impact on all who knew and loved \nhim.\n  May his name forever be remembered in the Congressional Record and in \nthe great United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/house-section/article/H569-8", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H569-H570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN HEROES COLA ACT\n\n  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. RUIZ.

The Veterans' Survivors \nClaims Processing Automation Act will allow veterans' surviving \nfamilies to mourn their loss and grieve without unnecessary \nbureaucratic steps in the benefit claims process.\n  The Veterans Access to Speedy Review Act will allow veterans to \nvoluntarily use video conferencing technology to accelerate the appeals \nprocess. Veterans and their families deserve to have their claims \nreviewed and to receive the benefits that they have earned and deserve \nin a timely and efficient manner.\n  I came to Washington to fight for pragmatic solutions to meet our \nNation's most pressing needs.

Sadly, Mr. Alston left us far too soon, at the age \nof 44.\n  Vernon Alston came from a military family and, from a young age, was \ndrawn to the service of our country. In 1991, he joined the U.S. Army \nReserve, and, in 1996, he began working as a Capitol Police Officer. He \nspent the rest of his life protecting the Capitol and those who work \nhere.

Phil dedicated \nhis life to three things: to God, to his family, and to his community.\n  He and his wife, Susan, had two children together and four \ngrandchildren. It was not uncommon for Phil to run straight to a city \nevent from his grandsons' ball games. He always made time for both his \nfamily and the city of San Angelo.\n  A graduate of Angelo State University, he led the San Angelo Chamber \nof Commerce for the last 10 years. He was the bridge between the \nGoodfellow Air Force Base and the San Angelo community, helping to \ncreate a strong and lasting bond. He loved our military and was always \nwilling to support our military in any way that he could.\n  As a deacon in the Baptist church, Phil led the church's college \nprogram and many mission trips to Mexico. He was a selfless servant, a \ntrait that extended beyond the city's, State's, and country's borders.\n  We lost Phil far too soon, just days after his 64th birthday.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) and the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am proud to offer H.R. 766, Mr. Chairman. It is a bipartisan piece \nof legislation that provides transparency and accountability among \nFederal banking regulators and the Department of Justice.\n  This legislation comes in response to the abuse of authority by DOJ, \nFDIC, and other banking agencies under the action called Operation \nChoke Point, an initiative which seeks to deny legally operating \nbusinesses the financial services they need to operate and survive.\n  The notion that Operation Choke Point is limited to payday lenders or \nthe banks serving them is far from the truth. This initiative has \nspread across many industries, including tobacco shops, gun \nmanufacturers and dealers, pawnbrokers, even a coal mine and an auto \ndealer. Even attorneys and data companies that serve these industries \nhave been impacted.\n  While regulators will tell you this activity has stopped, Operation \nChoke Point remains a very live issue. For more than a year, I have \nasked Americans impacted by this initiative to submit their story at \nour email address of chokepointstory@mail.house.gov.\n  Just this week I heard from a payday lender in Missouri who recently \nreceived account termination notices from his financial institution. \nGregory Bone, whose businesses have served borrowers in Branson, \nPineville, and Neosho, has operated since 1998 and is registered with \nboth the State of Missouri and the U.S. Treasury Department. On January \n21st, there is a similar story from a credit bureau in California and, \nbefore that, a tobacco shop in Florida.\n  The underlying problem here cannot be overstated. The Federal \nGovernment should not be able to intimidate financial institutions into \ndropping entire sectors of the economy as customers based not on \nwrongdoing, but purely on personal and political motivations and \nwithout due process.\n  We have the internal DOJ and the FDIC memos that prove these motives \nthat are driving Operation Choke Point. The Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform did a fantastic job of putting together two reports \nthat take the different agencies' own emails and show what is actually \ngoing on and the motivation for those actions.\n  This program sets a dangerous precedent that shouldn't be permitted \nunder any administration. William Isaac, the former chairman of the \nFDIC, appointed to the board by President Carter and named chairman by \nPresident Reagan, stated in committee that Operation Choke Point is the \nmost dangerous government program he has seen in his 45-year career as \na banker, a bank consultant, and as a regulator.\n  H.R. 766 offers a straightforward approach to a complicated problem. \nFirst, it dictates that banking regulators cannot suggest, request, or \norder an institution to terminate a banking relationship unless the \nregulator has a material reason beyond reputational risk.\n  The bill also strikes the word ``affecting'' in FIRREA and replaces \nit with ``by'' or ``against.'' This modest change will help ensure that \nbroad interpretations of the law are limited and that the intent of the \nstatute, penalizing fraud against or by financial institutions, is \nrestored.\n  It is essential that DOJ and financial regulators maintain the \nability to pursue bad actors, and I fully support these efforts. This \nis something they must continue to do. But the checks and balances in \nthis legislation would ensure accountability and would not hinder the \nability to pursue those suspected of fraudulent activity.\n  The provisions contained in H.R. 766 are reasonable. In fact, the \nFDIC used its authority to already put them in place. Agency policy now \nrequires staff to track and document account termination orders, which \nmust be made in writing and cannot rely on reputational risk. The \nwillingness of the FDIC to put these standards into place tells other \nregulators that they can and should follow suit.\n  I am proud the House is working in a bipartisan fashion to address \nthis issue, including the passage of limitation amendments by voice \nvotes in the 113th and 114th Congresses.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike have talked to regulators about the \ndangers of such a program. Many of my friends on the other side of the \naisle have expressed their concerns to me privately as well. This \nbipartisan legislation takes a responsible approach to curbing the \nmalpractice we have seen.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Hensarling for his \noutstanding support as we have gone through this 2\\1/2\\ year process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 766.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, if you listen carefully to my colleague on \nthe opposite side of the aisle, Mr. Luetkemeyer, you would think that \nthe major point of this bill is the Choke Point controversy.\n  Considerable time was spent by my colleague on the opposite side of \nthe aisle talking about Choke Point. Well, I do not want that \ndiscussion to obscure the real problem with this very bad legislation.\n  H.R. 766 eliminates core provisions of the Financial Institutions \nReform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, or FIRREA, that the Justice \nDepartment has used to investigate and prosecute bank fraud. This is \nwhat this discussion should be about: bank fraud.\n  FIRREA has proven to be the Justice Department's most effective tool \nfor holding Wall Street accountable. We hear a lot of talk about Wall \nStreet. We went through 2008 and the subprime meltdown, the bailout, \nand all of that.\n  Most of the Members on both sides of the aisle agree that we had to \nrein in the practices of Wall Street. Here we have a bill today that \nwould basically protect them and take away the very tool that is used \nin order to make them accountable.\n  After using FIRREA to secure historic settlements against Wall \nStreet, including a $7 billion settlement against Citibank, a $5 \nbillion settlement against Goldman Sachs, a $13 billion settlement \nagainst JPMorgan Chase, and a historic $16 billion settlement against \nBank of America, now H.R. 766 seeks to stifle the Justice Department's \ninvestigative powers over financial fraud. In fact, there are still \nongoing settlement negotiations with\n\n[[Page H572]]\n\nbanks like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs that were announced just this \nweek.\n  Without investigatory powers and an extended statute of limitations \ngranted to the Justice Department by FIRREA, it would be impossible for \nus to identify and rectify the fraudulent activity that set us up for a \ncrisis 10 years ago.\n  Apparently, H.R. 766 supporters believe that actually holding banks \naccountable for fraud was too much of a burden for them, replacing our \nsystem of too big to jail with one where our biggest banks are now too \nfrail to fine.\n  H.R. 766 also invites the next crisis by imposing burdensome \nrequirements--listen to this--imposing burdensome requirements on the \nJustice Department's ability to investigate bank fraud, allowing fraud \nschemes to continue at the expense of consumers and the financial \nsystem.\n  The Justice Department's ability to identify and rout out fraud would \nbe critical in averting future crises, and H.R. 766 would be a free \npass to banks that make their money by breaking the law.\n  That would include banks like Plaza, Commerce West, and Four Oaks, \nall of which knowingly aided fraudsters, despite the many red flags \nraised by their financial activities.\n  At Commerce West in particular, the bank admitted fraud for failing \nto file suspicious activity reports with regulators even after the \nbank's own employees determined that one of their customers was \nroutinely submitting fraudulent checks to the bank.\n  According to the Justice Department's complaint, the bank also failed \nto heed the warning of other banks that pointed out to Commerce West \nthat some of their customers were fraudulent businesses.\n  Furthermore, H.R. 766's account closure provisions are a solution in \nsearch of a problem as regulators are now forcing financial \ninstitutions to close customer accounts.\n  Every Federal banking regulator has been clear, except for rare cases \ninvolving national security or systemic risks. The responsibility for \nclosing accounts is a decision for financial institutions.\n  Some financial institutions are simply deciding that they would \nrather lose a customer than invest in the resources needed to ensure \nthat our financial system is not being used for money laundering or \nother criminal activity.\n  In order to protect our economy from the next financial crisis, \nregulators have to have the necessary tools to prevent fraud and \nprotect consumers.\n  Americans are still reeling from the effects of the financial crisis. \nWe should be in the business of seeking ways to continue to hold banks \nmore accountable for their misconduct, not rolling back the Federal \nGovernment's most effective tool for protecting consumers, investors, \nand taxpayers from bank fraud. Banks that break the law don't deserve \nget-out-of-jail-free cards.\n  The administration will veto H.R. 766. I urge my Democratic \ncolleagues to oppose H.R. 766.\n  I just want to say that, despite yesterday when we had five bills \nthat had been rolled into one that I warned our Members of Congress \nabout because of what they literally did, particularly in terms of \nallowing corporations to not have to disclose information about the \nstock that they were giving to their employees, and I talked about how \nbad that was.\n  This is worse. This is worse because we are able to call names and to \npoint out banks because we have the information. It is real.\n  We are able to point out how the Justice Department has been affected \nin making these banks accountable. So why in the world would we want to \ntake away the Justice Department's tool that is FIRREA? Why would we \nwant to prevent the Justice Department from going after these banks who \nknow they are dealing with crooks and fraudsters?\n  I would ask for a ``no'' vote on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), the cosponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Missouri. We have \nbeen working on this now 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years.\n  The bill is fairly simple, Mr. Chairman, in what it actually does. It \njust takes a second to read the operative line that an appropriate \nbanking Federal agency may not formally or informally request or order \na depository institution to terminate a specific customer account \nwithout a really good reason.\n  I want people to think about that, Mr. Chairman. The fact that we \nhave to actually debate this frightens me. The fact that we have to \nbring a bill to the floor of the United States House that says the \nFederal Government regulators cannot force a bank to close an account \nwithout a good reason should frighten people.\n  I heard Mr. Luetkemeyer talk about many of the companies that have \nbeen impacted: gun manufacturers, pawnshops. It has now spread, Mr. \nChairman, to individuals.\n  We are hearing reports that individuals engaged in legal businesses--\nevery single one of the victims are engaged in legal activity.\n  We are hearing now that individuals who happen to engage in legal \npoker playing in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is a completely legal \nendeavor--you may not like it--are having their bank accounts shut off \nby the Federal Government.\n  My dad told me when I got to this job: The difference between the \ngovernment when I was your age and the government that you are going \ninto is that I was never afraid of my government. Your children will \ngrow up afraid of their government because of things exactly like this.\n  We are debating a bill on the floor of the House that says the \ngovernment can't force banks to shut down legal business banking \naccounts. It is outrageous, but it is real, and it has happened for a \nlong time.\n  It has happened, by the way, Mr. Chairman, because this \nadministration has not been able to accomplish their agenda through \nlegislative process. So they are doing it now through regulation.\n  There is a report that our committee put out. It is an excellent \nreport. I commend it to everybody. There are emails from within the \nregulators. I will read one.\n  It says:\n\n       I have never said this to you, but I am sincerely \n     passionate about this. I literally cannot stand payday \n     lending. They are abusive, fundamentally wrong, hurt people, \n     and do not deserve to be in any way associated with banking.\n\n  It is a completely legal business, Mr. Chairman.\n  I hope that we have bipartisan support for this. We have had \ncosponsors on both sides. I encourage wholehearted support of this so \nwe can get the Federal Government out of making decisions like this.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, I would \nsimply like to point out that Mr. Mulvaney just continued in the vein \nthat Mr. Luetkemeyer started out in, obscuring the real point of this \nbill.\n  They are going to keep telling you it is all about Choke Point. What \nthey are not going to talk about is taking away the Justice \nDepartment's ability to use FIRREA to go after these banks that are \ncommitting crimes.\n  I don't want the Members to be misled. Ask them why they are refusing \nto talk about the main point of this bill.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the ranking member and the \nchair of the committee. I would also like to say that this is a \nsituation where there are--and I have even seen myself--some closures \nof accounts, which I think were not adequately justified, but this bill \ndoesn't just solve that problem. It solves a whole lot of problems that \nare not problems.\n  So they take what could be a legitimate issue, and then they use that \nlittle hole in the tent to push in a whole bunch of other stuff that \nwill literally weaken the whole system.\n  My good friend from South Carolina, if that was all the bill said, it \nwouldn't be that bad of a problem, but that is not only what it says. \nIn fact, it weakens financial protections and lets bad actors in the \nsystem off the hook. If we are concerned about small accounts being \nclosed, we should focus on that issue, but this particular bill goes \nway beyond that.\n  As Members contemplate how they want to vote on this bill, they had \nbetter think about and read this bill carefully because it goes far \nbeyond just\n\n[[Page H573]]\n\nsimply calling for a justification for arbitrarily closing accounts. \nThat is why I oppose the bill.\n  I oppose the bill, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, \nH.R. 766. This bill would do the opposite of what is asserted in the \ntitle. H.R. 766 would not protect customers of financial institutions \nactually. Instead, it would make it more difficult to hold financial \ninstitutions accountable, and it will achieve that goal in a bait-and-\nswitch way by acknowledging what may be, in some cases, a legitimate \nissue of arbitrary account closures, but then coming in, sneaking in \nthe back door, all this other stuff, to weaken the financial system.\n  Many Americans, including those who saw the movie ``The Big Short,'' \ncannot understand how so few people went to jail for the schemes that \ncaused the financial crisis. People made loans they knew would fail, \nsold those bad loans to investors, and caused the financial crisis that \ncost our economy $14 trillion.\n  Twelve million people lost their jobs, and 11 million people lost \ntheir homes. Who went to jail for all this mortgage fraud? Well, I \nthink there is only one person I have been able to find. I would be \nhappy to find anyone else. Teresa Giudice from ``The Real Housewives of \nNew Jersey,'' football player Irving Fryar, and straw buyers in \nMichigan, those are the only people I could find who went to jail for \nthis. Other people who committed massive fraud, they paid fines, but \nthey walked away.\n  I am incredibly frustrated by the fact that the Department of Justice \nhas not pursued more criminal prosecutions of people at the \nmultinational corporations who caused the financial crisis. But the \nanswer to that problem is stronger enforcement, not to take away the \nmost important tool Federal prosecutors have to pursue financial fraud.\n  There is this thing called FIRREA. I know people watching C-SPAN are \nlike, what is that? These Congress people always speak in acronyms. It \nis the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act. \nFIRREA was specifically designed to hold bankers accountable for \ndestabilizing the financial system with their fraudulent activity. This \nbill weakens that.\n  In an Orwellian twist, it says that FIRREA cases cannot be brought \nwhen fraud is committed against a bank instead of by a bank. I will say \nit again. If this bill passes today, FIRREA cases can only be brought \nwhen fraud is committed against a bank and not by a bank. That is bad.\n  It also limits law enforcement's subpoena power. Don't we want to be \nable to subpoena these guys? Why would we want to be able to weaken \nthat?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Newhouse). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 \nminute to the gentleman.\n  Mr. ELLISON. It eliminates the bankers' regulators' ability to ensure \nsafety and soundness of the financial system. We need to enforce the \nlaw, not wink at it.\n  Members, they are dangling a shiny, little object in front of you by \nsaying they are going to stop arbitrary account closures. This bill is \nway more than that. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for his \nwork on this very important bill.\n  The Constitution is clear: the right of the people to keep and bear \narms shall not be infringed, yet time and time again, this \nadministration has attempted to circumvent the constitutional rights of \nAmericans to further their political agenda.\n  Today, under the guise of protecting consumers, the Department of \nJustice and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are targeting \npayment companies to choke off credit for certain businesses they deem \nhigh risk, including ammunition and firearms stores, lending \ninstitutions, and other lawful businesses as well.\n  Instead of protecting consumers, this initiative is restricting \nconsumer choice and crippling legitimate businesses. This policy makes \nfinancial service providers responsible for policing their customers. \nThat is not fair to either banks or their consumers.\n  This commonsense legislation we are considering today will protect \nconsumer access to banking services and restrict the administration \nfrom using the highly substantive notion of reputational risk to \nundercut constitutional rights and terminate the accounts of lawful \nbusinesses. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), a valued member of the Committee \non Financial Services.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, as a fellow Washingtonian, might I \njust observe that you make that dais look good.\n  I actually counterintuitively want to start out by thanking my \nfriend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), for taking this \nissue on.\n  We had a problem in a lot of communities around the country with \nbusinesses getting access to the banking system, and I know he worked \nthis very hard last year. He investigated; he talked to banks, \nbusinesses, and regulators; and he actually negotiated a solution with \nthe FDIC that he had pushed and pushed until they actually adopted it.\n  It was a good solution. In fact, part of this bill would essentially \ncodify that. What it would say is, you can't use FIRREA to go after \nwhole sectors of the economy. It has to be specifically and \nindividually based. You have to have a reason to believe that an \nindividual business was engaged in fraud if you were going to use the \nbanking system to get at them. Good solution, constructive solution. My \nhat is off to you, sir.\n  Unfortunately, this bill, as has been suggested earlier, goes \nfarther. Section 3 makes it a lot harder for the Department of Justice \nto investigate financial solutions because, as has been suggested, it \ntakes direct and specific aim at the powers under FIRREA, as the \ngentleman from Minnesota had indicated. It puts limits on them as to \nwhen subpoenas can be issued. To me, frankly, that is a solution in \nsearch of a problem.\n  FIRREA has been the key statute in going after fraud that, in fact, \nhelped lead to the Great Recession and the crisis, and the wiping out \nof $13 trillion in net worth. Frankly, I am one of those people who \nbelieves we need more prosecutions, not fewer, for all the damage and \nharm done to Americans throughout this land.\n  I am very reluctant to embrace any language that substantially \nweakens or obstructs FIRREA's ability to investigate fraud. I do agree \nwith my friend that investigations and our oversight of them could be \nimproved by requiring a paper trail. I worked with him to see if we \ncould find a compromise that did that, but we couldn't. So ultimately, \nwe had to disagree, and this is a disagreement that I will characterize \nas being a very strong one.\n  The truth of the matter is, in the last two calendar years alone, \nFIRREA was the operative statute which led to $40 billion in fines and \nrecoveries being levied. Truth be told, it is very, very unlikely, if \nnot highly unlikely, that any of those $40 billion in fines or \nrestitution could have been recovered if the language of this \nlegislation had been in effect; $20 billion of which was restitution to \nharmed parties, people who lost their homes inappropriately because \nthey had had fraud perpetuated upon them.\n  I don't think that is what the American public wants right now. I \nthink the American public is still eager for some accountability for \nthe actions and behavior that led to the Great Recession.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield an additional 1 minute to \nthe gentleman.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. So I join in the chorus of my colleagues who \nsuggest that this bill is actually not just a step backward but two \ngiant steps backward. There is an issue here that could be worked on. \nThis is not the right solution; and, I might add, it is not going to \nbecome law because it has already been indicated by the executive \nbranch this probably isn't going anywhere.\n  I would entreat you--in the spirit of trying to find a solution to a \nreal problem--please, let us set aside, vote ``no,'' and not enact that \nwhich is a solution in search of a problem that doesn't exist and, in \nfact, does considerable\n\n[[Page H574]]\n\nharm to the American public and to our ability to hold people \naccountable.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, it is certainly rewarding and \nheartwarming to see that the ladies and gentlemen on the other side of \nthe aisle continue to support our bill from the standpoint they \nrecognize that where there is a problem, Operation Choke Point exists, \nthat our bill is the solution. The only thing they seem to have \nproblems with is the part that we try and do something with the DOJ \nwith regards to FIRREA.\n  To settle that and enlarge on that discussion, I am proud to yield 3 \nminutes to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), our \nOversight and Investigation Subcommittee chairman who will provide some \ninformation with regard to that very thing.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the chairman yielding. I am \ngrateful for Chairman Luetkemeyer's work on this important issue.\n  Our financial systems are the bedrock of our economy. When financial \nsystems work, our economy works. And we have seen when our financial \nsystem doesn't work, things come crashing down. To make sure our \nfinancial system is safe and sound, we have empowered regulators to \nkeep an eye over it, to make sure we don't do things that are too risky \nthat can endanger the financial system and then, therefore, the \neconomy.\n  One of the problems, though, is that those regulators have stepped \noutside that traditional role and have tried to impact policy decisions \nthat should be made in this institution by rules and regulations that \ncome out from their oversight capacity.\n  I look at the liberals, or it might be the progressives, inside the \nFDIC who, in line with the administration, said: I don't like gun \ndealers, I don't like ammunition manufacturers. Who cares about the \nSecond Amendment? I don't like them.\n  Now, if you don't like guns and you don't like ammunition and you \ndon't like short-term lenders, if you want to get rid of those things, \nhave a debate about it. Have an argument. Introduce a bill, and let's \nvote on it. Let the American people see it. But the administration \nknows they will lose because most Americans like their guns, they like \ntheir Second Amendment.\n  So instead of going through this institution, they very craftily \nthought: Wow, just think, if we were able to, as regulators, put \npressure on banks so banks would stop banking legal businesses that we \ndon't like--guess what happens if they can't bank? They will go out of \nbusiness, and we will have less guns, less ammunition, and we will have \nless short-term lending. That is exactly what they have done.\n  But we didn't empower the FDIC to make policy decisions. We said, \nhey, keep the banking system safe and sound. But like so many corners \nof this administration, they have expanded that authority to advance \ntheir liberal, progressive agenda.\n  I know my friends across the aisle, who I like very much and are \nfriends of mine, are trying to focus on big banks and Wall Street. But, \nMr. Chairman, to the ranking member I would say: Listen, big banks \naren't being affected by Choke Point. It is the smallest, little \nbusinesses in our communities that don't have the power to stand up and \nfight back and push back. They are the ones that are affected.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Big banks on Wall Street don't get hit by this. It is the little guy. \nThis is a bill that Mr. Luetkemeyer crafted that stands up for the \nlittle guy--the little one that doesn't have the lobbyist and the money \nto come to town to talk to Members of Congress--who is being affected \nby this liberal progressive agenda today that they know can't be get \npassed by law, so they do it by regulation.\n  This is one more horrible example of how your government isn't \nworking and how this institution isn't representing the people that we \nwere sent here to represent.\n  This is a great bill. Let's pass it. Let's join together and let's \nstop Operation Choke Point.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Again, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle will talk about \nguns. They will talk about Choke Point. They will talk about unfairness \nto businesses based on a bank's ability to close accounts. They will \ntalk about everything except the real point of this legislation.\n  I don't know why, I don't know where it came from, and I don't know \nwho can convince a serious public policymaker that somehow you are to \ntake away the investigative power of the Justice Department, a Justice \nDepartment that has proven that it could use FIRREA--that is the \nFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act--to \ninvestigate banks that are guilty of fraud. I don't know where this \nwould come from. Given what we have gone through in this country, \nstarting in 2008, I don't know why any serious public policymaker would \nwant to do that.\n  What have we witnessed in this country, based on the predatory \npractices of banks? We have seen whole communities devastated. We have \nseen foreclosures and people lose their homes. We have seen homes \nunderwater. We have increased homelessness. We have seen the targeting \nof some of the most vulnerable communities in our country, based on the \nfraudulent practices of banks.\n  The Justice Department has a tool, and they are using this tool. Why \nwould any credible Member of Congress want to take away the Justice \nDepartment's ability to investigate and to fine these institutions?\n  No, ladies and gentlemen, this is not about Choke Point. This is not \nabout guns. This is not about any of that other stuff that they are \ntrying to make you believe you should pay attention to.\n  Every legislator and every public policymaker should ask themselves: \nDo I want to be a part of ever allowing this institution to once again \nrevert back to the practices that caused people to lose their homes, \nthat threw this country into a recession, that still has us reeling \nfrom the negative impacts of those decisions by a bank?\n  Why would anybody want to take away the Justice Department's \ninvestigative powers? In addition to that, this bill will not even \nallow the Justice Department to exercise its authority to subpoena. Why \ndo you want to do that? It doesn't make good sense.\n  Again, you can talk about Choke Point all night long. You can \ndescribe it as being unfair to businesses, you can talk about what we \nneed to do, but that is not what this is about.\n  I know why you don't want to talk about it because you have got to be \nashamed of it. You have got to be ashamed of the fact that you are \nleading this institution to do away with investigative powers of the \nJustice Department.\n  Let me just say this. The Department of Justice has relied heavily on \nthe powers granted under FIRREA to pursue billions of dollars of \nmortgage fraud cases since the financial crisis. In these cases, \nfinancial firms defrauded the government by knowingly selling faulty \nmortgages while representing them as high quality.\n  Without FIRREA, investigations would have stalled and taxpayers would \nhave been left on the hook for even more losses. FIRREA powers were \nalso instrumental in securing the historic $25 billion mortgage \nservicing settlement.\n  As many of our colleagues know, there are still many more problems in \nthe mortgage servicing industry, and eliminating this tool would \nencourage fraudulent practices by mortgage services that end up \nwrongfully kicking Americans out of their homes.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining on each side, please.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman from \nMissouri has 19 minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from California \nhas 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I just want to make a few comments here. It seems that the ranking \nmember, as eloquently as she has spoken, continues to deflect from the \nbill we are talking about with regard to talking about mortgage \nservicing assets, the mortgage crisis that we had a few years ago. That \nis not in this bill.\n  We are talking about Operation Choke Point, which is recognized by \nthe Department of Justice. The Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee has a report from their own\n\n[[Page H575]]\n\nemail showing that within their own agency there was a discussion among \nthe legal staff, believing they didn't have the ability to do what they \ndo. They thought it was illegal themselves to do what they were doing, \nand yet they did this.\n  Mr. Chairman, for anybody who is listening and watching today, it \nshould send a chill down their spine when you sit here and have the \nleading law enforcement agency in this country believe and know that \nthey are doing something wrong and still do it. That, Mr. Chairman, \ncannot happen.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Ross), a cosponsor of the bill and a member of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, want to thank Chairman Luetkemeyer for \nintroducing this legislation which prohibits the Department of Justice \nfrom cutting off financial support to law-abiding businesses through \nits Operation Choke Point.\n  Created under the guise of a program to root out banking fraud and \nmoney laundering, Operation Choke Point has morphed into an instrument \nused by administration bureaucrats to pressure and force banks to end \nrelationships with the legitimate businesses the administration \nconsiders to be a ``reputational risk.''\n  This country is made up of all walks of lives and all walks of \nentrepreneurs and small businesses, yet this administration has \ntargeted these small and legitimate businesses.\n  I have a cigar retailer back home who was told by his bank that he \ncould no longer do business there. I have a gun store owner who was \ntold the same thing. I have a pawnshop that was told the same thing.\n  These targeted business owners do not receive a note from the bank \nstating: ``Due to Operation Choke Point, we regretfully must end our \nfinancial relationship with your business.'' No. They are just \ndiscontinued from doing any banking relationship, without any notice \nwhatsoever.\n  If what we have done with the Department of Justice and the FDIC is \nempower them with the ability to deny a fundamental right of \nconstitutional due process, then yes, we need to correct it. We have \nthat obligation.\n  As the chairman points out, we ought to be outraged over these \nadministrators doing this to our legitimate businesses.\n  This legislation, introduced by my colleague, will prohibit any \nFederal banking agency from suggesting, requesting, or ordering a \ndepository institution to terminate a customer account or prohibiting \nan institution from maintaining a banking relationship with specific \ncustomers unless the agency has a material reason to do so, and that \nreason is not solely based on reputational risk.\n  This bipartisan, commonsense legislation passed the Financial \nServices Committee by a vote of 35-19. In voting to pass H.R. 766 \ntoday, I will be voting to rein in this out-of-control administration \nand its assault on small, legal businesses not only in Florida, but \nacross the country.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Let me draw Members' attention to what is being attempted on the \nopposite side. They keep talking about Choke Point and how they want to \nsave payday lenders and rent-to-own and pawnshops and all of that. I \nmay have some issues with some of that, but that is not what this is \nabout today. Today, this is about the fact that they refuse to tell you \nwhat is really in this bill.\n  They cannot stand up and defend why in the world they would be taking \naway the Justice Department's ability to investigate bad banks. They \ncannot tell you why they are ignoring the lessons of 2008 and predatory \nlending and what the Justice Department has been able to do using \nFIRREA and investigating and fining and getting settlements.\n  They cannot tell you why they would ignore the fact that many \ninnocent middle class folks who work every day and who fought hard to \nmake down payments and signed on the dotted line for mortgages didn't \nknow that they were being tricked into signing mortgages that they \ncould never really keep up with and that the interest rates would reset \nand go higher and higher and they were going to lose their homes.\n  They cannot defend the predatory lending practices. They cannot \ndefend the fraud. They cannot defend the undermining of the average \nAmerican family. They cannot defend the fact that Americans lost their \nhomes. So they are going to keep talking about Choke Point and how they \nhave got to protect payday lenders and how they have got to protect \npawnshop owners and how they have got to protect rent-to-own and all \nthose businesses they hold so dearly and want to protect.\n  This really doesn't have anything to do with that. If they want to \nhave a real discussion about Choke Point, we are willing to do that; \nbut, this is not the time to do it.\n  This is not the time to use this to hide behind the fact that you \nwant to protect the big banks. As a matter of fact, this is so \noutrageous, it basically says that, instead of the Justice Department \nor anyone going after the banks, it would protect the banks by saying \nthat you can't go after the banks and you have to protect them and you \ncan't go against them.\n  I am simply saying over and over again that I don't care how many \nMembers they call up and I don't care how many Members come and talk \nabout Choke Point, somebody needs to tell us why they can't talk about \ntaking away the investigatory powers and the power to subpoena from the \nJustice Department, a Justice Department that has proven that it is \nwilling to use its investigatory powers in order to deal with these big \nbanks.\n  So listen very carefully and listen to all this Choke Point stuff \nthat they are trying to ram down your throats. Listen and look them in \nthe eye and see if they can look you back in the eye and defend what \nthey are doing.\n  Don't allow them to mislead you, Members of this Congress, into \nthinking that this bill is all about protecting payday lenders and \nrent-to-own and pawnshop owners and all these businesses that they care \nso much about.\n  This is about stripping the Department of Justice of their power to \ninvestigate and subpoena. This is about pulling the rug out from under \nthe citizens of this country who have tried to own homes and who have \nnot been protected by their own government until we had reform. This is \nabout saying they don't care what the Justice Department has been able \nto do to rein in these practices. They are going to come here today \nwith a bill and tell you it is all about Choke Point.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Tipton), an outstanding member of the committee.\n  Mr. TIPTON. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, we found some common ground. The ranking member was \njust talking about listening to Operation Choke Point. I think that is \nimportant for every American, because we are talking about freedom. We \nare talking about reining in an out-of-control bureaucracy. We are \ntalking about actually preserving freedom in this country, to take it \nback for the American people and for businesses as well.\n  I want to applaud Chairman Luetkemeyer for his leadership on this \nissue. It prevents Federal banking issues from pressuring banks and \ncredit unions to terminate customer accounts with legal businesses.\n  Although it is important to be able to prevent fraud in the banking \nsystem, Operation Choke Point has largely been abused by the agencies \nand their regulators, pressuring and manipulating financial \ninstitutions based on personal prejudices of Federal bureaucrats.\n  In my district and many others across the U.S., legitimate businesses \nhave found themselves shut out of the banking system after years of \nlongstanding relationships with banks and credit unions. Oftentimes, \nthis derisking means that these legal businesses are further shunned by \nother financial institutions fearful of civil and criminal liability as \nwell as greater regulatory scrutiny.\n  Thankfully, this legislation puts commonsense restraints on \nregulators that have been running amok. By requiring Federal banking \nagencies to provide a material reason other than reputational risk for \nterminating a customer account, this bill establishes\n\n[[Page H576]]\n\nnecessary, clear standards to avoid further abuses.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Instead of relying on implicit or explicit threats from regulators, \nthis legislation requires written justification of any request to \nterminate or restrict customer accounts.\n  It is clear that, despite several letters, hearings, and warning by \nCongress, financial institutions continue to face unwarranted pressure \nfrom the regulators. These requirements provide the necessary oversight \nto ensure banks, credit unions, and their customers are treated in a \nfair manner.\n  I am happy to lend my support to this bill, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this commonsense measure. I again thank the \ngentleman from Missouri for his efforts on this legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Williams), another outstanding member of our committee.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the time.\n  I rise today to support H.R. 766, the Financial Institution Customer \nProtection Act of 2016.\n  As a small-business owner for 44 years, I have seen it all--or at \nleast I thought I saw it all--and I am deeply troubled over a Federal \nGovernment program that I believe to be, at best, immoral and, at \nworst, illegal: Operation Choke Point.\n  The Obama White House has single-handedly granted itself the \nauthority to cut off relationships between private financial \ninstitutions and the perfectly legitimate businesses which they serve. \nThis Congress has not passed any legislation granting the executive \nbranch such immense power.\n  Mr. Chairman, all of us here have bore witness to the Obama \nadministration's willingness to bypass the lawmaking branch of our \ngovernment, but this is a new low. Operation Choke Point is the worst \nexample of the Obama White House telling Americans what is best for \nthem, and there is no appeals process.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is the worst form of government intrusion I have \never seen and can think of. Operation Choke Point is another example of \nthis administration's going around Congress to create laws rather than \ndo their job, to enforce the laws we already have on the books.\n  As a second-generation small-business owner, I support H.R. 766, \nwhich will rein in this abuse of power. Operation Choke Point is un-\nAmerican and deceiving. It is simply wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and do away with Operation \nChoke Point once and for all. Let's save small business. Let's save \nMain Street America.\n  In God we trust.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, after the Justice Department finally began \nto use the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act \nthat we refer to as FIRREA to create some semblance of justice for \nfinancial crisis-era bank fraud and misconduct, my Republican \ncolleagues respond by restricting the Department of Justice's most \npowerful tool for holding banks accountable.\n  This is an interesting debate that we are having. We are sitting here \nwondering why it is that not one Member on the Republican side of the \naisle who has taken to the floor to debate this bill will talk about \nFIRREA and will talk about the Justice Department and what you are \ndoing in stripping away their powers.\n  I know why. Because you know that, if, in fact, you really got up and \ntalked about what you were doing, you would lose all of the votes even \non your side of the aisle. This is outrageous. So you are hiding behind \nChoke Point.\n  Not one Member on the opposite side of the aisle has the guts to get \nup and say: I can't do this. I am going to talk about what this bill is \nreally about.\n  And so they continue to march down here, taking their orders to talk \nabout Choke Point, Choke Point, Choke Point.\n  No. No. No. This is about stripping the Justice Department of its \ninvestigatory powers and its subpoena powers.\n  FIRREA is the last line of defense between consumers and investors \nand bank fraud. Central to the DOJ's ability to investigate fraud and \nto build cases against financial institutions is its subpoena power, \npower that H.R. 766 singles out for unprecedented and burdensome \nrestrictions.\n  Instead of bolstering the Justice Department's ability to investigate \nmortgage fraud, H.R. 766 seeks to actually protect the banks and to \ninsulate them from accountability. Wow. Wow.\n  Can you just imagine that anyone could go home to their constituents \nand say: I just voted for a bill that would actually protect banks and \ninsulate them from accountability, I just voted for a bill to strip the \nJustice Department of its power to investigate?\n  Bank fraud should be met with the full force of the Federal \nGovernment. H.R. 766 is a dangerous step backwards for an economy still \nreeling from financial crisis-era fraud and misconduct.\n  Every regulator has been clear that account closures aren't the \nresult of pressure from regulators, but from banks that have decided \nthat, for some customers, they would rather lose their business than \ninvestigate any anti-fraud practices to protect our financial system \nfrom money laundering.\n  Look, you have got people who are willing to work on that part of \npublic policy that you would like to see some changes in, but this is \nnot it.\n  When you couple that discussion to overshadow what you are doing, to \nstrip the Justice Department of its powers to investigate, what you are \ndoing is you are setting up a situation to take us backwards and to \nharm so many people.\n  Have you forgotten the lessons already of 2008? Have you forgotten \nalready what this country went through? Have you forgotten that the \ncitizens of this country had to bail out the biggest banks to keep us \nfrom going into a depression?\n  We went into a recession. We tore up communities. We threw people out \nof their homes. We increased homelessness.\n  Now you want to come back and give the banks an opportunity to do \nwhat got us into trouble in the first place? Well, I can't imagine that \nyou are prepared to defend that.\n  The common theme throughout H.R. 766 and many of the proposals that, \nunfortunately, cleared the Financial Services Committee is that, even \nin the aftermath of the financial crisis, my Republican colleagues \nwould have you believe it is the big banks that are the ones in need of \nprotection, protection from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to please address their \nremarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill), one of the most knowledgeable members of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to address H.R. 766.\n  Before I talk about what my constituents have asked me to talk about, \nMr. Chairman, which is the problems with Operation Choke Point, for I \ndo take my instruction from my constituents at home, I do want to call \nmy distinguished ranking member's concern to this report about this \nbill, which says, ``or a Federally insured financial institution \nagainst an unaffiliated third person.''\n  So I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I don't understand where the \ngentlewoman from California is coming from in terms of gutting FIRREA. \nIt was certainly my privilege to serve at Treasury when FIRREA was \nnegotiated with the Congress and enacted into law.\n  I rise today, though, to support H.R. 766, the Financial Institution \nCustomer Protection Act, which helps to target and stop the egregious \nabuse of executive power in what has been known as Operation Choke \nPoint.\n  Bank examiners want our commercial banks across the country to be \nconscious of reputation risk, something every institution, large and \nsmall, takes very, very seriously.\n  Our boards of directors of our banks understand that, just like \ncredit risk, reputation risk is important. We don't\n\n[[Page H577]]\n\nneed to be lectured on the dangers of doing business with some high-\nrisk customers.\n  But, in Operation Choke Point, we find subtle and not-so-subtle \npressure from regulators to terminate business relationships rather \nthan to expose that reputation risk.\n  I have heard from pawnbrokers in Arkansas, legally licensed State and \nFederally regulated businesses, that they are victims of Operation \nChoke Point by having their bank servicing limited or cut off.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HILL. Just last week, Mr. Chairman, not 2 years ago, a firearms \ndealer in my hometown of Little Rock was dumped by his payment \nprocessor and is now having to pay more in interest, having less \ncontrol of his cash.\n  These are small, legitimate businesses that do business with our \nbanks, and they are being penalized by the prejudiced, politicized \nagenda of this administration.\n  This is not the only example. It is reminiscent of the IRS targeting \nof conservative groups.\n  So, with great pleasure, I support my friend from Missouri's bill. It \nis a reasonable, targeted approach. I urge all my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining, please?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Neugebauer), my friend and chairman of our Financial \nInstitutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 766, the \nFinancial Institution Customer Protection Act of 2015, offered by my \ngood friend from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).\n  This legislation is critical to ensure small businesses across the \ncountry are able to access basic banking services without the threat of \nbeing targeted at the political or ideological whims of Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  As my colleagues have mentioned, H.R. 766 prohibits the Federal \nGovernment banking regulators from formally or informally prohibiting \nbanks to serve lawful and legitimate businesses. Let me repeat that. It \nkeeps them from prohibiting banks from serving lawful and legitimate \nbusinesses.\n  Over the last several years, we have seen an effort by the Department \nof Justice, in cooperation with the Federal banking regulators, to \ntarget certain categories of lawful merchants. These merchants include \ngun stores, short-term, small-dollar credit lenders, and others. This \neffort has been officially named Operation Choke Point.\n  Operation Choke Point has used a perverse interpretation of the \nFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, currently \nreferred to as FIRREA, to force banks to terminate banking \nrelationships with certain categories of merchants even if its unlawful \nbehavior isn't present.\n  Representative Luetkemeyer's bill would clarify the original intent \nof FIRREA. Unfortunately, the minority leader and the ranking member of \nthe committee have been spreading misinformation about the impact of \nH.R. 766. So I will spend the rest of my remarks outlining exactly what \nthe bill will do and what it will not do.\n  It does not decriminalize any type of fraud. All of these criminal \nstatutes comprising FIRREA's predicted offenses are untouched by this \nbill.\n  H.R. 766 does not prohibit the Department of Justice from holding \nfinancial institutions accountable. FIRREA tools are still available \nfor the pursuit of any of the frauds committed by bank insiders against \nthe bank.\n  Additionally, the bill expressly provides that FIRREA's civil tools \nalso apply to fraud committed by the bank against an unaffiliated third \nparty.\n  In other words, where a bank defrauds a purchaser of a mortgage-\nbacked security, as was alleged by the big bank settlements, FIRREA's \ncivil tools remain available to the Department of Justice.\n  H.R. 766 does prohibit the use of FIRREA tools where fraud is \ncommitted by a bank's account holder, but not by the bank itself.\n  This is the type of self-affecting fraud that the Department of \nJustice asserted that gave rise to Operation Choke Point. In other \nwords, the fraud must be committed by the bank or against the bank for \nFIRREA to apply.\n  I hope everyone will read page 6, lines 21-25, of the bill.\n  Finally, H.R. 766 does limit the ability of the Attorney General to \ndelegate issuance of FIRREA civil subpoenas.\n  As a result, FIRREA subpoenas must be signed by the Attorney General \nor the Deputy Attorney General rather than a low-ranking Department of \nJustice attorney.\n  Unfortunately, we yet have another example of the minority not \nactually reading the text of the bill before making public statements.\n  Going forward, I hope the minority will study the text of the bill \ninstead of relying on false statements and talking points of the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have had the privilege to serve in this body for a \nnumber of terms, but I have not lost my ability to be outraged. \nOperation Choke Point is an outrage to the American people.\n  Who will stand up and defend the small mom and pop shops on Main \nStreet from the billions of dollars and the thousands of lawyers at the \nso-called Justice Department who wake up one day and decide that, \nnotwithstanding current law, they are going to put them out of \nbusiness?\n  Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, we have one outstanding Member of \nCongress, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), my colleague \nwho is standing up to these people. He is standing up to these people \nby authoring H.R. 766, and he is saying enough is enough. And we must \nsay enough is enough.\n  Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, a number of Democrats on the other side of \nthe aisle have actually joined with our side to say that justice must \nprevail and that the rule of law must prevail. I suspect that is why \nthe ranking member--bless her heart--had to spend so much time speaking \nherself, because she probably couldn't find any other speakers to come \nand help her out.\n  It is an outrage, Mr. Chairman, that this administration continues to \ntrample on the Constitution. Clearly, we know the President has his pen \nand he has his phone. But he clearly doesn't have a copy of the \nConstitution. For legally constituted businesses to have to fear that, \nin the dark of night, they are going to be shut down by the awesome \npower of the Obama administration is an outrage. All Americans should \nbe outraged.\n  Frankly, when is it that we will have the ranking member and others \nstand up for the rule of law? We are losing the rule of law to the \ndiscretion of regulators. If there was any justice in the Obama Justice \nDepartment, somebody would be indicted over Operation Choke Point. \nPerhaps, Mr. Chairman, they should indict themselves for bringing forth \nsomething we haven't seen since the Nixon era. What else is going to be \nin the bag of dirty tricks?\n  Somebody has to stand up against the elites in Washington who bypass \narticle I, section 1 of our Constitution. All legislative power is \nvested in this body. It is not vested in the Justice Department, Mr. \nChairman. They are supposed to enforce the law, not make the law.\n  To wake up one morning and find out that your bank account and your \naccess to funds have been choked off by an oppressive Federal \nGovernment, lawlessly, has to be stopped. Where is the justice, Mr. \nChairman? I ask you, where is the justice?\n  Now, just yesterday I learned that on the other side of the Capitol, \nwe had a Senator from Massachusetts who invoked the names of three dead \nAfrican Americans who tragically lost their lives and used that bloody \nshirt to attack this bill. Then this very same Senator turned around \nand put out a fundraising appeal on H.R. 766.\n  The American people have not lost their ability to be outraged at \nthose who may possess Ivy League degrees and Washington, D.C., \naddresses who have the arrogance to tell them what is\n\n[[Page H578]]\n\nbest for them, their businesses, their lives, and their families.\n  It is time that we respect the rule of law. It is time that we \nrespect the Constitution. It is time that we choke off Operation Choke \nPoint and put it into the dustbin of history: the history of dirty \ntricks and the history of lawlessness.\n  That is why it is so important, Mr. Chairman, that all Members--\nDemocrat, Republican, and liberals--let their voice be heard by casting \ntheir vote for H.R. 766.\n  Why--why--do Members outsource their legislative authority to the \nunaccountable and unelected? Sooner or later, Mr. Chairman, the shoe is \ngoing to be on the other foot.\n  Who will stand for justice today? We will look closely as the names \ncome up on the big board. The American people are watching, and they \nwant to know: Who is going to stand with me? Who is going to stand for \nthe rule of law? Who is going to stand for the Constitution? Who is \ngoing to stand for the little people in America?\n  I am proud to stand with Chairman Luetkemeyer and the Republicans of \nthe House Financial Services Committee to ensure that Operation Choke \nPoint is choked off once and for all.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-41.

Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Sherman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chair, this is really two bills that have been put \ntogether. One deals with Operation Choke Point, and for reasons \nexplained by the majority, it is important that we pass that part of \nthe legislation. The other imposes restrictions on FIRREA, and for \nreasons eloquently expressed by the ranking member, I do not support \nthat part of the bill. I, frankly, do not know how I am going\n\n[[Page H579]]\n\nto vote because of these portions of the bill, one is important to \npass, and the other is a restriction that I cannot support.\n  I will point out for all of us who want to deal with Operation Choke \nPoint that it is unfortunate that these two bills have been put \ntogether into one because we know the President isn't going to sign \nthis bill if it has got the FIRREA portion in it. So it is my hope that \nwe put on the President's desk a bill that protects American businesses \nfrom Operation Choke Point, a bill that the President can sign.\n  I want to use the time allotted here to try to improve the Operation \nChoke Point provisions because I hope they are ultimately signed into \nlaw.\n  Now, why are those Operation Choke Point provisions important? As the \nmajority has explained, various businesses that are currently unpopular \nwith the bureaucracy are being targeted, and it is an extremely \npowerful tool to destroy a business and to cut off its access to \nfinancial institutions.\n  Today they come for the gun stores and the tobacco dealers. And I \ndon't have friends who are gun store owners and tobacco dealers, so \nsome would say I should be quiet. But I do not know who the next \nPresident of the United States will be. And as I listen to the Record, \nI know that if they have the power, they will come after the Planned \nParenthood clinics and the environmental organizations.\n  Woe be to a Congress that yields extreme power to the executive \nbranch in the expectation that the executive branch will use it in a \nway that they favor knowing that the tide turns and the other party \ncould be in control of that branch. So it is important that we improve \nthe Operation Choke Point provisions of this bill.\n  Every speaker who talked about the Operation Choke Point provisions \nof this bill focused on mom and pop businesses, domestic businesses. \nEvery bit of the discussion in committee focused on that, and that is \nwhy it is important that this bill not have an unintended consequence \nnever discussed by anyone at committee; that is, that it would affect \nour anti-terrorism and national security efforts.\n  So in the words of the Democratic Daily Whip from Whip Hoyer, the \nSherman amendment clarifies that the underlying bill does not prevent \nbanking regulators from requesting a financial institution terminate a \nrelationship because the customer poses a national security threat, is \nengaged in terrorist financing, or is domiciled in Iran, North Korea, \nSyria, or another state sponsor of terrorism.\n  I think it is a step forward to improve the Operation Choke Point \nportions of this bill. I think that, as further improved, those \nprovisions should and, I believe, will become law. So I ask support for \nan amendment that makes it clear that a bill that was discussed only in \nthe sense of domestic businesses, only in the sense of ma and pa and \nMain Street, does not have an effect that the author never included in \nour national security policy.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank \nthe gentleman from California who has shown his concern about the Choke \nPoint provisions of the bill. He is absolutely right. Both of these \nissues are in this bill. We cannot divide it in the way that we are \nmoving forward. And it means that if this bill passes, no matter what \nthe concern may be, the overriding concern must be about stripping the \nJustice Department of its investigatory power and its subpoena power. \nIt must be about undermining the Justice Department's ability to hold \nthese big banks accountable.\n  I don't think you can divide this. This is one bill.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, this bill will be \ngoing through the legislative process. It is important that we improve \nthe Operation Choke Point provisions.\n  I have enjoyed working with the gentleman from Missouri, and I hope \nthat he will see fit to accept this amendment and to narrow it to a \nfocus outside of terrorism policy.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman), who is a very thoughtful member of the House \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  I wish to accept his amendment. I believe it adds greater granularity \nand specificity on a very important issue. Since he lost an amendment \nyesterday, I want him to bat at least .500.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-414.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, strike lines 4 through 9 and insert the following:\n       (1) Notice required.--Except as provided under paragraph \n     (2), if an appropriate Federal banking agency orders a \n     depository institution to terminate a specific customer \n     account or a group of customer accounts, the depository \n     institution shall inform the customer or customers of the \n     justification for the customer's account termination \n     described under subsection (b).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense \namendment that will protect customers of financial institutions and \nincrease transparency between them and the Federal Government.\n  I applaud the committee for bringing this bill to the floor to \nprotect consumers and businesses from an overreaching Federal \nGovernment. I am especially grateful to Representative Luetkemeyer for \nhis work on the bill, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  My amendment will increase transparency by requiring the financial \ninstitutions to provide notice to customers if their account is ordered \nterminated by a Federal banking regulator. Customers have a right to be \ninformed when the Federal Government has instructed a financial \ninstitution to close their accounts.\n  In the base bill, Federal banking agencies are required to notify the \nfinancial institution and provide written justification as to why the \ntermination is needed. My amendment would simply require the depository \ninstitution to share that justification with the customer.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  One of the ways the Federal Government has abused its powers in the \npast regarding customers of financial institutions is Operation Choke \nPoint. Operation Choke Point was an unconstitutional program created by \nthe Obama administration that put pressure on banks and payment \nprocessors to shut down industries like gun stores and pawn shops that \nPresident Obama and the attorney general just didn't like.\n  After continued pressure from Chairman Luetkemeyer, myself, and other \nMembers of Congress, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, \nannounced in January of 2015 that some changes to this terrible program \nwere to be made. While this was a positive step, this bill and my \namendment are still very necessary. Congress needs to codify these \ncustomer protections to prevent future abuses by an overreaching \nFederal Government.\n  My amendment will help put an end to the abuses of Operation Choke \nPoint. President Obama has been staunch in his assault on the Second \nAmendment, and Operation Choke Point was simply another way for the \nPresident and the DOJ to infringe upon the rights of lawful gun owners \nand businesses.\n\n[[Page H580]]\n\n  American citizens do not want Big Government to have the power to \narbitrarily terminate their accounts at financial institutions based on \nideological opposition to individuals or organizations. This simple, \ncommonsense amendment, which is supported by Americans for Limited \nGovernment, the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and \nEagle Forum, is about protecting consumers and increasing transparency.\n  CBO has informed me that this amendment will not score. As such, \nthere is no reason not to pass this amendment or this bill that will \nincrease transparency and protect consumers throughout the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and H.R. 766.\n  I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Gosar's amendment \nis a dangerous amendment to an already highly problematic bill. As the \nOCC deputy comptroller noted in 2015 testimony before our committee: \n``In the rare cases where a customer has engaged in suspected criminal \nor other illegal activity,'' the OCC ``may order the bank through an \nenforcement action to terminate the customer's account.''\n  H.R. 766 creates a national security exception for customer notice, \nbut it leaves the term undefined in a case where the illegal activity \ndoes not pose a threat to national security. Mr. Gosar's amendment \nwould potentially force banks to tip off someone engaging in criminal \nactivity, frustrating regulators' oversight of Federal anti-money \nlaundering laws.\n  Mr. Gosar's amendment exacerbates an already highly problematic \nproposal, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, again, I just want to point out, since I \nhave time on this amendment, that this bill is not about all of this \nanyway. They keep focusing on Choke Point, and they come up with these \nquestionable amendments, et cetera, such as Mr. Gosar's.\n  This is about the Republicans on the opposite side of the aisle \nstripping the Justice Department of its authority to go after these too \nbig to fail banks and taking away their investigatory powers and their \nsubpoena powers, thus threatening the citizens of this country once \nagain to the kind of predatory lending that helped to almost bring down \nthis economy starting in 2008.\n  I ask for a ``no'' on this amendment, and I am going to ask for a \n``no'' on the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I am miffed. I am absolutely miffed that a \ncustomer, or a consumer, would not have the ability to understand that \ntheir account was actually closed. I am totally miffed at personal \nrights and responsibilities and the coordination with the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Once again, this is the second amendment I have offered on Financial \nServices with the same type of attitude and idiocrasy that I have \nactually seen in defiance of a commonsense amendment.\n  I oppose the gentlewoman's objections, and I would ask everyone to \nvote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, I would \nask the Members of this Congress to not pay attention to what has been \nattempted by the opposite side of the aisle.\n  Again, I challenged them and I asked them to talk about FIRREA. I \nasked them to talk about the bill that takes away the investigatory \npowers of the Justice Department. I asked them to explain why they \nwould take away subpoena powers from the Justice Department. I asked \nthem if they remembered what happened when this country went into a \nrecession, almost a depression, because of predatory lending. I asked \nthem did they want to have their name and their vote behind big banks \nthat are guilty of fraud, who have been fined enormous sums of money by \nthe Justice Department because they were found guilty, and I am asking \nthem to talk about this. So this is a distraction. This is obscuring \nthe real bill that is before us.\n  Forget about this Choke Point part of the bill. We have time to work \non that. There are some Members on the opposite side of the aisle that \nshare some of those concerns, but not in this bill. They coupled it \nwith this taking away of the Department of Justice power because they \nknew that they could somehow divert the attention over to the so-called \nChoke Point and talk about this administration and talk about guns and \ntalk about payday loans and talk about rent to own and pawn shops and \nall that.\n  This is not about small business protection. This is about using the \nChoke Point argument as a way to divert attention away from what they \nare really doing.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, you can't go home and explain to your \nconstituents why you would protect the too big to fail banks, why you \nwould take away the power to make them accountable. They have harmed \nthis country. They have harmed our citizens. They have caused people to \nlose their homes, and they have increased the homelessness with their \npredatory lending.\n  We have reform that we are trying to implement. I know every trick in \nthe book has been played to try to undermine Dodd-Frank and to keep us \nfrom having the kind of reform because there are people who are just \nvery close to the big banks and they are not going to cross the big \nbanks. As a matter of fact, they used too much of their career to \nprotect the big banks.\n  This is an outrage. I want the Members of this Congress to \nunderstand, we have got time to have a discussion about Choke Point and \nall of that. We have Members on both sides of the aisle who would work \nwith you on those issues. This is not it.\n  You should not have placed this part in this bill. You should not \nhave had to try and make believe that this is all about Choke Point \nwhen, in fact, the real big deal in this bill is about how you are \ngoing to try to protect the biggest and the worst banks.\n  We have pointed out to you in this discussion all of the big fines \nthat have been imposed against these banks. Did these banks say, ``No, \nwe didn't do it''? Did these banks say, ``I am not going to accept \nthis. I am going to court, and I am going to fight''? You know they \nrolled over because they are guilty, and you know that they are.\n  Please do not be diverted from the real meaning of this bill. This \nbill is about crippling the Department of Justice and not about Choke \nPoint.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Womack). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nRodney Davis of Illinois) having assumed the chair, Mr. Womack, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 766) to provide requirements for the appropriate Federal banking \nagencies when requesting or ordering a depository institution to \nterminate a specific customer account, to provide for additional \nrequirements related to subpoenas issued under the Financial \nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, and for \nother purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 595, he reported the \nbill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of \nthe Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on adoption of the amendment in the nature of \na substitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n[[Page H581]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at \nthe desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Castor of Florida moves to recommit the bill H.R. 766 \n     to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to \n     report the same back to the House forthwith with the \n     following amendment:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Sections 2 and 3 shall take effect on the \n     date that the Attorney General and the Federal financial \n     institutions regulatory agencies jointly certify to the \n     Congress that in the preceding 5 years no federally regulated \n     financial institution has been subject to--\n       (1) a consent order, settlement, deferred prosecution \n     agreement, civil or criminal penalty for a violation of the \n     Servicemembers Civil Relief Act;\n       (2) a consent order, settlement, deferred prosecution \n     agreement, civil or criminal penalty for bank fraud, wire \n     fraud, or mail fraud relating to the origination, servicing, \n     securitization, or sale of a mortgage product; or\n       (3) a consent order, settlement, deferred prosecution \n     agreement, civil or criminal penalty for unfair or deceptive \n     acts and practices relating to the origination, servicing, \n     securitization, or sale of a mortgage product.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies'' has \n     the meaning given that term under section 1121 of the \n     Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act \n     of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3350).\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker and Members, this is the final \namendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to \ncommittee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final \npassage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rushed to come to the floor to offer this motion to \nrecommit because this bill, H.R. 766, is so outrageous. Under this \nbill, the Republicans in Congress are poised to give a get out of jail \nfree card to big banks and Wall Street interests when it comes to \nfraud. Republicans propose to take away tools and investigatory powers \nfrom the Department of Justice in cases of fraud and undermine the \nDepartment of Justice's ability to prosecute mortgage fraud and other \ncrimes to the detriment of American families and our neighbors back \nhome.\n  Americans expect that the big banks that have broken the rules be \nheld accountable for any of their financial misdeeds. However, the \nHouse Republicans are trying to give their special interest friends a \nbreak they do not need at the expense of hardworking Americans.\n  Shortly after I was sworn into Congress in 2007, my neighbors started \nto come to me and express, sincerely, about a problem that was \nhappening. It started in Florida almost earlier than anywhere else.\n  As the financial crisis took hold and people began to lose their jobs \nor their employers cut back on their hours, they couldn't keep up with \ntheir mortgages. The deeper we dug in to it, we began to see a pattern \nof fraudulent practices by many in the mortgage loan business.\n  After 2007, I had six foreclosure prevention workshops. At that time, \nI will never forget looking into the eyes of my neighbors, who asked \nfor a little bit of breathing room, a little bit of help.\n  We came to Washington and we asked for that help on behalf of \nAmerican families, not to let them off the hook for their mortgages, \nbut to give them a little breathing room. The response here in \nWashington was, instead, the huge, multibillion-dollar Wall Street \nbailout.\n  We asked, as part of that Wall Street bailout of the big banks: Could \nyou allow homeowners to have a little more breathing room so they could \nstay in their homes? But, no, that couldn't be part of the \nmultibillion-dollar Wall Street package. That was a lesson to everyone \nacross America who really holds the power here in Washington, D.C.\n  Next week, I am still going to have another foreclosure prevention \nworkshop with HOPE NOW and my local partners, because people are not \nhealed and the fraud continues.\n  On Monday of this week, I sat down with my U.S. attorney in the \nmiddle district of Florida, one of the busiest districts in America, \nespecially when it comes to fraud. Do you know what U.S. Attorney Lee \nBentley said? He said we need more tools to fight fraud. They are \nwinning big cases and big settlements when it comes to Medicare fraud \nand mortgage fraud and rooting out waste in the system.\n  So it is appalling. You bring H.R. 766 to take away those \ninvestigatory tools, the subpoena powers, for white-collar crime.\n  Today, House Republicans are aiming to weaken the vital financial \nfraud fighting law, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and \nEnforcement Act. This is irresponsible. House Republicans should be \ncalled out for it.\n  Republicans will eliminate the authority of thousands of Federal \nprosecutors to issue subpoenas for the purpose of investigating and \nprosecuting any big banks or other financial institutions that engage \nin financial fraud or other financial crimes.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  So I am offering an amendment, a motion to recommit, that, instead, \nsides with our hardworking families back home. My amendment will \nprevent the legislation from taking effect until the Department of \nJustice and banking regulators certify that no financial institutions \nthat are covered by the act have broken the law by taking advantage of \nservicemembers or by perpetrating abuses in the mortgage market. That \nis the very least my Republican colleagues could do.\n  In the meantime, American families who are appalled at this kind of \naction in the Congress should know that the Democrats are united for \nopportunity for hardworking Americans, especially for servicemembers \nand homeowners who are seeking to enjoy the American Dream. Americans \nshould be appalled that Republicans want to take the financial cops off \nthe beat and take tools away from our Department of Justice and U.S. \nattorneys.\n  I ask my House Republican colleagues to join us in working to build \nan economy that works for all Americans, not just for the privileged \nfew.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion. Side with American families.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the \ngentlewoman's motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I think I have finally found some common \nground with my friends on the other side of the aisle, which is that we \nlament how few prosecutions there have been after the great financial \ncrisis.\n  How about all of the former Democratic officials who used to warrant \nFannie and Freddie, which took tens of millions of dollars of bonuses \nonly to see hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer bailouts? Where \nare those prosecutions, Mr. Speaker?\n  How about all of the Democratic lawmakers who came and said, ``Let's \nroll the dice for taxpayer bailouts'' ? Guess what? The dice were \nrolled, and taxpayers were rolled as well. Where are the prosecutions \nthere? It has been 8 years of the Obama administration's Justice \nDepartment.\n  They are trying to take you away from what this is truly about. It is \nabout, again, Operation Choke Point. It is about the awesome resources \nand power of the Federal Government that is being used to crush small \nbusinesses that somehow appear on the Obama administration's enemy \nlist.\n  Today, those small businesses that deal with ammunition sales, that \nare coin dealers, dating services--all on the enemies list--that deal \nwith fireworks sales, payday loans, pharmaceutical sales. It is all \nright here in the FDIC Supervisory Insights. It reads that, even though \nyou are a perfectly legal business, if we don't like you, we are going \nto crush you, and there is nothing you can do about it because we are \nthe Federal Government.\n\n[[Page H582]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, there is something we can do about it. We can pass H.R. \n766. All the motion to recommit says is that the Justice Department \ngets to decide whether the law is ever enacted. It is not worth the \npaper it is printed on.\n  When is this body going to quit outsourcing its constitutional \nauthority to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats? It is an outrage. \nOperation Choke Point is an outrage. It is an affront to the \nConstitution. It is an affront to the rule of law. It is an affront to \nall of the hardworking mom-and-pop shops all across America. It strikes \nfear in the hearts of Americans.\n  It is time to stand up for the Constitution. It is time to stand up \nfor the rule of law. It is time to stand up for those who do not have \nvoice, for those who do not have power. Reject this motion to recommit, \nand enact H.R. 766.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from \nthe Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3033) to require the President's \nannual budget request to Congress each year to include a line item for \nthe Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science \nFoundation and to require the National Science Foundation to conduct \nresearch on dyslexia, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in \nthe Senate amendment.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the Senate amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n  Senate amendment:\n\n       Strike section 4 of the bill and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. DYSLEXIA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Consistent with subsection (c), the \n     National Science Foundation shall support multi-directorate, \n     merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded research on the \n     science of specific learning disability, including dyslexia, \n     such as research on the early identification of children and \n     students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers \n     and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and \n     educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and \n     implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia \n     intervention. Research supported under this subsection shall \n     be conducted with the goal of practical application.\n       (b) Awards.--To promote development of early career \n     researchers, in awarding funds under subsection (a) the \n     National Science Foundation shall prioritize applications for \n     funding submitted by early career researchers.\n       (c) Coordination.--To prevent unnecessary duplication of \n     research, activities under this Act shall be coordinated with \n     similar activities supported by other Federal agencies, \n     including research funded by the Institute of Education \n     Sciences and the National Institutes of Health.\n       (d) Funding.--The National Science Foundation shall devote \n     not less than $5,000,000 to research described in subsection \n     (a), which shall include not less than $2,500,000 for \n     research on the science of dyslexia, for each of fiscal years \n     2017 through 2021, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, to come from amounts made available for the \n     Research and Related Activities account or the Education and \n     Human Resources Directorate under subsection (e).

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the \nschedule for the week to come and perhaps thereafter.\n  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On \nTuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for \nlegislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On \nWednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour \nand noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 \na.m. for legislative business.\n\n[[Page H585]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 3293, the Scientific \nResearch in the National Interest Act, sponsored by Representative \nLamar Smith. This bill will go a long ways toward providing greater \ntransparency and accountability at the National Science Foundation. It \nis essential that we ensure precious Federal dollars are spent on \nFederal grants that promote science but do so in a way that is in the \nbest interest of the United States.\n  Additionally, the House will consider H.R. 3442, the Debt Management \nand Fiscal Responsibility Act, sponsored by Representative Kenny \nMarchant. This commonsense bill simply requires the administration to \nreport to Congress on the status of the Nation's debt and their plans \nto address our fiscal problems prior to the Nation reaching its debt \nlimit. With more than $18 trillion in public debt, we have a \nresponsibility, both Democrats and Republicans, to show the American \npeople a path toward solvency.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 2017, the Common \nSense Nutrition Disclosure Act, sponsored by Representative Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers. This important bill addresses a harmful menu labeling \nregulation that will burden every grocery store, convenience store, and \npizza restaurant in the country. Instead, our approach will provide a \nreasonable and flexible way for these businesses to provide customers \nwith nutritional information.\n  I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that information with respect to \nthe legislation that is going to be on the floor next week.\n  I would simply say with respect to one of these bills, the Debt \nManagement and Fiscal Responsibility Act, I don't know whether that \nbill requires the House to do the same, but certainly both the \nexecutive and the legislative branches of government need to have a \nresponsible fiscal program and analysis so that, in fact, we can move \ntoward fiscal balance. I look forward to having that discussion next \nweek on the floor.\n  Mr. Leader, we had a prayer breakfast this morning. It was a moving \nand very, I think, unifying time here in Washington where we had \nRepublicans and Democrats and a lot of people from around the world \nattending. We talked about coming together. We talked about respecting \none another, talking to one another, and serving our country and our \npeople in a way consistent with our various faiths.\n  In that context, I am going to ask the gentleman some questions on \nthe scheduling, but I am hopeful that the Speaker has indicated that he \nwants to consider some broad issues. He refers to five in particular: \nnational security, jobs and economic growth, health care, poverty and \nopportunity, and restoring the Constitution. I am not sure exactly what \nthat last phrase means, but in any event, I think all of us want to \nmake sure the Constitution is honored and certainly adhered to.\n  However, it also appears--and we had this discussion last week--that \nsubstantive legislation--that is, translating thoughts and objectives \nand visions into legislation--may not occur in 2016. I don't know that \nto be the case, but I fear that to be the case, that we will not offer \nto the American people in this critically important election year \nspecifics as to what we might do.\n  I mention specifically the Affordable Care Act, which I know the \ngentleman's party believes is not good policy, whether or not we were \ngoing to consider an alternative to do what your party has said it is \ngoing to do for the last 5 years, and that is repeal, but replace with \npolicies. I think that would be a useful discussion for us to have and \ndo so in a way that respects the integrity of each person's view as to \nwhat the best interests of our country are.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  In addition, one of the pieces of legislation would be the Voting \nRights Act amendment. I bring that up now because Speaker Ryan said \nyesterday, as I understand it, that he was in favor of doing a voting \nrights bill. I don't know that he went into specifics.\n  We believe that we need to address this bill because we believe it \nwas substantially undermined by the recent decision of the Supreme \nCourt some few years ago. He indicated that that was not going to be \nbrought to the floor because of Mr. Goodlatte's opposition to that or, \nperhaps, the failure of Mr. Goodlatte to address that in committee.\n  I bring that up specifically because I know, Mr. Leader, you made the \nobservation, and I think you are quoted as saying you believe the two \nparties can achieve consensus on that legislation, but we may not be \nable to move it forward this year.\n  Excuse me. That speaks to criminal justice system reform, not to \nvoting rights. I think we can reach consensus on the criminal justice \nreform. I think both parties believe that there are substantial areas \nthat need to be addressed in criminal justice reform. Senator Cornyn \nhas certainly indicated that. Republicans and Democrats in this House \nhave indicated that.\n  My question to you is with respect to the issues that I think we have \nall discussed and that the Speaker has discussed, such as: jobs and \neconomic growth; health care; poverty and opportunity, which we believe \nis a very important issue; criminal justice reform; job creation; long-\nterm fiscal agreements so that we can replace the sequester with a \npermanent rather than an every-2-year resolution; comprehensive tax \nreform, which almost all of us have said we are for--Mr. Camp brought a \nbill forward on that--comprehensive immigration reform; restoring \nvoting rights, which I mentioned; taking action to address gun \nviolence, which we are in favor of, and I think clearly your side has \nindicated that mental health is very much a component of that and you \nwant to address that; and addressing our national security challenges, \nwhich I agree with the Speaker that is a primary responsibility and \nconcern of, I think, everybody on the floor of this House.\n  My question, therefore, Mr. Leader, is: Do you expect any substantive \nlegislation, rather than simply ideas that both parties might express \nand put out to the public, that would be transparent, specific, and on \nwhich we could have debates on alternative policies? Do you expect, in \nthe relatively short time we have this year, to have legislation on the \nfloor dealing with one or more of those subjects?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I did take notes because you raised a lot of different issues.\n  The first point, you talked about Congressman Kenny Marchant's bill \nasking the administration to set a path forward. I agree with you. That \nis why I believe that any budget that comes before this floor should \nbalance in the 10-year window. I am proud of the fact that, on this \nside of the aisle, we have been able to do it, because that shows you \nthe path to solvency and how you deal with this debt through big \nchanges.\n  You talked about what Speaker Ryan laid out. These are big, bold, new \nideas. The Speaker says that they are going to go through committee. \nEvery Member of this body, your side and ours, will be able to \nparticipate. The legislation will come through committee.\n  Knowing these are bold ideas and the time we have here, some will get \ndone and some may not get done by the end of this calendar year, but \nthat doesn't mean that we can't finish the job.\n  If we want to save this country and put us on a path of solvency and \nincreased growth, these are areas that we find need to get done. We \nlook forward to you working with us on all of these areas.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  I think, certainly, we agree that we ought to work together. He and I \nhave worked together, as a matter fact, on some very significant \nlegislation more than a month ago that passed the House. I think the \nAmerican public wants that.\n  My urging to the majority leader would be that each of these ideas, \nif we are going to ultimately make them policy, has to be translated \ninto legislation.\n  The gentleman says all of us will be able to participate. Frankly, \nthe gentleman knows, as well as I do, that legislation has to come to \nthe floor for all of us to engage in, hopefully, with the ability to \noffer amendments and our ideas on how to perfect legislation that\n\n[[Page H586]]\n\nmay come out of the committees. I would hope that we would see that.\n  The gentleman mentioned the budget. I think the gentleman and others \nhave said they want to accelerate the budget process. I think that is a \ngood idea. I have always felt that we ought to move the budget and the \nappropriations bills earlier than we have historically done so that we \ncan get those to the Senate, so they have time to work on them and \nbring them back, in order to have all 12 appropriations bills done \nseriatim, one after another.\n  In my view, we are going to need a bipartisan effort and not have \npoison pills or the so-called riders in them in order for the Senate to \nconsider them and be able to work their will and then go to conference \nand get that done all prior to October 1. I don't know whether that is \npossible, but I think the gentleman would say that would be certainly \ngood to do, if in fact we could get that done.\n  When does the gentleman expect the budget, which is the start of that \nprocess, to be on the floor?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Well, I was just speaking with the Budget Committee chairman. He is \ntrying to move that process up. It is our goal. If we can reach that \ngoal before the first part of March and get that done, we can move up \nthe appropriations process.\n  As you know, it is difficult to move too fast because you have the \ncommittee hearings and you want the input and to be able to have the \naccountability and oversight of all the agencies. We have to have those \nhearings so that both sides of the aisle are in those committees and \nare able to produce something that is very productive.\n\n  Yes, it is our goal to try to move the process up this year. As soon \nas we have that scheduled for the floor, I will let you know.\n  Mr. HOYER. Am I correct, then, in saying that our target is the first \nweek in March or the second week in March, at the latest, for the \nbudget?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. We are looking at that timeframe, yes.\n  Mr. HOYER. I appreciate that information.\n  Let me discuss a number of other specific issues, if I can.\n  First of all, the Speaker indicated that he wanted to see legislation \non the floor of the House by March 31 on Puerto Rico. As you and I both \nknow, Puerto Rico is facing a fiscal crisis of its own. It is going to \nneed some authority to deal with that crisis so that neither the \nAmericans living in Puerto Rico are disadvantaged nor the children and \nothers--whether it is through the educational system, the healthcare \nsystem, providing power, or whatever services are necessary--will not \nbe adversely impacted.\n  Can the gentleman give me an idea as to what progress we are making \ntowards seeing legislation on the floor by March 31?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, we are committed to addressing this issue. We \nhave had numerous meetings and we have also had committee hearings. \nEven this week, Chairman Bishop and the Natural Resources Committee are \nhard at work to find the best path forward.\n  We are committed to getting this done. I will not prejudge the \ncommittee on what the solution should be, but I know they are hard at \nwork. We continually monitor it week to week. As soon as we have it \nscheduled, I will notify the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that.\n  Again, I would reiterate that, on the voting rights issue, the \nSpeaker is supportive of some legislative treatment addressing that \nissue.\n  Does the gentleman have any idea when that might occur?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I think the gentleman is referring to an article that we both read. I \nam not sure that you were in the meeting. I was not in the meeting.\n  Mr. HOYER. I was not.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. One thing that Speaker Ryan has laid out for this body \nis that it is not top-down, it is bottom-up, and that we go through \nregular order. Committees are there to do their work.\n  Look at the metrics of just this last year: If you take the 25-year \naverage, it is usually a little over 300 bills come through committee \nto this floor. We are well over 500. So we've shown that we are taking \nthat path and improving on having them come to the floor.\n  I think what the Speaker said and what I read was that he may have a \npersonal opinion, but he wants it to go through committee so that all \nvoices are heard and we have the opportunity for amendments. When it \ngets out of committee, we can move it to the floor.\n  I will keep you posted on when it is scheduled.\n  Mr. HOYER. I appreciate you keeping me posted, but my frustration is \nthat this issue has been hanging around for a very long period of time. \nWhen Mr. Cantor had your position as majority leader, he indicated he \nwas receptive to addressing it. The gentleman is correct; I was not \nthere either, but I believe the Speaker is reported as having said it \nneeds to be addressed.\n  I understand bottom-up, but if bottom doesn't work, you never get up. \nI refer to the Export-Import Bank that lay sanguinely for 2 years in \nthe committee because the chairman was opposed to it when the majority \nof your party was for it when it came to the floor.\n  So it is one thing to say that we ought to work bottom-up, but if the \nbottom is a stopper and creates gridlock, frankly, this body does not \nget to do what its responsibility is, and that is to reflect the will \nof the people, as we did on the Export-Import Bank.\n  So I sympathize with the bottom-up, and that is the way it ought to \nwork; but if, in fact, what we have is a blockage to the people's \nRepresentatives having the ability to work their will and reflect the \nUnited States citizens' views, then democracy is not working.\n  We saw that in the Export-Import Bank, in my opinion, which I worked \non very, very assiduously for over 2 years to get to this floor. Very \nfrankly, when it did get to this floor, as I said repeatedly, it would \nenjoy the majority's support.\n  In my view, if a voting rights bill gets to this floor, it will enjoy \nthe majority's support. As you know, Mr. Sensenbrenner was the sponsor. \nPresident Bush was President when we passed the Voting Rights Act in \n2006. It passed overwhelmingly in the House, overwhelmingly in the \nSenate, and was signed by President Bush.\n  I am certainly sympathetic to wanting to make sure that we follow \nregular order, but if regular order precludes democracy from working, \nthen it is irregular order and not in the best interests of our \ncountry.\n  Lastly, Mr. Leader, recently, all of us are concerned about Zika. We \nare all focused on Zika. Can the gentleman tell me whether or not there \nare any planned efforts to address what is clearly a very serious \nhealth crisis that confronts not only us, but certainly South America, \nLatin America, and other parts of the world?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, but I do want to \nthank the gentleman for still being able to work Ex-Im Bank into the \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. HOYER. You gave me such a great opening.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. The gentleman brings up a very serious issue. This is \nsomething that should not be taken lightly. This should not be partisan \nin any way shape or form. This is something we should get ahead of. \nThat is why the Energy and Commerce Committee has already scheduled and \nsent out letters for hearings. Susan Brooks has a bill that she has \nbeen working on dealing with this as well.\n  So, yes, we want to get in front of this. I know we have been talking \nto the administration as well. I look forward to working with you in \ndealing with this issue because this is not something that should lay \nby the wayside. This is something we have to get in front of.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. We certainly agree on that. I look \nforward to working together to address it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H587]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/house-section/article/H587-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n  ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2016, TO MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, \n                                  2016\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to give voice to the \nmillions of Americans who continue to be dumbfounded and frustrated by \nthis administration's handling of Iran.\n  Shortly before President Obama's final State of the Union address, \nnews broke that 10 U.S. sailors had been captured by Iran's Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard.\n  Remarkably, the President did not even mention our sailors in his \nspeech while TVs across the world became littered with pictures of our \nsailors on their knees at gunpoint.\n  Even worse, Iran's Supreme Leader celebrated this incident last week \nby awarding medals to those Iranians who captured the intruding \nAmericans.\n  Once the situation was resolved, Secretary Kerry had the audacity to \nactually thank the Iranians, and Mr. Obama then released billions of \ndollars in sanctions to the Iranians.\n  This is yet another embarrassing episode of weakness and capitulation \nthat only serves to embolden our enemies and increase the likelihood of \nfurther conflict.\n  It is time that this administration set aside what I would \ncharacterize as disdain for our military and, instead, defend our \nservicemembers with the passion and respect that they have earned and \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/house-section/article/H587-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEMS\n\n  (Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. BONAMICI.

Oregon was well represented by the \nOregon director of Emergency Management and by representatives from the \nUniversity of Oregon and Intel.\n  The University of Oregon manages the USGS Pacific Northwest Seismic \nNetwork and assists local governments in preparing for disaster \nresilience.

Established in 1909 to curb the rampant discrimination \nplaguing our country, today's NAACP envisions an America not defined by \ncolor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to ask Congress to help make the \nNAACP's dream a reality. Let's restore the full protection of the \nVoting Rights Act, fix our broken criminal justice system, and end the \nschool-to-prison pipeline.\n  We must continue to move forward to ensure equality of opportunity \nfor all Americans, not just the privileged few.\n  During Black History Month, Mr. Speaker, and every month, let us \nrecommit ourselves to ending the journey and having a more just and \nperfect union.\n  Lastly, I salute the NAACP and its chairperson, Rosalyn Brock, and my \nColumbus chapter NAACP chair, Nana Jones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/house-section/article/H587-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT--CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE FOR \n                       HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Brooke was a victim of human \ntrafficking and child pornography at the age of 7. The nanny was \nselling Brooke on the marketplace of sex slavery in the United States. \nA small child sold for sex in the United States is shameful.\n  Brooke was scared, feeling alone, and didn't tell anyone about her \nplight. No one spoke about sex trafficking then. But sex slavery has \nbeen going on in the United States for a long time, women and children \nforced into this scourge.\n  Brooke, with the help of her mother, has spoken out against this \nevil.\n  Congress has also spoken out. Congress passed a law last year that \nwill change the way we address human trafficking in the United States.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will provide and ensure \nthat America provides grants to rescue and restore survivors like \nBrooke, grants to educate the public, law enforcement, doctors, and \neducators to identify, prevent, and prosecute human trafficking.\n  Monsters that hurt victims will be prosecuted, the sellers and the \nbuyers.
