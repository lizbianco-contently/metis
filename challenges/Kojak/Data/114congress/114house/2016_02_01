As he attacked the oil and gas industry, he departed thanks \nto fuel developed by the oil and gas industry.\n  The President should change course for limited government and \nexpanded freedom.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and the President, by his \nactions, should never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H377-10", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H377-H378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous materials on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2187, the Fair Investment \nOpportunities for Professional Experts Act.\n  I would like to thank Mr. Schweikert from Arizona for his diligent \nwork on this bill and members on both sides of the aisle who approved \nthis bill in the Financial Services Committee by an overwhelming vote \nof 54-2.\n  Mr. Speaker, small and emerging companies play a significant role as \ndrivers of the U.S. economic activity, innovation, and job creation. In \nfact, the majority of net jobs created in the U.S. are from companies \nless than 5 years old. Most of these companies are privately held \ncompanies, and their ability to raise capital in the private market is \ncritical to the economic well-being of the U.S. and millions of \nAmerican families.\n  But in order for small companies to raise capital in the private \nmarket, under SEC regulations they must sell securities only to what \nare known as ``accredited investors.'' And what exactly determines \nwhether an investor is accredited? Well, the SEC has for years \ndetermined that an individual investor's financial status should be the \nsole proxy for determining whether or not they are able to understand \nthe risks and rewards.\n  In other words, the SEC has taken the position that only very wealthy \nindividuals should be allowed to invest in such offerings. That really \nmakes very little sense.\n  Under the SEC's logic, a random winner of the Powerball lottery would \nbe automatically deemed a sophisticated investor. But an individual who \nholds advanced degrees and works in finance or a related field, but who \nhappens to make slightly below what the SEC's threshold is, that person \nwould be barred from investing in private offerings.\n  You see, despite the paternalistic view taken by Washington \nregulators, there are plenty--plenty--of hardworking and smart \nAmericans who are plenty capable of understanding investments in \nprivate businesses.\n  Congress must, therefore, amend the definition of ``accredited \ninvestor'' in order to expand the pool of potential investors in a \nprivate placement market.\n  H.R. 2187 will do just that by codifying the current accredited \ninvestor income and net worth thresholds, adjusted for inflation going \nforward. Additionally, it will extend accredited investor status to \npersons who the SEC determines have a demonstrable education or job \nexperience to qualify as having professional subject matter knowledge \nrelated to that investment.\n  In other words, the expansion of the accredited definition will \nenhance small companies' ability to raise capital and to grow by \nincreasing the pool of potential investors, while at the same time \nincrease investment opportunities for more Americans. In fact, allowing \nmore individuals to invest in both public and private companies could \nultimately have the effect of decreasing the risk in these portfolios \nthemselves.\n  Finally, as SEC Commissioner Mike Piwowar pointed out in a speech \nlast year:\n  ``By holding a diversified portfolio of assets, investors reap the \nbenefits of diversification, that is, the risk of the portfolio as a \nwhole is lower than the risk of any individual asset . . . if the \ncorrelations are low enough, the overall portfolio risk could actually \ndecrease.''\n  Mr. Speaker, what that means is H.R. 2187 has a double benefit of \naffording American businesses more opportunities to raise capital, \nwhile actually providing hardworking Americans a greater opportunity to \ncreate wealth for themselves and their families. I ask my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join me in supporting H.R. 2187.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.\n\n[[Page H379]]\n\nSchweikert) and the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) for their \nhard work on this bill. As was pointed out by Chairman Garrett, all the \nvotes in the committee were in support of the bill, except for two.\n  This legislation expands the definition of a ``accredited investor,'' \na status reserved for investors who possess the sophistication and \nfinancial means necessary to invest in private, unregistered securities \nofferings.\n  Many of these thresholds have not been updated, Mr. Speaker, since \n1982, and the committee determined it was past time to do so.\n  It is important to note that the SEC Investor Advisory Committee as \nwell issued bipartisan recommendations, which acknowledge that the \ncurrent income and net worth tests ``don't begin to measure the type or \nlevel of financial sophistication needed to evaluate the potential \nrisks and benefits of private offerings.''\n  We can all agree, and a vast majority of the members of the Financial \nServices Committee did agree, that an updated definition is long \noverdue. The authors of this legislation and the sponsors, Mr. \nSchweikert and Ms. Sinema, have worked to consider the risks of private \nofferings to ensure that investors in those offerings can understand \nand bear those risks.\n  With those comments, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), the sponsor of the underlying \nlegislation, and the gentleman who has put all the time and hard work \non this great bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I also thank \nmy friend, Mr. Carney.\n  This is one of those occasions where we actually get to show up here \nand have something that is bipartisan that we agree upon. But partially \nbecause being my piece of legislation, and something we have been \nworking on for a while, I would like to tell a quick story of where \nthis sort of came from conceptually.\n  About 4 years ago, we were doing a little townhall at that time \nbefore redistricting in Tempe, Arizona, and most of the discussion in \nthis townhall was a discussion about the haves and have nots, and why \ndo some people seem to be making wealth and others are not. We sort of \ntried to actually address it intellectually with some analysis of what \nare the barriers out there. You are a middle income, hardworking \nfamily, and you have some talents; what is your optionality to be able \nto grow into that next tier of assets, of wealth? This actually became \npart of that discussion, that we actually have had this barrier now for \ndecades that say we are going to judge you on your income and your \nwealth and that income and wealth is your threshold that says you get \nto invest in something over here, not your knowledge.\n  There was a gentleman in the audience who stood up and said: I have \ngot a story for you. I have a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. I work \nat the Intel plant in Chandler. I have some friends that started a \nbusiness a year or two ago. I am an expert. I have a Ph.D. in \nelectrical engineering and I worked with these guys for years. They \nstarted a business, and I am not allowed to invest in it because I \ndon't meet the income and assets threshold.\n  That is partially what we have accomplished here. The neat thing that \nhas gone back and forth in discussion with my Democrat friends and many \nof my friends on our side working the bill--it is not everything I \nwanted--but conceptually it is a terrific idea that income, your wealth \nis not the only prerequisite for your right to invest in something, \nthat it also can be your knowledge and your talent. If we really care \nabout everyone getting a fair chance at that American Dream, we need to \ndo more like this where you get judged by what you know, your \nexpertise, and not just the fact that you already have made it.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and Mr. Carney, my \ncolleague on the distinguished minority, for this bill. I also want to \nthank Mr. Schweikert for his work on developing H.R. 2187, Fair \nInvestment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act, which makes reg \nD offerings and private placements more effective by broadening the \ndefinition of an accredited investor to account for educational or \nprofessional expertise.\n  Because of significant costs and barriers to raising capital in the \nU.S. public markets, many of our small companies raise start-up funds \nor expansion funds in the private market, and many of those private \nmarket transactions are through accredited investors.\n  The current definition focuses only on financial status of the \ninvestor, and as a result, only wealthy individuals typically can \nparticipate in reg D offerings.\n  H.R. 2187 expands the accredited investor definition, recognizing \nthat the ability to participate is not based on an asset test, but on \ntheir sophistication and knowledge.\n  I have been in this business before I was in Congress on and off for \nthree decades, and I know that many of our Nation's accountants, stock \nbrokers, venture capitalists, and engineers have money management \nexperience or have a series 7 FINRA license, they work in money \nmanagement, they work in specific kinds of industries, but they are not \nable to invest in private placements due to the fact that they don't \nmeet this income or asset test.\n  Mr. Schweikert's bill revises these rules so that investment and \nfinance professionals who have this kind of level of professional \nsophistication are now treated as accredited investors, irrespective of \nwhether they meet an arbitrary test.\n  It is a matter, Mr. Speaker, of basic fairness. The government should \nnot limit investing options to only investors they deem worthy.\n  Expanding the accredited investor definition will not only increase \ninvestment opportunities for more Americans, but will help us grow \nthousands of small and emerging markets that struggle to raise capital.\n  I thank the gentleman from Arizona for all of his work on this \ncommonsense legislation. I enjoyed working with him on it.\n  I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to again thank \nMr. Carney, and especially the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) \nfor his work on this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2187, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include any extraneous material with regard to this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3784, the SEC Small Business Advocate Act.\n  I would like to thank the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney) and \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) of the Financial Services \nCommittee, as well as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw) and the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley) of the Appropriations Committee, \nfor working together in a bipartisan manner on this bill. In doing so, \nit has resulted in the Financial Services Committee's favorably \nreporting H.R. 3784 out of committee by a unanimous vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, the SEC has a three-part mission: to protect investors, \nto maintain fair and orderly and efficient markets, and to also \nfacilitate capital formation. Yet, if you think about it, the SEC has \nreally given a short shrift to the capital formation part of its \nstatutory mandate, and it is to the detriment of entrepreneurs and to \nthe startup ventures.\n  Although small companies are at the proverbial forefront of \ntechnological innovation and also of job creation, they often face \nsignificant obstacles in obtaining the necessary capital and funding. \nThese obstacles, if you will, are often attributable to the \nproportionally large burden that security regulations place on them. \nThey are often written for large public companies, and they are placed \nthen on small companies which then seek to go public.\n  By failing to fulfill this important part of its mandated mission, \nthe SEC is basically hurting the small companies. It is impeding \neconomic growth, and it is basically hindering job creation, which is \nso desperately needed in this country. When the SEC has failed to \nadvance its mission in facilitating capital formation, Congress has \nstepped into this vacuum, most notably through the enactment of the \nJOBS Act back in 2012. You see, while the JOBS Act has made it easier \nfor these companies to go public, the JOBS Act alone has not been \nenough. It has not been enough to entirely overcome all of the \nobstacles that the companies face in trying to go public.\n  So now we have H.R. 3784. It creates the SEC small business capital \nformation advocate, and he will provide an independent voice for small \nbusiness capital formation on par with the SEC's investor advocate. \nThis new advocate will support the interests of small businesses and \nprovide guidance to the SEC on advancing a post-JOBS Act capital \nformation agenda, something that, unfortunately, if you look at the \ntrack record, the SEC has failed to do for years. The small business \nadvocate will support the interests not only of entrepreneurs and of \njob creators, but they will do so also on behalf of investors.\n  Finally, it is clear that fundamental change is needed within the SEC \nin order to get this agency to focus on the capital formation mandate. \nH.R. 3784 will provide a permanent voice for small businesses at the \nSEC, and it will help them ensure that the SEC does not neglect, \nanymore, this important mandate in the future.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3784 in a bipartisan \nmanner, just as was done in committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I begin by thanking all of those who have worked with us to introduce \nand to improve this legislation. I especially want to thank my \ncolleague and friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley), who will speak in a minute, the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw), and all of our other cosponsors, \nas well as the SEC, for their work on this bill. Due to their help and \nthe bipartisan work on our committee, this legislation received a \nunanimous vote out of committee, as the gentleman from New Jersey \npointed out.\n  Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the cornerstones of our \ncommunities, and they are a major driver of American economic job \ngrowth. In fact, small businesses create over 60 percent of new jobs in \nthe United States, which is the main point here. If we want to help \nbusinesses create jobs, we need to help small businesses.\n  From one's employment to one's shopping needs, every American relies \non small business in some way or another. Given the crucial part they \nplay in our economy, ensuring their success just makes common sense. \nThat is what this bill is--just a commonsense, bipartisan bill to help \nsmall businesses across our great country.\n  Despite the important role that small businesses have in driving \neconomic growth and job creation, they can be underrepresented in \nconversations about regulations affecting them at every level of \ngovernment, and their\n\n[[Page H382]]\n\nconcerns are not always heard. This doesn't just harm small businesses. \nIt can also adversely impact investors and the public at large.\n  The SEC has done an admirable job in supporting and in advancing the \npriorities of small businesses. This bill, the SEC Small Business \nAdvocate Act, simply gives the SEC more tools to understand their needs \nand concerns. The SEC Small Business Advocate Act mirrors provisions \nfound in the Dodd-Frank bill, which created the current Office of the \nInvestor Advocate.\n  This advocate would open clear avenues of communication to SEC \nleadership on issues affecting small-business owners, investors, and \nstakeholders. It would also help continue the reforms and progress that \nCongress made in passing the JOBS Act, which the gentleman from New \nJersey mentioned, including with issues such as equity crowdfunding and \nideas for venture exchanges and changes to tick size, which the \ngentleman from Wisconsin and I have worked on over the past year.\n  With the resources provided in H.R. 3784, the SEC will have the \nability to pursue meaningful regulatory improvements that could \nsignificantly improve outcomes for small businesses and help them with \ntheir access to capital, which is needed to grow and create jobs.\n  I am very encouraged that the House has chosen to take up this \nbipartisan piece of legislation today and that we are moving forward to \nensure a voice for small business at the SEC.\n  Again, I thank the SEC for its help on this issue and a special \nthanks to my friend and colleague, Congressman Duffy.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, as the members of the Financial Services \nCommittee have, to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley).\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, given that small businesses have accounted \nfor over 60 percent of the net new jobs created since the end of the \nrecession, we should be doing more to simplify regulatory compliance so \nthat small businesses can direct their resources to what they do best: \ninnovating and growing our economy.\n  Small businesses and small business investors were not the cause of \nthe financial crisis and do not pose a significant risk to the rest of \nthe economy. Yet, regulators like the SEC, which oversee the financial \nmarkets, too often craft regulations by which the costs to small \nbusinesses far outweigh the minimal benefits they may have on our \neconomy. We need our regulators to take the concerns of small \nbusinesses seriously and to make small business growth a top priority.\n\n  That is why I was proud to coauthor the SEC Small Business Advocate \nAct, which will establish an Office of the Advocate for Small Business \nCapital Formation within the SEC. This office will open a clear avenue \nof communication to the SEC leadership on issues affecting small \nbusinesses by maintaining a designated representative to advocate on \ntheir needs.\n  This advocate will be responsible for helping small businesses \nresolve problems with the SEC, analyzing the potential impact of \nproposed rules and regulations on small businesses, and reaching out to \nsmall businesses to understand issues related to capital formation. In \naddition, this bill formalizes the Advisory Committee on Small and \nEmerging Companies, which provides members of the small business \ncommunity with another mechanism to communicate their concerns with the \nSEC. This legislation will not only improve the regulatory process for \nsmall-business owners, but also for the everyday investors and \nconsumers who depend on them.\n  This legislation has widespread support from representatives of the \nbusiness community, and it passed unanimously out of committee. I urge \nmy colleagues to empower small-business owners and entrepreneurs and \nsupport this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I close by again asking my colleagues to follow the example of the \nFinancial Services Committee and vote unanimously to support this bill, \nwhich will help small businesses to access capital and to get the \nadvice they need from the SEC.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Again, I commend the gentleman for his work on this legislation and \nfor the bipartisan nature of this and of most of the bills, actually, \nthat will be coming to the floor today that were passed out of \ncommittee in a bipartisan manner.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3784, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H382-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H382-H384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL FORMATION ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GARRETT.

ANNUAL REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT-BUSINESS FORUM ON CAPITAL \n                   FORMATION.\n\n       Section 503 of the Small Business Investment Incentive Act \n     of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 80c-1) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(e) The Commission shall--\n       ``(1) review the findings and recommendations of the forum; \n     and\n       ``(2) each time the forum submits a finding or \n     recommendation to the Commission, promptly issue a public \n     statement--\n       ``(A) assessing the finding or recommendation of the forum; \n     and\n       ``(B) disclosing the action, if any, the Commission intends \n     to take with respect to the finding or recommendation.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include any extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4168, the Small Business Capital Formation \nEnhancement Act.\n  I would like to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin) and the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Vargas) for their bipartisan work on \nthis bill. I go off script here just to say thank you very much to Mr. \nPoliquin, who has been a very active member on this committee from the \nvery beginning and has been very active in making sure this legislation \nhas come to the floor today. I thank the gentleman.\n  As I said before, this bill came out of committee, due much in part \nto the gentleman's work, with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. I \nbelieve it was 55-1; so the gentleman just has that one to work on for \nhis next piece of legislation that comes out of committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress created the SEC Government-Business Forum on \nSmall Business Capital Formation--to do what?--to provide a platform to \nidentify unnecessary impediments to small business capital formation \nand to find ways to eliminate or to reduce them. Each forum seeks to \ndevelop recommendations for government and private action to improve \nand provide the\n\n[[Page H383]]\n\nenvironment for small business capital formation, thereby providing \nsmall businesses the opportunity--to do what?--to grow economically \nand, most importantly, as we have been talking all day, to create more \njobs.\n  Unfortunately, the SEC's default position over these several years \nhas been to simultaneously and summarily ignore many of the \nrecommendations made by the various forum participants, which include \nsmall businesses, venture capitalists, trade association \nrepresentatives, accountants, academics, and other small business \nacademics.\n  Despite the claims of which we hear every year from the Commission \nabout the importance of this forum, it seems that the only time the SEC \nactually implements one of these capital formation agenda items that \ncomes out of it is when Congress tells it to do so. This was certainly \nthe case with several provisions of the JOBS Act, many of which, as one \nwill recall, were original recommendations from that very same forum. I \nwill give two examples. There was the crowdfunding and the Regulation \nA-Plus provisions of the JOBS Act. They basically mirrored the forum's \nrecommendations years earlier.\n  The Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act, which is before \nus today, provides an answer. It basically provides a simple solution \nto making the SEC more responsive. It requires the SEC to respond \npublicly and in writing to each forum recommendation and to simply \nexplain whether it plans to take action on that item or not.\n  It really shouldn't take an act of Congress for the SEC to fulfill \nits basic capital formation mission. Quite honestly, it shouldn't take \nan act of Congress for the SEC to simply respond in writing to any of \nthe forum recommendations. Unfortunately, this is the position we find \nourselves in today; so we have H.R. 4168, which is the gentleman from \nMaine's work, which will ensure that the SEC no longer ignores these \nrecommendations and will be able to help fulfill its statutory mission \nto facilitate capital formation in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to add my thanks and congratulations as well to the \ngentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin) and the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Vargas) for their bipartisan work on this bill. This legislation, \nas was pointed out, passed out of the Financial Services Committee with \nall but one vote.\n  The SEC's Government-Business Forum on Capital Formation brings \ntogether academics, government officials, legal experts, and business \nstakeholders to make recommendations to improve and facilitate small-\nbusiness capital formation.\n  By directly addressing the recommendations of the forum, the SEC will \nhelp refine ideas and provide future forums with opportunities to \naddress the SEC's views or concerns, ultimately leading to a more \nconstructive and valuable process.\n  This legislation will enhance the role of the forum and assist the \nSEC to focus on the capital needs of small businesses, which, as we \nhave discussed several times today, are the main drivers of job \ncreation in our economy, while simultaneously encouraging participants \nto substantively engage in the forum.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of \nlegislation and thank the sponsors for their hard work.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I have already given him compliments, as \nmany as I am going to give on the floor. I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin) because he has been \nan outstanding member of the committee and is the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Garrett for bringing this \nvery important bill to the floor. I also want to extend my \ncongratulations to Congressman Juan Vargas of California. He has done a \nterrific job being the lead cosponsor of the Small Business Capital \nFormation Enhancement Act.\n  All of us in this Chamber who also are small-business owners \nunderstand how important it is to have access to money, to funds, to \ncapital, in order for our businesses to be successful, to grow, and \nultimately to hire more people. This is true in Maine's Second District \nthat I represent and also across the country.\n  It is all about jobs. Unless your business grows and expands, then \nyou don't have jobs. So it is very, very important to have that key \ningredient to small-business growth, which is access to capital or to \nmoney.\n  Now, if you are one of the greatest papermakers in the world--and we \nhave a lot, Mr. Speaker, up in Maine's Second District--and you work \nfor a paper company up in Madawaska, Maine, or Madison, Maine, you \nstill depend on your company--it might not be a small company--to make \nsure you have access to the stock and bond markets, to be able to \nborrow the funds they need to expand and be successful, and to make \nsure we can secure your job.\n  Now, if you are a small-business owner, which really dominates the \nlandscape in Maine and across the country--let's say you are a \nboatbuilder in Ellsworth, Maine--you still need access to capital in \norder to grow. If you are a biotech startup company in Lewiston, Maine, \nthe same holds true.\n  You know, 80 percent of the new jobs created in our country today are \nnot large companies, but they are small companies. That is where the \nproblem lies as far as access to funding is concerned. I am not worried \nas much about the big companies having access to the capital markets, \nbut I do worry about our small businesses.\n  Now, as both Mr. Carney and Mr. Garrett have mentioned, during each \nof the past 35 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, by law, \nhas been required and has put together an annual government-business \nforum.\n  During this annual meeting, they get the most experienced \nprofessionals they can find--businessowners, SEC attorneys, private \nsector attorneys--to review the current laws we have on the books today \nto make sure they are not impeding our small businesses' ability to \nborrow money and have access to capital in other ways.\n  Now, these forums also are a tremendous incubator of coming up with \nnew ideas to make sure our laws evolve. Our capital markets, Mr. \nSpeaker, in our economy are very dynamic. Businesses grow and they \nchange, and new products are offered and sold.\n  So there are new needs for capital going forward. We have to make \nsure that the actual laws that are the underpinning of our capital \nmarkets, the underpinning of our economy, also evolve. So these annual \nbusiness-government forums are very important venues for this to \nhappen.\n  Now, as has been said here earlier, unfortunately, the SEC has no \nlegal requirement to make sure all the terrific recommendations that \ncome out of these annual forums are acted upon or not. In fact, it is \nvery common for the SEC not to comment at all on all of the work done \nto bring these new ideas to the forefront.\n  So my legislation, I am proud to say, comes up with a very \ncommonsense fix. It simply requires the SEC to make a public statement \non what it is going to do to embrace these recommended changes or not. \nIt is very simple. Otherwise, these ideas, Mr. Speaker, sit on the \nshelf.\n  Now, my bill also has the ancillary benefit of making sure that each \nnew forum each year doesn't repeat what we just did the year before. By \nhaving a benchmark every year, by addressing the recommendations that \ncome out of these meetings, then we are able to spring forward and move \ndown the path where we left off the year before.\n  I want to thank the Speaker and the chairman very much for bringing \nthis important bill to the floor. I am delighted to work with Mr. \nVargas on this. He has done one heck of a job.\n  It is so important for everybody in this Chamber to please stand up \nfor small businesses across the country, to make sure they have access \nto the money they need to grow, be successful, and hire more workers. \nIt is all about jobs.\n\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank and congratulate the sponsor and \ncosponsor again. I have no further requests for time.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H384]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, small businesses are critical to \njob creation and sustainable economic growth in America.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, 1.2 million workers--nearly half of \nour State's private workforce--is employed by a small business. When \none of the more than 500,000 small businesses in Minnesota contacts our \noffice, it is most often about how well-intended, yet short-sighted, \nregulations are inhibiting their ability to utilize the financial \nproducts they rely on.\n  In order to ensure the creation and growth of small business, it is \nimperative that we do our job in Washington to make certain they have \naccess to the capital they need.\n  Since 1980, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been required \nto conduct a government-business forum each year to present and discuss \nways to improve small business capital formation. However, the SEC is \nunder no legal obligation, as we have heard several times today, to \nrespond to any of the findings or recommendations that come out of \nthese forums.\n  That is why the Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act is \nso important. The proposed legislation will require the SEC to respond \nto the findings and recommendations made at these annual government-\nbusiness forums. This will ensure that the ideas formulated at these \ngovernment-business forums will be carefully considered at the SEC and \npossibly even implemented.\n  I want to thank Representatives Bruce Poliquin and Juan Vargas for \ntheir hard work on behalf of consumers and small business.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Small Business Capital Formation \nEnhancement Act.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4168.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H384-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H384-H387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TREATMENT OF CERTAIN MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. GARRETT.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nany extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2209. I will begin by thanking the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) for all of his hard work on this \nlegislation and his leadership as well, with pulling it through and \ngetting it done right here at the beginning of this legislative year, \nand being a leader on this bill as well.\n  On the other side of the aisle, I thank the gentlewoman from New York \n(Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for working together with Mr. Messer in a \nvery bipartisan manner, which, as we have noted, has been on each and \nevery one of the bills that we have presented today in that manner.\n  Their efforts culminated in the committee, favorably reporting this \nbill by a vote of 56 to 1. So, as I have said to Mr. Poliquin before, \nyou have only one Member to go to get unanimous consent going forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, given the problems posed by insufficient liquidity \nduring the past financial crisis, Federal regulators issued a final \nrule back in 2014 to implement something called liquidity coverage \nratio, or LCR. That was being done consistent with something called the \nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision's standards.\n  The LCR was established on the premise that banks should have enough \ncash or assets that would be liquid enough when they needed them--and \nthat would be defined as high-quality liquid assets, or HQLAs--and that \nwe would have to have them on hand for 30 days if their usual sources \nof short-term funding would simply disappear.\n  It goes without saying, when you think about this, that anytime that \nthe government steps in, or anytime you have a government agency \nfavoring this type of asset over this type of asset through some sort \nof regulation in which they did it, you are going to end up with what? \nYou are going to end up with basically unintended and undesirable \nconsequences. That is what has happened here.\n  Not surprisingly, critics of the LCR have complained that the stock \nof HQLAs is defined way too narrowly, which could adversely impact the \nasset classes that we are talking about.\n  So investment-grade municipal securities, on the other hand, if you \nlook at them closely--more than we could do right here on the floor \nright now--they basically share the same liquidity characteristics of \nother HQLAs. And that is what Mr. Messer basically is trying to address \nwith this great piece of legislation.\n  Other HQLAs, such as corporate bonds and equity securities, have the \nbasic same characteristic here as far as liquidity goes. Yet, the \nprudential regulators, what do they do? They put them in one pile and \nexcluded them from the final LCR.\n  While the Federal Reserve has acknowledged this problem and they \nacknowledge the fault in excluding municipal securities from this \ndefinition of HQLAs, the Federal Reserve's rule would only apply to the \nbank holding company's municipal securities and not the national banks, \nwhere more of these municipal securities are held.\n  Paul Kupiec, who is over at the American Enterprise Institute, in \ntestimony before our committee back in October of last year on the \nbill, said it ``is appropriate and consistent with the public interest. \nThere is no reason why high quality liquid bonds issued by the U.S. \nStates and municipalities should receive a lower standing than foreign\n\n[[Page H385]]\n\nsovereign debt with equivalent (or even lesser) credit quality and \nmarket liquidity.''\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Think about that for a minute. We are basically, under the current \nsituation, treating our municipalities and U.S. securities at a lower \nstandard than foreign such securities, and we know how they have \nprevailed in the last year or so.\n  With that in mind, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. \n2209, and the hard work of Mr. Messer, as well, in this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for \nyielding and for his leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today for H.R. 2209. In sum, \nthis bill levels the playing field for cities and States, saves cities \nand States hundreds of millions of dollars, and does it in a way that \nmaintains the safety and soundness of our banking system.\n  I would first like to thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), \nmy friend, for his leadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with him.\n  When we introduced this bill, we worked hard to have balanced, \nbipartisan support and to have broad support on both sides of the \naisle. We introduced it with a coalition of five Republicans and five \nDemocrats. On the Democratic side, we were joined by Mr. Capuano, Mr. \nCleaver, Ms. Moore, and Ms. Sewell of Alabama. From the Republican \nside, we had Mr. King of New York, Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Stivers, and Mr. \nHultgren.\n  This was truly a very strong, bipartisan bill. I would like to thank \nall of our colleagues who joined with us. It passed out of the \nCommittee on Financial Services by a strong vote of 56-1, which shows \nthat we had overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  The purpose of this bill is to level the playing field for cities and \nStates by requiring the banking regulators to treat certain municipal \nbonds as liquid assets, just like corporate bonds, stocks, and other \nassets.\n  As a former member of the City Council of New York, I know firsthand \nthe importance of municipal bonds. They allow our States and cities to \nfinance infrastructure, build schools, and pave roads. We have \nmultimillions in municipal bonds in New York that is building the \nSecond Avenue subway, revamping our water system, and helping in so \nmany ways.\n  Unfortunately, in the banking regulators' liquidity rule, which \nrequires banks to hold a minimum amount of liquid assets, they chose to \nallow corporate bonds to qualify as liquid assets but completely \nexcluded municipal bonds, even municipal bonds that are just as liquid \nas corporate bonds. Even worse, they treat foreign securities \ndifferently than U.S. securities, municipal bonds.\n  This absolutely makes no sense. It effectively discriminates against \nmunicipal bonds. A municipal bond that is just as liquid as the most \nliquid corporate bond would not be counted as a liquid asset under the \nrule just because it was issued by a city or State rather than a \ncorporate entity. This is not fair.\n  The Fed has already recognized this error. It is already amending its \nrule to allow certain municipal bonds to count as liquid assets. They \nshould be praised for taking a second look at the data and recognizing \nthat some municipal bonds are, in fact, highly liquid. But the OCC, \nwhich regulates national banks, is still refusing to amend its rule and \ninsists on favoring corporations over cities and States. Mr. Messer and \nI introduced this bill because this kind of arbitrary discrimination \nagainst cities and States cannot be allowed to continue.\n  A recent analysis by the investment bank Piper Jaffray estimated that \nour bill would lower borrowing costs for cities and States by 15 basis \npoints, which would save cities and States hundreds of millions of \ndollars per year. That real-world impact is why this bill is so very, \nvery important.\n  Now, it is important to note that this bill does not undermine safety \nand soundness. It does not require regulators to treat bonds that are \nilliquid as liquid. It simply says that municipal bonds should be \nafforded the same opportunity as corporate bonds.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr Speaker, I yield such additional time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this is an \nimportant bill. It will help the economy. It will help our cities and \nStates. It levels the playing field for cities and States. It saves our \ncities and States, literally, hundreds of millions of dollars, and it \nmaintains the safety and soundness of our banking system. That is why \nit had such a strong, overwhelming bipartisan vote in committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), the sponsor of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Mr. Carney, and Mrs. \nCarolyn B. Maloney of New York for their leadership on this bill.\n  What would you think if I told you that the Federal Government \nbureaucracy is favoring foreign bonds and corporate bonds over \nidentically valued U.S. municipal bonds? It wouldn't make any sense.\n  Our Federal bureaucracy shouldn't create rules that favor loans to \nforeign countries over loans to our own local governments and schools, \nyet that is exactly what is happening under our broken Federal \nregulatory scheme.\n  Today's bill, H.R. 2209, would correct this problem. I am proud to \nhave coauthored this bipartisan bill with Congresswoman Maloney. I also \nwant to thank my good friends--Mr. Poliquin, Mr. Pearce, the chairman, \nand others--who helped us in working on this bill. I ask my colleagues \nfor their support.\n  It is really just common sense. U.S. municipal bonds are among the \nsafest investments in the entire world. According to Municipal Market \nAnalytics, over the last 5 years--a period, by the way, during which \nState and local governments struggled to recover from the recession--\nhigh-quality State and local government obligation defaults were only \nfour one thousandths of 1 percent. Let me repeat that. The municipal \nbond default rate was four one thousandths of 1 percent during the \nrecession. That is a pretty safe investment.\n\n  Public entities depend on this financing, too. State and local \ngovernments, school corporations, and public utility companies across \nthe U.S. sell municipal bonds to finance the infrastructure and \nservices that we all depend on. It is low-interest municipal bonds that \nfinance new schools, hospitals, bridges, and roads, and pay for the \nrepair of outdated and failing infrastructure. The needs are great.\n  In fact, according to the Society of Civil Engineers, State and local \ngovernments need $3.6 trillion to meet their infrastructure needs over \nthe next 5 years. That is what is so disappointing about recent \nregulatory rules from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve that \nwill arbitrarily increase the costs for local governments and schools \nto borrow.\n  Specifically, as others have described, in 2014, Federal banking \nregulators issued a rule requiring banks to have enough high-quality \nliquid assets, HQLAs, to cover their cash outflows for 30 days in case \nof a future financial meltdown. For the most part, liquidity set-asides \nprotect the consumer, and they make sense.\n  The problem is, in the same rule, they said that investment-grade \nU.S. municipal bonds don't count as HQLAs, while recognizing German \nsubsovereign municipal debt and many corporate bonds as high-quality \nliquid assets that do qualify. That doesn't make any sense at all.\n  By excluding all American municipal securities from HQLA eligibility, \nfinancial institutions are discouraged from holding them. The result is \nincreased interest rates and increased borrowing costs for State and \nlocal governments and the taxpayers that pay them.\n  This has a real impact on families when schools can no longer \naccommodate enrollment and local communities\n\n[[Page H386]]\n\nwhen bridges crumble or roads fail because repair and new construction \nsimply isn't financially feasible. This is particularly troubling \nbecause times are tough and budgets are tight across America.\n  Although the Federal Reserve continues to review this issue, so far \nthe Fed's response has been partial and inadequate. The OCC and the \nFDIC have not addressed the issue at all. Meanwhile, our local \ngovernments remain strapped for cash and cannot wait for a bureaucratic \nsolution.\n  Our commonsense bill, H.R. 2209, fixes this arbitrary decision by \nFederal regulators. The bill directs the FDIC, the Federal Reserve \nSystem, and the OCC to classify investment-grade municipal securities \nas level 2A, high-quality liquid assets.\n  Put simply, our bill requires the Federal Government to recognize the \nobvious: America's municipal bonds are some of the safest investments \nin the world, and we shouldn't have rules that give preferential \ntreatment to corporate bonds or other countries' bonds over our own.\n  I want to thank Congresswoman Maloney for working with me on this \ncommonsense legislation.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.\n  For those who work in the bond world, this bill ensures that a 2A \nasset is treated as a 2A asset and prevents federal regulators from \narbitrarily under-valuing them.\n  Lastly, let me be clear, this bill doesn't give special treatment to \nour local governments bonds.\n  State and local governments remain required to satisfy their debts \nand live with their bond ratings.\n  This bill is, however, a comprehensive solution that restores \nfairness and recognizes investment grade municipal bonds for exactly \nwhat they are: safe, reliable investments that allow local governments \nto serve citizens and their families.\n  Once again, I want to thank Congresswoman Maloney for working with me \non this common sense legislation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I would \njust close by thanking the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for their work on \nthis commonsense piece of legislation that will help towns, \nmunicipalities, and States across our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I have two additional speakers.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. \nPoliquin).\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to salute the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Messer) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. \nMaloney) for the great work that they have done on this bill. It is \nvery important.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent Maine's Second District, which is the west, \ncentral, northern, and down east parts of our great State. Now, when \nyou drive in the State of Maine over some of our roads this winter, you \nsee frost heaves and potholes and everything else. If you go on some of \nour bridges by the coast, you see there has been a lot of corrosiveness \nthat has taken place on those bridges because they are so close to the \nsalt water.\n  Now, it is so important to make sure that our State and our local \ngovernments have the opportunity to borrow the money they need to \nperform these very important infrastructure repairs.\n  When I was State Treasurer up in Maine, we used this process to sell \nhigh-quality, liquid municipal bonds to investors around the world. \nThat would allow us to receive and secure the funding we need to, in \nfact, repair our roads and bridges. Maybe a small town needs to improve \nits sewage treatment facility or build a new landfill or improve its \nwater treatment facility. Well, these high-quality, liquid municipal \nbonds provide the funds to do just that.\n  It is my opinion that banking regulators have made a mistake, Mr. \nSpeaker, because they include in the liquidity coverage ratio stocks \nand corporate bonds and other government bonds, but they have left out \nhigh-quality liquid, tax-free municipal bonds from that list of \nsecurities that will qualify for the liquidity coverage ratio.\n  As has been mentioned here earlier before, sir, the municipal bond \nmarket in this country is a $3.7 trillion market. There are thousands \nof these bonds held in the hands of investors around the world. It is \nclearly right and appropriate for these bonds to be included in this \nlist of assets such that banks can reach their liquidity coverage \nratio.\n  In doing that, Mr. Speaker, and in fixing this problem that Mr. \nMesser and Congresswoman Maloney have found, in passing H.R. 2209, \nState and local governments across the country will continue to be able \nto have the funds they need to repair their own bridges and roads, not \njust those in Maine. This will keep interest payments down for our \nState and local governments, saving taxpayers millions of dollars.\n  One of the goals of government, of course, is to show fairness and \ncompassion for those that pay the bills, the taxpayers across America.\n  I am rising in support of this bill, H.R. 2209. I encourage all my \ncolleagues in the House, Republicans and Democrats, to please do the \nsame.\n  Again, I congratulate the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for their great \nwork.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Messer and Mrs. Maloney for \nproducing this balanced, bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  The State of New Mexico has a geographical area about the same as \nfive Northeastern States. That area, though, has 55 million people to \npay the taxes to build roads, to build infrastructure, and to build \nschools. In the equivalent geographical area, New Mexico has almost 2 \nmillion people to build all of those miles of roads.\n  Now, this is the effect of this legislation: it removes the financing \nmechanism that States like New Mexico use--those Western, lightly \npopulated areas--municipal bonds to fund things like schools and roads \nand infrastructure. Yet the committee that decided what category these \nassets would fall into said that they are no good and that they are not \ngoing to count in the liquidity requirement for institutions.\n  What that means is $3.7 trillion will evaporate out of that municipal \nbond market. That is $3.7 trillion that would help us build \ninfrastructure and help us create better living for everybody in the \nWest. Yet this committee, which never visited New Mexico, appears not \nto have looked at the quality of assets.\n  Mrs. Maloney, adequately, says it is not a question of safety and \nsoundness. Mr. Messer says that the default rate is four one-\nthousandths of 1 percent. They obviously did not look at the quality of \nthe products. They simply said they are not going to qualify.\n  What that means is that financial institutions will no longer have \nincentive nor space under liquidity requirements to hold municipal \nobligations such as bonds. This is detrimental to the way of life in \nthe West.\n  I would like to congratulate again Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Messer for \nbringing H.R. 2209 to us today to help be a partial cure to the \nproblems that people from other countries have levied on us. It seems \ncommon sense; it seems useful; it seems good for the taxpayer and good \nfor the country. Let's pass H.R. 2209.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, I want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle. I thank \nall the sponsors of not only this legislation, but all the legislation \nthat we have had on the floor for the last hour here.\n  I was just thinking as this was wrapping up about what we will see \nwhen we leave here and look in the newspaper tomorrow and see what sort \nof media coverage Washington will get as to what we did on our first \nday back.\n  There is always a hue and cry saying that Washington is broken, there \nis no bipartisanship, and they are not passing any legislation to \ncreate jobs and trying to get the economy going again. You hear about \nthat in the media all the time. As a matter of fact, you actually hear \nit on the floor, with many Members coming down here saying\n\n[[Page H387]]\n\nthat this House has not passed a single jobs creation bill in so many \ndays, weeks, months, and years, or what have you.\n  Well, let it be known today that we worked here in a bipartisan \nmanner, first in subcommittee, the full committee, and now here in the \nHouse. We have four pieces of legislation. I know that some of the \nlegislation may have mind-numbing terminology and you may scratch your \nhead when you are talking about the liquidity coverage ratios, the \ncredited investors, LCRs, and all those sort of things. You might say: \nWell, what does that have to do with the job creation? What does that \nhave to do with infrastructure creation? What does that have to do with \ngetting a new roof on my local school or a bridge built in my town? \nWhat does that have to do with helping my neighbor actually get a job \nwhen he has been out of work for a period of time? What does that have \nto do with somebody in my family who is in a job right now, but no \nopportunity for advancement and no pay raise for a long period of time? \nThese bills on the floor today have everything to do with all those \nissues.\n  As we pass these job creation bills in a bipartisan manner, let the \nword go out that we are doing exactly what the American public asked \nCongress to do: to work together, get it done, get the infrastructure \nin this country growing again, get the economy going again, and create \njobs again.\n  That is why it is important to say thank you again to both sides of \nthe aisle, and I encourage a ``yes'' vote on all four of these bills \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2209.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H387-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H387-H394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INTERNATIONAL MEGAN'S LAW TO PREVENT DEMAND FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, \n     sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New \n     Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from \n     her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had \n     been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.\n       (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104-\n     145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by \n     identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing \n     the means to monitor their activities.\n       (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child \n     Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to \n     protect children and the public at large by establishing a \n     comprehensive national system for the registration and \n     notification to the public and law enforcement officers of \n     convicted sex offenders.\n       (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex \n     offenders are traveling internationally.\n       (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child \n     sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The \n     International Labour Organization has estimated that \n     1,8000,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex \n     trafficking and pornography each year.\n       (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a \n     foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child \n     in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where \n     commercial, child sex trafficking.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous materials on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, child predators thrive on secrecy, a secrecy that allows \nthem to commit heinous crimes against the weakest and most vulnerable.\n  Today the House has under consideration H.R. 515, the International \nMegan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation and Other Sexual Crimes \nThrough Advanced Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders, a law that \nwill significantly thwart child sexual exploitation in the United \nStates and abroad through a comprehensive and efficient system that \nwarns law enforcement of traveling sex offenders.\n  Mr. Speaker, I first introduced International Megan's Law back in \n2008. It has passed the House three times--2010, 2014, 2015--and, \nthankfully, passed the United States Senate in December.\n  International Megan's Law honors the memory of Megan Kanka, a \nprecious little girl from my hometown of Hamilton who suffered and died \nat the hands of a sexual predator. Megan was just 7 years old when she \nwas kidnapped, raped, and brutally murdered in 1994. Her assailant \nlived across the street. Unbeknownst to her family and other residents \nin the neighborhood, he was a convicted repeat sex offender.\n  Due to the extraordinary work by Megan's courageous parents, Maureen \nand Richard Kanka, the New Jersey State Legislature passed and the \nGovernor signed the original Megan's Law in 1994 and expanded it in \n2001. It requires registration and public notification of convicted sex \noffenders living in the community.\n  Today all 50 States and all U.S. territories have a Megan's Law. \nBecause of this law, parents, guardians, universities, school \nofficials, sports coaches, law enforcement, and the public at large are \nnow empowered with the critical information they need to mitigate harm \nto children.\n  We know from law enforcement and media documentation that Americans \non the U.S. sex offender registries are caught sexually abusing \nchildren in Asia, Central and South America, Europe, and, frankly, \neverywhere.\n  A deeply disturbing 2010 report by the GAO found that at least 4,500 \nU.S. passports were issued to registered sex offenders in fiscal year \n2008 alone. Typically, Mr. Speaker, a passport is valid for 10 years, \nmeaning some or many of the tens of thousands of registered sex \noffenders possessing passports may be on the prowl internationally \nlooking to exploit and abuse.\n  Ernie Allen, who served for 30 years as the president and CEO of the \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children and the International Centre \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, recently said: ``It is clear that \nthere is a substantial category of offenders who do not offend as a \nlapse of judgment; they do it as a lifestyle. And these are the \noffenders who are most likely to travel to seek victims in places where \nthe offender is most likely to be anonymous and most likely to avoid \nidentification and apprehension.''\n  Studies suggest and demonstrate that even when caught, prosecuted, \nand jailed, for a number of predators, the propensity to recommit these \ncrimes at a later date remains. For example, a 2008 study by Oliver, \nWong, and Nicholaichuk showed that untreated sex offenders were \nreconvicted for sexual crimes at a rate of 17.7 percent after 3 years, \n24.5 percent after 5 years, and 32 percent after 10 years. Keep in \nmind, Mr. Speaker, that these are just the rates for those who were \ncaught again and then convicted.\n  Pedophiles and other sexual predators often harm more than one \nvictim. There are different studies that showed large numbers of child \nvictims and large numbers of acts committed against those children. For \nevery victim who reports, there are likely many others who could not, \nwould not, and cannot come forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, some of those exploited children are prostituted by \nhuman traffickers to pedophiles. The International Labour Organization \nhas estimated that 1.8 million children are victims of commercial \nsexual exploitation around the world each year.\n  It is imperative that we take the lessons learned on how to protect \nour children from known child sex predators within our borders and \nexpand those protections globally to prevent convicted U.S. sex \noffenders from harming children abroad. It is imperative that we teach \nother countries how to establish their own Megan's Law and push other \ncountries to warn us in the United States when their sex offenders are \ntraveling here.\n  Specifically, H.R. 515 will authorize and empower the Angel Watch \nCenter, operating under the auspices of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, to check flight manifests against sex offender registries \nand quickly warn destination countries when sex offenders are headed \ntheir way.\n  The Angel Watch Center is authorized to send actual information about \nchild sex offender travel to destination countries in a timely fashion \nfor those countries to assess the potential damage and dangers to their \nkids and to respond appropriately, whether it is to deny entry or visa, \nmonitor travel, or limit travel.\n  To prevent offenders from thwarting International Megan's Law \nnotification procedures by country hopping to an alternative \ndestination not previously disclosed, H.R. 515 includes provisions for \nthe State Department to develop a passport identifier or, as we put it \nin the bill, ``any visual designation affixed to a conspicuous location \non the passport indicating that the individual is a covered sex \noffender.'' A passport, Mr. Speaker, so identified provides law \nenforcement and Customs an additional tool to protect children.\n  The passport identifier is only for those who have been found guilty \nof a sex crime involving a child and have been deemed dangerous enough \nto be listed on a public sex offender registry. When this information \nis no longer public knowledge in the United States--in other words, \nthey are off the registry--the passport identifier, in like manner, \nwill no longer be required.\n  It is worth noting that some States already require sex offenders to \nhave their status listed on their driver's licenses--Alabama, Florida, \nDelaware, and Louisiana, to name a few. Ironically, it has been \nreported that some registered sex offenders have used their passports \nas an ID in order to keep their status secret.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. Speaker, in order to protect potential victims, H.R. 515 also \naims to establish a durable system of reciprocity among the nations of \nthe world. International Megan's Law directs the Secretary of State to \nseek agreements with other countries so that the U.S. is notified in \nadvance of incoming sex offenders.\n\n[[Page H391]]\n\n  I would like to offer my profound appreciation, Mr. Speaker, to \nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy for his deep and abiding commitment to \ncombating human trafficking in all of its ugly manifestations, for \nscheduling the House vote 12 months ago on International Megan's Law \nand another dozen or so anti-human trafficking measures sponsored by \nMembers from both sides of the aisle.\n  That was historic and had never been done like that before. So I \nthank him for that leadership and for working closely with the Senate \nin order to help bring this bill to fruition.\n  His policy adviser, Emily Murry, was remarkable, as was and is Kelly \nDixon.\n  I would like to thank our distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee, Ed Royce, and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their \nstrong support for this bill and for the assistance of Jessica Kelch, \nDoug Anderson, and Janice Kaguyutan.\n  Janice will remember. She traveled with one of my staffers years ago \ninvestigating this terrible issue, which is a global scourge.\n  Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee on \nthe Senate side, truly made this bill a priority and carried it over \nthe finish line in the Senate. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. \nChairman, for that.\n  His professional staff, Caleb McCarry and Counsel Sarah Ramig, showed \nremarkable dedication and persistence through multiple interagency \nnegotiations.\n  His chief of staff, Todd Womack, and legislative director, Rob \nStrayer, skillfully guided the bill through the process on the Senate \nside, and I can't thank them enough.\n  I also want to thank my good friend Ben Cardin--Ben and I serve and \nhave served for decades on the Helsinki Commission--for his support and \nfor his efforts.\n  I am grateful to Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Barbara Mikulski \nfor their assistance and driving better Angel Watch Center \ncollaboration with the U.S. Marshals Service's Sex Offender Targeting \nCenter.\n  USMS will be required to vet names sent out by the Angel Watch Center \nand share previously vetted names with the Center in order to maximize \nexpertise, avoid duplication of efforts, and ensure accuracy of \ninternational notifications.\n  I would note that Senator Shelby also championed the passport \nprovisions that will ensure sex offenders with crimes against children \ncannot end-run the system.\n  I would like to thank his professional staffer, Shannon Hines, who \nwas extraordinarily smart and creative during this process.\n  Thanks to professional staffer Jen Deci as well as Senator Mikulski's \nstaffer, Jennifer Eskra, for their tireless work as well.\n  Senator John Cornyn, majority leader, did not rest on his success \nearlier this year in navigating the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct through the Senate, but persisted until International Megan's Law \nwas complete over on the Senate side.\n  Last, but not least, I would like to thank my chief of staff, Mary \nNoonan, who has been tenacious in guiding this bill past obstacle after \nobstacle, and Allison Hollabaugh, who worked energetically, \neffectively, and expertly with the agencies and other interested \nparties to achieve the final bill.\n  I also would like to thank my former top Foreign Affairs Committee \nstaff member, Sheri Rickert, who spent countless hours over several \nyears negotiating with disparate parties trying to achieve passage of \nthe bill. Those efforts, Sheri, were not in vain.\n  I would like to thank the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren for their strong endorsement of the bill, the International \nCentre for Missing and Exploited Children, ECPAT-USA, and the Family \nResearch Council, for their input, counsel, and strong support.\n  I again first introduced this bill in 2008, alongside Megan Kanka's \nparents, Maureen and Richard Kanka. Maureen and Richard, Mr. Speaker, \nare heroic people. They have fought for decades to spare children and \ntheir families from horrific crimes that can and must be prevented.\n  While they still carry deep emotional and psychological scars, \nMaureen and Richard's selflessness, love of others, and vision have \nprotected countless children from harm.\n  Enactment of International Megan's Law will expand meaningful child \nprotection at home and around the world, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as \nmuch time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.\n  Let me first thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his \nleadership on human rights and anti-trafficking issues and for his hard \nwork on International Megan's Law.\n  I also want to thank the Judiciary Committee for its bipartisan input \non this bill. This legislation is the product of a lot of hard work and \nreflects a commitment to advancing practical and effective ways to help \nthose victimized by sexual predators.\n  This is hard to believe, but around the world today there are tens of \nmillions of victims of human trafficking, which is what we call modern-\nday slavery. Many of these victims are children exploited in \nprostitution.\n  In many countries, extreme poverty and gaps in law enforcement create \nzones of impunity where sex offenders exploit vulnerable children. \nSometimes local officials have no idea this is going on. Sometimes they \nturn a blind eye, and sometimes officials are even complicit in this \ncrime.\n  We have a responsibility to protect all victims and to crack down on \nthis crime that destabilizes communities, fuels corruption, and \nundermines the rule of law.\n  International Megan's Law aims to prevent child sex offenders and \ntraffickers from exploiting vulnerable children when they cross an \ninternational border.\n  This bill would establish an Angel Watch Center within ICE--\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement--and provide advance notice to \nforeign governments when a convicted child sex offender travels to \ntheir country.\n  This bill will hopefully prevent some of these horrific crimes from \ntaking place.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, fighting modern slavery requires a much more \ncomprehensive response. Beyond prevention, governments must do all they \ncan to protect victims: robust identification efforts; policies and \nprocedures that get victims out of harm's way; comprehensive support \nservices that include physical and mental health care; education \nopportunities; legal assistance; reintegration with family and \ncommunity; and, of course, aggressive investigations and prosecutions \nto go after those responsible for such heinous crimes.\n  The reality is, the sad reality, is that no single government or \nsingle law will put an end to human trafficking. But every step we take \nstrengthens our ability to prevent these crimes, protect victims, and \npunish those responsible.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 515.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from North Carolina, (Mr. Pittenger), a member of the \nFinancial Services Committee who has been very active in the fight \nagainst human trafficking.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Chairman Smith, thank you so much for your leadership \non behalf of these individuals.\n  Thank you, Chairman Royce, for your strong leadership as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, right now more than 20 million people worldwide are \ncaught up in modern-day slavery. We call it human trafficking.\n  This isn't just a problem over there. In the city I represent--\nCharlotte--Maria was trapped when she answered an ad for an aspiring \nactress. Rosa was snatched from a local gas station while waiting for a \nride.\n  My good friend, Antonia Childs, dreamed of owning a bakery before \nfalling victim to human trafficking. Thankfully, Antonia was rescued \nand now leads a vital Charlotte organization rescuing women, including \nMaria and Rosa.\n  As a Nation, we must take responsibility for our part in this \nhorrific, multi-billion-dollar illicit industry. As Members of \nCongress, we must take an active role in ending human trafficking \nworldwide.\n  That is why, on January 22, 2015, I became an original cosponsor in \nsupport\n\n[[Page H392]]\n\nof Chairman Smith's H.R. 515, the International Megan's Law to Prevent \nChild Exploitation.\n  H.R. 515 ensures foreign countries are notified when an American sex \noffender who has previously abused children is traveling to that \ncountry. It encourages foreign countries to provide us with the same \nvital information when a sex offender is traveling to America.\n  It attacks the sickening practice of child sex tourism by requiring \nthe United States to notify other countries when convicted pedophiles \ntravel abroad.\n  It encourages President Obama to use bilateral agreements and \nassistance to establish reciprocal notification so that we will know \nwhen convicted child offenders are coming here.\n  International Megan's Law takes valuable lessons we have learned \nabout protecting our children here in the United States and expands \nthose protections globally so all communities can join together to take \nthe necessary steps to protect our children.\n  Please join me in taking this important step to end modern slavery \ntoday.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have no further \nspeakers on our side. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the distinguished chairman of \nthe House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 515, the \nInternational Megan's Law, focused on preventing demand for child sex \ntrafficking.\n  I really want to acknowledge the hard work by the Member from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), his perseverance here as the bill's author, as he \nhas tried on several occasions to get this through the Senate and to \nthe President's desk. With this action today, this bill, when it passes \nthe floor, will go to the President's desk.\n  I think it is very important that we understand the magnitude of this \nproblem, as he has tried to convey to us here, and how this is going to \nstrengthen the hand of law enforcement.\n  We want law enforcement to consider this a new tool. It will combat \nthe appalling industry of child sex tourism, in which adults travel \noverseas to exploit children in other countries.\n  My chief of staff, Amy Porter, has gone on several humanitarian \nmissions to work with very young children in Cambodia and elsewhere in \nSouth Asia as well. As she shows you the photographs of these little \ngirls exploited and traumatized by this predatory activity, it is hard \nto fathom that men from around the world, including America, including \nour country, engage in this predatory activity.\n  While the countries they travel to lack the resources needed to deal \nwith this rising number of child predators, this legislation is going \nto help us offset that.\n  One of the most discouraging things that my chief of staff, Amy, \nfound was that, in Cambodia, it was the local police chief who himself \nwas involved in the practice.\n  Now, upon her return to again check on this, she found that they had \nput an end to that. He was no longer in this trade, in this type of \nbusiness. It had been cleaned up some with pressure from the United \nStates, but it is still ongoing. So this will help us fight back.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of New York). The time of the \ngentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield the gentleman 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROYCE. At present, multiple U.S. Government agencies are working \nto combat human trafficking and child sex tourism, but there has been a \ntroubling lack of coordination and information sharing and \nnotifications to foreign countries that a potential sexual criminal is \nheading their way, and those notifications are very inconsistent.\n  This bill clarifies the responsibility, puts it on the Justice \nDepartment and the Department of Homeland Security. It better \ncoordinates those efforts. And, importantly, by proactively helping \nother countries to identify those incoming child predators, we will \nencourage them to alert us when foreigners convicted of sex offenses \nagainst children attempt to enter into the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  So I commend Chairman Smith for his work on this bipartisan \nlegislation, and I encourage all Members to support its passage. It \nwill be on the President's desk here after our action this evening.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute \nto the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).\n  Mrs. WAGNER. I thank the gentlemen for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 515, the \nInternational Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking.\n  I would like to thank, like so many have, Congressman Chris Smith for \nintroducing this important legislation to protect innocent children \nfrom the evils of sexual predators in the United States and worldwide.\n  As a mother who raised three beautiful children, I can tell you that \nthe constant concern for their safety and protection never goes away. \nWhen they were young, I worried if they were safe at the playground \ndown the street, if they were safe at the shopping mall or movie \ntheater.\n  Named after a young girl who was kidnapped, raped, and murdered at \njust 7 years old by her neighbor, Megan's Law and public knowledge of \npredators in our communities have been critical tools in protecting our \nchildren and easing some of the many fears that parents feel every \nsingle day.\n  I cannot fathom the anger and anguish felt by Megan's parents and all \nparents whose children fall prey to such sick predators. I would do \nanything to protect my children and all children from sexual predators, \nand I feel blessed that I and my colleagues are in a position where we \ncan make a difference.\n  We will be able to better identify and scrutinize sex offenders' \nactivity, ensuring that they do not engage in the ghastly practice of \nsex tourism either in our own neighborhood or any neighborhood around \nthe world.\n  The U.S. must take a leading role as a global defender of children \nfrom sexual abuse. Often planning their trips around locations where \nthe most vulnerable children can be found, sex offenders should not be \nallowed to use the anonymity provided by foreign travel to help hide \ntheir hideous crimes.\n  A 2010 Government Accountability Office report showed that in a \nsingle year, at least 4,500 registered sex offenders received U.S. \npassports to travel internationally. This is absolutely unacceptable, \nMr. Speaker.\n  During my time as a United States ambassador, I was exposed firsthand \nto the horrors of sexual abuse and human trafficking on the \ninternational level.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield the \ngentlewoman from Missouri an additional 1 minute.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, as elected Members of Congress, we must \nstand up for the powerless, and we must provide a voice for the \nvoiceless. Today we are doing just that.\n  Passing the International Megan's Law, which will provide advance \nnotice of foreign travel by registered sex offenders, is critical. We \nowe it to the innocent angels like Megan to take these crimes out of \nthe shadows and do everything we can to prevent future crime both in \nthe United States and across the globe.\n  Today I will vote to pass the International Megan's Law, and I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in providing protection for \npotential victims worldwide and greater peace of mind for those who \nlove them.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say this is a bipartisan bill. It will \nsave children's lives. It will prevent other crimes to victims like \nMegan Kanka from happening not just in the United States but around the \nworld.\n  I think my good friend, Ann Wagner, said a moment ago that Megan is \nan angel. Her parents are guardian angels. They have taken a pain, an \nagony, and a trauma that is incomprehensible and have worked tirelessly \nto get Megan's\n\n[[Page H393]]\n\nLaw enacted throughout the United States and in some other countries. \nThis will take it to the next level and will establish that true \nreciprocal reciprocity regimen, whereby we notice, they notice, \neverybody knows what is going on to take the secrecy out of this travel \nwhen a convicted pedophile hops on a plane with the idea of exploiting \nchildren.\n  This will have a very measurable impact and will protect children \nfrom this kind of agony.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, to conclude, I \nsecond the comments that were made by Mr. Smith. I congratulate the \nfamily of Megan Kanka. Being a father myself of a 2-year-old daughter, \nI can't imagine losing a little girl, especially in the heinous way \nthat they did.\n  I remember very much when all of that happened. Hamilton, New Jersey, \nis only about 40 minutes up the road from where I live in Philadelphia, \nand I remember the ugly incident very well. The fact that here we are, \nso many years later, and the family still continues to fight for other \nlittle girls and little boys is really remarkable and is a testament to \nthem.\n  I also congratulate the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who I \nknow has worked tirelessly on this bill for a long period of time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 515, \nInternational Megan's Law. While I support the underlying goal of \nensuring that American law enforcement agencies share information on \npotential child sex offenders with foreign law enforcement agencies, I \nam opposed to how one particular provision, added in the Senate \namendment before us today, would work in practice.\n  Other existing provisions of the bill already contain the following \ninformation-sharing requirements with and among law enforcement \nagencies here in the United States and abroad:\n  U.S. sex offenders are required to provide international travel-\nrelated information to the sex offender registries;\n  the Department of Homeland Security is required to create the Angel \nWatch Center to receive information on individuals seeking to enter the \nU.S. who have committed offenses of a sexual nature as well as \nregistered sex offenders seeking to travel outside the U.S. in order to \nshare all relevant information to federal, state, and local law \nenforcement officials;\n  the U.S. Marshal's Service is required to notify law enforcement \nagencies of sex offenders seeking to leave the United States who have \nnot transmitted their travel information to sex offender registries;\n  the U.S. Marshal's Service is required to notify the international \ndestination country of a sex offender's upcoming travel; and\n  the Secretary of State should seek reciprocal international \nagreements or arrangements to further these goals.\n  If our goal is to ensure that customs and border as well as law \nenforcement officials are notified so that they may track and \ninvestigate those sex offenders who may be engaging in sex tourism or \npose a threat of absconding, these provisions have addressed those \nconcerns.\n  As a result, I am skeptical of what more we stand to gain by the \nSenate amendment's provision authorizing the Secretary of State to use \na ``unique passport identifier for covered sex offenders'' that is \ndefined as ``any visual designation affixed to a conspicuous location \non the passport indicating the individual is a covered sex offender.'' \nAt best, if this vague language is meant to describe some sort of code \nor symbol embedded in the passport that is only discernible by law \nenforcement at the border indicating that the traveler is a sex \noffender, it is redundant given the other information-sharing mandated \nby the bill's other provisions. However, if this is interpreted to mean \nsomething akin to the words ``sex offender'' stamped on the \nidentification page of the passport, this raises serious problems and \nwill lead to unintended consequences.\n  First, it is simply bad policy to single out one category of offenses \nfor this type of treatment. We do not subject those who murder, who \ndefraud the government or our fellow citizens of millions and billions, \nor who commit acts of terrorism to these restrictions.\n  Second, by treating all sexual offenders as one monolithic group \nignores reality. While some pose a continued and real risk of \nreoffending and may be traveling to engage in sex tourism or other \nillicit acts, not all pose the same risk. Indeed, the failure of this \nprovision to allow for the individualized consideration of the facts \nand circumstances surrounding the traveler's criminal history, \nincluding how much time has elapsed since his last offense, underscores \nhow this provision is overbroad. Details such as whether the traveler \nis a serial child rapist versus someone with a decades-old conviction \nfrom when he was 19-years-old and his girlfriend was 14, just missing \nthe Romeo and Juliet exception by one year, are significant and would \nallow law enforcement to more appropriately prioritize their finite \nresources.\n  Third, a traveler does not have any recourse with the foreign \ndestination country if he or she is refused entry solely on the basis \nof this ``unique passport identifier.'' While the bill has some due \nprocess provisions, those apply only domestically. There is no recourse \nif a traveler is erroneously denied entry from the destination country.\n  Fourth, if the ``unique passport identifier'' is implemented in a way \nthat makes it obvious to not only law enforcement officials but any \nmember of the general public viewing the passport, this could lead to \nunintended consequences of persecution and harm to the traveler. This \nis especially troubling given that no factual context about the offense \nis provided.\n  If our goal is to ensure that domestic and foreign law enforcement \nand customs officials are notified of potential threats, multiple \nexisting provisions of the bill already achieve that goal without \nraising these problematic implementation and fairness concerns.\n  In summary, while I support the underlying goal of ensuring that \nAmerican law enforcement agencies share information on potential child \nsex offenders with foreign law enforcement agencies, I have grave \nconcerns about how the redundant and problematic provision regarding \nthe ``unique passport identifier'', added as a Senate amendment, would \nwork in practice. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nunderlying bill.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 515 \nbecause it seeks to protect our children from predators by identifying \nthe whereabouts of sex offenders and providing means to monitor their \nactivities.\n  This legislation is important because sex trafficking of children is \na displaceable act that we detest and has been an on-going concern for \nthe United States.\n  In addition to protecting our children from national threats, we must \nalso consider the potential threat from international actors, \nespecially during times of increased tourism, like for example the \nSuper Bowl, FIFA World Cup, World Olympics and other major events \naround the world where tourism is high.\n  This legislation by my friend Representative Smith aims to protect \nour children from exploitation, specifically sex trafficking in \ntourism, by providing advance notice of intended travel by registered \nchild-sex offenders outside of the United States to the government of \nthe destination country.\n  This legislation is important because it requests that foreign \ngovernments notify the United States when a known child-sex offender is \nseeking to enter the United States.\n  International child exploitation is increasingly becoming a top \npriority for all nations and certainly is for our country.\n  For instance, two years ago, during the FIFA World Cup in Brazil, \nreports of child exploitation received global attention.\n  According to the Department of State, Brazil is a destination country \nfor children subjected to sex trafficking.\n  For the case of Brazil, child sex tourists typically arrive from \nEurope and North America.\n  According to reports, the Rio de Janeiro civil police identified \neight hotels and restaurants involved in a child sexual exploitation \nnetwork in two city areas.\n  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as you know, is where the World Olympics will \nbe hosted this summer.\n  According to the Huffington Post, major sporting event usually lead \nto a spike in the demand for sexual predatory activities.\n  Unfortunately, these accounts of sexual predatory activity include \nchild sex trafficking.\n  Here at home, during the 2014 Super Bowl week, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, along with 50 law enforcement agencies, recovered 16 \nteenagers during an enforcement action on child sex trafficking.\n  Additionally, more than 45 pimps were arrested, some of whom claimed \nto travel to the Super Bowl location specifically for the purpose of \nprostituting women and children at the sporting event.\n  According to Judy Kluger, Director of Sanctuary for Families, and \nformer judge for New York City Criminal Court of New York County, New \nYork, ``the Super Bowl could never not be breeding grounds for sexual \nexploitation.''\n  If a location experiences an exponential increase in large numbers of \nmen travelling for entertainment, it will proportionally see an \nincrease in those who purchase sex.\n  As you all know, I am committed to ensuring the protection of \nchildren, always championing the protection of children.\n  As co-chair of the Children's Caucus, I commend the work of all my \ncolleagues here in Congress, dedicated to protecting children here in \nthe U.S. and across the globe.\n\n[[Page H394]]\n\n  This is why I support this legislation and I commend Representative \nSmith for championing legislative measures dedicated to the safety and \nprotection of our children worldwide.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules \nand concur in the Senate amendments to the bill, H.R. 515.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendments were concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H394-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H394-H395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRAFFICKING PREVENTION IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CONTRACTING ACT\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(H.R. 400) to require the Secretary of State and the Administrator of \nthe United States Agency for International Development to submit \nreports on definitions of placement and recruitment fees for purposes \nof enabling compliance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n2000, and for other purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 400\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This bill may be referred to as the ``Trafficking \n     Prevention in Foreign Affairs Contracting Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Department of State and the United States Agency \n     for International Development (USAID) rely on contractors to \n     provide various services in foreign countries such as \n     construction, security, and facilities maintenance.\n       (2) In certain cases, such as where the employment of local \n     labor is impractical or poses security risks, Department of \n     State and USAID contractors sometimes employ foreign workers \n     who are citizens neither of the United States nor of the host \n     country and are recruited from developing countries where low \n     wages and recruitment methods often make them vulnerable to a \n     variety of trafficking-related abuses.\n       (3) A January 2011 report of the Office of the Inspector \n     General for the Department of State, while it found no \n     evidence of direct coercion by contractors, found that a \n     significant majority of their foreign workers in certain \n     Middle East countries reported paying substantial fees to \n     recruiters that, according to the Inspector General, \n     ``effectively resulted in debt bondage at their \n     destinations''. Approximately one-half of the workers were \n     charged recruitment fees equaling more than six months' \n     salary. More than a quarter of the workers reported fees \n     greater than one year's salary and, in some of those cases, \n     fees that could not be paid off in two years, the standard \n     length of a contract.\n       (4) A November 2014 report of the United States Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO-15-102) found that the Department \n     of State, USAID, and the Defense Department need to \n     strengthen their oversight of contractors' use of foreign \n     workers in high-risk environments in order to better protect \n     against trafficking in persons.\n       (5) The GAO report recommended that those agencies should \n     develop more precise definitions of recruitment fees, and \n     that they should better ensure that contracting officials \n     include prevention of trafficking in persons in contract \n     monitoring plans and processes, especially in areas where the \n     risk of trafficking in persons is high.\n       (6) Of the three agencies addressed in the GAO report, only \n     the Department of Defense expressly concurred with GAO's \n     definitional recommendation and committed to defining \n     recruitment fees and to incorporating that definition in its \n     acquisition regulations as necessary.\n       (7) In formal comments to GAO, the Department of State \n     stated that it forbids the charging of any recruitment fees \n     by contractors, and both the Department of State and USAID \n     noted a proposed Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rule \n     that prohibits charging any recruitment fees to employees.\n       (8) However, according to GAO, neither the Department of \n     State nor USAID specifically defines what constitutes a \n     prohibited recruitment fee: ``Contracting officers and agency \n     officials with monitoring responsibilities currently rely on \n     policy and guidance regarding recruitment fees that are \n     ambiguous. Without an explicit definition of the components \n     of recruitment fees, prohibited fees may be renamed and \n     passed on to foreign workers, increasing the risk of debt \n     bondage and other conditions that contribute to \n     trafficking.''.\n       (9) GAO found that, although Department of State and USAID \n     guidance requires their respective contracting officials to \n     monitor compliance with trafficking in persons requirements, \n     they did not consistently have specific processes in place to \n     do so in all of the contracts that GAO sampled.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTS ON DEFINITION OF PLACEMENT AND RECRUITMENT \n                   FEES AND ENHANCEMENT OF CONTRACT MONITORING TO \n                   PREVENT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS.\n\n       (a) Department of State Report.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     State shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress \n     a report that includes the matters described in subsection \n     (c) with respect to the Department of State.\n       (b) USAID Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development (USAID) shall \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report \n     that includes the matters described in subsection (c) with \n     respect to USAID.\n       (c) Matters To Be Included.--The matters described in this \n     subsection are the following:\n       (1) A proposed definition of placement and recruitment fees \n     for purposes of complying with section 106(g)(iv)(IV) of the \n     Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. \n     7104(g)(iv)(IV)), including a description of what fee \n     components and amounts are prohibited or are permissible for \n     contractors or their agents to charge workers under such \n     section.\n       (2) An explanation of how the definition described in \n     paragraph (1) will be incorporated into grants, contracts, \n     cooperative agreements, and contracting practices, so as to \n     apply to the actions of grantees, subgrantees, contractors, \n     subcontractors, labor recruiters, brokers, or other agents, \n     as specified in section 106(g) of the Trafficking Victims \n     Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).\n       (3) A description of actions taken during the 180-day \n     period preceding the date of submission of the report and \n     planned to be taken during the one-year period following the \n     date of submission of the report to better ensure that \n     officials responsible for grants, contracts, and cooperative \n     agreements and contracting practices include the prevention \n     of trafficking in persons in plans and processes to monitor \n     such grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements and \n     contracting practices.\n       (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress.--In this section, \n     the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``trafficking in persons'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 103(9) of the Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(9)).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan \nF. Boyle) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, my coauthor on this bill is the ranking member, Eliot \nEngel of New York, and I wanted to thank him as well and our 27 \nbipartisan cosponsors for their support. This is the Trafficking \nPrevention in Foreign Affairs Contracting Act.\n  As many of our colleagues are aware, we just observed Human \nTrafficking Awareness Month, shining a spotlight on what is now tens of \nmillions of victims every year of what is modern-day slavery. One of \nthe goals here was increasing the awareness of these crimes against \nhuman dignity.\n  The scourge of human trafficking now is a worldwide challenge. \nAlthough the vulnerability may be greatest in the developing world, \nthese crimes also occur here in our own communities.\n  I am very proud of the work being done in southern California by \nmembers of our Human Trafficking Congressional Advisory Committee where \nadvocates, law enforcement, service providers, faith-based groups, and \ntrafficking survivors themselves meet regularly to converse, \ncoordinate, and plan how to combat human trafficking. Out of that \nworking group come a lot of good ideas. I want to acknowledge Sara \nCatalan who helps me in leading that task force.\n  This bill is intended to close a gap that exists in protection. The \nUnited States cannot be too careful in ensuring that our overseas \nemployment\n\n[[Page H395]]\n\npractices do not inadvertently support debt bondage, because that debt \nbondage is one of the tools of human traffickers.\n  At some overseas posts, the State Department and USAID rely on \ncontractors to provide construction, security, maintenance, and other \nservices, and these contractors sometimes employ foreign workers \nrecruited from far away, far-away developing countries where they are \nvulnerable to abuses. In particular, the middlemen those contractors \nrely on often charge recruitment fees to prospective employees--in \nother words, payments for the right to work.\n  Current law prohibits U.S. contractors from charging foreign workers \nunreasonable recruitment fees, and the State Department claims to \nprohibit any recruitment fees at all. However, neither State nor USAID \nhave defined what constitutes a ``recruitment fee,'' and this ambiguity \nallows for a loophole that has been exploited. Recruiters simply rename \nthese fees and continue charging them.\n  This is a serious problem. We had a report by the State Department \nInspector General in 2011. He found that a majority of the Department's \nforeign contract workers in certain Middle East countries were paying \nsubstantial fees to recruiters--and this is what caught our attention--\nsometimes more than a year's salary resulting in, in the words of our \nInspector General--in his words--``effective debt bondage.''\n  A worker from the Philippines performing janitorial services for our \nEmbassy in Saudi Arabia should not be at risk of shakedowns from \nunscrupulous or violent operators.\n  To ensure that our overseas contracting does not feed such problems, \nthis bill requires State and USAID to define what prohibited \n``recruitment fees'' are and to report to Congress on their plans to \nimprove contract monitoring, to protect against human trafficking. A \nprohibition is only forceful if people understand what is prohibited. \nClarifying these matters will give our contractors the guidance they \nneed to ensure that our laws and policies are followed by those they \nuse to recruit foreign workers.\n  I again want to thank Mr. Engel and all of our cosponsors for their \nsupport of this strongly bipartisan bill which deserves our unanimous \nsupport.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and also Ranking Member \nEngel for their leadership and for their hard work on this bill.\n  It seems that every day we see another report about the way modern \nslavery touches our lives. Fish caught by an enslaved sailor in \nSoutheast Asia ends up in our grocery stores. Rare metals that are \nneeded to power our smartphones are mined through forced labor in \nCentral Africa. Oranges and tomatoes grown right here in the United \nStates are picked by migrants who end up trapped and isolated.\n  Human trafficking is a crime that affects every nation on Earth. It \nundermines stability, fuels criminal networks, and robs tens of \nmillions of people of their basic freedom. It touches all of our lives.\n  United States Government has long been a leader in the fight against \ntrafficking. Republican and Democratic administrations alike have \nfocused hard on the best way to prevent modern slavery, protect its \nvictims, and prosecute those responsible. The State Department's Annual \nTrafficking in Persons Report is the global gold standard for assessing \nhow well governments are doing to combat this problem.\n  As we learn more and more about this crime, how it has worked its way \ninto the global supply chain and labor market, we find new ways of \ndisrupting trafficking networks. Part of American leadership on this \nissue must be to make sure, first and foremost, that we are not making \nthis problem worse.\n  Our foreign affairs agencies employ thousands of foreign contract \nworkers overseas. These men and women work in construction, food \nservice, and security projects abroad.\n  In 2011, inspectors interviewing some of these workers found that 77 \npercent of them had paid recruiting fees to the company arranging the \nwork. What that means is before workers are able to get these jobs, \nthey need to pay a recruiter a hefty sum. Sometimes these fees are 6 \nmonths' or even a year's wages. These fees can include the high costs \nof housing or transportation to a worksite in a foreign country. So \noften, a worker arrives at a new job saddled with debt and is forced to \nwork until he or she can pay the so-called recruiter back.\n  This sort of treatment is unacceptable under any circumstances. The \nfact that this is happening to individuals working for the United \nStates Government is absolutely intolerable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H395-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H395-H396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  We cannot be the world's leader in the fight against modern slavery \nif taxpayer dollars are flowing into the hands of traffickers.\n  The Obama administration saw this problem and took steps to deal with \nit. An executive order forbids any U.S. Government contractors from \ncharging unreasonable recruitment fees. But so far the State Department \nand USAID have been unable to enforce this requirement. The reason \nwhy--neither agency has defined recruitment fees, so their guidelines \nfor fair treatment of workers by contractors are unenforceable.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is simply not acceptable. This bill requires that \nthe State Department and USAID adopt a legally binding definition of \nrecruitment fees. In addition, the agencies must improve how they \nmonitor contractors to detect and prevent human trafficking.\n  This legislation represents a commonsense step to resolve this \nproblem and to make sure we have a clean House as we lead global \nantitrafficking efforts. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \nOrganizations, and he is the author of the original Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend \nand colleague, the distinguished chairman, Ed Royce, for his \npersistence and creativity in finding new ways to hold the \nadministration accountable for preventing human trafficking, especially \nin government contracting, as is required by the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the National Defense \nAuthorization Act of 2013.\n  It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that U.S. Government procurement should \nbe the quintessential example of how to buy goods and services from \nreputable vendors. The TVPA ensures that contracts are lost if there is \ncomplicity in trafficking and that responsible parties are prosecuted \nif they, in like manner, are complicit in human trafficking.\n  H.R. 400 targets a key piece of the law for practical implementation \nand brings our government one step closer to ensuring that U.S. tax \ndollars are not going to companies that look askance at human \ntrafficking by their contractors and subcontractors.\n  Again, this is a very important bill. I want to thank the \ndistinguished chairman for his leadership on this.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  In closing, I would simply congratulate the gentleman who does a \nwonderful job chairing our Foreign Affairs Committee. As I said on a \nradio show in Philadelphia last week, I really wish those who say that \nthere is no bipartisanship in Washington, D.C., could see the way the \nranking member, Mr. Engel, and our chairman, Mr. Royce, conduct our \nforeign affairs business. I think they would have a different view.\n  I am proud to support this piece of legislation, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to do so.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank Mr. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania for his work on \nthis.\n  On the heels of Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I think it is \nimportant that we as an institution take this\n\n[[Page H396]]\n\nopportunity to ensure that our own overseas contracting does not \nindirectly support debt bondage, and that is what this legislation \nensures. Our practices need to reflect our Nation's fundamental \ncommitments to freedom and human dignity, and, most importantly as \nwell, we need to set an example for the rest of the world. I think by \npassing this legislation we will do so.\n  I again want to thank my coauthor, Mr. Engel, and all of our \nbipartisan cosponsors for their support of this bill. It really \ndeserves our unanimous support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 400, \nthe Trafficking Prevention In Foreign Affairs Contracting Act.\n  I support this legislation because it enforces the implementation of \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.\n  H.R. 400 requires the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) to submit \nreports on definitions of placement and recruitment fees for purposes \nof enabling compliance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n2000.\n  Indeed, the office of the Inspector General reported that a \nsignificant majority of the Department of State's foreign workers in \ncertain Middle Eastern countries paid substantial fees to recruiters.\n  According to the Inspector General, ``approximately one-half of the \nworkers were charged recruitment fees equaling more than six months' \nsalary.''\n  Moreover, ``more than a quarter of the workers reported fees greater \nthan one year's salary and . . . fees that could not be paid off in two \nyears.''\n  The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that \nUSAID, the Department of State (DOS), and the Defense Department (DOD) \nshould enhance and strengthen their oversight of contractors in order \nto better protect against trafficking in persons.\n  The agencies should develop more precise definitions of recruitment \nfees, and have stronger implementation strategies towards contracting \nofficials in areas where the risk of trafficking in persons is high.\n  Indeed, out of the three agencies previously addressed, only the DOD \ncommitted to definitional recruitment fees and concurred with the \nUnited States GAO's definitional recommendation.\n  A proposed Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rule that prohibits \ncharging any recruitment fees to employees was noted by both the \nDepartment of State and USAID.\n  However, both the Department of State and USAID lacked an explicit \ndefinition for what constitutes a prohibited recruitment fee.\n  Without an explicit definition of the components of recruitment fees, \nthe risk of debt bondages increase, prohibited fees are more likely to \nbe renamed and passed, and other conditions that contribute to \ntrafficking are more likely to occur.\n  I support this legislation because no later than 180 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, both the Secretary of State and the \nAdministrator of USAID shall submit to the appropriate committees of \nCongress a report that includes a proposed definition of placement and \nrecruitment fees for purposes of complying with the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act of 2000.\n  Both entities will also include a description of what fee components \nand amounts are prohibited or are permissible for contractors or their \nagents to charge workers.\n  An explanation of how the definition provided will be incorporated \ninto grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and contracting \npractices will be required.\n  Both the 180-day period preceding the date of submission and the one \nyear following the date of submission require a report of the \ndescription of actions taken.\n  Indeed, acknowledging the actions executed during the time periods \nprovided ensure that officials responsible for grants, contracts, and \ncooperative agreements and contracting practices include the prevention \nof trafficking in persons in plans and processes.\n  These include agreements and contracting practices that relate to \nareas of the world in which the risk of trafficking in persons is high.\n  In a 2011 CNN report, we learned about a federal agency filing a \nlarge human trafficking lawsuit.\n  The article discussed Thai workers who made their way to the \nnonprofit agency.\n  Some were approached by a labor contractor who offered what is said \nto be a lucrative job on a farm in the United States, but the would be \nworkers unfortunately found themselves owing thousands of dollars in \nrecruiting fees instead.\n  I support this legislation because it facilitates, establishes and \nmonitors a strong system for submitting reports pertaining to explicit \ndefinitions of placement and recruitment fees, so foreign workers \nrecruited from developing countries are not vulnerable to a variety of \ntrafficking-related abuses.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 400, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H396-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H396-H400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ELECTRIFY AFRICA ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. ROYCE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan \nF. Boyle) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 \nlegislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nextraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking this bill's Senate \ncosponsors. The Senate sponsors of the original measure are Bob Corker, \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and the ranking \nmember, Mr. Cardin, as well as two other Senators, Marco Rubio and \nChris Coons. I thank them for their good work to ensure this bill's \nSenate passage. We had our House version passed into the Senate.\n  I also want to thank Ranking Member Eliot Engel, as well as Chairman \nChris Smith, and Ranking Member Karen Bass of the Africa, Global \nHealth, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations \nSubcommittee for working so closely with me to develop the concept for \nthis legislation over the last several years.\n  Last Congress, the House passed a similar version of the measure we \nconsider today. With today's action, this bill will head to the \nPresident's desk for signature.\n  The Electrify Africa Act seeks to address the massive electricity \nshortage in Africa. It is a direct response to the fact that today 600 \nmillion people living in sub-Saharan Africa--that is 70 percent of the \npopulation--do not have access to reliable electricity. The Electrify \nAfrica Act offers a market-based response to this problem, and it will \nbring about the development of affordable, reliable energy in Africa.\n  Why do we want to help increase energy access to the continent? Well, \nto create jobs and to improve lives in both Africa and America. It is \nno secret that Africa has great potential as a trading partner and \ncould help create jobs here in the U.S.\n  As the Foreign Affairs Committee investigated how to make better use \nof the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which was landmark \nlegislation passed over a decade ago to expand trade with Africa, we \nlearned that the lack of affordable, reliable energy made the \nproduction of goods for trade and export nearly impossible. Even where \nother conditions supported manufacturing, the cost of running a plant \non a diesel generator is prohibited.\n  However, the U.S. is not alone in its interest in enhancing trade \nwith Africa. We have competition. Just last month, the People's \nRepublic of China pledged $60 billion in financial support to the \ncontinent. If the United States wants to tap into this potential \nconsumer base, we need to be aggressively building partnerships on the \ncontinent, which is what this bill does.\n  This bill will also have a tangible impact on people's lives. As \nformer chairman of the Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and \nInternational Organizations Subcommittee, I have seen firsthand how our \nconsiderable investments in improving access to health care and \neducation in Africa are undermined by a lack of reliable electricity.\n  Mr. Engel and I visited a power provider in rural Tanzania, which \nwould help meet the goals of this bill, in a place where only 10 \npercent of the population has access to electricity. In areas like that \nthroughout Africa, schoolchildren are forced to study by inefficient, \ndangerous kerosene lamps. Cold storage of lifesaving vaccines is almost \nimpossible without reliable electricity. Too many families resort to \nusing charcoal or other toxic fuel sources whose fumes cause more \ndeaths than HIV/AIDS and malaria combined and also damage the eyesight \nof the children trying to study.\n  In Tanzania, we now have American entrepreneurs bringing new \ntechnology and management expertise to the remotest areas of Africa, \nand that is improving lives. Many of us on the committee have worked to \ntransform our foreign assistance from programs that offer extensive \nBand-Aids to policies that support economic growth and independence. \nThe Electrify Africa Act is part of this transition.\n  This bill mandates a clear and comprehensive U.S. policy providing \nthe private sector with the platform that it needs to invest in African \nelectricity.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce, Subcommittee Chairman \nSmith, and Ranking Member Bass. I also want to thank our Senate \ncolleagues, especially Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin, for \nadvancing this effort. We are now in a place to send this legislation \nto the President's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, across sub-Saharan Africa, more than 600 million \nindividuals live without access to reliable electricity. That is double \nthe U.S. population without electricity, nearly two-thirds of their \npopulation.\n  For individuals, that deficit means never knowing what will happen \nwith the flip of a switch. It means a day's work needs to come to an \nend at sunset, that food can't be refrigerated, and that technology \nthat is so valuable for connecting to the rest of the world can't be \nrelied upon.\n  For communities, lack of access to power undermines the ability of \nhospitals to deliver health care because\n\n[[Page H399]]\n\nvaccines spoil and medical equipment sits useless. Businesses can't \nexpand and thrive. Schools are limited in what they can offer students.\n  For countries, these factors combine to undermine stability and \nstymie progress. Without reliable power, countries can't become strong \nplayers in the global economy or strong partners on the global stage. \nThe better these countries do, the better it is for their neighbors, \nfor their region, and for the entire world.\n  As you can see, the United States has an interest in helping these \ncountries grapple with this challenge and making sure the lights stay \non. That is why the Electrify Africa Act is such an important bill.\n  This legislation puts into law President Obama's 2013 Power Africa \ninitiative. It seeks to create strong, new partnerships among \ngovernments, banks, and other private sector investors with the aim of \nproviding first-time power to 50 million people by the year 2020. It \ncalls for a long-term strategy from our own government for assisting \nsub-Saharan African countries with national power strategies, and it \ndirects other American agencies to make assistance for power projects \nin sub-Saharan Africa a top priority. It helps bring American influence \nto bear around the world to encourage international bodies to bring a \nnew focus on this challenge.\n  Mr. Speaker, I fully support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \nOrganizations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for \nyielding.\n  I want to congratulate Chairman Royce on the Electrify Africa Act as \na companion bill to the legislation that we have before us today. We \nheld a hearing in my subcommittee that Karen Bass will remember well in \nNovember of 2014. The blessings that will accrue from a huge effort to \nelectrify Africa are almost without limit, especially when it comes to \nhealth care and ensuring that students can have proper light to go to \nschool and to study, particularly at night. All of the benefits that we \ntake for granted in the United States and in other parts of the world \nstill have yet to come to Africa.\n  In the 21st century, energy has become vital, as we all know, to \nmodern societies. We no longer have to shop for food each day. \nRefrigerators keep food cold and preserved longer, whether in our \nhomes, in restaurants, or during the process of transportation. Cell \nphones, computers, televisions, and other electronics require \nelectrical power to allow us to lead more productive lives in the \nmodern world and increasingly in the developing world.\n  As we have seen in the recent Ebola epidemic and in the current Zika \nvirus epidemic, it is vital that medicines and plasma be kept cold so \nthat they don't lose their potency. Of course, in the preservation of \nblood and so many other items that are essential to life, electricity \nfacilitates their continuance and their potency.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  It is unfortunate that the continent of Africa has so many people who \nhave been denied the ability to enjoy the advances of science. \nCurrently, only 290 million people out of about 914 million Africans \nhave access to electricity and the total number lacking continues to \nrise.\n  Bioenergy, mainly fuel, wood, and charcoal, is still the major source \nof fuel, and as the chairman pointed out in his opening comments, it \nthreatens the lives of so many people in Africa, including the eyesight \nof many of those who experience that.\n  On the other hand, hydropower accounts for about 20 percent of the \ntotal power supply in the region, but less than 10 percent of its \nestimated potential has been realized. Persistent drought in some areas \nmakes hydropower unpredictable.\n  The Electrify Africa Act takes an all-of-the-above approach--all of \nthese good prospects--in promoting the widest selection of sources of \nenergy that includes all forms of fossil fuels, but also hydroelectric \nand renewable energy sources.\n  This facilitates African nations to use all available energy sources. \nCoal, which is abundant in Africa, will be in the mix, and, hopefully, \nwe can help them import clean coal technology to mitigate pollution.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for this legislation.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes \nto the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), who is the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human \nRights, and International Organizations and who is a leader on sub-\nSaharan Africa issues.\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2152, the Electrify \nAfrica Act.\n  I commend the leadership and the work especially of our chair, Mr. \nRoyce, of our ranking member, Mr. Engel, of our subcommittee chair, Mr. \nSmith, and also of our committed members and staffs of the House \nForeign Affairs Committee as well as of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on this critical bill.\n  Because of this bill, the lives of millions of people can be changed \nimmeasurably for the better.\n  I remind my colleagues that two-thirds of the population of sub-\nSaharan Africa live without electricity, particularly in the rural \nareas. This means that children are forced to study by candlelight and \nthat doctors and midwives are delivering babies by relying on \nflashlights.\n  The effort to devise an inexpensive, safe, and reliable source of \npower is being addressed not only in the small, brilliant initiatives \nby young African entrepreneurs, such as by those whom I met when I had \nthe honor of traveling with President Obama to the 2015 Global \nEntrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi, but also in the large, innovative \npublic-private partnerships, such as Power Africa.\n  Electrify Africa can contribute to this effort in a major way by \nhelping to address the glaring absence of electrical power for at least \n50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020, thus improving the \neducation, health care, and other basic needs of millions of Africans.\n  The lack of access to power adversely affects broad-based economic \ndevelopment on the continent. This was particularly evident last year \nduring the Ebola crisis in three small African countries.\n  That battle was won with the help of the U.S. and with well-\ncoordinated regional efforts on the ground. Yet, in order to win the \nwar against other crippling diseases, there must be greater access to \nelectrical power.\n  In working together, we have crafted legislation that will focus on \nincreasing access to electricity in rural and poor communities through \nsmall, renewable energy projects that will result in at least millions \nof Africans having access to electricity for the first time in their \nlives by 2020.\n  When we worked together last year to pass AGOA, we knew much more was \nneeded in order to build the infrastructure that supported African \nnations in their ability to develop the capacity to become full trading \npartners with the United States.\n  This legislation, along with AGOA, is consistent with the theme from \nthe continent--trade, not aid--moving toward the continent of Africa's \nbeing self-sufficient and self-determined.\n  I am proud to serve as an original cosponsor of this legislation, and \nI invite fellow Members to support this bill as well.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n  I thank Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and the subcommittee \nchairman and ranking member.\n  Sometimes the right thing to do is also in our strategic interests as \na country, and this piece of legislation is a great example of that. I \nurge this body to pass it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I again thank all of this bill's cosponsors in the House and in the \nSenate as well as the House and Senate staffs, particularly Nilmini \nRubin.\n  I also thank Andy Olson, whose hard work has gotten us here today.\n\n[[Page H400]]\n\n  I also acknowledge Andrew Herscowitz--the USAID Power Africa's \ncoordinator--and his team, who are watching this debate right now in \nthe gallery.\n  I think, as we look at the range of enthusiasm for this legislation, \nat the last count I took, we had letters of support from 35 African \nambassadors, from the Chamber of Commerce, from the Corporate Council \non Africa, from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, \nfrom the American Academy of Pediatrics, and, of course, from the ONE \nCampaign.\n  The United States has economic and national security interests in the \ncontinued development of the African continent. This bill sets out a \ncomprehensive, sustainable, and market-based plan to bring 600 million \nAfricans out of the dark and into the global economy, benefiting \nAmerican businesses and workers at the same time and, frankly, saving \nlives at the same time.\n  So I urge all Members to support the Electrify Africa Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of S. 2152 an \nimportant legislation.\n  I support S. 2152 because it seeks to establish a comprehensive \nUnited States policy that encourages the efforts of countries in Africa \nto develop an appropriate mix of electricity solutions, including \nrenewable energy, for more broadly distributed electricity access in \norder to support poverty reduction, promote development outcomes, and \ndrive economic growth, and for other purposes.\n  According to the World Bank, those living on $1.25 day in Africa \naccounted for 48.5% of the population in that region in 2010.\n  Moreover, the U.S. Energy Information Administration statistics state \nthat in 2011 the whole of Africa possessed only 78 gigawatts of \ninstalled generation capacity, of which South Africa accounted for 44 \ngigawatts.\n  By comparison, installed capacity in the United States alone was \n1,053 gigawatts.\n  In other words, all of Africa has only 7% of the electric capacity of \nthe United States.\n  This is why S. 2152 is important, as it can be instrumental in \nhelping to facilitate higher energy capacities in Africa.\n  Furthermore, actual production capacity for Africa is likely to be \nsubstantially lower than the theoretical quantity because of inadequate \nmaintenance, outmoded equipment and fuel shortages.\n  Using per-capita data, a US citizen on average uses 12,461 kilowatt \nhours of electricity per annum; a citizen of Ethiopia uses 52.\n  On average, only 30% of Africa's citizens have any access to electric \nelectricity, and even where electricity is available, provision can be \nsporadic, with frequent electricity cuts and ``brown-outs.''\n  For now, the continent remains largely dependent on hydroelectricity \nwith 13 countries utilizing hydroelectricity for 60% or more of their \nenergy.\n  But, hydroelectricity relies on rain and Africa's rain fall is \nsporadic at best.\n  The reliance on sporadic rainfall adversely impacts the effectiveness \nand accessibility to hydroelectricity sources.\n  Energy is a key life blood of every economy and community.\n  In addition to electricity in homes, the energy sector has been \ninstrumental in creating millions of jobs, providing lighting to \ncommunities and healthcare centers, fueling our vehicles, increasing \nliteracy and life expectancy.\n  As an advocate for energy empowerment in Africa, I have championed \nenergy brain trusts that are convened to serve as a platform for all \nrelevant stakeholders from the energy sectors including coal, electric, \nnatural gas, nuclear, oil and emerging energy sources such as wind, \nsolar, hydroelectricity and turbine energy.\n  I support the Electrify Africa Act as it will address the energy \nissues of the day.\n  As you all may know, with enthusiasm, optimism and a collaborative \nspirit I partnered with my colleagues here in Congress and experts in \nother U.S. agencies such as USAID, which has been spearheading \ninnovative energy initiatives through its inter-agency efforts.\n  This legislation is important because it will increase the number of \npeople with new access to electricity and electricity services.\n  This legislation will improve and expand the generation, transmission \nand distribution of electricity.\n  I support this legislation because it provides reliable electricity \nto people and businesses in urban and rural communities.\n  It will address the energy needs of citizens living in areas where \nthere is little or no access to electricity grids.\n  It is also important because it will help develop plans to \nsystemically increase coverage in rural areas.\n  It will facilitate the reduction in transmission and distribution \nlosses and improve end-use efficiency and demand-side management as \nwell as end energy-related impediments to business productivity and \ninvestment.\n  Additionally, this legislation will facilitate the capacity of \ncountries in Africa to monitor appropriately and transparently the \nregulation of the power sector.\n  It will also serve as an economic stimulator because it will \nencourage private investment in energy production and distribution.\n  Overall, this legislation is important because it makes accessible a \nhuman necessity: electricity, which will dramatically improve the \nquality of life of children, women and men.\n  Access to electricity will aid the mid-wife in successfully \ndelivering a healthy child, while insuring the mother's successful \nrecovery.\n  Access to electricity, taken for granted in some parts of the world \nis critical in Africa because it will provide the light for a child to \ndo his or her homework.\n  Electricity gives Africa's future innovator, politician and teacher \naccess to the internet: opening countless doors.\n  I support this legislation because it will promote first-time access \nto electricity and electricity services for at least 50,000,000 people \nin Africa.\n  This legislation will facilitate the installation of at least 20,000 \nadditional megawatts of electricity in Africa by 2020 in both urban and \nrural areas.\n  When Africa succeeds the world succeeds and this is why I support \nthis legislation and I thank my colleagues for their bipartisan support \nacross both chambers of the House.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2152.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H400-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H400-H401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED \n   STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF HUNGARY--MESSAGE FROM THE \n          PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H.

The Agreements were signed in Budapest, Hungary, \non February 3, 2015.\n  The Agreements are similar in objective to the social security \nagreements already in force with most European Union countries, \nAustralia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, and \nSwitzerland. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination \nbetween the United States and foreign social security systems to \neliminate dual social security coverage and taxation, and to help \nprevent the lost benefit protection that can occur when workers divide \ntheir careers between two countries.\n  The Agreements contain all provisions mandated by section 233 of the \nSocial Security Act and the provisions that I deem appropriate to carry \nout the purposes of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4) of the \nSocial Security Act.\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report required \nby section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the estimated number \nof individuals who will be affected by the Agreements and the estimated \ncost effect.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Major shipping traffic is increasing through the Bering \n     Strait, the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and the Arctic Ocean, \n     and will continue to increase whether or not development of \n     the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States is \n     undertaken in the future, and will increase further if such \n     Outer Continental Shelf development is undertaken.\n       (2) There is a compelling national, State, Alaska Native, \n     and private sector need for permanent infrastructure \n     development and for a presence in the Arctic region of Alaska \n     by appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, \n     particularly in proximity to the Bering Strait, to support \n     and facilitate search and rescue, shipping safety, economic \n     development, oil spill prevention and response, protection of \n     Alaska Native archaeological and cultural resources, port of \n     refuge, arctic research, and maritime law enforcement on the \n     Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, and the Arctic Ocean.\n       (3) The United States owns a parcel of land, known as Point \n     Spencer, located between the Bering Strait and Port Clarence \n     and adjacent to some of the best potential deepwater port \n     sites on the coast of Alaska in the Arctic.\n       (4) Prudent and effective use of Point Spencer may be best \n     achieved through marshaling the energy, resources, and \n     leadership of the public and private sectors.\n       (5) It is in the national interest to develop \n     infrastructure at Point Spencer that would aid the\n\n[[Page H415]]\n\n     Coast Guard in performing its statutory duties and functions \n     in the Arctic on a more permanent basis and to allow for \n     public and private sector development of facilities and other \n     infrastructure to support purposes that are of benefit to the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 532.

It makes \nseveral reforms to Coast Guard authorities, as well as laws governing \nshipping and navigation. It is important legislation that will assist \nthe Coast Guard in fulfilling its missions.\n  I thank the committee ranking members, Mr. DeFazio and Mr. Garamendi, \nfor their hard work and their efforts, and Chairman Shuster for his \nleadership. Our collective interests to support the Coast Guard and its \nmany missions allowed for the development of the bill before us today.\n  The members of the Coast Guard do a tremendous job for our Nation. \nCoast Guard servicemembers place their lives on the line and at risk on \na daily basis to save those in danger, ensure the safety and security \nof our ports and waterways, and protect our environmental resources.\n  Passing H.R. 4188 will help rebuild and strengthen the Coast Guard. \nIt will also demonstrate the strong support Congress has for the men \nand women of the Coast Guard and the deep appreciation we have for the \nsacrifices they make for our Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  I thank John Rayfield, who is on my staff, and the Democrats' staff \nfor what they have done on this bill. I thank Reyna Hernandez McGrail \nfor the work that she put in, and I thank Commander Burdian, with the \nCoast Guard, who liaised with us on a daily basis to get this done.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 4188 as amended by the Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am pleased to be here again, at the beginning of another year, to \nrise to join Chairman Hunter in strong support of legislation to \nauthorize funding for the United States Coast Guard and to advance new \npolicy initiatives to strengthen the prospects for the U.S. flag and \nthe U.S. maritime industry.\n  H.R. 4188, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015, is very \ncarefully crafted bipartisan-bicameral legislation that has been \ndeveloped over the course of far too long. It should have and could \nhave been done last year, but here we are.\n  I thank the Senate. I guess I should be a little more kind to the \nother House.\n  Several months of negotiation with Members of the Senate have finally \nconcluded. This bill is deserving of robust support from Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, and I urge its quick passage by the House \ntoday so it can be enrolled and sent to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I thank Chairman Hunter for his leadership and cooperative spirit in \nworking with me and the other Democrats to address our interests and \nconcerns. The willingness of Chairman Hunter and of his outstanding \nstaff on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee to \ncollaborate and work with the minority is very, very much appreciated.\n  Now, the bill is not perfect. In fact, I haven't seen one in the \nyears I have been here, and that has been a few years now; but that is \nthe case with virtually every piece of bipartisan legislation that has \nbeen passed by Congress. On balance, the benefits of this bill really \noutweigh any detrimental aspects.\n  I am pleased this legislation will provide an increased authorized \nfunding level for the Coast Guard for the next 2 fiscal years. Our \nCoast Guard has suffered over the past 3 to 4 fiscal years due to \ninsufficient budgets. The authorized funding levels in this \nlegislation, along with the increased appropriation in the fiscal year \n2016 omnibus bill, are a marked improvement.\n  The importance of budget stability to the men and women of the Coast \nGuard cannot be overstated. Coastguardsmen and -women are pressed daily \nto meet the arduous demands of the service's 11 statutory missions \nwhich scatter them over seven different continents and every ocean. In \nfact, last week, I saw three of our cutters at the dock in Bahrain \nworking to preserve our interests in the Persian Gulf.\n  The last thing our Coast Guard needs is to face recurrent budget \nuncertainties, a circumstance which leaves the service's leadership \nunable to know exactly what resources and capabilities they have \navailable to perform vital national security functions, such as \naddressing port and harbor security, illegal drug and migrant \ninterdiction, search and rescue, law enforcement and environmental \nresponse actions, and several other important activities.\n  This legislation will also strengthen our national security through \nprovisions that enhance policies that govern foreign port security \nassignments. Others that bolster the coordination of international port \ninspections, conducted by the Coast Guard and our foreign partners, \nwill help better ensure that critical maritime infrastructure does not \nbecome a liability for national security.\n  Additionally, language included in the bill will strengthen the Coast \nGuard's maritime drug enforcement authority, which should improve the \nFederal Government's activities in the Western Hemisphere to combat \nillegal drug trafficking, which has had a substantial destabilizing \neffect on several nations across the region.\n  I am also very pleased that this legislation continues to move the \nball down the field in an effort to strengthen and to recapitalize a \nnew fleet of polar class heavy icebreakers for the Coast Guard.\n  It is clear that we are witnessing the opening of the Arctic to \nmaritime commerce. We have got to do something, and this bill puts us \non the road to doing that. In this most challenging of maritime \nenvironments, it is vital that the service has the icebreaking \ncapabilities it will need to operate safely and effectively; so we will \nfigure out whether the Polar Sea can actually be\n\n[[Page H419]]\n\nrefitted. Additionally, this legislation authorizes funding to allow \nthe Coast Guard to maintain progress in finalizing requirements and in \ninitiating preliminary designs for a new heavy icebreaker.\n  In moving to an end here, I am pleased that the legislation includes \nlanguage to continue to preserve the remaining infrastructure at the \nformer LORAN-C stations until such time that the administration makes a \nfinal decision on whether to build an enhanced LORAN, or E-LORAN, \ninfrastructure as a reliable land-based, low-frequency backup \nnavigation and timing signal for the global positioning satellite \nsignal, which, I think, most of us know is the single point of failure \nfor most of the American economy and for a good deal of our military. \nThe GPS signal is fairly easy to corrupt, to degrade, or to otherwise \ndisrupt. For this reason, we need to think seriously about a backup, \nand this bill sets us on the right course.\n  This administration needs to make a decision on this, and it should \nmake it now. The language in this legislation ensures that we will have \navailable in the future the remaining LORAN-C infrastructure.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Shuster, with Ranking Member \nDeFazio, and, of course, with Chairman Hunter in advancing this \ninitiative wherever and whenever possible.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Hunter and his staff for their support for \nthe Coast Guard and the U.S. maritime industry and for their \ncooperation and leadership in pulling this bill together.\n\n  Of course, Congressman Shuster, who is the chairman of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Ranking Member DeFazio \nalso deserve thanks for their leadership and contributions.\n  I thank my staff and the majority's staff for the work that they have \ndone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Huffman).\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the chairman \nfor the good work that has gone into this very important bill. As \nsomebody who represents one-third of the California coast, obviously, \nthis legislation is important to me. I want to especially thank the \nchairman and ranking member for one part of this legislation that has \nspecial significance to the people of Marin County, whom I am honored \nto represent.\n  Finding affordable housing in Marin County is very difficult, and it \nhas only gotten harder since the Great Recession and since the rebound \nin the real estate market. That has had an impact on the families I \nrepresent. It has had an impact on businesses and on folks in \nagriculture who can't find the full-time staff that they need because \nthey can't afford to live in the community.\n  Section 501 of this bill is going to help in a very significant way \nto address this housing crunch in West Marin. It is going to take some \nCoast Guard property that is excess property and sell it at fair market \nvalue to the County of Marin. This will be a win-win for the County of \nMarin and also for the Coast Guard. I look forward to seeing the county \nbegin working with local partners on repurposing this property for the \npublic benefit of affordable housing.\n  We still have a long way to go to make sure that working families in \nplaces like Marin County and everyplace else have access to quality \nhousing, but this bill is an important step for at least one community \nthat I represent.\n  I thank the tireless group of advocates who have worked on this, \nespecially West Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey, Kim Thompson, and \nall of those at the Community Land Trust Association of West Marin, and \nothers. Finally, I thank Ranking Member DeFazio and Chairman Shuster as \nwell as the subcommittee members and staff. I thank very much the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  If I might just close by saying a special ``thank you'' to the \nchairman and his staff, to my staff--David--and to my own team on this. \nAlso, this really was a bipartisan bill; so I thank Chairman Thune and \nthe ranking Democrat on the committee, Bill Nelson, for their efforts \nin putting together this bill.\n  Let's get this job done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, the Coast Guard in the future is going to fulfill a much \ngreater role than it has filled since its inception. As you have \nweapons of mass destruction become ubiquitous throughout the world, the \nbad guys are going to use the same routes that they use to smuggle \ndrugs and people to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into this \ncountry.\n  It is my belief and Mr. Garamendi's firm belief that the Coast Guard \nis going to play a major, pivotal role going forward. After the Iranian \ndeal goes through, who knows who is going to have nuclear weapons. It \nis going to be the Coast Guard that interdicts and stops them on those \nsame drug routes that they are going to be taking with those weapons of \nmass destruction; so it is important that we make sure that they are \nstaffed, that they are capable, and that they are ready to do what we \nneed them to do as a nation, even if it is different than what they \nhave done for the last few hundred years.\n  I also thank my staff and Mr. Garamendi's staff and my personal staff \nfor their time and effort. I will even squeak in a thank-you for the \nSenate for just finally getting it done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4188, the \n``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015'', as amended by the Senate. \nThis legislation is virtually the same bill that the House passed last \nDecember by voice vote. I urge Members from both sides of the aisle to \nagain support this important maritime legislation.\n  As I noted when the bill passed the House late last year, this \nlegislation reflects a sensible compromise negotiated with the other \nbody that, most importantly, would provide increased authorized funding \nlevels and budget stability for the Coast Guard for the next two years. \nCombined with the matching increases in FY 2016 appropriations \ncontained in the recently-enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, we \nwill have provided a solid foundation to build from in the coming \nfiscal year.\n  Additionally, the legislation includes provisions to improve Coast \nGuard mission effectiveness, continue efforts to recapitalize the \nService's aging vessels and other assets--especially the need for new \npolar icebreakers--and enhance maritime security and safety policy.\n  Importantly, the bill extends the existing statutory prohibition \npreventing the Coast Guard from closing its air facility, or AIRFAC, \nlocated in Newport, Oregon.\n  Due to budget cuts, in 2014, the Coast Guard threatened to close the \nNewport AIRFAC--which handles one-half of the emergency search and \nrescue response calls on the Central Oregon Coast.\n  In fact, only last week a 40-foot crabbing vessel capsized a mile \nfrom the entrance to Coos Bay, throwing four fishermen into the frigid \nand perilous waters of the North Pacific Ocean. This incident again \ndemonstrates that calamity can strike at anytime off the Oregon Coast. \nIt underscores the importance of keeping a strong AIRFAC presence along \nthe Oregon coastline, to ensure the safety of Oregon's fishing \nindustry, and the people who live, recreate, or work along the coast.\n  This legislation extends the existing statutory prohibition for an \nadditional two years, and likely longer, depending on whether the Coast \nGuard completes some necessary planning to address the looming need to \nrecapitalize its two helicopter fleets.\n  Moreover, after the prohibition expires, this legislation authorizes \na rigorous administrative process that the Coast Guard must follow \nbefore it can close any AIRFAC.\n  In the future, the Coast Guard must promptly notify Members of \nCongress representing affected areas and convene public meetings in \ncommunities within the area of responsibility of the AIRFAC to gather \ninformation on how the closure would affect residents and visitors.\n  In its totality, this provision will ensure that any future proposal \nto close an AIRFAC will be vetted extensively through a transparent, \npublic process; a process that will ensure that the Coast Guard's \nsearch and rescue capabilities are the absolute last place any one \nshould consider cutting in the Coast Guard's budget.\n  I want to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, Congressman Bill Shuster, for his leadership on this \nlegislation. I also want to express my\n\n[[Page H420]]\n\nappreciation for the very constructive and bipartisan working \nrelationship we have developed to advance the agenda of the Committee \nthis Congress. This legislation is a great start to 2016.\n  I also want to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard \nand Maritime Transportation, Congressman Duncan Hunter, and Ranking \nMember John Garamendi, for their support for this provision, and for \ntheir close cooperation and contributions throughout negotiations with \nthe other body.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, the final legislation before the House is a \nsensible, bipartisan product that supports our Nation's Coast Guard. \nAnd while admittedly not perfect, this legislation is something that \nMembers on both sides of the aisle should readily support.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical \nlegislation.-\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Young of Iowa). The question is on the \nmotion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) that the \nHouse suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, \nH.R. 4188.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H420-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PENN STATE POLICE OFFICER STEW NEFF MARKS 50 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I deeply admire the \nservice of policemen and -women who serve across Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District; but, today, I rise to note Lieutenant Stew \nNeff's service. He has been a member of the Penn State University \nPolice Department for the past five decades.\n  Lieutenant Neff was born and raised not too far from State College, \nand he joined the Penn State Police Department as a dispatcher on \nJanuary 10, 1966. Since then, he has filled many roles, most recently \nas a training officer, as a firearms instructor, and as a special \nevents coordinator for the past 13 years.\n  As a sign of his longevity with the department, consider that the \ncurrent assistant chief went to high school with Lieutenant Neff's \ndaughter. At a time when so many people switch jobs at the drop of a \nhat, Stew's dedication to the Penn State Police Department and to the \nuniversity, itself, is highly commendable.\n  Lieutenant Neff isn't planning on retiring soon. He says that he \nstill loves his job and embraces the opportunity to serve his community \nas a member of the Penn State Police Department. I wish Stew the best \nof luck as his career continues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H420-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MAJOR SHAWN CAMPBELL; CORPORAL MATTHEW DROWN--TEXAS MARINES\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, while patrolling the blue South \nPacific seas, two American Stallion helicopters collided off the coast \nof Hawaii. It was January 14, 2016. Twelve U.S. marines on board \nperished. Despite rescue efforts by air and sea, the marines were never \nfound. Their watery graves are only known to God.\n  Major Shawn Campbell, 41, and Corporal Matthew Drown, 23, were Texas' \nown. They were graduates of two neighboring high schools--Klein and \nKlein Oak--in my Texas congressional district.\n  Major Campbell, over here with two of his children, was a hardcore \nmarine. A graduate of Texas A in microbiology, he served three tours \nof duty in combat in the Middle East. Recently, he was ordered to the \nStates as an instructor pilot. Major Campbell left behind a wife and \nfour kids.\n  Corporal Matthew Drown joined the Marines right out of Klein Oak High \nSchool in 2011. He was on the debate team and was a friend everyone \nwanted to have. He was planning on reenlisting in the Marine Corps.\n  These volunteers lived and died protecting America. They are the best \nthat we have.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing like a marine. Ronald Reagan said: \n``Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a \ndifference . . .

Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to represent thousands of \nteachers, firefighters, and law enforcement officers across the Fourth \nDistrict of Texas who have dedicated their careers to public service.\n  As the son of two schoolteachers and as a former law enforcement \nofficial myself, I have a personal and deep-felt appreciation for those \nwho shape future generations by educating our children and protecting \nthe communities where we live.\n  Right now there are nearly 900,000 of these public servants who are \nbeing unjustly denied their hard-earned retirement benefits through an \narbitrary formula called the windfall elimination provision, which can \nreduce their Social Security checks by up to $413 a month.\n  That is why I have cosponsored and why I strongly support H.R. 711, \nthe Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act, to reduce and to eliminate \nthe windfall elimination provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to take it up for a vote as soon as possible so \nthat we can ensure that our public servants receive both the Social \nSecurity benefits and the pensions that they most certainly have \nearned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H421-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING DARYL VEATCH\n\n  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in admiration of a leader in \nMissouri's Fourth District, Mr. Daryl Veatch.\n  Daryl has served tirelessly to provide reliable light and energy to \nMissouri members of the Osage Valley Electric Cooperative, of which I \nam a lifelong member. After 43 years, Mr. Veatch has resigned his \nposition as the general manager of Osage Valley in Butler, Missouri.\n  His passion for excellence was seen throughout all of his work: from \nthe beginning at Grundy Electric Cooperative, where he served as a \nclerk, to his tenure as the president of the Missouri Electric \nCooperative Human Resources Association, the Accountants Association, \nand a member of the Public Relations Committee.\n  This year Daryl was honored with the esteemed A.C. Burrows Award \ngiven by the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives for his \nleadership above and beyond the call of duty to strengthen and improve \nthe economic and social conditions of his community.\n  Part of going above and beyond for Daryl was being actively involved \nas a leader on the local Butler R-V School Board, the area Chamber of \nCommerce, and his Rotary Club.\n  Thank you for giving your life to the service of the citizens of \nMissouri's Fourth District. I congratulate you on a job well done. I \nlook forward to hearing of the continued impact you will have in and \nfor our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H421-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H421-H429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AN HOUR OF POWER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be \ngiven 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any \nextraneous materials relevant to the subject matter of this discussion.\n\n[[Page H422]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to \nrise this evening as co-chair, along with my distinguished colleague \nwho represents the Eighth District of New York, Congressman Hakeem \nJeffries, for this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, an \nhour of power, addressing the state of our Union, Dr. King's dream, and \ntoday's African American message.\n  Congressman Jeffries is a scholar, a distinguished member of the \nJudiciary Committee. He continues to be a tireless advocate for social \nand economic justice, working hard to reform our criminal justice \nsystem, improve the economy for hardworking Americans, and to make \ncollege more affordable for all. Most importantly, he is someone that I \nam proud to follow and he is my colleague.\n\n  Today we come to educate and to discuss some of the many \ncontributions and accomplishments in American history that African \nAmericans etched into the cornerstone of this America, Mr. Speaker, \nthat they helped change. The Congressional Black Caucus is and \ncontinues to be a part of that change.\n  As we reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose holiday we \nrecently observed, thanks to our Congressional Black Caucus colleague, \nCongressman John Conyers, the dean, who worked tirelessly to have the \nday observed as a Federal holiday, we pause to reflect on our progress \nand our history not only to remember, but to acknowledge, our \nunfinished work.\n  Congressional Black Caucus members and other colleagues with \nconstituents across the country participated in holiday services, \nprograms, marches, and many other events last week. This was not a day \noff, Mr. Speaker, but a day on in the spirit of Dr. King's legacy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to join some 4,000 constituents in \nmy district in Columbus for the Nation's largest Martin Luther King \nbreakfast celebration.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  As I sat there, I was reminded of his words that we live by and that \nwe are guided by: ``Faith is taking the first step, even when you don't \nsee the whole staircase.'' Later I had the opportunity to join hundreds \nof folks to march in freezing weather, singing ``We Shall Overcome.''\n  Today we also mark the beginning of the observation of Black History \nMonth, to celebrate giants in civil rights, in the civil rights \nmovement, as well as labor and education, transportation, the arts, and \nthe service movement.\n  As we reflect on Dr. King's dream, just a few weeks ago President \nBarack Obama from this House floor, Mr. Speaker, delivered his final \nState of the Union Address. In his address, the President delivered a \nspeech filled with hope and optimism, reminding us that we, the \npeople--emphasizing all people--want opportunity and security for our \nfamilies. It was a message of a better future, fairness, and democracy \nfor all Americans because we rise or fall together, Mr. Speaker.\n  President Obama continues to remind us that ours is a nation bounded \nby a common creed and that our American values of equality, fairness, \nand justice should be available to all, not just a fortunate few. Far \ntoo long people and communities of color continue to be left behind \nwhen we discuss equality, fairness, and justice.\n  In the 48 years since his death, while we have made some strides in \nconfronting injustices and ending unequal treatment, there is still \nwork to be done. Our Nation is still plagued by the vestiges of \nsegregation and unequal laws and policies, evident today in Flint, \nMichigan, and its lack of clean drinking water; in it being harder, not \neasier, to exercise the constitutional right to vote through voter \ndisenfranchisement; Black men being killed in Ferguson, Baltimore, \nChicago, and my State of Ohio; inequities in health care, poverty, and \nin our failing schools.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, the time is now for us to work together to protect \nthe most at risk among us, to defend the foundation of our democracy, \nand to expand opportunity for all people.\n  However, Republican leadership fails to act and refuses to bring up \nVoting Rights Advancement Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation, for \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, we will hear from our Congressional Black \nCaucus colleagues on the state of our Union and where we go from here. \nI welcome the dialogue and the debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee from the 13th District of California. We know \nher as a fearless advocate, fighting to eliminate poverty. We know her \nas someone who has a history of representing not only the people of her \ndistrict but the people of America. I have had the opportunity to \nwitness this firsthand, as I serve on her committee when she fights to \nend the War on Poverty. It is my honor to ask Congresswoman Barbara Lee \nto bring her message to us tonight.\n  Ms. LEE. Let me first thank Congresswoman Beatty for her very kind \nand humbling remarks, but also for her tremendous leadership on so many \nissues, not only since she has been here in Congress, but before she \ncame representing her constituents, and really looking out for, \nspeaking out for, and working for the most vulnerable in our society.\n  I am really proud of what she is doing with the Congressional Black \nCaucus, also Congressman Jeffries for continuing to organize these \nimportant sessions really to beat the drum and to allow our country to \nunderstand what the issues are that the Congressional Black Caucus \ncontinues to work on because if, in fact, we address those issues, as \nyou know, that the most vulnerable are dealing with each and every day, \nwe will strengthen America, and so our country will be stronger. I \nthank both of them for making sure that we are doing that.\n  We celebrate tonight the start of Black History Month, but I would \nlike to reflect quickly again what we are doing tonight on Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr.'s dream of true democracy.\n  In his famous speech, ``I Have a Dream,'' let me just quote here what \nhe asked the American people to do. He said:\n  ``To make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise \nfrom the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of \nracial justice.\n  ``Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all God's \nchildren.\n  ``Now is the time to lift our Nation from the quicksands of racial \ninjustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.'' Of course and sisterhood.\n  As I think about his powerful words going into Black History Month \nand his challenge for America to live up to her highest ideals, we must \nreflect on how far we have come and where we need to go.\n  Now, of course, the right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy, \nwhich Dr. King reminded us of when he said: ``Give us the ballot, and \nwe will fill our legislative halls with men and women of goodwill.'' In \nhis honor, we must pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act, H.R. 2867, \nintroduced by a great woman, a member of the Congressional Black \nCaucus, Congresswoman Terri Sewell.\n  In 1967 Dr. King explained the underlying nature of the challenges \nfacing our country in his book ``Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or \nCommunity?'' he talked about these triple evils. He wrote about \npoverty, racism, and war. He said they are the forms of violence that \nexist in a vicious cycle in our country. He says: ``They are \ninterrelated, all-inclusive, and stand as barriers to our living in the \nbeloved community. When we work to remedy one evil, we affect all \nevils.''\n  So we must come together as never before to address these issues that \ninfect our communities in order for our Nation to move beyond the \nquicksands of racial and economic injustice.\n  Of course, the first of these evils is poverty, a harsh reality lived \nevery day by more than 46 million Americans. Our Joint Economic \nCommittee report, championed by Congresswoman Maloney and the \nCongressional Black Caucus, demonstrated and showed that African \nAmericans are disproportionately affected by the scourge of poverty. \nThe poverty rate in our community is 27 percent. One in three African \nAmerican kids live in poverty. One in five kids in the entire country \nlive in poverty. Poverty rates throughout our country are much too high \nfor everyone, and we know how to eliminate poverty.\n\n[[Page H423]]\n\n  Our assistant leader, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, a \ngreat human being who has worked so hard to eliminate poverty for so \nmany years has come up with a formula that would target resources to \nthose rural and urban communities with the highest rates of persistent \npoverty.\n  We have our Half in Ten Act, which establishes a national strategy to \ncut poverty in half over the next decade. That is more than 22 million \nAmericans lifted into the middle class in just 10 years by coordinating \nlocal, State, and Federal anti-poverty programs.\n  Likewise, our Pathways Out of Poverty Act is a comprehensive anti-\npoverty bill that starts by creating good-paying jobs while redoubling \nour investments in proven programs that empower families to build \npathways out of poverty into the middle class.\n  Of course, Dr. King mentioned the second evil, which is racism. While \nracial barriers and biases are endemic through our society, they are \nvery and most apparent in our broken criminal justice system. It is \nhigh time that we work to fix our criminal justice system that far too \noften fails African Americans. Yes, Black lives matter.\n  So today in America, an African American is killed by a security \nofficer, police officer, or self-proclaimed vigilante every 28 hours. \nThat is nearly once a day. One in three Black men can plan to spend at \nleast some part of their life behind bars, and men of color make up 70 \npercent of the U.S. prison population. Let me say that again. Seventy \npercent of the U.S. prison population are men of color. That is simply \noutrageous.\n  Now, we have ended legal segregation. Our first African American \nPresident is serving his second term in the White House. Our Attorney \nGeneral, Loretta Lynch, serves as our first African American female \nAttorney General. But so much must be done to achieve the dream of \nliberty and justice for all.\n  Dr. King told us over and over again that we live in two Americas. \nThis was in 1967, in one of his speeches. The Kerner Commission report \nstill describes American society today. We have got to really look at \nour history and acknowledge and honor the legacy of those who really \nbrought us this far. But when you look at the statistics and what is \ntaking place now in communities of color and the African American \ncommunity, it just shows us what we have to do. We have a long way to \ngo.\n  Dr. King finally spoke of war. He talked about the fact that our \nNation continues to be involved in endless wars, and communities are \nsuffering the costs. The Pentagon consumes 60 percent of discretionary \nspending compared to 11 percent that we spend on education, job \ncreation, and resources to help our young people live the life that \nthey so deserve in terms of being educated and providing workforce \ntraining, housing, health care, all the opportunities that are the \nAmerican opportunities to allow us to live the American Dream.\n  Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries, I just want to thank \nyou for arranging the time for us to talk tonight. We have real \nsolutions. You have real solutions. Every member of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus has real solutions to end poverty, to end racism, and to \nend war.\n  During Black History Month, we need to recommit ourselves to all of \nthe solutions that members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and \nMembers of this body as a whole, have if the political will were there \nso we can honor the legacy of those who came before us during Black \nHistory Month. By honoring them, we say we are going to pick up that \nmantle and really address these triple evils once and for all.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congresswoman Lee, for reminding us \nof the work we have to do to strengthen our America and for giving us \nthose facts that clearly point out the barriers that we have and also \nthe disparities when you look at 70 percent of our men being \nincarcerated, yet we don't make up 70 percent of the population.\n  Thank you for reminding us of all the work and the words of Martin \nLuther King because you are so right. To sum it up in his words: \ninjustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere.\n  Thank you. We will continue that work.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to \nCongresswoman Karen Bass from the 37th District of California. It is a \ngreat honor for me because she is certainly not only a leader, but an \nadvocate domestically and globally for young girls. As a matter of \nfact, when I think of her work across this Nation in foster care, I \ncall her the Sojourner Truth of foster care.\n  When I think of her leadership, it is important for me to remind \nfolks that she was the first African American female to be Speaker of \nthe House of the great State of California. Today it is indeed my honor \nto yield to Congresswoman Bass.\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Beatty. I want \nto congratulate her for her leadership that she has displayed since day \none of coming to the House of Representatives, and knowing of her \nleadership in the State of Ohio, serving as the leader of the \nlegislature in Ohio.\n  I want to acknowledge my colleague Hakeem Jeffries. I have always \nappreciated his leadership in the committees as well as his leadership \nwithin the House. I am glad that he is very much a part of our Caucus.\n  I know our theme today is: ``The State of Our Union: Have We Achieved \nDr. King's Dream?'' I have to say that the state of our union is a \nmixed bag. Have we achieved Dr. King's dream? As a nation, we haven't, \nbut if we look at the success of individuals, many individuals have \nachieved remarkable levels of success.\n  While the success of individuals should rightfully be celebrated, \nuntil the richest nation on the planet in the history of the world has \nfigured out how to address poverty, income inequality, and provide \nopportunity for everyone to succeed in our Nation, Dr. King's dream is \na dream deferred.\n  Dr. King would have been so proud to have been at the inauguration of \nthe first African American President, but he would have been horrified \nto see a man achieve that level of success, becoming the most powerful \nman in the world, and still be subjected to doubters who ask to see his \nbirth certificate, questioning if he was actually an American, \nobviously code for ``he might be the President, but he is still not one \nof us''; asking to see his college transcripts, questioning if his \nacademic success was legitimate.\n  Dr. King would be horrified to learn the number of hate groups. White \nsupremacist organizations exploded after the election of the first \nAfrican American President of the United States. He would have been \nshocked to hear that leaders in our country actually publicly stated \nthat they would do everything they could, including hurting the \nnational economy, to ensure that the Nation's first African American \nPresident did not serve a second term.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Dr. King would have been overjoyed when this President was reelected \nto a second term, so that no one could say the first time was an \naberration. Dr. King would have been so proud of the millions of people \nwho withstood attempts to block their right to vote and to know that \nthousands were willing to stand for hours to make sure they voted and \nreelected President Obama.\n  Dr. King would have celebrated the creation of a program to provide \nhealth coverage for the majority of people in the Nation. He would have \ncelebrated the fact that this was accomplished in the first term of \nPresident Obama's administration.\n  Dr. King would have celebrated the fact that when the law was signed \nby President Obama, for the first time, insurance companies could no \nlonger refuse to provide coverage for people if they had an illness or \na preexisting condition.\n  Just think for a minute. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, insurance \ncompanies excluded you from coverage if you had a preexisting \ncondition. There were examples of babies born prematurely that were \nexcluded from coverage because their premature birth and the associated \ncomplications were considered a preexisting condition.\n  And, frankly, almost everyone after a certain age has one preexisting \ncondition or another--hypertension, high cholesterol, et cetera. Prior \nto passage of healthcare reform, aging, essentially, was a reason to \nexclude individuals from coverage.\n  While Dr. King would have celebrated this victory, he would have been\n\n[[Page H424]]\n\nshocked to know Congress has voted over 60 times to take health care \naway from people and to reverse this advance. If the Affordable Care \nAct was repealed, then the parents of the premature baby and the adult \nover 60 with high blood pressure would not have health care.\n  On another subject, Dr. King would wonder: How on Earth did his \ncountry end up incarcerating more people than any other nation in the \nworld? And how is it that the majority of people incarcerated in the \nUnited States are poor and are people of color?\n  As a man of faith, as a teacher of the Bible, he would wonder what \nhappened to the concept of redemption in our society. How did we become \na society that punished people forever? What happened to the belief \nthat, if you offended society and then paid your debt to society, you \nwere expected and accepted to reenter society with your full rights?\n  How did we evolve into a nation that basically said we will punish \nyou for your entire life? Because even though 85 percent of people \nincarcerated are eventually released, we can strip away your right to \nvote. You cannot live in public housing; and if your family lives in \npublic housing, then you can't go home.\n  If you were in prison and you owed child support, well, we just kept \nthe clock running on what you owed even though you were in prison and, \nof course, could not work to pay child support. You owed the money \nanyway.\n  And, of course, when you were released, you are then behind in child \nsupport. And because you are behind because you could not work while \nincarcerated, we will not give you a driver's license. And if you are \nfrom Los Angeles and cannot drive, you can forget about having a \ndecent-paying job, because those jobs certainly don't exist in your \nneighborhood.\n  Furthermore, if you don't find a job, we just might violate your \nparole and put you back in prison, because a condition of your parole \nis that you have a job. But then, since you are a felon, we will not \nallow you to work anyway.\n  In California, until we changed the law, there were 56 occupations \nyou could not participate in if you were a felon. One of those \noccupations we even trained you for while you were in prison. We have a \nschool that trains prisoners to be barbers. But when you were released, \nwe didn't allow ex-offenders to have a license in the very occupation \nwe trained you for--until we changed the law.\n  I think Dr. King would be thoroughly confused by the contradictions \nhe would see in America today. We have amazingly successful \nindividuals, thousands of African Americans and other people of color \nin elected office or in other major positions of authority. They are \nCEOs of companies, astronauts, athletes, college presidents, \nentertainers on every level, actors, producers, directors.\n  In every area in society, there are successful individuals. There are \n48 African American Members of Congress. The year before his death, \nthere were only five African Americans in Congress.\n  But Dr. King would wonder what is holding our Nation back from making \nsure every American has access to the American Dream. With all the \ntechnological advances, advances in science and education, how can it \nbe that people are hungry in America, that too many children continue \nto go to poor, segregated schools, and that there are homeless \nencampments that exist in most major cities?\n  Although his dream for our Nation is only partially realized, I \nbelieve now it is our responsibility to continue the work and to \ncontinue the struggle until there is no such thing as homelessness in \nthe richest nation on the planet, until all children have access to a \n21st century education, until poverty is eliminated and the safety net \nis strong enough that no one in our Nation slips through the cracks.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, thank you again to Congresswoman Karen Bass \nfor reminding us of all the great riches that we have in this society, \nbut also for putting on the forefront that our work is not finished. \nThere is hope. Because we have learned that through having a President \nwho stands on the shoulders of another great man--Martin Luther King.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed my honor and privilege to yield to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), who hails from the Second \nDistrict of Louisiana. He is someone who is fearless and not afraid to \nspeak up, but he doesn't speak in vain. He speaks with a platform--\nwhether that platform is to discuss reforming our broken prison system, \nwhether it is to talk about HBCUs, or whether it is to be a role \nmodel--and he knows a lot about that because he is a natural leader. \nWhen he took office in the State legislature, he was one of the \nyoungest legislators to ever serve.\n\n  So it is indeed my honor to call Congressman Cedric Richmond a \ncolleague and friend.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. I want to thank the gentlelady and scholar for yielding \nto me and putting on this series tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, on January 12, right here in this \nChamber, President Obama proudly declared to the citizens of the United \nStates that the state of our Union is strong. With that, I agree. \nHowever, tonight, just as I did in New Orleans on this holiday, I must \nstand here and give the state of the dream address.\n  So, today, I stand in this Chamber and report to the world that the \nstate of the dream is in disrepair. It is in disrepair because of \nneglect by some and intentional harms by others.\n  Let me first just state what I believe his dream to be. This is in \nhis own words. In accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. King said: ``I \nhave the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three \nmeals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, \nand dignity, equality, and freedom for their spirits.''\n  So why do I say that dream is in disrepair? Well, inadequate funding \nand misguided policies stand as a bar to many kids of color from \ngetting a quality education, just like Bull Connor stood in the \nschoolhouse doors during the civil rights movement.\n  Why do I say the dream is in disrepair? Because too many African \nAmerican children have better access to guns and drugs than textbooks \nand computers. Far too many of them choose guns and drugs.\n  Why do I say the dream is in disrepair? Because the Supreme Court \nrolled back the protections for minority voting rights.\n  Why do I say the dream is in disrepair? Because in a Supreme Court \nhearing on minority admission policies to colleges and universities, \none of our Supreme Court Justices demonstrated his bias, his ignorance, \nand his lack of understanding by trying to justify why Blacks should go \nto lesser colleges and universities.\n  Why is the dream in disrepair? Because the Black Supreme Court \nJustice sat there and said nothing. Well, if I were in college and I \nwere playing Spades, I would call him a ``possible,'' because you can't \ncount on him to hold up when the game starts.\n  Why do I also say the dream is in disrepair? Because big Wall Street \nexecutives can steel millions and never get charged and held \naccountable while young Black kids who shoplift get prosecuted and fill \nup our jails and our prisons and create what we call the prison \nindustrial enterprise.\n  Some ask: Why do the poor and uneducated continue to steal and cheat? \nWell, the answer is simple: Because the rich and educated keep showing \nthem how.\n  So, as we stand here this month and celebrate Black History Month, we \nwill not only describe some of the problems, but we will go into some \nof the solutions that have been tested over time.\n  Let me just say that Dr. King and the generation before us did a \ngreat job of making this dream a reality through sacrifice, hard work, \nand commitment, but somewhere in my generation, we fell off from that \nsacrifice and determination.\n  Far too many of us are letting reality shows and music videos give \nour children their misguided sense of morals. Too many of our African \nAmerican and White middle-class families who have achieved the dream \nare excited that they are there, but they are telling the rest of the \nworld to get it the best they can.\n  The dream can be realized when everyone realizes that you are not \ngoing to help minority communities in spite of the minority \ncommunities, but we are going to bring them to the table and let them \nbe a co-participant in drafting their accomplishments.\n\n[[Page H425]]\n\n  So, where do we go from here? We continue to invest in proven leaders \nand proven ways out of poverty and ways to get ahead, like education. \nWe have to invest in the Pell grants and our Historically Black \nColleges and Universities because we know that education is the best \nway out of poverty.\n  We have to invest in summer jobs so that kids in urban areas and \nimpoverished communities can get exposure to a different way of life so \nthat they can help themselves. We know that a summer job reduces the \ndropout rate by 50 percent.\n  What else can we do? We can invest in job training. We can invest in \ndisadvantaged businesses. We can do a number of things. And the good \npart about it is we have a Congressional Black Caucus that can stand \nhere and introduce legislation if the other side would meet us halfway.\n  So, the state of our union will continue to be strong. The state of \nthe dream will become a reality when people join hands together to make \nsure that the least of us have every opportunity in the world.\n  I will tell you that the dream was strong. The dream is the same \ndream that allowed my mother, who is from the poorest place in the \ncountry, 1 of 15 children, to achieve her college degree and raise two \nsons who went off to Morehouse. So the dream is real when I, as the son \nof a single mother, can go to Morehouse, Tulane Law School, and the \nHarvard School of Government. That is the dream.\n  So I stand here today and just ask that we do what Booker T. \nWashington said. We may be as separate as our fingers, but we are as \nwhole as the hand. This body has an obligation to come together as the \nhand and make sure that we give every kid from every place in this \ncountry the opportunity to succeed.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Richmond for reminding us that you \nbring hope. Your experience shows that there is opportunity. Because \ncertainly, we know that there are fewer Black students graduating from \nhigh school. Sixteen percent of Blacks drop out, compared to 8 percent \nof our White counterparts.\n  Mr. Speaker, can you tell me how much time I have remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield \nto my colleague from the 10th District of New Jersey (Mr. Payne). He is \nsomeone who is a great example of a committed public servant. He is \nsomeone who puts others before himself. When you want to call on him, \nhe is someone that will sit and quietly listen to you, and then a few \nminutes later he will give you probably one of the most profound \nanswers that one could look for. I am proud to not only call him my \ncolleague, but I am also proud to call him my classmate.\n  It is my honor to ask Congressman Donald Payne to bring his \nreflections.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking my classmates, \nCongresswoman Joyce Beatty and Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, for \nanchoring these important Special Order hours for the Congressional \nBlack Caucus.\n  Since her arrival here in Congress, Congresswoman Beatty has \ndemonstrated why she was a leader in Ohio, and she has become a great \nleader in the House of Representatives.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Dr. King envisioned for this Nation a future of vast \npotential, a future where every man and woman and child would have the \nopportunity to get ahead, free from the constraints of injustice and \nintolerance.\n  What we see happening across our country shows how far we still have \nto go to achieve Dr. King's dream. From gun violence to racial wealth \ngaps, from lack of diversity to persistent poverty, there are still \ncritical issues affecting our communities that must be addressed.\n  In 2015, there were at least 76 gun deaths in my district in New \nJersey, the Tenth Congressional District. One-third of all the gun \ndeaths in New Jersey last year happened in my district.\n  If we don't do something to tackle this epidemic, then we are failing \nour children. We are failing the next generation, to give them the hope \nand the possibilities of being a positive part of this community, such \nas we saw in Congressman Cedric Richmond.\n  In my district, African Americans face unemployment rates nearly \ntriple that of White workers. Generations of African American workers \nare being left behind, without a fair shot at success. The economic \nprosperity and the American Dream are on hold for many African American \ncommunities.\n  Instead of working to address these challenges facing our \ncommunities, Republicans continue their assault on women's health by \ntrying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  On the other hand, Democrats are working on bold, aggressive action \nthat will have an immediate impact on the challenges facing African \nAmericans.\n  I have tried to do my part here in Congress. My Safer Neighborhoods \nGun Buyback Act would create a voluntary Federal gun buyback program to \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands. That is just one measure that we have \nto look at.\n  But in talking about Dr. King's dream, it reminds me of A Tale of Two \nCities. This is the best of times and the worst of times.\n  Yes, we have seen an African American rise to the pinnacle of success \nin this country in public service in President Barack Obama. Dr. King \nwould be very proud of that.\n  But he would be upset to see the other part, the despair that our \ncommunities are in without the opportunities to raise their children as \nother communities do.\n  Dr. King was about equal opportunity for every man and woman. He \ndiscussed problems in Appalachia, he discussed problems in the South, \nand he discussed problems in the North.\n  So, yes, his main focus was the African American community. But \ninjustice somewhere is injustice anywhere, and he lived that motto. He \nwould be happy for some reasons, but in other areas he would be very \ndisappointed.\n  So it is our job to continue to push towards that dream, and we here \nin the Congressional Black Caucus are committed to pushing forward to \nsee his dream realized.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you, Congressman Payne, for bringing us those \nwords of wisdom and reminding us of the epidemics that face us, the \nfailures that we have experienced, but leaving us with the hope of \npushing forward and helping to realize Martin Luther King's dream.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed my honor now to yield to the freshman of \nour group, someone who may be a freshman by our description, but \nsomeone who is not a stranger.\n  Whether it is advocating for jobs for veterans, whether it is looking \nat economic development and opportunities for those who are in \nstruggling economies, she comes to us as a lawyer, she comes to us as a \nmother and a public servant.\n  She is someone who stands tall in her words of wisdom and someone's \nvoice that we have learned to listen to.\n  She hails to us as the Delegate from the Virgin Islands. Join me in \nwelcoming Congresswoman Stacy Plaskett for her words of wisdom.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much for allowing me this opportunity to \nbe here with my colleagues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so humbled and honored to be with the gentlewoman \nfrom Ohio, Joyce Beatty, who is an example to us freshmen and who \nfights, along with the gentleman of New York, Hakeem Jeffries, not just \nfor the people of their district and not just for African Americans, \nbut for all Americans, because that is what we are all here in this \nCongress to do.\n  By pointing out the inequalities, it is not to cast aspersions on all \nof America, but to make us to be better people than what we are today.\n  When Dr. King so eloquently delivered his famous ``I Have a Dream'' \nspeech 50 years ago, he did so with every hope and expectation that \nthat Nation would rise up and live out the true meaning of that creed. \nHe hoped that the tenet all men are created equal would, in fact, one \nday be a truth held self-evident.\n  We cannot allow simply moving past the glaring bigotries of Jim Crow, \nhowever, to be a benchmark for success. Doing so would ignore the more \nsubtle bigotries that continue today.\n  These subtle bigotries are, in fact, as deeply rooted and extreme in \ntheir effect as those glaring bigotries Dr. King and so many others \nfought vigorously and valiantly to overcome.\n\n[[Page H426]]\n\n  We are still achieving the dream. Today it is not just social \ninjustice, but also extreme inequality that constrains economic \nmobility for the African American community and, therefore, for all of \nAmerica.\n  Whether it is State-sanctioned attempts to roll back voting rights in \nAlabama, the outright denial of equal voting rights to citizens living \nin the Virgin Islands and other territories, or the years of neglect \nthat have led to the poisoning of residents in Flint, Michigan, the \npersistent wealth and opportunity divide in this country is rooted in \nthe legacy of racial discrimination dating back to Reconstruction and \nto slavery, indeed.\n  Although we have achieved much since the days of separate, but equal, \nthere are still structural barriers to achieving the American Dream for \ntoo many minority families in this country.\n\n  There is racial disparity in nearly every index of the American \nDream, and those disparities place families of color further behind in \ntheir plight to achieving the dream.\n  A recent study by the Corporation for Enterprise Development shows \nthat families of color are two times more likely to live below the \nFederal poverty level, almost two times more likely to lack liquid \nsavings, and are significantly more likely to have subprime credit \nscores.\n  A lack of liquid savings among families of color often lends to \nfurther disparity and wealth loss, as evidenced by the proportion of \nstudent debt by race and ethnicity.\n  African American college students rely more on student loans to pay \nfor college than do other racial groups and are less likely to pay off \nthe debt, according to a report by the Wisconsin HOPE Lab.\n  While unemployment in this country has fallen to 5 percent, African \nAmerican communities like my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands \ncontinue to experience double-digit unemployment rates.\n  Many of these communities of color have experienced decades of \nsystematic divestment of funding and resources that can only serve to \nwiden the wealth and opportunity gap.\n  That is benign neglect, a benign neglect that has led to failing \npublic and alternative education systems, crumbling infrastructure, \nand, in some cases, the slide to bankruptcy, bankruptcy not just due to \nmismanagement and corruption, which is the convenient answer, but a \nsystematic lack of investment, support, and adequate funding, which \ncauses places like Detroit, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands to \nmortgage their children's futures in bonds to make ends meet.\n  African Americans make up 13 percent of the population, but have only \n2.7 percent of total wealth.\n  This Congress has within its power to reverse the years of benign \nneglect to these communities through supporting legislation to invest \nin infrastructure and education through fighting against voter \nsuppression efforts and supporting student loans and other finance \nreforms.\n  Closing the wealth and opportunity gap should not be a dream in post-\nracial America. It is the responsibility of this Congress to uphold the \nprinciples to which we were founded, to not only adhere to those \npowerful words that preamble our Constitution, but also to provide for \nthe general welfare and ensure that justice, liberty, and prosperity \nare afforded to all and not just some.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands. \nLet me just say thank you for making us have a better understanding \nthat we cannot do this alone and we have so much more work to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight's Special Orders hour hopefully will share with \nthis institution the amount of work that we have yet to do. But I \nbelieve in hope and opportunity for all.\n  So when I listen to the great legacy that those who have come before \nus, whether that is Dr. Martin Luther King, whether that is Rosa Parks, \nwe have members of this Congressional Black Caucus who stand united to \nprovide opportunities for all.\n  We are often referred to as the conscience of the Congress. There is \na reason for that: Because we are the voice of the voiceless.\n  And when I think of voices, I think of my co-anchor. I think of a man \nwho came as my classmate, someone stellar, someone who is a scholar and \na profound lawyer, someone who stands tall in stature and in his words, \nsomeone that I actually enjoy sitting and listening to as he so often \nbrings the message.\n  It is my honor to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) \nto talk to us about the state of our union, Dr. King's dream, and \nAfrican Americans in this great Nation.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from \nOhio, Representative Beatty, my good friend, for those very kind words \nand, of course, for her tremendous leadership in anchoring and \nshepherding us here this evening in the same manner that she has done \nsince her arrival here in the House of Representatives, always \neloquent, erudite, and effervescent.\n  We appreciate that unique and tremendous combination of skill and \nability that you bring to the people that you represent so ably in \nColumbus, Ohio, and, of course, really, on behalf of America as you \nstand here anchoring this Congressional Black Caucus Special Orders \nhour.\n  I look forward to continuing to work together throughout the year as \nwe endeavor to speak truth to power here on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives and articulate issues of significance and importance to \nAfrican Americans in the United States of America and to all of \nAmerica.\n  Earlier today I made the observation that this is the first day of \nBlack History Month. Essentially, black history is American history. \nThe two are forever intertwined. That is why the subject matter of this \nspecial order is of particular importance.\n  Dr. King once made the observation that the arc of the moral universe \nis long, but it bends toward justice.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  I think what Dr. King was saying is that in this world you have got \nsome good folks and you have got some bad actors. But in order for \njustice to prevail, what you essentially need is a fair amount of the \ngood folks to come together, sacrifice, work hard, and dedicate \nthemselves to the cause of social change, and at the end of the day \njustice will prevail.\n  Make no mistake that in the United States of America, of course, it \nhas been a long and complicated march. We certainly have come a long \nway, but we still have a long way to go. During the founding of the \nRepublic back in 1776, in the DNA of this great country was embedded \nthe principles of liberty and justice for all. It was a great document \nand a great start. Embedded in the DNA of this country was fairness, \nequality, and opportunity for everyone. But there was a genetic defect \ncalled chattel slavery that was also attendant to our birth.\n  If you are going to have any discussion about where we are in America \ntoday, you have got to recognize there was a genetic defect that has \nimpacted the arc of the African American community here in America and \nthe American story, and that genetic defect of chattel slavery stayed \nwith us, of course, until the war ended in 1865. Millions of African \nAmerican slaves were subjugated. It was one of the worst crimes ever \nperpetrated in the history of humanity. It finally ended in 1865 with \nthe adoption of the 13th Amendment. Of course, we know that the 14th \nAmendment and the 15th Amendment followed, equal protection under the \nlaw for everyone, 14th Amendment, and the 15th Amendment was designed \nto guarantee the right to vote. The so-called Reconstruction period \nlasted until the middle of the 1870s, but it was largely abandoned \nthereafter.\n  The African Americans, of course, were given a raw, bad deal. How can \nyou cure the genetic defect of chattel slavery with three \nconstitutional amendments without ever really forcefully implementing \nthem and within a decade or so abandoning the principles inherent in \nthose constitutional amendments? In place we received the Black Codes, \nJim Crow, segregation, and an intense lynching campaign unleashed on \nAfrican Americans in the South, in the Midwest, in the far West, and \nother parts of the United States of America. So we went from chattel \nslavery, a brief period of Reconstruction, then you give us Jim Crow.\n  So we dealt with Jim Crow which was at least in principle abolished \non paper\n\n[[Page H427]]\n\nwhen the Supreme Court makes the decision in Brown v. Board of \nEducation that separate but equal was just a farce. It was a joke. It \nwasn't real. So the Supreme Court exposes that, but then says, go ahead \nand implement it with all deliberate speed. Which basically meant don't \nreally implement it with any urgency, any immediacy, any impactful \nfashion, just take your time and do it at your own pace.\n  So as we are trying to deal with Jim Crow, then you have, of course, \nDr. King and leaders of the civil rights movement, John Lewis, whom \nCongresswoman Beatty and I are so privileged to serve with, A. Philip \nRandolph, Roy Wilkins, James Farmer, and so many others. The civil \nrights movement deals with the lingering effects of our original \ngenetic defect of chattel slavery replaced by Jim Crow.\n  Then in the 1960s, we get the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting \nRights Act, the 1968 Fair Housing Act, Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, \nand efforts to try to finally correct the injustices that have been \nrace based here in America. Like Reconstruction, which lasted for a \nlittle over a decade, we get this period of dramatic social change, \nmainly in the early and mid-1960s that is quickly abandoned and taken \nadvantage of by Richard Nixon in 1968 with the Southern strategy White \nbacklash, particularly in the Deep South, compounded in 1971 when \nPresident Richard Nixon makes the statement that drug abuse is public \nenemy number one. Essentially, the War on Drugs ushered in an era of \nmass incarceration.\n  When President Nixon made that statement, there were less than \n350,000 people incarcerated in America. Today, 40-plus years later, \nafter the War on Drugs, so called, was started, 2.3 million people, \nmore than 1 million African American men, disproportionately and \nadversely impacting communities of color and as has been mentioned \nearlier, incarcerate more people in America than any other country in \nthe world, a country where we over-incarcerate and under educate.\n  We have made a lot of progress in America. African Americans as a \ncollective community really haven't been given any room to breathe \nbecause we have gone from chattel slavery--the original birth defect in \nthis great Republic--to Jim Crow, to mass incarceration with brief \nperiods of Reconstruction and civil rights era mixed in between. And \nyou wonder why we are in the situation that we are in right now.\n  We have made a lot of progress. Obviously the fact that Barack Obama \nis sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is a significant development, \nbut as Dr. King says, he talked about an arc, which means that similar \nto what Abraham Lincoln once said, that we have to continue a march \ntoward a more perfect Union, the Congressional Black Caucus with \nleadership from dynamic representatives like Joyce Beatty, have put \nforth a series of things to benefit not just the African American \ncommunity, but all communities, to help bring the promise of American \ndemocracy to life.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back to my good friend, \nRepresentative Beatty.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much to my colleague. As I stood here and I \nlistened to you walk us through that rich history, it reminded me of \nall of the bad actors that caused many of those bad things. I reflect \non someone in my family being a part of that chattel slavery as a \nslave, I think about Jim Crow, and I think about the things that my \ngrandmother was asked to do when she had walked far just to try to vote \nand was asked to recite things that probably the people asking her \ncould not have done.\n  Then when I think about all of those social reforms and all the \nthings that happened 50 and 55 years ago, it made me think, Congressman \nJeffries, when we think about Martin Luther King and his dream, so \noften people say, ``What would he think today?'' But I guess for me the \nquestion is a little different that I would like to discuss with you. \nDo you think history is repeating itself?\n\n  As I listened to you talk about slavery, and today when I go into \nsome parts of my community with the War on Drugs I have had Black men \nsay to me that they feel like they are living during a time of slavery. \nWhen I talk to young, single moms who are fighting for their own \nexistence or to feed their children, they feel that they are held \ncaptive by poverty.\n  So are we looking at still bad actors, bad actors in the Chambers \nthat I stand in, bad actors who want to take away SNAP, bad actors who \ndon't want to give us a voting rights bill, bad actors that don't want \nto ban the box?\n  What do you think? Are we seeing history repeat itself?\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. It is a great question. Unfortunately sort of the arc \nof history here in this great country of ours is that whenever progress \nhas been made it has been followed by a backlash. Progress was made \nwith the Reconstruction amendments. It was followed by a backlash that \ngave us Jim Crow, the Black Codes, and an explosion of lynching in the \nSouth. Progress, of course, was made in the 1960s with the Civil Rights \nAct, the Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act immediately followed \nby Richard Nixon's Southern strategy, and a backlash against things \nlike affirmative action which had barely been put into motion and a \nrollback of the War on Poverty which was designed to help African \nAmericans and all Americans of every race.\n  Then, of course, many thought that we perhaps had reached a post-\nracial America in the aftermath of the election of President Barack \nObama, but we know, of course, that that is not the case sadly.\n  I am hopeful, however, that many of my colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats, Conservatives and Progressives who have come together, folks \nlike Raul Labrador, Trey Gowdy, and Jason Chaffetz--good friends of \nmine on the other side of the aisle--recognize the importance of \ndealing with mass incarceration for America.\n  Here are a few statistics that I think we need to be concerned about \nas it relates to your question. African Americans serve virtually as \nmuch time in prison for a nonviolent drug offense, approximately 58 \nmonths, as White Americans do for a violent criminal offense, 62 \nmonths. Whites in America statistically use drugs five times as often \nas African Americans, yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug \noffenses at 10 times the rate of White Americans.\n  Lastly, African Americans represent 83 percent of crack cocaine \nFederal defendants, but only 28 percent of users--83 percent are \ndefendants, 28 percent are users; whereas, White Americans represent \n5.8 percent of Federal defendants but 62 percent of users.\n  Something is wrong. Justice is not colorblind in America. So \nhopefully we will find the ability to come together to deal with the \noverall broken criminal justice system and certainly as part of that \nrectify some of the racial disparities that exist.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much.\n  Let me just end by saying, Mr. Speaker, what you have witnessed \ntonight is that our past that we have talked about is our experience, \nour present is our responsibility, and our future is our hope.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King's \nvision of ending inequality through providing jobs, justice, and peace \nto all Americans is a vision that many have fought and died to make a \nreality. As the Civil Rights Movement battled against discrimination \nand inequality in the 1960's, I adopted Dr. King's vision of jobs, \njustice, and peace when I ran for Congress in 1964. I remember the Jim \nCrow era, poll taxes, and institutionalized segregation when I arrived \nin Congress. Yet, for all of these institutional scars and \ndiscriminatory impediments, the work we did in Congress aided in \nfulfilling the promises of equality enshrined in our Constitution. \nAfter a historic effort, the Civil Rights Act was passed, the Voting \nRights Act was adopted, and a new era of federal protections around \nequality was ushered in the 20th Century.\n  Some fifty years later, this era has yet to be fully realized. While \nthe initial challenges of recognizing and upholding civil rights have \nbeen met, many of the original problems persist, but in an evolved \nform. Fifty plus years later, the American people confront issues of \nvoter suppression, gender and sexual orientation discrimination. Many \ncommunities feel under siege from those sworn to protect their liberty. \nHate crimes and religious intolerance are on the rise as reported \nnightly on the\n\n[[Page H428]]\n\nnews. And women contend with a pay inequity hampering their standing \nwith men in the workplace.\n  In spite of all of these shortcomings, strides have been made: \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act in 2006; the passage of legislation \nexpanding access to healthcare; the introduction of legislation \ncombating voter caging and deceptive practices, and the passage of the \nHate Crimes Prevention Act, signed into law by the first African-\nAmerican President of the United States, himself emblematic of civil \nrights progress.\n  These issues were all, at one point in time, deemed radical. Women's \nsuffrage, racial equality, and now gay and lesbian rights: for each, \nthe civil rights movement has expanded until true justice is achieved. \nMany problems persist and more are certain to arrive, but through \nrenewed determination to tackle these deep-seated problems, we can one \nday live up to the beloved community envision by Dr. King.\n  While our struggle for equality stems from being afforded the basic \nhuman rights associated with a free society, the ideal of achieving \neconomic justice, with employment for all who seek it, remains out of \nreach for many. The aftermath of the financial crisis has brought \ncrippling unemployment, wage stagnation, and rising income inequality. \nYet, the Great Recession has only exacerbated a decades-long decline in \nthe fortunes of the working and middle classes. As finances continue to \ndeteriorate, basic social and public services have often been the first \nto go.\n  In the realm of healthcare, a basic safety net was only recently \nafforded to the underserved in the United States with passage of the \nAffordable Care Act, yet millions of low-income and unemployed \nindividuals remain uninsured. Housing remains a continued blight, as \nmass-foreclosures following the aftermath of the Great Recession tear \napart communities and destabilizes families.\n  Even after fifty years of promoting Dr. King's cause for peace, our \ncountry is enmeshed in gun violence, which tragically produced the \nshootings in Newtown, Aurora, Tucson, and Wisconsin, and daily on the \nstreets of America's most populated cities. These horrific occurrences \nare unacceptable for our nation, which is why catapulting peace to the \nforefront of our nation's agenda will save lives and protect our most \nvital right under the Constitution: life. I am hopeful that by \nstrengthening our gun laws we can remove military style weapons out of \nour communities, prohibit the sale of deadly gun clips, and close \nloopholes on the sale of guns.\n  Our rate of incarceration and length of sentences are unjust and \nunsustainable. The United States incarcerates 25 percent of the world's \nprisoners, while we have only five percent of the world's population. \nAnd we disproportionately prosecute and incarcerate African Americans \nmore than any other race. This is the result of what President Obama \nhas called a ``huge explosion'' in our incarceration rates, with \n500,000 people imprisoned in America in 1980 growing to 2.2 million \ntoday. We must change our prosecution policies and sentencing laws to \naddress this crisis, and I am working with my colleagues to do that.\n  The profiling of racial and religious minorities is also a terrible \nreality that threatens peace in our nation. Profiling is an archaic \nform of discrimination that subjects individuals to criminal \nindictments or investigations based on their race or religion. Although \nprofiling cannot be found in any form of written law, the practice is \nreal in America and threatens the trust and peace that is essential in \nthe relationship between citizens and their law enforcement. Our \nnation's leaders can work to pass legislation, such as the End Racial \nProfiling Act, to prohibit this practice in any law enforcement agency \nand the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act to provide real \nstandards for the operation of police departments.\n  As we press forward to address inequality in the 21st Century, the \noutstanding question is whether or not Congress will rise to tackle \nthese issues. The American people have already witnessed how politics \ncan transform our legislative body into a body producing nothing but \ndysfunction. However, the erosion of Congress's focus on protecting \ncivil rights and civil liberties can be reversed.\n  This Congress has the opportunity to answer these present injustices \nby assuming the unwavering commitment to jobs, justice, and peace that \nwas displayed so valiantly by Dr. Martin Luther King. Ending inequality \nin America is a battle that can be won, and although the enemy is still \nthe same, our approach in the 21st century must not lack the strength \nand courage of those who have fought so bravely before us.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this February we recognize and \ncelebrate the 39th commemoration of Black History Month.\n  This month we celebrate the contributions of African Americans to the \nhistory of our great nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pioneers, \nheroes, and leaders like Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Supreme \nCourt Justice Thurgood Marshall, U.S. Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce, U.S. \nCongresswoman Barbara Jordan, U.S. Congressman Mickey Leland, \nAstronauts Dr. Guion Stewart Bluford Jr. and Mae C. Jemison, Frederick \nDouglass, Booker T. Washington, James Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa \nParks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks just to name a \nfew of the countless number of well-known and unsung heroes whose \ncontributions have helped our nation become a more perfect union.\n  The history of the United States has been marked by the great \ncontributions of African American activists, leaders, writers, and \nartists.\n  As a member of Congress, I know that I stand on the shoulders of \ngiants whose struggles and triumphs made it possible for me to stand \nhere today and continue the fight for equality, justice, and progress \nfor all, regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.\n  The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs. Ivalita ``Ivy'' Jackson, \na vocational nurse, and Mr. Ezra A. Jackson, one of the first African-\nAmericans to succeed in the comic book publishing business.\n  They were my beloved parents and they taught me the value of \neducation, hard work, discipline, perseverance, and caring for others.\n  And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn Lee, my husband and the \nfirst tenured African American law professor at the University of \nHouston.\n  Mr. Speaker, I particularly wish to acknowledge the contributions of \nAfrican American veterans in defending from foreign aggressors and who \nby their courageous examples helped transform our nation from a \nsegregated society to a nation committed to the never ending challenge \nof perfecting our union.\n  Last year about this time, I was honored to join my colleagues, \nCongressmen John Lewis and Congressman Charles Rangel, a Korean War \nveteran, in paying tribute to surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen \nand the 555th Parachute Infantry, the famed ``Triple Nickels'' at a \nmoving ceremony sponsored by the U.S. Army commemorating the 50th \nAnniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n  The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in escorting bombers during World \nWar II--achieving one of the lowest loss records of all the escort \nfighter groups, and being in constant demand for their services by the \nallied bomber units--is a record unmatched by any other fighter group.\n  So impressive and astounding were the feats of the Tuskegee Airmen \nthat in 1948 they persuaded President Harry Truman to issue his famous \nExecutive Order No. 9981, which directed equality of treatment and \nopportunity in all of the United States Armed Forces and led to the end \nof racial segregation in the U.S. military forces.\n  It is a source of enormous and enduring pride that my father-in-law, \nPhillip Ferguson Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen.\n  Clearly, what began as an experiment to determine whether ``colored'' \nsoldiers were capable of operating expensive and complex combat \naircraft ended as an unqualified success based on the experience of the \nTuskegee Airmen, whose record included 261 aircraft destroyed, 148 \naircraft damaged, 15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions over Italy \nand North Africa.\n  They also destroyed or damaged over 950 units of ground \ntransportation and escorted more than 200 bombing missions. They proved \nthat ``the antidote to racism is excellence in performance,'' as \nretired Lt. Col. Herbert Carter once remarked.\n  Mr. Speaker, Black History Month is also a time to remember many \npioneering women like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; activists \nHarriet Tubman and Rosa Parks; astronaut Mae C. Jemison; authors Maya \nAngelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom have each in \ntheir own way, whether through courageous activism, cultural \ncontributions, or artistic creativity, forged social and political \nchange, and forever changed our great Nation for the better.\n  It is also fitting, Mr. Speaker, that in addition to those national \nleaders whose contributions\n\n[[Page H429]]\n\nhave made our nation better, we honor also those who have and are \nmaking a difference in their local communities.\n  In my home city of Houston, there are numerous great men and women. \nThey are great because they have heeded the counsel of Dr. King who \nsaid:\n  ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You only need a \nheart full of grace. A soul generated by love.''\n  By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to some of the great men and \nwomen of Houston:\n  1. Rev. F.N. Williams, Sr.\n  2. Rev.

Ms. Lenora ``Doll'' Carter\n  As we celebrate Black History Month, let us pay tribute to those who \nhave come before us, and pay forward to future generations by \naddressing what is the number one issue for African American families, \nand all American families today: preserving the American promise of \neconomic opportunity for all.\n  Our immediate focus must be job creation, and enacting legislation \nthat will foster and lay the foundation for today's and tomorrow's \ngeneration of groundbreaking activists, leaders, scientists, writers \nand artists to continue contributing to the greatness of America.\n  We must work to get Americans back to work.\n  We must continue to preserve the American Dream for all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here in celebration of the heroic \nand historic acts of African Americans and their indispensable \ncontributions to this great Nation.\n  It is through our work in creating possibilities for today and future \ngenerations that we best honor the accomplishments and legacy of our \npredecessors.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when President \nBarack Obama delivered his final State of the Union address last month, \nhe highlighted the resilience and determination of the American people. \nThe President touted notable achievements in scientific advancement, \ngreater transparency throughout our political system, and a stronger \nand more equitable economy as evidence pointing to the strength of our \nNation.\n  For context, in the final month of President George W. Bush's \npresidency, the economy was in free fall. The private sector lost \nnearly 820,000 jobs in the final month of President Bush's presidency \nalone and unemployment peaked at around 10 percent in the midst of the \nGreat Recession. Today, the economy has added 14.1 million jobs over 70 \nconsecutive months of private-sector job growth, household wealth has \nincreased by more than $30 trillion, and average home prices have \nrecovered to pre-recession levels under President Obama's \nAdministration. However, economic indicators are not the only method \nfor determining the true state of our union.\n  As we celebrate Black History Month in February, it is timely to \nconsider how other great leaders from our past would perceive the state \nof our union today. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is one such leader who \nenvisioned a greater future for our Nation in the face of unspeakable \ndiscrimination and intolerance. In his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech \ndelivered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., Dr. King laid \nout his vision of our country where all men are created equal and where \nfreedom must ring if America is to be a great nation.\n  Today, those principles ring true. We have made great progress as a \nnation to move away from the darkest moments of our past. Yet, there is \nstill much work to be done. We have witnessed continued efforts to \ndisenfranchise select groups of voters by gutting the Voting Rights Act \nand persistent racial tension between law enforcement and the \ncommunities they are sworn to protect. It is a constant struggle that \nafflicts communities all across the United States and suggests that \nmore work needs to be done if we are to achieve Dr. King's dream.\n  Mr. Speaker, the freedoms we enjoy in the United States are not \nabsolute. The principles and values that define our Nation are \nconstantly challenged and ever-evolving. Dr. King had a distinct vision \nfor the future of our Nation and his legacy can help guide our \ndecisions moving into the future so that we can avoid making the same \nmistakes of our past.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, each February our nation takes time to \nreflect on the countless contributions African Americans have made to \nthis country's history. We celebrate innovators like Ohio District 11's \nown Langston Hughes, pioneers like astronaut Mae Jamison, as well as \npolitical and civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  Black History Month represents inclusion and innovation. It promotes \nAmerica at its best. For in this month, we appreciate our collective \nstrength and recognize the diversity of each and every patriot.\n  America is a country of immigrants, and our power lies in our \ndifferences. To quote Dr. King, ``We may have all come on different \nships, but we're in the same boat now.''\n  No matter how we arrived, every American should have access to the \nsame opportunity. Every individual should be able to reach his or her \nown potential and succeed in the home of the free and the land of the \nbrave.\n  Unfortunately, many do not have equitable access to opportunity. This \nis why the Congressional Black Caucus stands today.\n  Despite the contributions and sacrifice of African Americans, many \nstill suffer from the effects of historic injustice and prejudice. We \nare almost three times more likely to live in poverty than Whites, and \nsix times more likely to be put in jail. Our unemployment rate is \nnearly two times the rates of Whites. When we do find work, we make \nless than our White counterparts.\n  As Black America reflects on its current situation, many tend to ask \nquestions such as, ``What would Dr. King do?'' or ``How would the civil \nrights leaders of the past address the issues of the present?''\n  If Dr. King was alive today, I believe he would certainly be proud of \nwho we are. But he would also say that we must commit ourselves to \nmoving forward together as one people and one nation.\n  It is time we ``fix our politics.'' Not just in Washington, but \neverywhere.\n  As President Barack Obama stated recently, ``We are in a time of \nextraordinary change.'' The Members of this House have the opportunity \nto pass policies that reverse years of bigotry and injustice and level \nthe playing field for all.\n  This Black History Month, I urge my Congressional colleagues to \ncelebrate through legislative action. Develop a new formula to ensure \nthe right to vote for all Americans. Reauthorize the Higher Education \nAct to help more kids go to college. Combat harsh sentencing through \ncriminal justice reform.\n  These actions won't just honor a race of people. They will further \nthe hope and success of an entire nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/house-section/article/H429-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Jody B.
