The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we witnessed thugs, \ntyrants, and dictators from Russia, Iran, and Cuba speak before the \nGeneral Assembly at the United Nations; and with straight faces, each \nclaimed to be defenders of peace, of international standards, of human \nrights, principles that Putin, Rouhani, and Castro have made a living \nout of ignoring and abusing to the detriment of the people who live \nunder their oppressive rule.\n  President Obama had an opportunity to set the tone, to call for \nreforms at the badly mismanaged United Nations, to challenge the status \nquo and reestablish America's leadership and credibility. Instead, he \nused it as an opportunity to pay lip service to American ideals and \nvalues and to abdicate America's role as a world leader, a void that is \nnow being filled by our adversaries like Russia, Iran, China, and \nSyria.\n  The Russians continue their aggressive actions in Ukraine and are now \nsending military hardware to the murderous Assad regime. Iran has had a \nrecord number of hangings since the so-called moderate leader, Rouhani, \ntook office, and thousands of ethnic and religious minorities are \nimprisoned and sentenced to death.\n  The President has done everything in his power not to upset the \nIranians because he doesn't want to ruin the chance for a nuclear deal, \na deal which will cause a nuclear and conventional arms race in the \nregion, and his words yesterday proved to be empty rhetoric when \nmatched to his policies and actions in the past.\n  Not to be outdone, Raul Castro doubled down on his intransigence, \nfurther demonstrating that the Obama administration offered concessions \nto the regime, which have resulted in even greater oppression by that \nhated Cuban dictatorship. But per usual with the President, it was the \n``blame America first'' narrative that he was trying to peddle with his \nmisguided policies toward Cuba.\n  President Obama used this opportunity to undermine the United States \nCongress, and perhaps foreshadowing an eventual abstention on the U.N. \nvote on the Cuban embargo, he stated:\n\n       I'm confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an \n     embargo that should not be in place anymore.\n\n  President Obama failed once again to put the onus on the Castro \nregime to release all political prisoners, to hold free and fair \nelections, and to respect human rights in order for us to lift the \nembargo. The Cuban embargo language in the law is clear on all the \nconditions, Mr. Speaker, conditions that have to be met in order for it \nto be lifted, conditions that the Castro regime has no interest in \nabiding by.\n  President Obama should stop ignoring current law and stop loosening \nregulations on a regime that has done nothing to deserve this praise. \nThe Castro regime is the one responsible for the human rights \nviolations occurring in Cuba and the constant beatings against pro-\ndemocracy leaders. The U.S. embargo cannot be held responsible for \nthat.\n  Does Castro say: ``Oh, I had to beat the very peaceful group Ladies \nin White walking to church because the embargo says I must beat their \nheads in?'' Does Castro say: ``Oh, I cannot have any political party \noperating in Cuba other than the Communist Party because the embargo \nhas me, obligates me, to only have this political party operating?'' \nDoes he say: ``I cannot respect human rights in Cuba because that nasty \nU.S. embargo forces me to violate human rights?'' Of course not. That \nis lunacy. That is a responsibility that only Castro can claim. The \nCastro regime instead has done nothing--nada--to unclench its iron \nfist.\n  Mr. Speaker, President Obama's remarks yesterday at the U.N. made him \npart of the problem with what is wrong at that broken institution; and, \nonce again, it highlighted that his misplaced priorities and misguided \nforeign policies have not kept our country any safer.\n  That is why it is up to us in Congress to be proactive and to push \nfor reforms at the United Nations. That is why this week I am \nreintroducing my U.N. Transparency Accountability and Reform Act. My \nbill would fundamentally change the way that we fund this failed\n\n[[Page H6310]]\n\ninstitution by shifting the funding mechanism from assessed to \nvoluntary contributions in order to make the organization more \neffective and accountable to its objectives.\n  For example, the Human Rights Council does not deserve our assistance \nwhen countries like Cuba, China, Venezuela, some of the world's worst \nhuman rights violators, push a decidedly anti-American, anti-Israel \nagenda at the Council. We should not fund these bodies at the U.N. We \nshould only fund the ones that we believe are working, the ones that \nare transparent, the ones who are accountable to the member states that \ndonate their budgets.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration has had 7 years to implement \nreforms, and it has failed. It is time for Congress to take the lead, \nand I urge my colleagues to sign up to my bill this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6310-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LET STATES SET MARIJUANA POLICY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, amidst all the turmoil on the world \nstage, I think many of us are still processing the visit from Pope \nFrancis last week, his call for us to care for the planet, for our \nfellow man, for all of God's creatures.\n  In the background here on Capitol Hill, there is more than a little \nturmoil in terms of what is going to happen after the resignation of \nSpeaker Boehner. There looks to be a little good news that we will \navert a government shutdown, at least for a few months, as we continue \nto have the misdirected crusade to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  I have been focusing on the epidemic of deaths from prescription drug \nabuse and heroin overdoses. Mr. Speaker, it is something that is \ncreating problems from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine; yet, in \nthe midst of that epidemic, there was a stark symbol of our dysfunction \non something that most Americans now think should be legal.\n  There are over 200 million Americans that live in States where they \ncan get access to medical marijuana. Four States and the District of \nColumbia have legalized adult use, and more States are going to be \nvoting on it again this year; yet we have arrested over 7 million \npeople over the last 10 years, costing billions of dollars.\n  It can turn lives upside down, particularly lives of young men of \ncolor, especially African Americans, who are arrested many times more \noften even though their use is the same as White young men. It fuels \nthat frustration that one can understand in the African American \ncommunity.\n  I would suggest that it is time for us to focus law enforcement \nresources on real drug problems, deal with that epidemic of \nprescription drug abuse and heroin overdose. Let's deal with making \nsure that our children are safe rather than at risk from a vast \nunderground drug distribution network.\naccounts, so this is an attractive source of revenue for people who \nwould like to rob them.\n  Let's let the States make their own policy until we reclassify \nmarijuana, frankly, no less dangerous than tobacco, which is completely \nlegal in every State. In the meantime, we should at least stay out of \nthe way, let States formulate their own policy, and have local \nauthorities deal with real problems, not creating unnecessary ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6310-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, for many in California, including my own \nfamily and my neighbors, it is an exciting time this year. This is \nharvest time. Busy, but again, a very enjoyable time we all look \nforward to as farmers and ranchers. You see more combines, shakers, and \nsweepers running from sunrise to sunset working to fill the next \ntruckload with this season's crops. And you see the men and women \nresponsible for producing nearly half of all U.S.-grown vegetables, \nnuts, and fruits.\n  But this year's harvest in the north State paints a much different \npicture, one with fallowing fields, wells that are going dry, and less \nand less truckloads of crops leaving those farms. As a farmer myself, \nwe know it is the last truckload that leaves the field that is the one \nyou make your living on.\n  From the grapes in world-renowned wines to almonds and pistachios, \nexports are down and production is lower, causing a troubling ripple \neffect in the region and across our Nation's economy in the form of \nlost jobs and revenue and less choices for high-quality crops grown by \nAmericans for our American consumers.\n  The numbers for this year are without a doubt very troubling. On-farm \ngate prices are down, and farm yields per acre are down. According to a \nrecent UC Davis study, just California alone is set to lose about $2.7 \nbillion due to the drought. Farm employment is down by over 10,000 jobs \nthis year, as well as the 21,000 or so indirect jobs that will also be \nlost by those involved in the production and processing of farm crops.\n  Labor income is estimated to fall by at least $716 million, being \nreplaced by an already troubled and strapped unemployment. Direct crop \nrevenue losses are going to be up to $900 million, straight out of \ngrower's pockets. In addition, the rice harvest is expected to cover \nonly 375,000 acres, down from a peak number of 560,000 acres. The \nalmond supply is expected to decrease by 4 percent, potentially losing \nmarket share to foreign interests. California dairy production is down \nby at least 3 percent, costing an estimated $250 million, a number that \nhas shown significant increases in other States as well this year. \nAlfalfa hay shipments are significantly lower than last year, and the \nlivestock industry faces losses of an estimated $100 million in order \nto replace it.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are real numbers that are only set to get worse. \nWe cannot simply stand by and watch as farmers, ranchers, small town \neconomies, and ag employees face more water rationing and fallowed \nfields.\n  California and the West cannot afford another year of inaction from \nCongress. I rise today to urge my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in both House and Senate to come to the table and advance \ncommonsense drought solutions, such as new water storage and \ninfrastructure, to provide relief now and in the future such as Sites \nReservoir up in northern California and desalination projects for our \ncities. Let's get them permitted, let's get them approved and in the \npipeline. We can't wait any longer. We need these reforms, indeed, now \nand for the future. Our State is growing, the population is growing, \nand we grow the finest and best crops and export them not only to the \nrest of the country, but to much of the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, not doing anything now or this year is a dereliction of \nour responsibility and betrays Americans who expect us to provide the \nproducts they consume and enjoy these fine ag products that, indeed, \ngive America the reputation as being the breadbasket of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6310-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6310-H6311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n                             END HUNGER NOW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, while there is talk of a 2-month spending \nbill to keep the government open before time runs out this week, we \nhave yet to see it. Passing a short-term bill will only postpone a \nRepublican shutdown, not stop it. As long as it remains a possibility, \nwe need to talk about the cost to everyday families.\n  Unlike the last Republican shutdown in 2013, closing the government's \ndoors this time around means millions and millions of Americans may be \ncut off from their Federal food assistance benefits.\n  Forty-five million Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, or SNAP, to help put food on the table. SNAP is our \nNation's premier antihunger program, and it is one of the most \neffective and efficient of any Federal programs.\n  Two-thirds of all SNAP recipients are the most vulnerable among us: \nchildren, seniors, and the disabled. Millions more are working families \nwho\n\n[[Page H6311]]\n\nmay be working one, two, or three jobs just to make ends meet, and \nsometimes it is still not enough. SNAP is a critical program that \nmillions of Americans depend on to keep from going hungry.\n  Mr. Speaker, during the last Republican shutdown in 2013, SNAP had \ncontingency funds available from the stimulus law that meant SNAP \nbenefits continued uninterrupted. But stimulus funding was cut off in \nNovember of 2013. So this time around there is no back-up plan for \nSNAP.\n  Current law prevents the U.S. Department of Agriculture from spending \nSNAP money it doesn't have. Without congressional action, USDA will be \nforced to shut off retailers from accepting SNAP benefits within the \nfirst few days of October.\n  That means families won't be able to use their SNAP benefits to \npurchase food at any store that normally accepts SNAP, including \ngrocery stores, big-box retailers, and corner stores.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unfathomable to me that this would happen, that \nRepublicans would threaten the food benefits of tens of millions of \nAmerican children, families, and seniors, all just to score political \npoints with their right-wing base. Whether Republicans shut down the \ngovernment this week or in December, it is unacceptable to leave \nstruggling families out in the cold.\n  As our economy continues to recover, I would remind my colleagues \nthat SNAP is one of the quickest, most effective economic multipliers \nwe have. Every $1 in SNAP benefits generates about $1.70 in economic \nactivity.\n  About 80 percent of SNAP benefits are redeemed within 2 weeks of \nreceipt, and about 97 percent are spent within a month. Every day SNAP \npumps money back into our local economies and supports local \nbusinesses.\n  SNAP benefits can only be spent on food, meaning that a family can \nuse its other income to meet its other essential needs, like paying \nrent, utilities, and medical care.\n  Mr. Speaker, not only would a government shutdown have a devastating \nimpact on hungry families, it has the potential to result in serious \neconomic harm to retailers that could ripple throughout our economy.\n  Already food banks, food pantries, and soup kitchens are bracing to \nserve an influx of clients if SNAP benefits are cut off. But despite \nthe incredible work they do, these charities are already overburdened. \nThe demand for food assistance is incredibly high.\n  They are working tirelessly every day to meet the need, and charities \nare already forced to pick up the slack from an inadequate SNAP \nbenefit. All too often the benefit runs out before the end of the month \nand families must turn to charities just to cobble together enough to \neat.\n  I cannot begin to imagine how overwhelmed antihunger agencies will be \nif millions of Americans lose access to SNAP next month or the month \nafter. Unfortunately, in a Republican-controlled Congress with the \nhabit of going from one crisis to the next, this scenario is all too \nrealistic.\n  A government shutdown would literally take food away from hungry \nAmericans. It would be devastating for millions of Americans that are \nalready struggling to put food on the table and make ends meet. \nFamilies who rely on SNAP cannot afford to have their food benefits \ndisrupted even for a day.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should be working to end hunger now, not making \nhunger worse in this country, the richest country in the world. Quite \nfrankly, it is unconscionable we are even in a situation where millions \nof hungry people are at risk of losing their food benefit.\n  Last week Pope Francis delivered an inspiring message to Congress. It \nis unthinkable that we could so quickly forget his call for compassion \nin helping the least among us. For millions of American families who \nare already struggling to put food on the table, we should be giving \nthem a hand up, not taking food away.\n  Nobody in this Chamber will go without food if the Republicans shut \ndown the government. None of our kids will go without food, but \nmillions and millions of our fellow citizens will.\n  For the sake of 45 million Americans across the country and more than \n700,000 in Massachusetts who depend on SNAP, I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to work with Democrats on a long-term, bipartisan budget \nthat puts families first. Families who rely on SNAP shouldn't have to \nworry about losing their benefits at the end of every short-term \nfunding bill.\n  Whether it is this week or in December, our most vulnerable families \nsimply cannot afford another government shutdown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6311-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SPRUCE KNOB-SENECA ROCKS NATIONAL RECREATION AREA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the \ntime to recognize Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks on their 50th year as a \nnational recreation area.\n  Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area was established by \nan act of Congress on September 28, 1965, and has been enjoyed by \nfamilies from all over the country ever since.\n  It is located in Pendleton County in the eastern panhandle area of my \ndistrict in West Virginia. I was lucky enough to have had the privilege \nto visit just last month.\n  As the only true peak on the East Coast of the United States, it \nlures rock climbers from all around and boasts some of the most \nspectacular scenery on this side of the Mississippi.\n  Let me tell you, it is even more beautiful in person. Don't take my \nword for it, though. I encourage everyone to plan a trip to this \nnational treasure.\n\n\n                         Life at Conception Act\n\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the \ntime to recognize the historic event that took place last week. On \nSeptember 24, 2015, his Holiness Pope Francis became the first Pope to \never address Congress.\n  I would like to thank all that were involved in this planning process \nthat led to this significant event, especially Speaker John Boehner. It \nwas truly an honor to take part in the first papal address to Congress.\n  Pope Francis' message was one of hope and love, and it reminded us \nthat we need to keep fighting for the sanctity of life, marriage, \nfamily, and religious liberty.\n  Pope Francis clearly stated that there is a moral obligation to \nprotect unborn babies. Protecting the unborn is one of the issues that \ncompelled me to run for political office in the first place, and I am \ncommitted to continuing to fight in Congress.\n  During his address, the Pope said:\n\n       The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to \n     protect and defend human life at every stage of its \n     development. I am convinced that this is the best way, since \n     every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an \n     inalienable dignity.\n\n  I am proud to be the lead sponsor of H.R. 816, the Life at Conception \nAct. The Life at Conception Act is a necessary component in the long-\nterm protection of the unborn. In the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the \nSupreme Court justices wrote that, since the beginning of life is not \ndefined by law, it is open to interpretation.\n  The Life at Conception Act simply defines by Congress that the life \nof a child begins at conception. Establishing personhood will protect \nthe right to life of unborn children who are the most defenseless among \nus and need our protection.\n  This bill sets a standard for promoting and encouraging a culture of \nlife. If enacted, it would simply affirm that unborn children are \ndeserving of protection.\n  We currently have 122 cosponsors of this important bill. I encourage \nmy colleagues in the House to cosponsor as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6311-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6311-H6312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BIPARTISAN BUDGET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, this Congress is making a habit, \nunfortunately, of acting in crisis mode, which is irresponsible and \ndoes a disservice to the fate and the trust that the American public \nhas placed in us as their elected representatives, and this has a \ndirect bearing on our economy. The Pope spoke to the need for us to \ncome together and negotiate bipartisan solutions for the many \nchallenges facing the United States and the world.\n  The first and most pressing issue is to fund government. Thankfully, \ntomorrow the House is expected to vote\n\n[[Page H6312]]\n\non a short-term continuing resolution to do just that. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote in favor of a clean continuing resolution to avert \na government shutdown. There is no justification to shut down \ngovernment. Yes, we have our differences. We negotiate that in a budget \nprocess.\n  However, we know that this is a short-term fix and that a real \nsolution to fixing our Nation's very real and very serious budget \nproblems is in producing a long-term budget, and we should do that in \nDecember.\n  Instead of moving from one crisis to another crisis, we must get back \nto the work of governing responsibly. Responsible governance requires \nthat we come together, work hard, compromise on a bipartisan budget \nthat will not result in poorly thought-out, across-the-board spending \ncuts, more commonly known as sequestration.\n  Failing to govern responsibly and compromise will negatively impact \nindustries so vital to America. That includes our agriculture economy, \nwhich provides the food that we eat on America's dinner table. It \nincludes manufacturing and service industries that provide goods and \nservices that we trade.\n  Finally, it will severely impact some programs that support our \nNation's future, like health care, education, public safety, and \nresearch and development, costing billions of dollars and thousands of \njobs.\n  In addition to negotiating a bipartisan budget agreement, we need to \naddress the impacts of sequestration and the Congress must address the \ndebt ceiling this December without fanfare that could further throw our \neconomy into chaos.\n  If the United States were to default on its loans or fail to live up \nto our promises to those of retirement age, it would send our economy \nin a downward spiral just at the time that we are finally recovering \nfrom this Great Recession.\n  Unfortunately, not all the areas of the United States are feeling the \nrecovery's effects equally. In the San Joaquin Valley that I represent, \nmany of my constituents are still feeling the effects of the recession, \nin addition to the unnecessary impacts of our failure to invest in \ninfrastructure, our water infrastructure that we terribly need to \ninvest in as well as our transportation infrastructure.\n  Vital programs, like the Ex-Im Bank, the highway trust fund, the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, have either expired or will soon expire. \nThe Export-Import Bank's charter which was created has sustained 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion private sector jobs and expired June 30.\n  By refusing to bring up the reauthorization of the Bank for a vote, \nAmerican jobs are being threatened and Congress is undermining the \nability of American businesses to compete in a global market.\n  The highway trust fund is set to expire on October 29. Our Nation's \nroads, bridges, highways, and railroads are out of date and are in dire \nneed of repair. I have never seen a bridge or road that is Republican \nor Democrat. This is just investing in America.\n  A long-term transportation bill was last passed by Congress in 2009. \nSince then, Congress has had 34 short-term patches. That is simply \nirresponsible. This not only puts American's safety at risk, but \ncompletely undermines our ability to create and sustain American jobs \nby investing in our infrastructure.\n  Congress must act to work on a bipartisan basis to reauthorize these \nprograms and countless other Federal programs that are set to expire \nnot only this week, but in December, when we address long-term funding \nfor the next fiscal year. Otherwise, there will be another threat to \nshut down government in December. It is irresponsible.\n  Last week Pope Francis reminded us of our responsibilities, the \nbetter angels in all of us. He said, ``A good political leader is one \nwho, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit \nof openness and pragmatism. A good political leader always opts to \ninitiate processes rather than simply possessing spaces.''\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Therefore, the question we should be asking: Are we simply possessing \nspaces or are we trying to find together the common good for the common \nman, as Pope Francis suggested?\n  I hope his spiritual guidance will allow us to work together to do \nwhat we were sent here to do, which is the people's work. That is what \nwe were sent here to do on behalf of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6312-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AGRICULTURE HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The team is now working on a \nlandscape project for Pennsylvania's farm show in January.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the accomplishments of these \nfuture farmers and also recognize the important work performed by the \nFFA.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Nolan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the foolish and \nwasteful squandering of Americans' hard-earned taxpayer dollars are \nonce again on display in the war in the Middle East and in Syria. \nBefore I get to my point, I want to remind my colleagues here that we \nspent $3 trillion on the war in Iraq. That is right, $3 trillion. Look \nwhere it has gotten us.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that for one of those trillion \nwe could have graduated every college kid in America and vocational \nschool kid in America debt free. Instead, we have saddled them with \ndebt that is crippling their ability to get ahead and our economy to \ngrow.\n  It is no secret that bridges are falling down here in America and \ntrains are coming off the rails. For one of those trillion dollars, we \ncould have rebuilt our infrastructure and transportation system in this \ncountry, once again creating good jobs and opportunities and laying the \nfoundation for our economy to grow.\n  For another trillion of those dollars, we could have given the \nAmerican taxpayers a trillion-dollar tax break. Would they not have \nloved that and do they not need that? Instead, we are still looking at \n$2 trillion going forward in taking care of the men and women who \nserved: the warriors, the patriots, the men and women who were willing \nto stand up and protect us, but who lost arms and lost legs and \nsuffered severe brain injuries. Yes, that is right, $2 trillion going \nforward, tending to and caring for them. And that is a moral obligation \nthat we are obligated to and must fulfill.\n  Now to my point today. Last year the Congress authorized $500 million \nto be spent on training the so-called moderate Free Syrian rebels, and \nnow we have learned that only a handful, like four to five, has shown \nup for duty, according to Lloyd Austin, the U.S. Central Commander for \ntroops in the Middle East.\n  Back in June, Republican Congressman Curt Clawson and I offered an \namendment to the Defense Appropriations bill to stop funding this so-\ncalled Free Syrian rebel program. Why? Well, the hard, cold fact is \nthat many of their leaders told us at the time that they would not use \nthe money to fight and join us in the fight against ISIL. Now we ask \nthe House not to appropriate an additional $600 million, seeing that \nthe $500 million that was spent has already been wasted and misspent.\n\n[[Page H6313]]\n\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues at the time did not follow our \nbipartisan recommendation on this important issue, and the House did go \nahead and appropriate an additional $600 million for that failed \nprogram. Now that we know only a handful are showing up for duty, it is \nnot too late to stop this additional $600 million from going forward \nfor this failed program.\n  I am calling for the immediate removal of that funding. After all, we \ndid pass my amendment prohibiting Congress from funding so-called \nrebels where there was clear proof that the money was being misspent. \nMr. Speaker, the proof could not be more clear in this case.\n  This isn't about agreement or disagreement with our involvement in \nthese Middle East conflicts. This is about the tragic, foolish, \nsenseless, wasteful squandering of $1.1 billion of hard-earned American \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Clawson and I both worked as businessmen for decades \nbefore coming to the Congress. Anyone who knows anything about business \ncan tell you this: No private sector company ever succeeded by spending \nhuge amounts of money on employees who never showed up for work or, \nworse yet, turned their allegiances to an opposition or a competitive \ncompany. That is no way to run a business, that is no way to govern, \nand it is certainly no way to win a war.\n  I plead with my colleagues to come to their bipartisan senses, join \nMr. Clawson and me, and help us put an end to this tragic and wasteful \nspending of hard-earned American taxpayer dollars. The American \ntaxpayers are counting on us. Let's not disappoint them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6313-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize someone who has \ndedicated 26 years of his life to ensuring the health of our U.S. Army \nreservists, a man who has devoted his life to helping others, U.S. Army \nMajor General Bryan Kelly, who retired as commanding general of the \nArmy Reserve Medical Command in Pinellas Park, Florida, on September \n26.\n  General Kelly's military career began when he received a direct \ncommission into the U.S. Army Reserves after graduating magna cum laude \nfrom Boston College, where he earned a Master of Arts and a doctorate \nin psychology.\n  During his service to our country, General Kelly has served in the \n883 Medical Company and the 804. He has been deployed to Iraq, where he \nserved as the commander of the 399 Combat Support Hospital. And since \n2012, General Kelly has served as the commander of the Army Reserve \nMedical Command.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Major \nGeneral Bryan Kelly for his 26 years of service and for the positive \nimpact he has had, both on his community and the many men and women who \nserve in our military today.\n  I also rise to recognize and thank his wife of 35 years, Denise, and \nhis two daughters, Kristina and Michelle, for their support during his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6313-9", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6313-H6314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VA CHILDCARE PILOT PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS.

The\n\n[[Page H6314]]\n\nprogram has been especially useful in the treatment of post-traumatic \nstress disorder, which requires regular counseling and recurring \nfollow-up appointments.\n  While I am grateful that Kids Korner will be extended for another \nyear, Congress should do more. I urge my colleagues to support \nlegislation introduced by Congresswoman Julia Brownley to make the \nprogram permanent and allow VA hospitals across the country to \nestablish similar programs for veterans that they serve. Making child \ncare available to patients who need it is a cost-effective way to \nimprove health outcomes for veterans to whom we owe so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6314-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF IRANIAN TERRORISM ACT\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, it is no secret that Iran has been one of \nthe leading sponsors of terrorism in the world for decades and that I \nam strongly opposed to the Iran nuclear deal.\n  Hundreds of Americans have been killed by terrorist attacks that were \nsponsored or financed by Iran. U.S. courts have ruled against Iran in \nmore than 80 cases, holding Iran responsible for nearly $45 billion in \ndamages.\n  The first thing, before any agreement would ever happen, is that we \nshould make sure that Iran--out of that $150 billion of possible \nsanctions relief, we should demand that American families who lost a \nloved one at the hands of Iranian terrorism receive the damages they \nare owed. We cannot fail these American families. Yet Obama's \nadministration is prepared to unfreeze up to $150 billion of these \nassets that will help finance Iran's continued terror attacks.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the legislation by the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), H.R. 3457, the Justice for Victims of \nIranian Terrorism Act, which keeps Iran's sanctions in place until Iran \nhas at least paid the damages that it owes American families.\n  Madam Speaker, this is the very least we can do on a bad deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6314-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. QUIGLEY.

Defunding Planned Parenthood will not change \nthat. Instead, defunding Planned Parenthood would lead to a decrease in \naccess to contraception and an increase in unplanned pregnancies.\n  With 40 percent of unplanned pregnancies ending in abortion, \ndefunding Planned Parenthood would inevitably result in more abortions, \nnot fewer. If you really want to reduce the number of abortions, you \nshould be lobbying to increase funding for Planned Parenthood and other \norganizations that provide safe and effective birth control.\n  So let's fund Planned Parenthood, keep our government open, and move \non to more pressing issues for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6314-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL RICE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with America's rice \nfarmers and families in celebrating the month of September as National \nRice Month. It has been 25 years since September was first dedicated as \nNational Rice Month.\n  So on this silver anniversary, I want to pay a special tribute to the \nhardworking men and women who produce rice on their family farms. I \nwould also like to recognize all those who mill and market rice, all \nthe suppliers and buyers and, of course, all of the consumers who make \nrice an essential part of their diet.\n  Rice farming in America actually predates this Nation's independence, \nbeginning almost 300 years ago. Today, America's rice industry creates \n125,000 good-paying jobs and contributes an estimated $34 billion to \nour Nation's economy.\n  Nine million tons of rice are grown each year by family farmers on \nmore than 2.7 million acres of land, predominantly in Louisiana, \nArkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, California, and Texas. While these six \nStates produce the lion's share of rice in America, there is also rice \nproduction in other States, like Illinois and Tennessee.

Mr. Speaker, I am here because I stand with the majority \nof Americans who support Planned Parenthood and the lifesaving \npreventative healthcare services that they provide each year to \nmillions of women, to men, to families all across this country. In \nfact, a new poll shows that nearly 7 in 10 Americans, 69 percent, \noppose shutting down the Federal Government as a means of defunding \nPlanned Parenthood. Shutting down the government, we know, puts this \nAmerican economy at risk, and it is no way to govern.\n  But there is only 1 legislative day left before another GOP-\nengineered shutdown.

His message was simple and honest. It crossed \nreligious and political divides. He challenged us to do better and even \ninvoked Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He reminded us that this Nation \ncontinues to be a land of dreams.\n  Pope Francis has returned to the Vatican, and we must get back to \nwork. But I hope that his message will stay with us a little longer. \nAnd we should follow the Golden Rule. Paraphrased, we should treat \nothers like we would like to be treated. Not only should that apply to \nhow we treat each other in the Halls of Congress, but also to how we \naddress the bigger problems that this Nation is facing.\n  From immigration reform to voting rights, each of us should place \nourselves in the shoes of struggling families and work on the solution \nthat is right for them and right for this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6315-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SUICIDE PREVENTION\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, as this Suicide Prevention Month comes to \na close, I believe it is crucial we remain committed to all suicide \nprevention efforts. We must continually ask ourselves: Are we doing \nenough when it comes to addressing mental health and suicide in our \nNation? I don't think so.\n  As vice chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I know that \nthis issue is especially important for our Nation's heroes. Recent data \nhas shown that every day in this country approximately 18 to 22 \nveterans take their own lives. This statistic answers the question I \nposed earlier. It is obvious more needs to be done.\n  My COVER Act addresses suicide prevention for veterans by promoting \naccess to better alternative complementary mental health treatments. \nWhile traditional forms of therapy may work for some, tailoring \ntherapies to the veteran and finding the balance between traditional \nand complementary alternative treatments could be the difference in \nsaving lives.\n  The COVER Act passed the House several weeks ago.

In May, I launched the \nAdams Hunger Initiative to draw greater attention to this issue and to \nfoster bipartisan solutions.\n  This week I am introducing a resolution to highlight the severity of \nthe hunger crisis across our Nation and to recognize the role critical \nprograms like SNAP and others play in helping families put food on the \ntable and to call on Congress to strengthen these programs and \nstreamline requirements for afterschool and summer meals programs.\n  Mr. Speaker, if the government shuts down on Thursday, the SNAP \nprogram won't have enough to cover October benefits, impacting more \nthan 65,000 people in my district and millions across the Nation. \nDuring Hunger Action Month, a time when we should be elevating and \naddressing this crisis, we are taking steps back.

Mr. Speaker, as the eighth annual Hunger \nAction Month comes to an end, I salute the efforts of Feeding South \nFlorida for its year-round efforts to end hunger in our communities.\n  For the past 8 years, we have dug our way out of a deep recession \nthat turned once middle class families into people\n\n[[Page H6316]]\n\nwho have less and already struggling families into have-nots. In \nFlorida's 24th Congressional District, more than 200,000 children are \nfood-insecure and go to bed hungry. Overall, 23 percent of individuals \nare food-insecure.\n  Feeding South Florida is a lifeline that runs food banks, a mobile \nfood pantry that delivers fresh fruits and vegetables, a summer food \nservice so students can continue to receive healthy meals when school \nis out of session, and a program that brings food to senior housing \nsites.\n  Just last week in this very Chamber Pope Francis reminded us that the \nfight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many \nfronts. Feeding South Florida does that every day and deserves all the \nsupport we can muster. That is why I wear this orange adornment today, \nto honor the entire organization, administration, and workers, of \nFeeding South Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6316-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harris) laid before the House the \nfollowing communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2015.\n     Hon.

The gentlewoman from North Carolina is \nrecognized for 1 hour.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 444 provides a closed rule \nfor consideration of H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety \nAct.\n  Over the past few months, extremely disturbing information has come \nto light about the activities of abortion providers and their sale of \nunborn children's hearts and other organs for compensation. In light of \nthose discoveries, we provide for consideration today of crucial \nlegislation to ensure States are free to ensure their limited \ntaxpayers' dollars do not provide sustaining funding to abortion \nproviders whose activities are found repugnant.\n  H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act, allows States to \nmake a decision identical to the one this House made earlier this month \nwhen we passed H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, which \nstopped the flow of taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood as \ninvestigations continue into its sale of unborn children's parts.\n  As my colleagues noted during debate on H.R. 3134, arguments from the \nminority that this bill will prevent women from accessing health care \nring hollow. We know that federally qualified health centers and rural \nhealth centers outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics at a rate of 20 to \n1.\n  Of these over 13,000 federally qualified health centers and rural \nhealth centers, women have access to any healthcare service provided by \nPlanned Parenthood or other abortion providers with one obvious \nexception. Because they are federally funded, these true health centers \ndo not perform abortions.\n  Clearly, despite opponents' best efforts to argue otherwise, this \nbill does not deny healthcare services to women. It does allow States \nto decide whether their Medicaid funds should support a provider whose \natrocities have shocked our national conscience and devalued human \nlife.\n  It is not surprising, though, that we are hearing these hollow \narguments about access to healthcare services, as the political \nmachinery of abortion providers has kicked into high gear with scare \ntactics to protect their business. Abortion is, after all, a business. \nPlanned Parenthood is the single largest abortion business in the \ncountry.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Recently, they performed over 325,000 abortions in 1 year. That is \nnearly 900 every day, at a rate of over 35 an hour. They are able to \ncontinue that activity, in part, because Planned Parenthood has \nreceived over $1 billion in 3 years from Medicaid alone. I have spoken \npreviously on the floor about the absurdity of providing taxpayer funds \nto organizations that have had their willingness to accept compensation \nfor the remains of unborn children exposed for all to see.\n  Several States, including Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, and Indiana, \nhave recognized that alarming truth and acted on their own to stop \nproviding abortion providers with taxpayer dollars through Medicaid. \nUnfortunately, the Obama administration has forced those States to \ncontinue providing taxpayer dollars to abortion providers.\n  Thankfully, when the Framers of our Constitution established our \nNation, they saw fit to give States a right to determine their own \naffairs and the disposition of their citizens' taxes. Today, we restore \nfederalism to the Medicaid program and enable States to make their own \nchoices on which Medicaid providers to accept, allowing them to stop \nthe flow of taxpayer dollars to organizations that accept compensation \nfor the sale of well-developed unborn children's hearts and bodies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend this rule and the underlying bill to my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for yielding the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  My friend, the gentlewoman from North Carolina, says that the \nminority speaks in a way that is hollow. I will tell you what is \nhollow: talk about regular order in this institution.\n  The general public may not know that there is a methodology that \nallows for all proceedings to go forward. Customarily, a measure of \nthis kind would have had a committee hearing and a committee markup. It \ndid not, and that is not regular order.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are now less than 48 hours away from another \ngovernment shutdown, and instead of considering a\n\n[[Page H6317]]\n\ncontinuing resolution, we are debating legislation that will limit a \nwoman's access to health services and make it harder for Medicaid \npatients to obtain care. I wonder about States like Florida and Texas \nthat did not accept Medicaid money under so-called ObamaCare having \ncharge of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am frustrated that we are again wasting \nprecious time considering a bill crafted by ideological extremists, \nwhich, even in the unlikely event of Senate passage, would be vetoed by \nthe President.\n  To be sure, this frustration isn't limited to my friends on this side \nof the aisle. Just this week, the fight over defunding Planned \nParenthood and similar scuffles facilitated by fringe elements of the \nRepublican Party led to the resignation of the Speaker of the House.\n  And on a personal note, I would like to thank the Speaker for his \nservice and his forthright commentary regarding his leaving the House. \nIn my judgment, he has done a credible job for this institution. He had \npeople who would not let him do the things that were needed for all of \nus in this Nation.\n  The Republican Conference is really divided so fervently that we can \nagain expect the real threat of a government shutdown in December. All \nwe are doing today, in the final analysis on that subject, whenever it \ncomes up--and it may come up today and tomorrow--is to kick the can \ndown the road again. The can ain't got no more space for kicking. But \nwe continue to do that, and this time until December, even if we are \nable to avoid the one currently looming over our heads.\n  Mr. Speaker, current Federal law already denies Federal Medicaid \ncoverage of abortion except in limited circumstances, and Federal \ninsurance coverage of an abortion is restricted.\n  Instead of debating bills like the one before us today, we should be \ncoming together to find a balanced and responsible way to fund the \ngovernment, pass a budget that represents our constituents' priorities, \nand invest in this great country.\n  H.R. 3495 seeks to amend title 19 of the Medicaid law to allow States \nto prevent qualified providers and institutions from participating in \ntheir Medicaid programs without a showing of cause or due process if \nthey have any involvement--underscore that, ``any involvement''--in \nabortions, a standard which has been left undefined and certainly \nvague.\n  Aptly termed the ``free choice of provider'' provision, title 19 \ncurrently mandates that Medicaid beneficiaries be permitted to obtain \nservices from any qualified provider he or she chooses and is \nimplemented in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' free \nchoice of provider regulation. This regulation also explicitly states \nthat under no circumstance can the free choice of provider protection \nbe compromised with respect to providers of family planning services.\n  In short, current Federal law was designated to guarantee that State \nMedicaid programs provide beneficiaries with the same basic opportunity \nand rights to choose and receive covered healthcare services from any \nqualified provider in the same way as any member of the general \npopulation seeking healthcare services. The legislative language of \nthis bill is so broad that, if enacted, it has the potential to have a \ndevastating impact on patient access by giving States the ability to \nkick any provider out of Medicaid, including entire hospital systems, \nif that provider has even an attenuated connection to abortion \nservices.\n  For example, it is entirely possible that, under this bill, a \nhospital could be excluded from providing any and all services in \nMedicaid if an obstetrician with admitting privileges at the same \nhospital provides, or even provided in the past, abortions as a \nseparate part of his or her practice.\n  The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an \norganization of over 57,000 physicians and partners in women's health, \nhave come out publicly against this legislation, as have the American \nCivil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored People. I will include those endorsements against this \nmeasure in the Record.\n\n         The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Congress of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), representing 57,000 \n     physicians and partners in women's health, I urge you to vote \n     NO on H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act.\n       This intentionally vague bill should not be enacted into \n     law. In falling far short of any standard for sound federal \n     health legislation and policy, it would serve only to scare \n     providers away from providing comprehensive, compassionate \n     care to women, and leave women without the care they need. \n     America needs more ob-gyns participating in the Medicaid \n     program; this bill would do the opposite.\n       I urge you to vote NO on H.R. 3495 when it comes to the \n     House floor. Don't be fooled by the title of this bill. This \n     legislation is nothing more than the latest in a string of \n     attacks against women's health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Mark S.

Duffy's bill, the misleadingly titled \n     ``Women's Public Health and Safety Act.'' (H.R. 3495). \n     Because of the critical importance of the civil rights and \n     civil liberties principles involved, we will score the vote.\n       H.R. 3495 gives states virtually unchecked power to exclude \n     women's health care providers from participation in Medicaid. \n     It does so by undermining the longstanding free choice of \n     provider provision which guarantees patients the ability to \n     seek health care services, and specifically family planning \n     services, from any qualified provider. This bill would allow \n     states that are hostile to a woman's right to abortion in \n     general, and to Planned Parenthood in particular, to target \n     women's health providers for exclusion from Medicaid with \n     impunity. In so doing, the bill forces doctors and \n     organizations to choose between providing a constitutionally-\n     protected medical service that one in three women needs in \n     her lifetime and providing other necessary health care \n     services to low-income patients who already face a dearth of \n     qualified and willing medical professionals. Mandating such a \n     choice not only raises serious constitutional concerns, but \n     also threatens to devastate access to care for millions of \n     low-income women and men.\n       As the latest component of the ongoing smear campaign \n     against Planned Parenthood, this bill particularly \n     jeopardizes access to the high quality, affordable health \n     care that Planned Parenthood health centers provide. Planned \n     Parenthood is a critical safety-net provider. One in five \n     women will visit a local Planned Parenthood health center \n     during her lifetime, and many low-income women and women of \n     color rely on Planned Parenthood as their primary health care \n     provider. Despite the fact that numerous investigations have \n     already cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing, opponents \n     of safe, legal abortion continue to cite the deceptively \n     edited videos that misrepresent the organization's fetal \n     tissue donation practices as justification for legislation, \n     like H.R. 3495, that would harm women's health.\n       H.R. 3495 would allow states to eliminate Planned \n     Parenthood health centers from Medicaid without cause based \n     solely on political motivations, effectively denying access \n     to vital preventive care services, including wellness exams, \n     cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and \n     contraception to many patients. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, \n     and Utah have all recently attempted to do this, despite \n     warnings from the Department of Health and Human Services \n     that doing so likely violates federal law by illegally \n     restricting beneficiaries' access to services. As defunding \n     efforts in Texas and Indiana have demonstrated, eliminating \n     Planned Parenthood as an option for those enrolled in public \n     health care programs would leave a serious void that could \n     simply not be filled by other health care providers.\n       H.R. 3495 would give these states and others that share \n     this anti-women's health agenda broad discretion to exclude \n     any person, institution, agency or entity that ``performs or \n     participates in the performance of abortions'' from \n     participating in Medicaid. Not only would this mean that all \n     such women's health providers could be cut out of the \n     Medicaid program under this provision, but states could also \n     attempt to use it to eliminate a wide range of other health \n     care providers, with serious consequences for low-income \n     patients. For example, a hospital that provides emergency \n     abortions to stabilize a women's health, as required under \n     federal law would be barred from Medicaid under H.R. 3495, \n     leaving Medicaid patients without access to any care at that \n     hospital. Simply put, this bill is extreme and would have a \n     devastating impact on access to care.\n       The ACLU opposes H.R. 3495 and urges all members of the \n     House of Representatives to vote ``No.'' Should you have any \n     questions, please contact Georgeanne Usova.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karin Johanson,\n       Director.\n     Georgeanne M.

We are, \n     however, very cognizant and very appreciative of the wide \n     range of health care services offered to the communities we \n     serve and represent by Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. \n     The latest estimates indicate that Planned Parenthood serves \n     over five million clients a year, and that 75% of their \n     clients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal \n     poverty level. Services provided at locations include \n     screening for breast, cervical and testicular cancers; \n     contraceptives; pregnancy testing and pregnancy options \n     counseling; testing and treatment for sexually transmitted \n     diseases; comprehensive sexuality education, menopause \n     treatments; and vasectomies and tubal ligations. For many of \n     Planned Parenthood's patients, the annual exams received at \n     their facilities are the only access to health care they \n     have.\n       Thank you in advance for your attention to the position of \n     the NAACP; H.R. 3495 is extreme and should be opposed.\n       Sincerely,\n\n                                      Hilary O. Shelton,    --\n\n                                    Director, NAACP Washington    \n                                Bureau & Senior Vice President    \n                                          for Advocacy and Policy.\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. The American Congress of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists stated that the bill falls far short of any standard \nFederal health legislation policy, and insisted that ``it would serve \nonly to scare providers away from providing comprehensive, \ncompassionate care to women, and leave women without the care they \nneed.'' Moreover, the group maintains this bill would prevent OB/GYNs \nfrom participating in the Medicaid program.\n  The reality is over 90 percent of the services of Planned Parenthood \nand similar organizations are preventative in nature, including cancer \nscreenings, testing for sexually transmitted infections, and family \nplanning services.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries already have limited access to doctors, and \nthis bill will only restrict access for the poorest individuals in our \nsociety.\n  I said last night in the Rules Committee that wealthy women in our \nsociety don't have the problem of seeing the doctor of their choice. \nUnder this particular measure, poor women will be further restricted \nfrom having the access to a physician of their choice as a Medicaid \nprovider.\n  Knowing this, the title of the bill, the Women's Public Health and \nSafety Act, is as ironic as it is patronizing. H.R. 3495 will punish \nthe most vulnerable Americans and will prevent women from accessing the \ncare that keeps them safe and healthy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard the question, Why haven't you done this \nbefore? Unfortunately, the full depths to which abortion providers have \nsunk was not previously public knowledge. The recent release of a \nnumber of hidden camera videos exposing the painful dismemberment of \nunborn children to facilitate the sale of their body parts by Planned \nParenthood has provided clear evidence that truly repugnant activities \nare rampant in the abortion industry and that taxpayer support should \nnever be provided to organizations that participate in the trade of \nhuman tissue.\n  One key Planned Parenthood abortionist even said: ``We've been very \ngood at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I'm not \ngonna crush that part, I'm gonna basically crush below, I'm gonna to \ncrush above, and I'm gonna see if I can get it all intact.''\n  In these days of 3-D ultrasounds and high-definition screens, it is \nimpossible to hide the humanity of these child victims. They have \nfingers and toes, heartbeats, and organs developed enough that tissue \ncollectors will pay $60 a specimen for them.\n  In light of the serious questions raised by these videos, the House \nCommittees on Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and Oversight and \nGovernment Reform have each launched investigations.\n  While Planned Parenthood does not receive direct Federal funding for \nabortions, these investigations are warranted, as a recent report from \nthe Government Accountability Office shows that the organization \nreceives an average of 500 million taxpayer dollars each year for other \nlines of business. Money is fungible, and the Federal funds that \nPlanned Parenthood receives ultimately subsidize their abortion \nservices.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why today's legislation is so important. In \nlight of the atrocities uncovered in abortion facilities across the \ncountry, it is vital that States be empowered to choose to withhold \nMedicaid funds from flowing to abortion providers that deliberately \ndismember unborn children to receive compensation for their organs and \nother body parts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), my good friend.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3495. This bill is \nmisleadingly named the Women's Public Health and Safety Act when, in \nfact, it puts women's and men's health at risk.\n  This bill would allow States to block Planned Parenthood or any other \nhealth provider from Medicaid based on ``involvement in abortions.'' \nNow, millions of American women and men depend on Planned Parenthood \nfor essential health care.\n  The majority seems determined to take our Nation's healthcare system \nbackwards. Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding to provide services \nlike cancer screening, access to contraception, and pre-conception \ncounseling that helps women prepare for healthy pregnancies.\n  Members of Congress should stop attacking women's ability to control \ntheir own health care. This bill disproportionately impacts low-income \nwomen and families and unfairly takes away one of their healthcare \noptions.\n  Congress needs to get back to doing our job and stop this attack on \nwomen's health.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  For those who complain that this bill isn't properly named, let us \nnot forget that at least half of the unborn children who are victims of \nabortion are female who would grow up to be women. Far too many \nsupporters of abortion on demand ignore that reality and the fact that \nmany abortions are sex-selection abortions.\n  Until they confront that, how can they parse bill titles, \nparticularly those that protect all existing funding for women's \nhealth, while ensuring women and their children are not party to the \nsale of tiny hearts and organs for compensation?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to my colleague from Maryland (Mr. \nHarris).\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill very simply allows States to be partners in \nthe Medicaid program. The Medicaid program is a partnership between the \nFederal Government and the States, except too often Washington tells \nthe States exactly what they have to do.\n  This is one of those examples because this is not theoretical. There \nare two States that have attempted to defund with their use of taxpayer \ndollars in their States--these are not Federal tax dollars. They don't \nwant their State's taxpayers dollars to fund Planned Parenthood. \nInstead, they want to fund other women's health services. They should \nbe allowed to do that.\n  Why should the Secretary of Health and Human Services demand that one \nparticular institution get funds?\n  Let's talk about that institution. The gentleman from Florida says, \noh, this is going to deny women health care.\n\n[[Page H6319]]\n\n  Let me tell you who is denying women health care in my district, in \nrural Lower Eastern Shore. We had a Planned Parenthood in Salisbury. \nThey closed up in April. On their Web site, they said: The center in \nEaston will be open Monday through Friday. You can just get your care \nthere, our Planned Parenthood Center, which is about 45 minutes up the \nroad.\n  Mr. Speaker, just go on your tablet device and see what the hours at \nthe Easton Planned Parenthood are that are supposed to develop this \nwonderful comprehensive health care to women in my district.\n  Now, if you want to go today, you are out of luck. They are closed. \nNow, if you went yesterday, they were open for 7 hours, from 10 a.m. to \n5 p.m. That is nice. I guess they are bankers' hours. I guess we just \nassume that everybody is going to get their health care between 10 a.m. \nand 5 p.m. So Monday they are open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday they \nare closed.\n  Mr. Speaker, if one of the women in my Lower Shore want to go on \nWednesday, they are out of luck. They are closed. If they want to go on \nThursday, they are in luck. They are open for 7\\1/2\\ hours, from 11 \na.m. to 6:30 p.m. But if they want to go on Friday, Saturday, or \nSunday, they are out of luck because Planned Parenthood is closed. They \nare not delivering comprehensive services those days.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, as we know, Planned Parenthood doesn't deliver \ncomprehensive women's health services. One of the most important \nservices that you can deliver to a woman of child-bearing age is \nmammograms.\n  Not a single Planned Parenthood facility in this entire country has a \nmammography machine. Now, how do you deliver a mammogram without a \nmammography machine?\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an untruth. Planned Parenthood doesn't do \ncomprehensive cancer screening. Because one of the most important \nscreening techniques is mammography, and none of them can deliver it.\n  Let's contrast what the woman who is seeking comprehensive women's \nhealth care on the Lower Eastern Shore in Maryland--what her \nalternative is, because the gentleman from Florida mentions that our \nMedicaid patients won't be able to be seen if we pass this bill.\n  The alternative is our Federally qualified health center, our \ncommunity health center, called Three Lower Counties. Now, if you go to \nThree Lower Counties today, you are actually in luck because they are \nopen from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and they have a mammography machine as \nwell as the entire range of comprehensive services, with one exception. \nThey don't do abortions. But, then again, the other Planned Parenthoods \non the Eastern Shore of Maryland don't do it either.\n  So, in fact, if a woman who is on Medicaid really wants access to \ncomprehensive health care in my district, they have got to go past \nPlanned Parenthood unless--well, that is not true.\n  I guess, if Monday and Thursday they want their health care, they can \ngo to Planned Parenthood. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, they \ncan't.\n  But they could go to one of those at my community health center. In \nfact, nationwide there are only a little over 500 Planned Parenthood \nfacilities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Ms. FOXX. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARRIS. There are 13,000 community health centers, each of which \nhas to have radiology facilities. That is how you get the Federal \nmoney.\n  So, in fact, if we really want to let our States, by their choice--we \nare not forcing States. We are not saying that a State can't fund \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Look, I come from the State of Maryland. We will probably choose to \ndo it.\n  But a State that chooses not to should be given the option to tell \ntheir women: If you really want it, really want comprehensive care, \nwell, go to one of the community health centers. That is all this bill \ndoes.\n  This doesn't limit care. This expands care because this tells women: \nYou don't have to go to the Monday-and Thursday-only clinic that can't \ngive you a mammogram. You can actually go get comprehensive care \nsomewhere else, even if you are on Medicaid.\n  My biggest objection--and the gentlewoman from North Carolina hit it \non the head--is look at what else Planned Parenthood does. They \nactually--and, as a physician, I find this unbelievable.\n  They will change the abortion technique in order to better harvest \nthe fetal tissue that they can then sell. That should be so morally \nobjectionable that we should allow States to limit that funding.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just like to indicate to my friend from Maryland that, while \nthere are 13,000 community health centers, many of them are overcrowded \nto begin with and can't provide even the daytime that you mentioned in \nSalisbury, all the services for various communities.\n  But, more important, you are correct. Planned Parenthood does not do \nmammograms. But they did in the last year 500,000 breast screenings. I \ncould offer up anecdotal information that allows--you can go downstairs \nright here to the House physician. The House physician doesn't provide \nall of the services, but refers you out to GW or to Walter Reed \nBethesda.\n  So referring out those women, if I were to pull up the anecdotal \ninformation of the number of women that did ultimately learn that they \nhad problems, those statistics justify the continuation of this \norganization that provides compassionate services to women.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, here we go again. Just 10 days ago the \nHouse took a vote to attack women's health. At that time, I said it \nfelt like deja vu.\n  Now I am starting to wonder if this is the only issue that my \ncolleagues care about.\n  Have we taken a vote to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank? No.\n  Have we taken a vote to extend the Land and Water Conservation Fund? \nNo.\n  Have we taken a single vote this year to fix our broken immigration \nsystem? No.\n  Yet, somehow we found time to take vote after vote restricting \nwomen's access to care. It is reprehensible.\n  The bill we are considering today is one of the worst yet. It is a \ndangerous and unprecedented assault on women and their healthcare \nproviders, and it does nothing to address the real issues that \nAmericans are facing.\n  Mr. Speaker, voters didn't send us here to intimidate their doctors \nand interfere in their private medical decisions.\n  It is time for Congress to stop wasting time and get to work. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying bill.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am \ngoing to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3611, a long-\nterm reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I am very pleased \nto yield 3 minutes to my good friend from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nFlorida.\n  I rise to oppose the demand for the previous question so that we \nmight, in fact, take up the issue of a long-term reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Something has changed. This is no longer an abstract philosophical \nconversation. This is a real, manifest, concrete conversation in which \npeople are losing their livelihoods.\n  I stood here last week and reported that not one, but two, satellite \nsales were likely lost. A subsequent announcement by Boeing to lay off \nworkers in El Segundo, California, is not abstract.\n  I referred to General Electric announcing that it was laying off 500 \npeople as a result of the failure of this\n\n[[Page H6320]]\n\nbody to do what it has done every chance it had under every President \nfor 81 years, almost always unanimously.\n  This is no longer an abstraction. People are losing their \nlivelihoods, and it will continue. It continued yesterday. General \nElectric announced another 350 jobs lost. They are moving them from \nWisconsin to Canada.\n  This is not an abstraction. This is not some ideological tug of war. \nYou are taking away people's jobs.\n  And, by the way, last week, when GE announced its first layoff of \n500, the spokesman for the majority party said it was immaterial. They \ndismissed it. Well, if you opened up that envelope and found a pink \nslip, you wouldn't think it was immaterial.\n  Last week I revealed a dirty little secret. I shared with you that \nthe Boeing aircraft company, the largest exporter in the United States \nof America, the heart of our manufacturing base, didn't make airplanes. \nThey don't. They design and assemble them. They assemble them with \nparts made mostly in America.\n  Now, here is today's dirty little secret: domestic content. The \nExport-Import Bank requires anything it finances to be made out of 85 \npercent domestic content. Made in America, 85 percent.\n  Now, our largest exporter, in good times, finances about 1 in 5 of \nits sales through the Ex-Im. But it is countercyclical. In bad times, \nit is up to 40 percent, as a consequence of that material amount that \nis sold. And, by the way, 70 percent of its sales are international. \nThey make all their airplanes with a minimum of 85 percent domestic \ncontent.\n  People, stop and think. If you do away with the Ex-Im, you do away \nwith the 85 percent domestic content requirement.\n  Boeing wants to make airplanes in America with 85 percent domestic \ncontent.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. I know this because 2 years ago there was a \ncoalition formed to lobby to reduce the domestic content. Boeing left \nthe coalition because they want to make airplanes in America. If you do \naway with Ex-Im, you do away with the domestic content requirement.\n  Six to 8,000 of the 15,000 businesses in Boeing's supply chain are \nsmall businesses. They are small businesses. You are holding a gun to \nthe head of America's number one exporter and forcing them--forcing \nthem--by virtue of competitive disadvantage to look at and consider \noutsourcing.\n  More pink slips. More people losing their livelihood. This is no \nlonger an abstraction. You are taking away people's livelihoods.\n  Yes, it is unilateral disarmament. Every other developed country on \nthe face of the planet has an export credit authority, every other one, \nexcept us now.\n  In God's name, defeat the previous question.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Ms. FOXX. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking \nabout the Ex-Im Bank because they know when they talk about protecting \norganizations that sell babies' hearts and lungs, they are losing.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues in the minority also claim that women \nwould no longer have access to healthcare services. It is important to \nremember that this bill merely stops the Obama administration's current \npractice of using Medicaid to force States into including abortionists \nin their provider network. Each State can take its specific needs into \nconsideration when determining what, if any, action to take under this \nbill. Claims that 13,000 federally qualified and rural health centers \naren't sufficient fail to reflect the fact that community health \ncenters have grown significantly since 2010.\n  According to HRSA data, health centers have grown so much that, in \nthe years since 2010, they have acquired 3.4 million more patients, 1.9 \nmillion of whom are women. And as our colleague from Maryland pointed \nout, they are often open more days and more hours than Planned \nParenthood clinics are. They are providing better and more \ncomprehensive services to women.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), my very good friend \nwho is the ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services and a \nreal champion on both these issues that we are discussing here today.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong \nopposition to the previous question so that this House may finally get \non with the important work of supporting American jobs by reauthorizing \nthe charter of the Export-Import Bank.\n  My friends on the opposite side of the aisle claim that they support \nbusiness. They claim they support small business. They claim that this \nis something that is not paid enough attention to. Yet when we have the \nopportunity to support the Ex-Im Bank, what do they do? They turn it \ninto a political question because they want to use it to divide.\n  Let me tell you some facts about the Ex-Im Bank.\n  The Ex-Im Bank supported $27.4 billion of U.S. exports at no cost to \nAmerican taxpayers; 164,000 American jobs were supported. Nearly 90 \npercent of Ex-Im Bank transactions directly supported small businesses. \nThere was a $675 million surplus generated for American taxpayers in \nfunding year 2014 alone.\n  Ex-Im Bank's mission is American jobs. By financing the export of \nAmerican goods and services, Ex-Im Bank has supported $1.3 million \nprivate sector, American jobs since 2009, supporting, again, 164,000 \njobs in funding year 2014 alone.\n  So, Mr. Speaker and Members, every day that this Republican-led House \nrefuses to act is another day that American workers suffer the \nconsequences.\n  It has been 3 months now since Republicans shut down our Nation's \nexport credit agency, a vital financing tool that enables U.S. \ncompanies both large and small to compete for sales in the global \nmarketplace, and businesses and their workers are feeling the pain.\n  The stories that we have received from across the Nation make the \nunfortunate consequences of the House Republicans' shutdown of the Ex-\nIm Bank distressingly clear. In describing the impact of the Ex-Im \nshutdown, the chief financial officer of Chief Industries, \nIncorporated, a Nebraska company that sells grain bins and elevators, \nsaid: ``We've lost business. That's the easiest way to put it. We can't \nget that business back.''\n  In my home State of California, the president of Combustion \nAssociates, Incorporated, a power plant manufacturer, said that the \nshutdown of the Ex-Im Bank has put her small, woman- and minority-owned \ncompany at a ``real disadvantage,'' saying that, as a result of fierce \ncompetition from Chinese and European firms: ``If we don't get Ex-Im \nback soon, there's a very good chance we will lose three pending \ncontracts to one of our competitors.''\n  In describing the devastating consequence of losing the support of \nthe Ex-Im Bank, the owner of U.S. International Trading Corporation, \nbased in Nevada, said that the ideologically charged debate surrounding \nthe reauthorization ``is like being stabbed in the back by people who \nshould be defending you.''\n  Steve Wilburn, a long-time Republican and former marine, who owns a \nrenewable fuels company in Arizona that lost a major Philippines green \nenergy project due to the uncertainty over Ex-Im's future, recently \nremarked: ``I never thought the day would come when the Republican \nParty would somehow view a small business like mine as crony \ncapitalism.''\n  While these small businesses and many like them are unable to \nsuccessfully compete internationally without the support of the Ex-Im \nBank, some of our Nation's largest manufacturers are losing contracts \nas well, with significant negative downstream consequences for the \nsmall business suppliers that make up their vast U.S. supply chains.\n  Making matters worse, in recent weeks, large companies, including GE \nand Boeing, have announced that the lack of export credit financing \nfrom the Ex-Im Bank has forced those companies to move some of their \nmanufacturing operations abroad, where export credit financing is \nreadily available.\n\n[[Page H6321]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we should be ashamed of this. We should be doing \neverything we can to grow jobs in this country and give U.S. businesses \nthe tools they need to succeed.\n  I have said it before and will say it again, a majority of this House \nsupports reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank; and if we don't give \nMembers the opportunity to vote up or down on reopening the Bank's \ndoors today, the self-inflicted shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank will \ncontinue to hurt workers and our economy. It is time to recognize the \nrealities of the extremely competitive international marketplace that \nbusinesses must compete in.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I don't know what they are afraid \nof. They like shutting things down.\n  You are going to shut down something in this country that is going to \ncause us to lose jobs.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair and not to other Members of the House.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I repeat, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are talking about the Ex-Im Bank because they know that when \nthey talk about protecting organizations that sell babies' hearts and \nlungs, they are losing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nCarter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have known for some time that Planned Parenthood is \nthe largest provider of abortions in this country. What we did not know \nuntil recently was just how vile and disgusting the nature of this \norganization truly is.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3495 because I believe States have \nthe right to refuse funding to an organization that profits from the \nsale of aborted children's organs. Medicaid and CMS should not be \nallowed to force States to fund these horrific practices against the \nStates' wishes.\n  The advancement of women's health should always remain a top priority \nfor our healthcare community. However, we can achieve this goal without \nrequiring States to provide access to institutions like Planned \nParenthood.\n  Taxpayer dollars should not be going to the killing of unborn babies. \nTaxpayer dollars should not go to organizations like Planned Parenthood \nthat support the practice of abortion and trafficking of aborted fetal \ntissue.\n  Taxpayer funds should go toward investigating and prosecuting the \nindividuals that are responsible for trafficking in the selling of \nfetal tissue. Taxpayer funds should go toward the advancement of \nwomen's health.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, but we cannot stop \nhere.\n  In addition to cutting off funding, the perpetrators behind these \nheinous crimes should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. \nThese disgusting acts are on par with those committed by the sickest of \ncriminals behind bars, and that is exactly where the people who did \nthis belong.\n  I urge my colleagues to support precious, innocent lives of the \nunborn.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from North Carolina says \nthat we are discussing the Export-Import Bank because we are losing, as \nshe put it, on the subject that is the base bill here today. We are not \nlosing. This bill will pass the House of Representatives, and it will \ngo nowhere. Why we are discussing the Ex-Im Bank is because we need \nAmerican businesses to win.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa), my classmate, who is \na member of the Committee on Financial Services.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose this rule and \nsupport the motion to defeat the previous question.\n  Instead of bringing a bill to the floor that will go nowhere, we \nshould, instead, be letting the House work its will; and we should be \nvoting to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Reauthorizing the Export-\nImport Bank is an economic imperative.\n  While some of my colleagues celebrate their misguided, ideologically \ndriven agenda, hardworking Americans are losing their jobs, and \nAmerican businesses and exporters are being outgunned by larger export \ncredit agencies which are more than willing to provide financing to \nAmerica's foreign competitors.\n  The Bank is an unbridled, market-driven success story which has broad \nbipartisan support in both Houses of this Congress as well as support \nfrom the majority of Americans. The Bank supports hundreds of thousands \nof good-paying jobs in this country.\n  If we fail to act now, we are shutting off a lifeline for many of our \nsmall businesses and exporters. In my congressional district alone, the \nBank has supported thousands of small business and manufacturing jobs. \nThese are good jobs in a very high-need area in Texas that would not \nhave been possible without the Bank. These jobs are now in danger.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my GOP colleagues to let common sense regain a \nfoothold in this House. We have the votes. Let Congress work its will \nand allow a vote on the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to how I began my remarks today, and \nthat is to say that the measure before us has not gone through regular \norder in the House of Representatives. There were no hearings, no \nmarkup. It just showed up in the rules for us. And somehow or another, \nthat seems to be a pattern that is developing around here, where we are \nnot legislating, we are rulemaking. In the final analysis, many Members \nand their constituents are being shut out.\n  Mr. Speaker, the decision to have an abortion is obviously a very, \nvery difficult decision for a woman, and it is one that must be made, \nin my judgment--and my colleague from Colorado (Mr. Polis) always says \nthat it is not the Oversight Committee's--which is hearing right now, \nas we speak, from Planned Parenthood providers--or the Energy and \nCommerce Committee's decision for a woman's right to choose. The \nfreedom of choice measure, since 1960, has been a part of Medicaid in \nthis country, and now we would tear that fabric and divide this country \nwith an issue that the only committee that should be in charge is the \ncommittee formed by a woman, her doctor, and God.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  There is no place for the ideological whims of politicians in that \ndetermination. I said last night I know where this is headed. I have \nseen it now for 22 years. What the ultimate objective is is not this \nlegislation today or the legislation that we considered 2 weeks ago or \nlegislation like this that they have considered. For 22 years that I \nhave been here, it has been headed toward trying to reverse Roe v. \nWade.\n  Like it or not, the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade conferred \nupon women the right to do with their own bodies what they determine \nbest until the point of viability. It is unfathomable to me and \ncountless others around this country and the world that we continue to \nentertain attacks on poor women's health to satisfy the extreme \npolitical agenda of a few in Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often \narticulate their support for measures such as the one we are \nconsidering today by insisting that it is our duty to protect the most \nvulnerable in society. To those individuals I ask: How does eliminating \ncritical health services to our country's most poor and preventing \nthose same individuals from being able to see the doctors of their \nchoice that they know and trust help them to accomplish this worthwhile \ngoal?\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question and against this rule and the underlying bill. I want \nto ask us to get back to regular order and let us get into legislating.\n  No, my colleague from North Carolina, we are not losing. We asked on \nthe Export-Import measure to allow for American businesses to win. \nEverybody here knows that this legislation, once it passes the House of \nRepresentatives, is going to get lost in that nowhere forest. I said \nlast night, and I listened to\n\n[[Page H6322]]\n\nmy granddaughter saying, ``Let It Go.'' The words are different to this \nparticular situation today, but the title of the song should be heard \nas a mantra by the Republican Party on the subject of the rights of \nwomen and their choice. They should just let it go.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  My colleagues continue to hold up regular order as an excuse for \ntheir unwillingness to stop the flow of taxpayer dollars to \norganizations that dismember children. Thankfully, there are committee \nhearings being held on this issue even now that will continue to expose \nthe wrongs of the abortion industry. Here today, though, we take the \nsimple step of stopping funding to organizations that sell children's \nbody parts.\n  My colleague's newfound affection for regular order is a poor \nobjection to the passage of this legislation to protect women and \nchildren from being parties to trafficking in human tissue. It is not \nextreme to want to protect the most vulnerable, the unborn, from having \ntheir body parts being sold and the use of taxpayer dollars to aid such \nenterprises.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have heard today about outrageous activities that are \nongoing in the abortion industry as it takes apart tiny babies with \nbeating hearts and cute little fingers and toes. It is truly saddening \nthat the reaction in this Chamber isn't unanimous agreement that the \nclinics where this has occurred be closed and those responsible be \nsanctioned for their reprehensible actions. We haven't even been able \nto come to agreement with those on the other side that Federal grants \nto these organizations from the Department of Health and Human Services \nstop immediately.\n  Now we try again to find common ground. Today, the legislation before \nus would take the small but vital step of allowing those States that \nchoose, and only those States, to stop funding abortion providers \nthrough Medicaid. This legislation wouldn't tell New York or \nMassachusetts or California that they can't give their taxpayer dollars \nto an organization that sells body parts. It would, however, enable \nLouisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, or Indiana to do so.\n  The principle of federalism, that Americans are free to come together \nwith others in their community and establish the principles by which \nthey will govern themselves, is a bedrock for our Nation. Even if \nopponents of this legislation have become callous to the unheard cries \nof unborn children dismembered for compensation, they should rally to \nthe cause of federalism in order to allow their own communities to \nexercise the freedom it protects.\n  What a sad day it is when we can no longer even unite around our \nfounding principles, one of which was that life is the first \nunalienable right. When we ignore the need to protect that right for \nthe smallest of our brothers and sisters, we should not be surprised by \nthe erosion of our other rights, including the right to self-governance \nprohibited by federalism.\n  The exposure of the ongoing tragedy of crushed young lives must spur \nus to unite to stop this imposition of Federal power on States and \ntheir citizens and restore to them the choice of protecting children \nfrom being sold as organ donors before even taking their first breath. \nThis is what H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act, would \naccomplish, and I commend it and this rule providing for its \nconsideration to my colleagues for their support.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n     An Amendment to H. Res. 444 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3611) to reauthorize and reform the Export-Import Bank of the \n     United States, and for other purposes. The first reading of \n     the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against \n     consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3611.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 444, I call up \nthe bill (H.R. 3495) to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nallow for greater State flexibility with respect to excluding providers \nwho are involved in abortions, and ask for its immediate consideration \nin the House.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Wagner). Pursuant to House Resolution \n444, the amendment printed in House Report 114-269, is adopted, and the \nbill, as amended, is considered read.\n  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Public Health and \n     Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASING STATE FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING \n                   PARTICIPATION OF PROVIDERS WHO PERFORM, OR \n                   PARTICIPATE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF, ABORTIONS.\n\n       Section 1902 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a.) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(23), by striking ``subsection (g)'' \n     and inserting ``subsection (g), subsection (11),''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(ll) Rules With Respect to Determination of Participation \n     of Providers Who Perform, or Participate in the Performance \n     of, Abortions.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Beginning October 1, 2015, subject to \n     paragraph (2), for purposes of this title, a State, at its \n     option, may establish criteria with respect to the \n     participation under the State plan (or under a waiver of the \n     plan) of an institution, agency, entity, or person who \n     performs, or participates in the performance of, abortions.\n       ``(2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an \n     abortion--\n       ``(A) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or \n     incest; or\n       ``(B) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical \n     disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as \n     certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death \n     unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering \n     physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy \n     itself.\n       ``(3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     terms `institution', `agency', or `entity' mean the entire \n     legal institution, agency, or entity, or any part thereof, \n     including any institution, agency, or entity that controls, \n     is controlled by, or is under conunon control with such \n     institution, agency, or entity.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) \nand the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) each will control 30 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 3495.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3495, the Women's \nPublic Health and Safety Act. This bill, at its core, is about choice \nas well as protecting the lives of millions of unborn babies across \nAmerica.\n  H.R. 3495 would empower States with flexibility to include or not \ninclude in their Medicaid program providers who perform or assist in \nthe performance of elective abortions.\n  The Hyde amendment already makes sure that Federal Medicaid dollars \ndo not pay for elective abortions. This bill would amend current law so \nthat States would have the flexibility and discretion to work with \nqualified providers of their choice.\n  This bill also means States would be able to remove the largest \nabortion chain from being the recipient of millions of dollars of State \nand Federal funds, which are allocated within their States.\n  Planned Parenthood has received about $1.2 billion through Medicaid \nover a 3-year period, and States who wish to eliminate Planned \nParenthood from this funding stream are being blocked from doing so.\n  All Medicaid providers ought to be held responsible for their \nactions. However, the current administration is interpreting current \nlaw to protect the interests of political elites over the health care \nof those truly in need. States should be able to work with providers \nwho prioritize and respect life and exclude organizations whose \nbusiness model is built around the destruction of life.\n  Planned Parenthood is the Nation's largest abortion chain, doing over \n327,653 abortions in the last reported year. That comes out to an \naverage of 898 abortions per day every day, 37 abortions every hour, 3 \nabortions every 5 minutes, more than 1 abortion every 2 minutes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, the new fiscal year starts in less than 36 hours, and \nCongress has still not passed the annual appropriations bills. If we \ndon't do it, the government will shut down. During the last shutdown, \nwe lost $24 billion and 120,000 private sector jobs. I am sure we could \nexpect just the same now.\n  The debt ceiling will need to be raised within the next couple \nmonths, Madam Speaker, and many Republicans are already threatening to \nrefuse to perform even that basic task. This would throw the \ninternational economy into chaos. It would cause the loss of tens of \nthousands more jobs in the United States.\n  Of course, the Ex-Im Bank expired in June, and our business \ncommunities are clamoring for reauthorization. Why? Well, last year the \nEx-Im Bank financed deals that supported 164,000 American jobs.\n  I would suggest, Madam Speaker, that the U.S. House should spend this \nweek figuring out how to avoid a political and financial catastrophe \nrather than once again passing a blatantly political bill stripping \nwomen of their basic healthcare rights. This latest attack targets both \nthe women who need to see a doctor or healthcare provider as well as \nthe providers themselves.\n  I wonder if the people on the other side of the aisle actually read \nthis bill on the floor today because it is so broadly written that it \nwould target any medical provider--doctor, hospital, clinic, you name \nit--that has even the most tenuous connection to the provision of a \nfull range of women's healthcare services.\n\n[[Page H6325]]\n\n  The majority claims that this bill targets Planned Parenthood, a \nhealthcare provider that 2.7 million Americans rely on every year. \nFirst of all, over 90 percent of the services provided by that agency \nare routine wellness exams, like breast exams, cervical cancer \nscreening, and birth control and family planning services.\n  As we all know, because we discussed it ad nauseam last week, Planned \nParenthood has received no Federal funding for abortions. In fact, no \nagency receives Federal funding for abortions with a very few \nexceptions.\n  This bill would, therefore, not stop any government funding of \nabortions. It would instead allow Federal and State funding to be cut \noff for any entity, not just Planned Parenthood, which performs \nabortions with private dollars.\n  That means that poor women would be blocked from the full range of \nhealthcare services that they need not just at Planned Parenthood, but \nat their local hospital or their local clinic or the offices of another \nwomen's health group.\n  Let's call this bill what it is. It is an attempt to eliminate \nhealthcare services for women across the board, using the Planned \nParenthood witch hunt as an excuse. Let's be very clear. The \ninvestigation of the last few months has demonstrated that the \nvideotapes the majority so heavily relies on are heavily edited, \nmanipulated, and at times downright misleading.\n  We are the U.S. Congress, Madam Speaker, and we are better than that. \nThe American public will not stand for this diversion, and neither \nshould we. Let's defeat this ill-conceived bill. Let's direct all of \nour collective attention to bipartisan solutions resolving the looming \nfiscal disaster that we are all facing.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, in response briefly, money is fungible. \nEverybody knows it. In one pocket, out the other, same pair of pants. \n$1.2 billion over the last 3 years in Medicaid. The videos, nobody is \nputting words in their mouth. It is their words, their pictures.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), \nvice chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and a distinguished \nleader on this issue.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for his diligence and his consistency through the years as \nwe have worked on this issue at the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I \ndo rise in strong support today of the Women's Public Health and Safety \nAct.\n  There will be a lot said about this bill during the course of the \nday, but let's be certain in what the bill actually says. You have got \ntwo pages, and what this does is grant to the States flexibility.\n  Madam Speaker, what they have asked us for is flexibility. Why are \nthey asking us for this flexibility? Because we have four States \ncurrently in litigation over wanting to be able to determine who is and \nis not a Medicaid provider in their State.\n  So there is a premise and a basis and a reason for bringing this \nforward and allowing the States to have the final say in who \nparticipates in that Medicaid delivery--that is what you call good \ngovernment--and sending the power and the money back to the State and \nlocal level.\n\n  This bill is necessary because the Obama administration has blocked \nattempts of States to remove certain providers from the program. Now, \nwe have four States, as I said, that have had to go into court because \nthey have tried to remove providers and CMS has blocked that action. \nSo, therefore, they are not able to move these providers out of the \nprogram.\n  The States know best the needs of their residents, and they know best \nwhich providers are providing affordable access to quality medical care \nand which ones are trying to skirt the law. There are no mandates in \nthis bill. The final decision is up to the States.\n  The left, in their endless efforts to protect Planned Parenthood and \nto prevent them from being held accountable, have once again resorted \nto scare tactics.\n  I also want to touch on the issue of the community health centers, \n9,000 here in our country. They meet the needs of over 24 million \nAmericans. You take a district like mine in Tennessee, there are zero \nPlanned Parenthood affiliates in my district--zero. There are 16 \ncommunity health centers.\n  Contrast that with the Ninth Congressional District of Illinois, Ms. \nSchakowsky's district. She has 1 Planned Parenthood affiliate, and \nthere are 44 community health centers. Ms. DeGette has 3 Planned \nParenthood sites and 46 of the community health centers.\n  So what we are doing is encouraging the States to take the \nresponsibility and make the determination of where this ought to be.\n  Madam Speaker, it is amazing to me. People always say: Let's make \ncertain that we are being good stewards of the money. Planned \nParenthood is now outsourcing their women's health issues. They have \ncut them in half over the past 7 years. It is important for us to \nredirect the funds and give the States the opportunity to determine who \nprovides the service and the access.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3495, \nyet another radical GOP assault on women's health care. Unfortunately, \nmy Republican colleagues are at it again, attempting to use any excuse \nto pursue their extreme agenda. They are attacking Planned Parenthood \nin order to limit women's constitutionally protected right to choose \nwhat is best for them and their families.\n  The legislation is particularly offensive and egregious. Let me tell \nyou what this legislation is. In the words of more than 120,000 family \nphysicians nationwide, it represents an unprecedented level of \nlegislative interference in the patient-physician relationship. It is \nnot only ill-advised, it is dangerous.\n  This legislation would, in the words of the National Women's Law \nCenter or the National Health Law Program, ``wreak havoc on our \nNation's safety net programs and millions' access to health care across \nthe country.'' It represents a direct attack by Members of Congress on \nwomen's ability to control their own reproductive health.\n  This legislation undermines patient choice of providers and provides \nStates unchecked authority to terminate providers from Medicaid without \ncause. This is a direct attack on the freedom of low-income women to \nchoose their own trusted and qualified medical provider.\n  I stand, Madam Speaker, with Planned Parenthood. I stand with all the \nphysicians and health professionals out there who provide lifesaving, \npreventative health services to millions of women and men every day. I \nstand with the hundreds of millions of Americans to say that I will not \nstand by silent and allow those who are committed to ending abortion \naccess in this country use fraud and deception to cut millions of \npeople off from their health care.\n  We cannot allow Republicans to win their war on women. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the extreme Republican agenda and vote ``no'' on \nH.R. 3495.\n  I include in the Record two letters on this legislation, one from the \nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, and an analysis of this \nlegislation by the National Health Law Program and the National Women's \nLaw Center.\n\n                                               September 28, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner & Minority Leader Pelosi:  I am \n     writing on behalf of the 120,900 members of the American \n     Academy of Family Physicians to express our strong opposition \n     to the ``Women's Public Health and Safety Act'' (H.R. 3495), \n     which will be considered by the House of Representatives this \n     week. This legislation would, if enacted, expand the ability \n     of states to selectively prohibit identified physicians and \n     health care facilities from participating in the Medicaid \n     program. Furthermore, this legislation represents an \n     unprecedented level of legislative interference in the \n     patient-physician relationship.\n       We are deeply concerned with the overall intent of this \n     legislation and, more specifically, its attempts to interfere \n     with the patient-physician relationship. Our most pointed \n     criticism is directed at the phrase ``or by\n\n[[Page H6326]]\n\n     any individual or entity based on the individual's or \n     entity's involvement in abortions.'' This language is not \n     only ill-advised, it is dangerous. Health care decisions \n     should be made by a patient in consultation with her \n     physician(s). Patients deserve an environment that encourages \n     open communication with their physicians on health care \n     options appropriate for their health status. This legislation \n     would potentially discourage and prohibit physicians from \n     discussing a safe and legal health care service with their \n     patients. As previously stated, this represents an \n     unprecedented level of legislative interference in the \n     patient-physician relationship.\n       Again, we urge the House to reject this legislation. The \n     proposal represents an inappropriate and misguided intrusion \n     into the patient-physician relationship and actually seeks to \n     criminalize a physician for discussing a legal, safe, and \n     appropriate health care service with their patients. This is \n     a dangerous bill and it should not pass.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Reid Blackwelder, MD, FAAFP,\n     Board Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 17, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: The National Health Law Program and \n     the National Women's Law Center strongly oppose H.R. 3134, a \n     bill that would wreak havoc on our nation's safety net \n     programs and millions' access to health care across the \n     country. It is no overstatement to say that, if H.R. 3134 \n     were to become law, our country would face a significant \n     public health crisis. Excluding a highly trusted and \n     qualified provider from a network that provides critical \n     preventative health care would do nothing more than harm \n     those who are in need of this health care the most.\n       H.R. 3134 would mean that millions of low-income \n     individuals in the Medicaid program could lose their ability \n     to access the provider they trust and choose for high quality \n     health care. This conflicts with, and threatens to \n     jeopardize, a longstanding protection for Medicaid enrollees, \n     the ``freedom of choice'' provision. This provision gives \n     Medicaid recipients the right to choose to receive covered \n     services from any qualified provider. Historically, Congress \n     has singled out family planning for unique protection when it \n     comes to freedom of choice. Freedom of choice is especially \n     critical for receiving family planning services--it \n     guarantees that women, men, and young people have ready \n     access to family planning services they need when they need \n     them, and from a provider they trust. H.R. 3134 attempts to \n     eliminate Medicaid enrollees' ability to visit Planned \n     Parenthood, whether for family planning services or the other \n     critical services Planned Parenthood provides, such as well \n     woman visits, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted \n     infections, and life-saving cancer screenings. The end result \n     could mean that Medicaid beneficiaries lose access to what \n     may be the only source of primary and preventive care they \n     have.\n       H.R. 3134 would also inflict serious harm on the \n     chronically underfunded Title X program. Planned Parenthood \n     is a critical component of this safety net program, as the \n     health centers serve a disproportionate share of clients in \n     the Title X system. While only comprising 13% of Title X \n     clinics, Planned Parenthood clinics serve 37% of clients. \n     Each Planned Parenthood health care center serves nearly \n     3,000 patients for birth control services, far more than \n     other clinic types. Taking away Title X funding from Planned \n     Parenthood would leave those who rely on the Title X program \n     without a key provider that they trust and that provides the \n     health care services they need.\n       Eliminating funding from Planned Parenthood would have a \n     disproportionate impact on women of color. Hispanic and Black \n     women more commonly access family planning or medical \n     services from a Title X-funded clinic. And women of color \n     make up a disproportionate share of Medicaid recipients \n     relative to their population. Given that Planned Parenthood \n     serves 36% of all clients who obtain care from the family \n     planning health network, and that women of color often turn \n     to this network for their health care, taking away such a \n     trusted, high-quality health care provider would have inflict \n     particular harm on women of color.\n       Proponents of H.R. 3134 boldly suggest that individuals \n     would not lose services because other providers will fill in \n     the drastic void that would be left if Planned Parenthood \n     clinics were shut down. Historical evidence and existing gaps \n     in our country's public safety net suggest otherwise. For \n     example, after Texas turned its preventative care and family \n     planning program into a state-funded program in order to \n     exclude Planned Parenthood from its network, 30,000 fewer \n     low-income women received health care. When Indiana defunding \n     forced a Planned Parenthood clinic to shut its doors, it led \n     to an HIV outbreak in the county because there was no other \n     clinic providing HIV education and testing. The suggestion \n     that other providers can and will step up to fill this need \n     defies common sense.\n       On a closing note, while we focus on the dramatic negative \n     impact that H.R. 3134 would have on millions of lives across \n     our country, it is imperative to place this attack in the \n     context of the many other attacks on women's health. For \n     example, some members of Congress are pushing to completely \n     eliminate or further cripple the Title X program, as \n     reflected in the current appropriations proposals.\n       Not only would H.R. 3134 mean that millions of women, men, \n     and young people would lose access to birth control, cancer \n     screenings, breast exams, and STI and HIV testing, but it \n     also represents a direct attack by Members of Congress on \n     women's ability to control their own reproductive health.\n       We strongly urge you to vote no on H.R. 3134, and stand \n     strong in support of the millions who receive high quality \n     health care through the Planned Parenthood health care \n     centers.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Health Law Program,\n     National Women's Law Center.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, unfortunately, the Obama administration \nputs its own abortion-centered ideology ahead of women's health care.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black), an \noutstanding leader on this issue.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act, legislation empowering \nStates to terminate Medicaid contracts with providers that disrespect \ninnocent human life by performing abortions.\n  As we debate this bill today, the big abortion industry is in crisis \nmode. They have seen the same videos I have implicating Planned \nParenthood, the Nation's largest abortion provider, in the trafficking \nof fetal tissue and organs, and they have seen the same nonpartisan \ngovernment report I have indicating that Planned Parenthood received \n$1.2 billion in Medicaid funding over a 3-year period.\n  So, knowing that they are losing the public opinion battle, they are \ntaking their fight to the courts, suing States that dare to protect \ntaxpayer dollars by exercising their right to terminate contracts with \nthis abortion giant. Tennessee saw this tactic before when Planned \nParenthood took our State to court over an abortion law back in 2000. \nWe defeated them, but it took 14 years to do it.\n  Madam Speaker, let's not let that happen again. If President Obama \nand the congressional Democrats are so intent on blocking this \nlegislation to combat taxpayer funding of abortion providers at the \nFederal level, then they should at least let States use their 10th \nAmendment rights to take action within their own borders without the \nthreat of costly, politically motivated lawsuits. The Women's Public \nHealth and Safety Act will do just that.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this compassionate, pro-life, pro-woman \nlegislation.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill and to the \npolitical gamesmanship that continues to put our Nation at risk.\n  Today we witness yet another attack by some of our colleagues who are \nobsessed with ending access to Planned Parenthood, a trusted healthcare \nprovider in my community. But today's bill takes a slightly different \napproach, one that cynically tells a woman that the government knows \nbetter than she does when it comes to telling her who she should trust \nwith her health and well-being. As a woman, a mother, and a nurse, this \nis insulting. These attacks have to stop.\n  Republicans are willfully putting their heads in the sand. They think \nit is no big deal to shut down hundreds of clinics offering essential \nservices not available anywhere else; they think that the rest of the \nsafety net can easily pick up the slack, ignoring the fact that those \nproviders themselves have said they cannot; and they think it is worth \nshutting down the government to achieve this goal.\n  Moreover, I would just like to emphasize that these women have chosen \nto go to Planned Parenthood for their care. Suggesting that they can \njust get their care from some other provider is both callous and \ncondescending.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nwhich provider a woman chooses to go to for her own reproductive health \ncare is not your decision to make--at least, it shouldn't be.\n  I urge my colleagues to trust women to make their own decisions. Vote \n``no'' on this bill.\n\n[[Page H6327]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the prime sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Madam Speaker, I have to tell you, I have been watching my \nDemocrat friends across the aisle do somersaults trying to whitewash \ntheir past and rename their dinners that they have every year, their \nJefferson-Jackson dinner. There is a big conversation about the \nConfederate flag and what it means, which I would agree with my friends \nacross the aisle. But what they don't want to talk about is the roots \nof where Planned Parenthood started.\n  It started with Margaret Sanger, a known racist and a speaker in \nfront of the KKK. She believed in eugenics, and she is the founder of \nPlanned Parenthood. We should talk about the racist roots of Planned \nParenthood just like with the Confederate flag and just like the \nJefferson-Jackson dinner that the Democrats celebrate every year.\n  If you watch the videos that have come out about Planned Parenthood \nharvesting little baby body parts and selling those body parts for a \nprofit, it is disgusting. This is not a debate about abortion or even \nnon-abortion, pro-life or pro-abortion. Those who are even pro-abortion \nagree that these tactics are unacceptable. They have no place in our \nsociety. That Federal tax dollars should actually go to fund an \ninstitution that harvests baby body parts for sale is absolutely \nasinine.\n  You want to talk about health care? Health care doesn't mean Planned \nParenthood, and Planned Parenthood doesn't mean women's health care.\n  You talk about defunding women's health care. There is no less money. \nThere is the same amount of money that goes to women's health care. \nThat is a false argument. We spend the same amount of money, but we \nsay: You know what? When we have an organization that supports the \nharvest and sale of body parts, our tax dollars probably shouldn't go \nto it.\n  Or, better yet, why don't we let the States make that decision for \nthemselves? If they say that it is an affront to our morals and our \nvalues in one State, we should say we are not going to send Federal \nMedicaid money to that organization. And if another State says, ``You \nknow what? We are okay with it,'' then let them spend their money that \nway, giving States back the power to choose how they use their money.\n  I have got to tell you that I oftentimes sit back and am amazed that \nmy friends across the aisle who talk about being very compassionate and \ncaring and loving and supporting the downtrodden can't join us in \nsaying: We probably should at least ban abortions after 20 weeks when \nlittle babies feel pain, when little babies can survive outside the \nwomb. We are so radical in our position that we want to support \nabortion up to the point of birth. We won't even support you if there \nis a botched abortion and the baby is born alive and we should probably \ntry to save it.\n  You can't even join us in that. It is a sellout to the radical \nabortion industry.\n  I see the rally outside. It is a rally for Planned Parenthood, which \nprovides the largest funds to the Democratic coffers, to their \ncampaigns.\n  This is not about life. This not about health care. This is not about \nabortion. This is about campaign money that flows from Planned \nParenthood into my friends' campaigns. Sadly, I wish they would put \naside their campaign concerns instead of standing for states' rights \nand women's health and little babies' lives.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds all Members to address \ntheir remarks to the Chair.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I didn't agree with much the previous \nspeaker said, but I do agree that, from our perspective, it is about \ncampaign money on that side.\n\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, but also for \nher tremendous leadership on this and so many issues.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3495, the so-\ncalled Women's Public Health and Safety Act.\n  First of all, this bill does not keep women safe, and it certainly \nwon't keep them healthy. Instead, it would prevent individuals or \norganizations that provide abortion services from treating women \nenrolled in Medicaid, and it would simply strip women of their \nfundamental right to choose their own healthcare provider.\n  Congress already denies Federal Medicaid coverage of abortion, which \nis wrong, and that needs to be repealed. That is the Hyde amendment. We \nhave got to repeal that. Now, excluding doctors from serving Medicaid \npatients is yet another attack on the rights of low-income women.\n  When in the world are you going to stop?\n  H.R. 3495 would deny more than 7 million women access to critical \nhealthcare services, including contraceptive care, STI tests, \nlifesaving cancer screenings, and other primary care services; and it \nwould hurt our most vulnerable communities, including low-income women \nand women of color.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill is simply wrong. It is nothing more than a \nshameful attempt to restrict women's constitutional rights. Politicians \nshould never interfere with women's personal healthcare decisions, \nperiod. Stay out of our lives.\n  The Women's Public Health and Safety Act does just the opposite of \nwhat this bogus title says. It erodes the health and safety of women \nand continues the war on women.\n  Today I am proud to stand with Planned Parenthood and the men, women, \nand children in our country. I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill that \nwill severely hurt the health and safety of women.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, we should be aware that not a single penny \nwill be cut for women's health care under this bill.\n  I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Madam Speaker, I stand before you in full support of \nH.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act.\n  This legislation amends Medicaid law to give States the freedom and \nflexibility to remove abortion providers from Medicaid. Taxpayer \ndollars should not be used for abortion, period.\n  This important policy is widely supported by the American people. \nThat is why the Hyde amendment, first established in 1976, protects \ntaxpayers from preventing the use of Federal funds for abortion. \nHowever, through the years, we have seen these groups attempt to \ncircumvent this Federal mandate in order to further their own \ndestructive agenda of death.\n  In North Carolina, Madam Speaker, there are 294 community health \nclinics, but only 9 Planned Parenthood abortion centers. Providing \nStates like North Carolina with flexibility and funding will result in \nbetter, more accessible health care for all women, instead of funneling \nmoney to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood and their army of \npolitical lobbyists.\n  Thank you to Congressman Sean Duffy for his leadership on this issue.\n  As a nation, we must restore the value and sanctity of each and every \nlife against this selfish culture of death. I will continue to be a \nvoice for the voiceless and speak out against these egregious acts as \nlong as it takes to restore the God-given promise of life.\n  Life is precious. As Pope Francis stated in this Chamber, we must \ncherish each and every one at every stage of life.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  Ms. MOORE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I am in opposition to this ill-conceived legislation \nbrought forward from my good friend and colleague from Wisconsin.\n  I realize that good people can differ on topics, and I have been \nstunned by some of the discussion that has occurred on the floor today \nwith regard to the racist roots of Planned Parenthood, with regard to \nso-called states' rights.\n  I can tell you that, as an African American and as a woman, I have \nheard the term ``states' rights'' used in ways that were not very \nhealthy and safe for me as an African American woman. There is nothing \nhealthy and safe about a bill that would deny\n\n[[Page H6328]]\n\nwomen their constitutional and human rights to control their own \nreproduction--to get birth control, to be protected against STDs, or to \nhave an abortion.\n  I know many people in this body are fond of reality shows, but in \nreality, a woman is fertile for 30 to 40 years of her life, and there \nis nothing healthy about becoming pregnant every year for 30 to 40 \nyears. I am one of nine kids, and that is not a healthy scenario for \nmany women.\n  The reality is that this would have an adverse impact on some of the \npoorest women, and many of them African American, in this country. \nSeventy-eight percent of Planned Parenthood patients live at 150 \npercent or lower of the poverty level.\n  The reality is that 60 percent of all Americans do not want to see \nPlanned Parenthood defunded. It is not in the interest of public health \nand safety for these women to be denied this basic health care.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Madam Speaker, we have heard about these films that are not real at \nall. They have been doctored, edited, and they are revisionist tapes, \nall in pursuit of defunding the premier organization that protects \nwomen's health.\n  With regard to the other community health centers, I am glad to know \nthat my colleagues are interested in funding those centers. But this \nbill even puts them at risk because any ancillary service related to \nabortion can be deemed as unfitting for reimbursement under the \nMedicaid program.\n  My last point, Madam Speaker, is that we have seen the flexibility \nthat States have used. We saw in Indiana where they defunded Planned \nParenthood and, as a result, we saw a pandemic of HIV infestations in \nthat State.\n  So I would say before I yield back, Madam Speaker, that I urge my \ncolleagues to not go for the appeasement of the Anti-Choice Caucus so \nthat we don't shut the government down, to use women as a gambit in \nthis political battle.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 18 \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Colorado has 19 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chair of the Pro-Life \nCaucus.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, last week Pope Francis admonished a joint session of \nCongress to follow the Golden Rule--to do unto others as you would have \nthem do unto you. The Pope also said the Golden Rule compels us to \nprotect and defend human life at every stage of development--and, of \ncourse, that includes the unborn. It is wrong to remain silent, he \nsaid, or to look the other way when individuals are put at risk.\n  At the White House welcoming ceremony earlier in the day, President \nObama spoke of protecting the least of these, taken from Matthew's \nGospel, the 25th chapter. When President Obama says protect the least \nof these, he excludes millions of unborn children.\n  Every day Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons to \ndeath approximately 900 unborn babies, the least of these, and hurts \nmany women in the process.\n  Subsidized by half a billion dollars annually, Planned Parenthood \nkills a baby every 2 minutes and has terminated the lives of over 7 \nmillion infants since 1973, a staggering loss of children's lives that \nequates to twice the number of every man, woman and child living in the \nState of Connecticut.\n  So I rise in strong support of H.R. 3495, the Women's Health and \nPublic Safety Act, authored by our distinguished colleague, Sean Duffy, \nto give States the authority to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  States, indeed, Madam Speaker, should have the freedom to choose who \nthey subsidize and why. But the President has denied that option to at \nleast six States so far, including Texas, Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, \nAlabama, and Arkansas. The latter three States had moved to defund in \nthe wake of the recent undercover videos by the Center for Medical \nProgress.\n  Now, because of the CMP videos, we know Planned Parenthood is also \ntrafficking in baby body parts.\n  I would note parenthetically, Madam Speaker, I wrote the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act to try to end the cruelty of modern-day slavery, \nsex trafficking, and labor trafficking. Planned Parenthood's activities \nare a manifestation of human trafficking, exploiting defenseless unborn \nchildren and taking body parts that they have no right to take.\n  It turns out Planned Parenthood has turned these babies into human \nguinea pigs, and it makes the abortion industry even richer.\n  Although much of the media continues to ignore this scandal, Planned \nParenthood's meticulously crafted facade of care and compassion has \nbeen shattered. Caught on tape, Planned Parenthood's top leadership, \nnot interns or lower level employees, show callous disregard for \nprecious children's lives while gleefully calculating the financial \ngain, which begs the question: Do Americans understand the violence to \nchildren done every day in Planned Parenthood clinics?\n  Have my Congressional colleagues, has the President, actually watched \nthe videos? To care for the least of these, have they watched them?\n  In one clip, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, Senior Director of Planned \nParenthood Federation of America's Medical Services, says: ``We have \nbeen very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that I am \nnot going to crush that part.''\n  So they crush all around that part that is desired, dismember that \nbaby piece by piece, but they leave intact certain parts, including \nlivers, that will then be sold.\n  Planned Parenthood Medical Directors' Council President Dr. Mary \nGatter appears on the video nonchalantly talking about utilizing a \n``less crunchy''--her words--abortion method, again, to preserve body \nparts.\n  Regarding the price tag for baby body parts, she says: ``Let me just \nfigure out what others are getting. And if this in the ballpark, then \nit is fine.'' ``If it is still low, then we can bump it up,'' she says.\n  Another Planned Parenthood Director, Deborah VanDerhei, says: ``We \nare just trying to figure out as an industry''--and it is the abortion \nindustry--``we are just trying to figure out how we are going to manage \nremuneration because the headlines would be a disaster.''\n  Concern for making money, finding another revenue stream, but no \nconcern whatsoever for that child victim who suffers when they are \ndismembered: arms, legs, torso, decapitated head. It is gruesome \ndismemberment abortions. That is what Planned Parenthood does.\n  One woman, Holly O'Donnell, from StemExpress, says: ``She gave me the \nscissors and told me that I had to cut down the middle of the face.'' \n``I can't even describe what that feels like,'' she says.\n  I suspect that, if the President watches at least one of the videos \nand my colleagues on the other side, they would at least demand real \nanswers concerning Planned Parenthood's inhumane behavior and violence \nthat is directed at the least of these.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend.\n  You know, mention has been made about Margaret Sanger. I have read \nthree of Margaret Sanger's books. In one of them, called The Pivot of \nCivilization, she talks about the cruelty of charity of caring for \nindigent women who carry babies to term, that you should not give them \nhelp, that charity is cruel.\n  She was a racist. Read her books. Read her birth control review. I \nwent to the Library of Congress, got many copies of it and read through \nit. She had many programs that talked about focusing on Blacks and \nothers for extermination. Just read her books. And, again, The Pivot of \nCivilization is one of the worst.\n  Let me also say to my friends that they talk about how these videos \nhave been doctored. Well, there is a new report that just came out \ncalled the Coalfire Forensics Analysis. It finds that the videos are \nauthentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing.\n\n[[Page H6329]]\n\n  The events depicted in the missing footage fall into five common \ncategories: commuting, waiting, adjusting recording equipment, meals, \nand restroom breaks.\n  At each interview, four devices recorded conversations, two video \nrecorders with microphones and two audio-only devices. I ask my friends \nand colleagues on the other side to take a look at that analysis.\n  Again, you just attack the whistleblower. You attack the \norganization. But you don't look at the evidence.\n  I have watched those tapes several times and was sickened by just how \ninhumane these individuals are in cutting little babies into pieces in \norder to procure their body parts.\n  Seven million babies since 1973 killed in Planned Parenthood clinics. \nThey ought to be called Child Abuse, Incorporated. It is the most \nunsafe place in America, for a child to be in a Planned Parenthood \nclinic.\n  I submit the Coalfire Forensics Analysis Report for the Record.\n\n          [Prepared by Coalfire Systems, Inc., Sept. 28, 2015]\n\n                   Digital Forensics Analysis Report\n\n               (Delivered to Alliance Defending Freedom)\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       In September, 2015, CGS, the prime contractor on behalf of \n     Alliance Defending Freedom, engaged Coalfire Systems, Inc., \n     the sub-contractor (hereinafter ``Coalfire'') to conduct a \n     computer forensics analysis of certain raw video and audio \n     data files. Coalfire's objectives for this project are to:\n       Forensically evaluate video and audio files provided by The \n     Center for Medical Progress (``the Organization'') through \n     CGS (``raw'' video and audio), and determine whether the raw \n     video or audio content of the files have been edited or \n     otherwise altered;\n       Compare the raw video and audio to certain files posted to \n     YouTube (``Full Footage'' videos and a ``Supplemental'' \n     video) for the purpose of determining inconsistencies between \n     the files.\n       The scope of Coalfire's analysis did not cover or include:\n       Validation of those individuals depicted in the video or \n     audio, who recorded the video and audio files, the location \n     where they were recorded, when they were recorded, or the \n     purpose of the recordings;\n       Providing an opinion on the chain of custody prior to \n     receipt of source materials by Coalfire;\n       Coalfire's analysis was limited to only the source \n     materials received from the Organization and did not include \n     interviews of participants in the videos or audio.\n       A flash drive containing recorded media was received via \n     FedEx by Coalfire on September 17th, 2015, where it was \n     examined using industry-standard forensic tools and \n     techniques. The flash drive contained (i) a total of ten (10) \n     videos with audio recorded on two (2) separate devices, and \n     (ii) a total of eight (8) audio recordings made with two (2) \n     audio-only devices.\n       Coalfire's analysis of the recorded media files contained \n     on the flash drive indicates that the video recordings are \n     authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing. \n     This conclusion is supported by the consistency of the video \n     file date and time stamps, the video timecode, as well as the \n     folder and file naming scheme. The uniformity between the \n     footage from the cameras from the two Investigators also \n     support the evidence that the video recordings are authentic.\n       With regard to the ``Full Footage'' YouTube videos released \n     by the Organization, edits made to these videos were applied \n     to eliminate non-pertinent footage, including ``commuting,'' \n     ``waiting,'' ``adjusting recording equipment,'' ``meals,'' or \n     ``restroom breaks,'' lacking pertinent conversation. Any \n     discrepancies in the chronology of the timecodes are \n     consistent with the intentional removal of this non-pertinent \n     footage as described in this report.\n       Furthermore, four of the five raw video recordings, which \n     also contained audio captured from the video recording \n     device, are accompanied by a raw audio recording captured \n     from a separate audio-only recording device. The raw audio-\n     only recordings last for the duration of their associated raw \n     videos. These raw audio recordings support the completeness \n     and authenticity of the raw video recordings since they \n     depict the same events within the same duration as captured \n     from the two separate video recorders.\n                                  ____\n\n\nDigital Forensics Analysis Report of Video Recordings by The Center for \n                         Medical Progress (CMP)\n\n       The Coalfire forensic analysis removes any doubt that the \n     full length undercover videos released by Center for Medical \n     Progress are authentic and have not been manipulated. \n     Analysts scrutinized every second of video recorded during \n     the investigation and released by CMP to date and found only \n     bathroom breaks and other non-pertinent footage had been \n     removed. Planned Parenthood can no longer hide behind a \n     smokescreen of false accusations and should now answer for \n     what appear to be the very real crimes revealed by the CMP \n     investigation.--Casey Mattox, Senior Counsel, Alliance \n     Defending Freedom\n       American taxpayer money should be redirected to fund local \n     community health centers and not subsidize a scandal-ridden, \n     billion-dollar abortion business. Planned Parenthood is an \n     organization that cares about one thing: making a profit at \n     the expense of women's health. The investigative videos, \n     whose authenticity was confirmed by the report, show that \n     Planned Parenthood is an abortion-machine whose top \n     executives and doctors haggle and joke about the harvesting \n     and selling of baby body parts. Women deserve far better.--\n     Kerri Kupec, Legal Communications Director, Alliance \n     Defending Freedom\n\n\n                           Facts and Findings\n\n       Forensic analysis of CMP's recorded media files indicates \n     that the video recordings are authentic and show no evidence \n     of manipulation or editing.\n       The events depicted in the missing footage fell into five \n     common categories: commuting, waiting, adjusting recording \n     equipment, meals, and restroom breaks.\n       At each interview, four devices recorded conversations (two \n     video recorders with microphones and two audio only devices). \n     The recordings were cross-referenced and found to be \n     consistent.\n\n\n                       Coalfire v. Fusion Report\n\n       The Coalfire report had access to every second of released \n     audio and video investigative footage recorded by CMP and \n     analyzed that footage to verify and authenticate all of the \n     videos on the CMP YouTube page.\n       The Fusion report had access only to four full length \n     videos released on YouTube between July 14 and August 4, and \n     none of the source material.\n       The Coalfire report also confirmed that one segment of \n     missing video highlighted by the Fusion Report was later \n     uploaded in full to CMP's YouTube page.\n       Coalfire is an internationally recognized third-party \n     digital security and forensics firm with experience providing \n     evidence for civil and criminal investigations.\n       Fusion is a small company formed to develop material for \n     Democratic party campaigns.\n       Both reports verify there is no evidence of fabrication or \n     misrepresentative editing, nothing was dubbed or altered. \n     Fusion's ``analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of \n     substantive video manipulation.'' Coalfire found the videos \n     to be ``authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or \n     editing.''\n\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank my good friend for her \nleadership and for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to this ironically titled \nbill, Women's Public Health and Safety Act. Let's be honest. We all \nknow that this bill in no way protects the health and safety of women. \nIn fact, it does quite the opposite.\n  This bill is aimed squarely at restricting a woman's constitutionally \nprotected freedom to make her own reproductive health choices. This \nbill is not based on facts. This bill is not based on the health needs \nof women. This bill is pure politics and ideologically driven.\n  It is shameful that Congress is considering a bill that would leave \nvulnerable women's access to comprehensive health care at the mercy of \nthe extreme fringe of the far right.\n  This is another attempt to put politics between a woman and her \ndoctor and a thinly veiled attempt to destroy a woman's right to \nchoose. This bill is so vaguely worded and so broadly written that it \nwill have devastating and far-reaching effects on women's health.\n  States would be allowed to exclude any provider, any entity, that has \never provided an abortion or has ever had any sort of association or \ninvolvement with an abortion. This bill puts women's lives in danger, \nand it is a chilling and a most dangerous precedent.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge a strong ``no'' vote. Instead, stand for a \nwomen's right to make her own personal health care choices.\n  Planned Parenthood should be celebrated, not demonized. It is the \nlargest healthcare provider for vulnerable women in this great country \nof ours.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I would just remind the gentlewoman that \nabortion is not health care.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), a \ngreat leader in the Pro-Life movement.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, protecting innocent unborn lives is \nparamount to defining who we are as a people and as a nation. Killing \ninnocent babies before they even have a chance at life is \nunconscionable, let alone turning around and selling the fetal tissue \nfor profit.\n  Planned Parenthood is the Nation's largest provider of abortion. This \nabortion chain received $1.2 billion of taxpayer money through Medicaid \nover a\n\n[[Page H6330]]\n\n3-year period. Planned Parenthood last reported that over $500 million \nof their annual revenue comes from government funding. This is \nreprehensible.\n  No Federal dollars should go to any institution in the business of \nharvesting and selling baby parts of aborted children.\n  Can you imagine what people would say in this country if this \npractice occurred with our beloved pets? Most of us have cats and dogs. \nWould we stand for them to be killed and their body parts harvested and \nsold for profit?\n  Where is the outrage that this is happening to our country's babies, \nour unborn children?\n  I continue to fight to defund Planned Parenthood at the Federal \nlevel, and I encourage all State and local governments to also stop \nfunding Planned Parenthood.\n  In light of the recent undercover videos, three States have attempted \nto end their Medicaid contracts with Planned Parenthood and the Obama \nadministration said disqualifying Planned Parenthood because of its \nabortion business violated Federal Medicaid law.\n  Well, today's bill amends the Medicaid law to empower States with the \nability to exclude abortion providers from Medicaid.\n  Given the horrific nature of the videos showing the shameful lengths \nthat Planned Parenthood will go to in order to harvest and sell fetal \norgans, I am hopeful that each and every State would exercise this \noption.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, which is critical to the \nfight to protect innocent lives.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Judy Chu).\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, another day, another \nattack by Republicans on women's health care in the House of \nRepresentatives. But this one is different. It goes beyond the typical \nattacks on women and endangers their health and the health of entire \ncommunities.\n  By holding Medicaid hostage, this bill seeks to intimidate doctors \nand hospitals into not providing a safe and constitutionally protected \nservice.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  I am appalled by how far Republicans are willing to go. The language \nin the bill is so vague that it would allow States to exclude entire \nproviders from the Medicaid program. Minority and low-income women \nwould be disproportionately impacted and would stand to lose access to \ncritical health services like birth control and family planning.\n  It is time to stop the attacks. Women must be free to make their own \nhealthcare choices in consultation with their doctors and without \nthreats from Republican politicians in Washington, and we must have as \none of those choices Planned Parenthood.\n  For many, it is the only place they can turn to for even the most \nbasic care. Women--especially low-income women--turn to Planned \nParenthood for affordable and dependable primary care services. They \nfill a vital gap that community health centers can't fill by \nthemselves. We are all better off because of their cancer screenings, \nSTI testing, and wellness exams.\n  Republicans are trying to hold our health care hostage by using \nbaseless attacks to shut down Planned Parenthood, using heavily \ndoctored videos. It is time to stop using health care as a weapon to \nbully women.\n  We must vote against this bill.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Harris), another leader on this issue.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, look, this bill is very simple. This bill \njust says that States actually can be partners with the Federal \nGovernment and Medicaid. The Federal Government, the Secretary of HHS, \ndoesn't get to tell a State which providers they think are inadequate--\nyes, inadequate.\n  Planned Parenthood is not a comprehensive health provider in my \ndistrict. In the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland, they closed the \nPlanned Parenthood in April and said on the Web site: ``You can get \nservices Monday through Friday at the center in Easton, 45 minutes up \nthe road.''\n  Madam Speaker, if you go up the road today, they are closed. In fact, \nthe center in Easton, funded with Federal dollars, is open 2 days a \nweek. That clinic is empty the rest of the time. Federal dollars are \npaying for an empty clinic that doesn't deliver comprehensive care.\n  Madam Speaker, you may have heard somewhere that Planned Parenthood \nprovides mammograms. Nonsense. Even Planned Parenthood executives say \nthey don't have a mammogram machine in the entire system. They don't \nprovide mammograms.\n  The only method for breast cancer screening that actually results in \ndecreased deaths from breast cancer, the only method--mammograms--they \ndon't even provide at Planned Parenthood. They say: Oh, but you can be \nreferred.\n  Actually, Madam Speaker, the law is you don't need a referral for a \nmammogram screening. That is the law. You don't need a referral. Any \nwoman can go get a mammogram screening as long as she is within the \nscreening guidelines without a referral.\n  So exactly what is this magic that Planned Parenthood provides?\n  The gentlewoman from New York said it fills a gap that community \nhealth centers can't fill. Nonsense. Community health centers can \nprovide mammograms. They can provide breast cancer screenings, cervical \ncancer screenings, contraceptives, birth control.\n  The only thing they don't do is they don't provide abortions outside \nthe limits of the Hyde amendment, and they don't sell baby body parts.\n  Oh, that is right. I guess if selling baby body parts is what is \nimportant about women's health care, then you are right. You have got \nto go to a Planned Parenthood to get it. You can't get it at a \ncommunity health center.\n  Remember, there are 13,000 community health centers providing the \nbroad range, the truly broad range, of health care, not health care \nthat you have to leave, by the way. Maybe you approach some age, you \nare younger than some age, and you don't go to Planned Parenthood \nbecause it is not comprehensive care. Community health centers are. \nThey were designed that way.\n  The Affordable Care Act I am no particular fan of. But the fact of \nthe matter is it set these up to be truly comprehensive primary care \ncenters. And there are 20 times as many as there are Planned \nParenthoods.\n  And you know what? My community health center in my district, if you \ncall today, they are actually open. If you call tomorrow, they are \nopen. But Planned Parenthood isn't. If you call Thursday, Planned \nParenthood is open for 7\\1/2\\ hours. My community health center is open \n8\\1/2\\ hours. If you call Friday, you are out of luck with Planned \nParenthood. Madam Speaker, we are paying Planned Parenthood to keep an \nempty office open that doesn't even provide comprehensive care in my \nclinic.\n  Now, the gentlewoman from New York said that, in this bill, you could \nnot provide an abortion. That is nonsense. Read the bill. It says, as \nlong as you provide abortions consistent with the Hyde amendment--that \nis a rape or incest exclusion or the life of the mother. In fact, the \ngentlewoman was wrong.\n  She said lives are threatened. No, Madam Speaker. If lives are \nthreatened, specifically, this bill says the State can choose to fund \nthat provider and can do that.\n  Madam Speaker, the bottom line is Planned Parenthood--there is only \none thing that it does that you don't get--again, I will reiterate--\nthat you don't get--in a community health center.\n  You can get an abortion usually at any stage of pregnancy for any \nreason, and you can get your baby's body parts sold in the trafficking \nof body parts that we saw in those films.\n  Are those films doctored? They are not doctored. Anyone can go look \non the Web site. They are raw footage. People are talking about a \nLamborghini from the profits of baby body parts. If that isn't \nrepulsive to us, what is? All this bill does is it allows States to \ndefund that.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to point out \nthat the gentleman is absolutely correct. Planned Parenthood does not \nprovide mammograms. They do provide breast cancer screenings.\n  But under this bill, if there is a hospital or a clinic that does \nprovide mammograms and they also provide\n\n[[Page H6331]]\n\nabortions, well, then, the States could prevent funding.\n  So, ironically, under the terms of this bill up for discussion today, \nmammograms could be prevented. I don't think that is the intention of \nthe rider of this bill.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), \na senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I thank my colleague from Colorado for \nyielding to me.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3495, the so-called \nWomen's Public Health and Safety Act.\n  Women's health care is more than mammograms. I know at the Planned \nParenthood in my district over 80 percent of the care they provide is \nfor women's health and not abortion.\n  This bill would give States the right to exclude a healthcare \nprovider who performs abortion care from their Medicaid program.\n  Medicaid provides premium care to millions of low-income women and \nfamilies alike. Excluding providers from Medicaid without cause is \nanother ill-masked attempt to impede reproductive rights.\n\n  This bill, as it is named, is claiming to provide safe public health \ncare for women. By excluding quality healthcare providers, such as \nPlanned Parenthood, the quality of available services will drop. As a \nresult, women's health will be detrimentally harmed.\n  That was proved in a study by a Texas agency after 2011. This is yet \none more attempt to defund Planned Parenthood which, if successful, \nwould hurt millions of women in communities across the country.\n  H.R. 3495 is contradictory to the views of the majority of Americans. \nThree out of four American women support publicly funded family \nplanning centers and believe these centers have a positive impact on \npublic health.\n  By passing this bill, we are harming the millions of women who rely \non publicly funded family planning care. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this damaging bill.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, despite its puffed-up name, this bill has \nnothing to do with protecting women's health or safety. The bill the \nRepublicans pass today would cut off access to health care for millions \nof American families who rely on Medicaid.\n  This bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement for any service, \nPlanned Parenthood or any doctor or hospital or clinic or local health \ncenter that performs or is involved in any way with abortions.\n  If this bill passes, a woman seeking prenatal care for a planned \npregnancy could suddenly be cut off from her doctor if that doctor also \nprovides abortion services or even referral to abortion services.\n  A child with a life-threatening illness could be turned away from his \nhospital because the hospital chair expressed views supportive of \nabortion.\n  A senior citizen with a chronic illness could suddenly find his or \nher prescription lapsed with no way to refill it because his or her \ndoctor is somehow involved with abortion.\n  My colleagues continue to insist that this bill won't interrupt care, \nthat these families, children, and seniors will just see different \ndoctors, will go to different hospitals.\n  How many of my colleagues have ever been on Medicaid? How many of \nthem have ever been turned away by a doctor or told they have to wait \nmonths for an appointment because the doctor simply cannot afford to \naccept any more Medicaid patients?\n  This bill would dramatically worsen the shortage of Medicaid doctors \nand lengthen wait times for patients, putting more people at risk and \nincreasing healthcare costs in the long term. If their overarching goal \nis dismantling Medicaid as we know it, this bill is a strong first \nstep.\n  If we really want to talk about a culture of life, we should be \nbringing bills to the floor to encourage more doctors to serve in high-\nneed areas to give every child access to the highest quality health \ncare.\n  We should be talking about increasing funding for WIC and SNAP to \nmake sure parents, babies, and children aren't going to bed hungry at \nnight.\n  We should be talking about expanding education programs that target \nlow-income students. We should be talking about funding public housing \nprograms to provide stability to families.\n  We should be talking about lowering student loan debt to ensure \nparents can give their kids every opportunity without a crushing burden \nof debt.\n  What we should not be doing is cutting doctors and hospitals and \nclinics and community healthcare centers out of Medicaid and putting \nmore lives at risk.\n  This bill is just another blatant attempt to intimidate doctors and \nhospitals into ending abortion services. Under the guise of promoting \nlife, this bill puts more lives at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Bera).\n  Mr. BERA. I thank my colleague from Colorado.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to another bill restricting \nwomen's access to health care. The so-called Women's Public Health and \nSafety Act is not about public health, and it is certainly not about \nsafety.\n  This is a bill that takes away individual rights. It is a bill that \nwould significantly restrict a woman's access to health care, where \nthey want to go.\n  This is fundamentally about individual rights and an individual's \nability to choose where they want to get health care. It is another \nexample of politicians coming into the exam room and making decisions.\n  Now, my colleagues on the right, Madam Speaker, often will say they \nwant to stand for individual rights. Well, Planned Parenthood has not \nbroken any laws, to my knowledge.\n  If an individual patient wants to go get their care at Planned \nParenthood, that is their right. Planned Parenthood is providing access \nto care. They are doing exactly what their name says: planning and \nhelping families decide when they are ready to start a family, planning \nparenthood. We should be protecting that fundamental individual right.\n  As a doctor, I find it offensive when the government comes into my \nexam room and tells patients what they can and cannot do. Fundamentally \nto the practice of medicine, I have to answer my patients' questions, \nempower them to make the choices that they want to, and let them make \nthose choices.\n  Again, patients should be able to choose their provider. Congress \nshould not be picking and choosing who people can go see. This is about \nindividual rights and preserving that right.\n  I am proud to stand with Planned Parenthood. I am proud to fight to \npreserve those individual rights. As a doctor, we have got to protect \naccess to care.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 10\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, today we are debating H.R. 3495, which should be \ncalled the Yet Another Radical Republican Assault on Women's Health \nCare Act.\n  This bill undermines the longstanding Freedom of Choice providers \nprovision of the Medicaid statute that protects the rights of Medicare \npatients to seek care from any willing, qualified provider.\n  This bill contains language that is so broad that it gives States \nunchecked authority to deny access to any providers it defines as \nparticipating in the performance of abortion.\n  This bill is the latest in a long line of radical Republican efforts \nto defund Planned Parenthood and deny women access to the high-quality \nhealth care services it provides.\n  Madam Speaker, here are the facts:\n  Each year Planned Parenthood provides essential care to 2.7 million \nmen and women. One in five American women have visited Planned \nParenthood at least once.\n\n[[Page H6332]]\n\n  There are 1.5 million young people and adults who participate in \nPlanned Parenthood's educational programs on reproductive health.\n  Each year 700 Planned Parenthood clinics across the United States \nprovide 900,000 cancer screenings to help detect cervical and breast \ncancer, 400,000 Pap tests, and 500,000 breast exams.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Madam Speaker, the cruel irony of this bill is that if it becomes \nlaw, these services, not abortion services, will be put at risk because \nPlanned Parenthood is already prohibited from using Federal funds to \nprovide abortion services except in very limited circumstances. In \nproviding the critical services I just described, Planned Parenthood \nsaves lives.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to close by noting the very articulate and \npowerful testimony that Cecile Richards offered in the House Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee today. It was disturbing that so many \nMembers of this Chamber treated her with such condescension and \ndisrespect.\n  At some point, Madam Speaker, the Republican Party will need to end \nthis war on women and recognize that the question of whether women have \na right to make their own healthcare decisions is a matter of settled \nlaw, and threatening to shut down the government unless we agree to \ndeny millions of women access to high-quality health care is reckless \nand irresponsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for her \nleadership, and I thank the gentleman, Mr. Pitts, because in actuality \nthis is not a debate on people's conscience and what you believe in. It \nis a debate and a question of the law.\n  First of all, the underlying legislation that we have before us is \nlikely to be ruled unconstitutional, and it is likely to be so because \nit meets the very four corners of why the Supreme Court ruled the Texas \nlaw to be unconstitutional, and I venture to say that this bill was a \ncopy of the Texas law.\n  In 2014 and 2015, the Texas legislators tried to stop reproductive \nhealthcare clinics by requiring them to have a hospital-style surgery \ncenter building and staffing requirements, leaving only seven clinics \nto provide health care, the same thing where they threatened the same \nkind of thing which would only leave 10 healthcare providers. Guess \nwhat, Madam Speaker; in 2014 and 2015, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates ruled it unconstitutional and stopped the legislature in their \ntracks. That is what is going to happen to this legislation as well.\n  Let me be very clear: Planned Parenthood does not engage in selling \nbody parts. Yes, as under the law, they do deal with fetal tissue \nresearch, which has saved millions of lives.\n  Under the 1993 NIH Revitalization Act, it is unlawful for any person \nto knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal \ntissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate \ncommerce. They do not do this. The reason I know that is there has been \nno Department of Justice investigation, no Health and Human Services \ninvestigation, and, in actuality, Mr. Daleiden, who is not the FBI and \nnot the Department of Justice, has, in fact, engaged in a deleterious, \ndastardly, and deceitful investigation, even stealing--stealing--the ID \nof one of his fellow high school students.\n  So I am against this bill, and I am against it for the good things \nthat Planned Parenthood does. For example, in my State, there are 38 \nclinics; 150,000 young women are being served, 108,000 on \ncontraceptives, and others are STI.\n  Let me finish, Madam Speaker, by saying mammograms are not done in \nyour doctor's office. You get a referral, and you go to a place where \nyou can get a mammogram with a radiologist.\n  If we would only discuss facts, we would know that the underlying \nbill should be opposed. I oppose it, and I ask my colleagues to oppose \nit.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  I strongly oppose this latest attempt by the Republican House \nmajority to undermine women's rights.\n  Despite its title, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act,'' H.R. \n3495 is nothing more than the latest string of attacks on women's \nhealth.\n  Instead of wasting time fueling politically-charged attacks on health \ncare services for women, and attempting to roll back women's \nconstitutionally protected rights, this House should be advancing \nlegislation that will reform our broken immigration and criminal \njustice systems.\n  And as we approach yet another deadline for piecemeal fiscal fixes, \nwe should be focused on passing a comprehensive and cost-savings \nbudget.\n  Yet, we are here today debating a bill that threatens millions of \nAmerican's access to preventative care and could end up costing \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars if enacted.\n  However, we know this bill will not become law given the President's \nclear Statement of Administrative Policy issued yesterday to veto this \nmeasure.\n  As such, HR 3495 is simply being offered here today as a shameless \npolitical decoy to attack the legal rights of women.\n  If enacted, H.R. 3495 would give states unchecked power to exclude \nwomen's health care providers from participating in Medicaid.\n  Hampering women's health and safety, this bill would enable states \nthat are hostile to women's right to abortion, and to Planned \nParenthood, to freely target women's health care providers for \nexclusion from Medicaid.\n  The United States Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago, in Roe v. \nWade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), that a woman's constitutional right to \nprivacy includes her right to abortion.\n  Since this landmark decision, abortion rates and risks have \nsubstantially declined, as have the number of teen and unwanted \npregnancies.\n  However, politicians continue to try to sneak around the Constitution \nand four decades of Supreme Court precedent with sham laws that do \nnothing to improve women's health care and only make it more difficult, \nif not impossible, to obtain safe and legal abortion.\n  Restricting all access to reproductive and women's health services \nonly exacerbates a woman's risk of an unintended pregnancy and fails to \naccomplish any meaningful overthrow of Roe v. Wade.\n  In recent years, state policymakers have passed hundreds of \nrestrictions on abortion care under the guise of protecting women's \nhealth and safety.\n  Fights here in Congress have been no different.\n  In my state of Texas a law that would have cut off access to 75 \npercent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 2015.\n  On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional \na Texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that \nprovided the full range of services would be required to have a \nhospital-style surgery center building and staffing requirements.\n  This requirement meant that only 7 clinics would be allowed to \ncontinue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to \nwomen.\n  Any woman facing an unintended pregnancy needs to be able to make her \nown decisions and weigh all her options--and these laws take those \noptions away.\n  Texas has 268,580 square miles, only second in size to the state of \nAlaska.\n  The impact of the law in implementation would have ended access to \nreproductive services for millions of women in my state.\n  In 2015, the State of Texas once again threatened women's access to \nreproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10 \nhealthcare providers in the state of Texas.\n  The Supreme Court once again intervened on the behalf of Texas women \nto block the move to close clinics in my state.\n  It seems every month we are faced with a new attack on women's access \nto reproductive health care, often couched in deceptive terms and \nconcern for women's health and safety.\n  And in fact we are here today supposedly to talk about the safety of \nwomen--But we know that's not really the case.\n  If my colleagues were so concerned about women's health and safety, \nthey would be promoting any one of the number of evidence-based \nproactive policies that improve women's health and well-being.\n  Instead, they are proposing yet another attempt to ban abortion.\n  That is their number one priority. This is certainly not about \nprotecting women's health, it's about politics.\n  We must separate the personal views of abortion from the legal issues \nand fundamental constitutional rights.\n  Undisputable, every woman has the constitutional right to make \npersonal health care decisions so basic that it must be equally \nprotected for all.\n  Yet, this bill provides an outright pathway to discriminate against \npoor and minority women.\n  H.R. 3495 would give states broad discretion to exclude any person, \ninstitution, agency\n\n[[Page H6333]]\n\nor entity that ``performs or participates in the performance of \nabortions'' from participating in Medicaid.\n  According to policy experts and advocates, such as the ACLU and \nNational Partnership for Women and Families, this extreme measure would \nmean that not only would all such women's health care providers be cut \nout of Medicaid, but states could also attempt to use it to eliminate a \nwide range of other health care providers, with serious and devastating \nconsequences for low-income patients.\n  Restricting access to women's reproductive health care providers \nmakes it increasingly difficult--and sometimes impossible--for women \nwho have decided to end a pregnancy to get the safe, legal, high-\nquality care they need.\n  The result is not the elimination of abortions, but higher costs, \nlonger delays, and extra steps for women seeking abortion care, and in \nthe process punish women for their decision to exercise their \nconstitutional right to end a pregnancy.\n  History tells us that unsafe and late-term abortions did not cease to \nexist without adequate access to clinical service. Rather, the exact \nopposite--as we know limited and restricted access only leads to unsafe \nand dangerous practices.\n  Today, countless women in states like Texas and Mississippi, \nWisconsin, Alabama, Tennessee, and Louisiana--where state laws are \nalready gravely impacting women's access to health care providers--\nwomen are being forced to travel upwards of hundreds of miles or cross \nstate lines to access their constitutional right to an abortion.\n  These restrictions create sharp disparities in access to care that \nare troublingly reminiscent of the time before Roe v. Wade, when access \ndepended on a woman's social status, where she lived or her ability to \ntravel to another state.\n  In an effort to undermine what they could not otherwise overturn, \npoliticians are attempting to ``turn back the clock'' to the pre-Roe \nera by shuttering reproductive health care clinics and cutting off \nwomen's access to safe and legal abortion care.\n  Yet, far too many women who cannot afford to travel elsewhere will \nface an impossible choice between carrying an unintended pregnancy to \nterm or seeking drastic options outside the law.\n  A right that only exists on paper is no right at all.\n  Simply, restricting a women's right and access to legal abortion \nservices discriminately endangers the lives of women.\n  Congress should be doing everything it can to ensure that women have \naccess to preventive care, not eliminating it.\n  This is a legislative assault on all progressive health care, \nservice, and advocacy organizations who aim to provide vital care and \nservices to women and men across this country.\n  Hundreds of thousands have already spoken up, including leading \ngroups and communities such as the growing voice of our millennial \ngeneration.\n  For instance, the nearly 60,000 OB-GYN physicians and partners in \nwomen's health warn that this bill would scare providers away from \nproviding comprehensive, compassionate care to women, in a time where \nAmerica desperately needs more ob-gyns participating in Medicaid \nprograms.\n  Physicians and experts in the field have long argued that these \ndamaging measures serve no medical purpose, interfere in the doctor/\npatient relationship, and do nothing to promote women's health.\n  My colleagues should not be closing the door to health care services.\n  Rather, my colleagues should be doing more to connect our youth and \nwomen to services that help them reduce their risk of unintended \npregnancies and STD's, and improve their overall health through \npreventative screenings, education and planning, and not restricting \ntheir access to lawfully entitled family planning and private health \nservices.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, there has been a lot of talk here about a bill that is \nonly two pages long. You have heard a lot of talk about and a lot of \nmisstatements of fact about Planned Parenthood. But guess what; this \nbill is really about giving the States the ability to hurt women, and \nit never even mentions Planned Parenthood. It never mentions any of the \nprocedures that you have heard about here on the floor. It merely gives \nthe States the ability to wipe out clinics that serve women.\n  So it isn't about abortion procedures. It isn't about Planned \nParenthood. It is about taking away access to health care. This bill \ngives the authority to States to cut off all of those services if they \nspecialize in health care for women.\n  When is this war on women going to stop? Your party ought to be \nashamed of its reputation in this country now that it is really taking \non women on all issues. So on behalf of my wife, my daughter, and my \ngranddaughter, who will need access to women's services--hopefully not \nabortion, but if necessary, maybe--I would hope that this war on women \nwould stop and that all of us would vote against it.\n  Oppose this legislation.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We have heard a lot of emotion today, Madam Speaker, and a lot of \nideas and ugly things being thrown around, but as a lawyer with legal \ntraining, I did something radical. I actually read this bill. It didn't \ntake me very long, because, as Mr. Farr pointed out, it is only two \npages long.\n  I want to talk about what this bill would really do because this bill \nwould do far, far more than its proponents claim that it would do.\n  Let me say, first of all, there is no Federal money that is spent on \nabortion in most cases in the United States. This has been the law of \nthe land for a long time. I disagree with that law because I think it \nlimits full reproductive health for women who can least afford it, but \nthat is the law of the land.\n  So what are we talking about here? What we are talking about is \nStates being able to deny money to anybody who is directly or \nindirectly involved with abortion services with nongovernmental money, \nwith private money from women and their family, with insurance money, \nwith nongovernmental money.\n  So here is how this bill would work. A State could decide that, if a \nhospital provided abortions with nongovernment money, it simply wasn't \ngoing to authorize State money or Medicaid money to that hospital. I \ndon't mean just Medicaid money for women's services; I mean all \nMedicaid money or State money, all money for services.\n  This bill could say that an OB-GYN who has co-privileges at a \nhospital that provides abortion could now not serve any--any--Medicaid \npatients. This bill would say that a doctor who provides services at a \nneighborhood healthcare clinic who has privileges at a hospital that \nprovides abortion could now be banned from taking Medicaid patients. \nThat is how broad this bill is written.\n  Madam Speaker, what this would do is it would allow States to \nterminate all government funds to any entity that directly or \nindirectly provides abortions with nongovernment dollars.\n  So what would this do? Well, 72 million people in this country are on \nMedicaid right now. These people are men, these people are women, and \nthese people are children. These people are people who take women's \nmedical services and those who don't need them. These 72 million \nAmericans risk the loss of all of their healthcare services under \nMedicaid because of this radical bill.\n  Now, okay, let's say that won't really happen. Let's say that is just \nan overbroad interpretation of the bill. So then our colleagues on the \nother side say, well, let's just limit ourselves to community health \ncenters. If we use this bill to deny funding for Planned Parenthood, \neveryone will go to community health centers. Let's see how that would \nwork.\n  Right now, we have 24 million patients in this country in community \nhealth centers. The community health centers themselves tell us, for \nevery one of those 24 million patients they are taking, right now they \nare turning away seven people. So we have 4.2 million Planned \nParenthood patients. Let's say those 4.2 Planned Parenthood patients \ndecide to go to the community health clinics. That is not going to \nwork.\n  They tried this in Louisiana. In Louisiana, a Federal judge found \nthere would be 29 providers for 5,000 women to get healthcare services. \nThat is untenable, that is unacceptable, and it puts our Nation's \nwomen's health at risk.\n  Listen, since we have been debating this bill today, we are 1 hour \ncloser to a government shutdown, and we have done nothing to make sure \nwe are not going to do that. I would suggest that we refocus our \nefforts, that we stop beating up Planned Parenthood, that we stop \nbeating up women's health,\n\n[[Page H6334]]\n\nthat we get together collectively and we say: How are we going to keep \nthis government open? How are we going to work together to make sure \nevery man and woman in this country has a good job, good health \ninsurance, and that they can provide for their families? That is what \nwe are elected to do, and that is what I commit myself to do on behalf \nof this body.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, we have heard lots of arguments here on the floor. We \nhave heard about abortion being a healthcare issue. Abortion is not a \nhealthcare issue. Abortion is the most violent form of death known to \nmankind: death by dismemberment and decapitation. It is horrific.\n  These video clips that we have seen show the graphic nature of what \nthey are doing to these little unborn babies in Planned Parenthood \nclinics and the harvesting of their body parts.\n  You call that humane? It is horrific. It is barbaric.\n  Why is this bill necessary? Currently, CMS is bullying States, \ntelling them they must include providers of elective abortions in their \nMedicaid programs. This bill empowers States with the needed \nflexibility to design their Medicaid programs in a manner that is \nconsistent with pro-life values in a State.\n  The gentleman talked about patients. Well, a lot of unborn babies are \ntreated as patients in their mother's womb. One lady talked about, what \nabout individual rights? Well, what about the rights of these little \npatients in the womb?\n  Madam Speaker, this bill merely gives States the flexibility to \nchoose to establish criteria regarding the participation in its \nMedicaid program of entities or persons who perform or participate in \nthe performance of elective abortions.\n  Under this bill, low-income women and men will still have access to \nmore than 13,000 federally qualified health centers in rural health \ncenter sites, in addition to at least 1,200 private and free charitable \nclinics. In contrast, Planned Parenthood has some 665 clinics. They can \nfind health care near them because these federally qualified and rural \nhealth centers are 20 to every 1 Planned Parenthood clinic.\n  We have the list of the Members here. Some of the Members who have \nspoken may have one Planned Parenthood clinic. They may have 56, 44--\nthe list varies--community health centers who would get that \nredistributed money and provide real health care, as Dr. Harris said.\n  This bill gives States the flexibility to design their Medicaid \nprograms in a manner they choose to serve their Medicaid patients. So I \nstrongly urge support for H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and \nSafety Act.\n  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the question of adopting \na motion to recommit on H.R. 3495 may be subject to postponement as \nthough under clause 8 of rule XX.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, as Congress works to defund the \nnation's largest abortion provider--Planned Parenthood,\n  Following a number of undercover videos revealing potential baby part \nsales,\n  It is only right that we allow states to defund abortion providers as \nwell.\n  If the governor of a state believes that funding these organizations \ngoes against the will of the people, they should be permitted to do so.\n  That includes funding through Medicaid.\n  H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act bill simply gives \nstates the flexibility to do just that.\n  Women should receive the best healthcare,\n  But they should not be put at risk, along with their unborn children, \nby organizations who are driven by profit.\n  The federal government and state governments should not be forced to \nhave blood on their hands.\n  We do not need to fund Planned Parenthood, which killed over 327,000 \nbabies in 2013 alone.\n  And states do not need to do this either.\n  Instead, we should be sending this money to health centers that truly \nhave the patients in mind.\n  How many more Planned Parenthood scandals do we need before they are \ncut off from federal and state dollars?\n  How many more mothers will be lied to and babies killed as a result \nof continued funding?\n  Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, for that matter, \nmust be defunded.\n  It is our role to protect the most vulnerable among us--\n  Unborn children and mothers and families in crisis alike.\n  I urge a YES vote on H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety \nAct.\n  And that's just the way it is.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 444, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. SINEMA. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. SINEMA. Madam Speaker, I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Sinema moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3495 to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report \n     the same to the House forthwith with the following amendment:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in the amendments made by this Act shall be \n     construed as prohibiting health care services from being \n     provided to a woman by an institution, agency, entity, or \n     person, so long as such services are provided to protect the \n     health of the woman.\n\n  Mr. PITTS (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of \norder against the motion to recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nArizona is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Madam Speaker, this motion to recommit is the final \namendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to \ncommittee. If this amendment is adopted, the bill will immediately \nproceed to final passage, as amended.\n  This motion is straightforward and commonsense. The motion ensures \nthat nothing in this bill prohibits a woman's access to healthcare \nservices. This amendment protects the health of American women.\n  I believe a woman's personal healthcare decisions should be decided \nby the woman, her family, and her doctor. Women and their families \nshould be able to make these decisions free from government \ninterference.\n  Despite our political differences, protecting the health, safety, and \nindependence of American women is something that most of us in this \nChamber can readily support. It is what the American people want and \nbelieve.\n  The American people and people in my home State of Arizona want \nCongress to put aside partisanship and focus on solving our country's \ngreat challenges. They want Congress to focus on growing our economy, \ncreating opportunity for hardworking families, making college \naffordable, reforming the VA, and strengthening our military and \nnational security. The list goes on and on.\n  It is no surprise that Republicans and Democrats alike think that \nCongress is a mess, but Congress doesn't have to be a mess. Congress \ncan produce results when it puts partisanship aside and works for the \nAmerican people.\n  Earlier this year, we worked together to find a real solution to the \nlong-term challenge of reimbursing doctors through Medicaid. We \nreplaced the SGR and protected seniors' access to health care. That is \nthe kind of success we can achieve for the American people if we work \ntogether.\n  We also worked together to help prevent veteran suicide and improve \naccess to mental health care for veterans. The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which \npassed with the support of every Member of Congress, is an important \nstep toward ending the epidemic of veteran suicide in our country. That \nis the kind of\n\n[[Page H6335]]\n\nwork we can do for our veterans when we work together.\n  We worked together to pass the 21st Century Cures Act to encourage \nbiomedical innovation and the development of lifesaving treatments and \ncures. This creative, bipartisan approach cuts through red tape, \nallowing innovators to focus on lifesaving discoveries rather than \ngovernment bureaucracy. These are the solutions we can create when we \nwork together.\n  Last night, we passed the PACE Act, which enables employees at small- \nand medium-sized businesses to keep their health insurance plans. This \nis the kind of bipartisan work we can accomplish.\n  If we work together, we can get things done for the American people. \nWe can find a long-term sustainable solution to funding our highways \nand infrastructure; we can pass a budget that creates jobs and \nopportunity, grows our economy, and improves our national security; and \nwe can reform our broken Tax Code so it provides certainty, encourages \njob growth, and enables us to compete on a global scale.\n  Instead, I've watched Congress fight once again in a partisan way, \nwithout a bipartisan solution on the horizon. This is not what \nArizonans want. It is not what the American people want.\n  I offer this motion today to stand for something we all agree on, \nprotecting the health of women, and I ask my colleagues to support this \nreasonable motion.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentlewoman's motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, today, under the Obama administration's \ninterpretation of Federal statute, States are forced to include in \ntheir Medicaid program providers who perform elective abortions, \nwhether they like it or not.\n  The Women's Public Health and Safety Act is a commonsense measure \nthat would allow a State to choose to establish criteria regarding the \nparticipation in its Medicaid program of entities or persons who \nperform or participate in the performance of elective abortions.\n  Unlike what some Members on the other side of the aisle have said, \nthis bill will not harm women's access to health care. Rather, this \ngives States more tools to design a Medicaid program that fully serves \nlow-income women and men.\n  The Women's Public Health and Safety Act would put States back in the \ndriver's seat and let each State design their Medicaid program in a \nmanner that best meets the needs and respects the choices and values of \nthe people within their States.\n  This bill should be supported by every Member who believes the States \nshould be strong, full partners in the operation of the Medicaid \nprogram. If State taxpayers do not want to include abortion providers \nin their Medicaid program, they should not be forced to include them.\n  I urge the Members strongly to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

IMPROVED AUDITING OF CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Performance of Non-defense Audits by \n     DCAA.--\n       (1) In general.--Effective on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Defense Contract Audit Agency may not provide \n     audit support for non-Defense Agencies unless the Secretary \n     of Defense certifies that the backlog for incurred cost \n     audits is less than 18 months of incurred cost inventory.\n       (2) Adjustment in funding for reimbursements from non-\n     defense agencies.--The amount appropriated and otherwise \n     available to the Defense Contract Audit Agency for a fiscal \n     year beginning after September 30, 2016, shall be reduced by \n     an amount equivalent to any reimbursements received by the \n     Agency from non-Defense Agencies for audit support provided.\n       (b) Amendments to Defense Contract Audit Agency Annual \n     Report.--Section 2313a(a) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by amending subparagraph (D) to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(D) the total costs of sustained or recovered costs both \n     as a total number and as a percentage of questioned costs; \n     and'';\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a \n     semicolon;\n       (3) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and\n       (4) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(4) a description of outreach actions toward industry to \n     promote more effective use of audit resources; and''.\n       (c) Review of Acquisition Oversight and Audits.--\n       (1) Review required.--The Secretary of Defense shall review \n     the oversight and audit structure of the Department of \n     Defense with the goals of--\n       (A) enhancing the productivity of oversight and program and \n     contract auditing to avoid duplicative audits; and\n       (B) streamlining of oversight reviews.\n       (2) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall ensure \n     streamlined oversight reviews and avoidance of duplicative \n     audits and make recommendations in the report required under \n     paragraph (3) for any necessary changes in law.\n       (3) Report.--\n       (A) Not later than one year after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on actions taken to \n     avoid duplicative audits and streamline oversight reviews.\n       (B) The report required under this paragraph shall include \n     the following elements:\n       (i) A description of actions taken to avoid duplicative \n     audits and streamline oversight reviews based on the review \n     conducted under paragraph (1).\n\n[[Page H6401]]\n\n       (ii) A comparison of commercial industry accounting \n     practices, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley \n     Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-204; 15 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.), \n     with the cost accounting standards prescribed under chapter \n     15 of title 41, United States Code, to determine if some \n     portions of cost accounting standards compliance can be met \n     through such practices or requirements.\n       (iii) A description of standards of materiality used by the \n     Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Inspector General of \n     the Department of Defense for defense contract audits.\n       (iv) An estimate of average delay and range of delays in \n     contract awards due to the time necessary for the Defense \n     Contract Audit Agency to complete pre-award audits.\n       (v) The total costs of sustained or recovered costs both as \n     a total number and as a percentage of questioned costs.\n       (d) Incurred Cost Inventory Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``incurred cost inventory'' means the level of \n     contractor incurred cost proposals in inventory from prior \n     fiscal years that are currently being audited by the Defense \n     Contract Audit Agency.\n\n     SEC. 894. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EVALUATION METHOD FOR \n                   PROCUREMENT OF AUDIT OR AUDIT READINESS \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Given the size, scope, and complexity of the Department \n     of Defense, the statutory deadline to establish and maintain \n     auditable financial statements, starting with the fiscal year \n     2018 financial statement, is one of the more challenging \n     management tasks that has ever faced the Department.\n       (2) As the military services have never received a clean \n     opinion on their consolidated financial statements and only \n     recently begun auditing portions of their financial \n     statements, the audits of military service financial \n     statements will also be a complex challenge for companies \n     selected to provide audit services.\n       (3) The acquisition of services by the Department abides by \n     many rules and parameters, one of which is the lowest price, \n     technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation method. LPTA is \n     generally appropriate for commercial or noncomplex services \n     or supplies where the requirement is clearly definable and \n     the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     before using the lowest price, technically acceptable \n     evaluation method for the procurement of audit or audit \n     readiness services, the Secretary of Defense should establish \n     the values and metrics for evaluating companies offering \n     audit services, including financial management and audit \n     expertise and experience, personnel qualifications and \n     certifications, past performance, technology, tools, and \n     size.\n\n     SEC. 895.

SURVEY ON THE COSTS OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Survey.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a \n     survey of contractors with the highest level of \n     reimbursements for cost type contracts with the Department of \n     Defense during fiscal year 2014 to estimate industry's cost \n     of regulatory compliance (as a percentage of total costs) \n     with Government-unique acquisition regulations and \n     requirements in the categories of quality assurance, \n     accounting and financial management, contracting and \n     purchasing, program management, engineering, logistics, \n     material management, property administration, and other \n     unique requirements not imposed on contracts for commercial \n     items.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report on the \n     findings of the survey conducted under subsection (a). The \n     data received as a result of the survey and included in the \n     report shall be aggregated to protect against the public \n     release of proprietary information.\n\n     SEC. 897.

The authority \n     to require certified cost or pricing data under this \n     paragraph shall not apply to any contract of an offeror that \n     has not been awarded, for at least the one-year period \n     preceding the issuance of a solicitation for the contract, \n     any other contract in excess of $5,000,000 under which the \n     offeror was required to submit certified cost or pricing data \n     under section 2306a of title 10, United States Code.\n       (4) Exception.--The head of the procuring activity may not \n     require certified cost or pricing data to be submitted under \n     this subsection for any contract or subcontract, or \n     modification of a contract or subcontract, covered by the \n     exceptions in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 2306a(b)(1) \n     of title 10, United States Code.\n       (5) Delegation of authority prohibited.--The head of a \n     procuring activity may not delegate functions under this \n     subsection.\n       (d) Reports.--Not later than January 1, 2017, and January \n     1, 2019, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on activities \n     undertaken under this section.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Head of an agency.--The term ``head of an agency'' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 2302 of title 10, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) Pilot program period.--The term ``pilot program \n     period'' means the period beginning on October 1, 2016, and \n     ending on September 30, 2019.\n\n      TITLE IX--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT\n\nSec. 901.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES MARINE \n                   CORPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As senior United States statesman Dr. Henry Kissinger \n     wrote in testimony submitted to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate on January 29, 2015, ``The United \n     States has not faced a more diverse and complex array of \n     crises since the end of the Second World War.''.\n       (2) The rise of non-state forces and near peer competitors \n     has introduced destabilizing pressures around the globe.\n       (3) Advances in information and weapons technology have \n     reduced the time available for the United States to prepare \n     for and respond to crises against both known and unknown \n     threats.\n       (4) The importance of the maritime domain cannot be \n     overstated. As acknowledged in the March 2015 Navy, Marine \n     Corps, and Coast Guard maritime strategy, ``A Cooperative \n     Strategy for 21st Century Seapower: Forward, Engaged, \n     Ready'': ``Oceans are the lifeblood of the\n\n[[Page H6402]]\n\n     interconnected global community. . . 90 percent of trade by \n     volume travels across the oceans. Approximately 70 percent of \n     the world's population lives within 100 miles of the \n     coastline.''.\n       (5) The United States must be prepared to rapidly respond \n     to crises around the world regardless of the nation's fiscal \n     health.\n       (6) In this global security environment, it is critical \n     that the nation possess a maritime force whose mission and \n     ethos is readiness--a fight tonight force, forward deployed, \n     that can respond immediately to emergent crises across the \n     full range of military operations around the globe either \n     from the sea or home station.\n       (7) The need for such a force was recognized by the 82nd \n     Congress during the Korean War, when it mandated a core \n     mission for the nation's leanest force--the Marine Corps--to \n     be most ready when the nation is least ready.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Marine Corps, within the Department of the Navy, \n     remain the Nation's expeditionary, crisis response force;\n       (2) the need for such a force with such a capability has \n     never been greater; and\n       (3) accordingly, in recognition of this need and the wisdom \n     of the 82nd Congress, the 114th Congress reaffirms section \n     5063 of title 10, United States Code, which states that the \n     Marine Corps--\n       (A) shall--\n       (i) be organized to include not less than three combat \n     divisions and three air wings, and such other land combat, \n     aviation, and other services as may be organic therein;\n       (ii) be organized, trained, and equipped to provide fleet \n     marine forces of combined arms, together with supporting air \n     components, for service with the fleet in the seizure or \n     defense of advanced naval bases and for the conduct of such \n     land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a \n     naval campaign; and\n       (iii) provide detachments and organizations for service on \n     armed vessels of the Navy, provide security detachments for \n     the protection of naval property at naval stations and bases, \n     and perform such other duties as the President may direct;\n     but these additional duties may not detract from nor \n     interfere with the operations for which the Marine Corps is \n     primarily organized;\n       (B) shall develop, in coordination with the Army and the \n     Air Force, those phases of amphibious operations that pertain \n     to the tactics, techniques, and equipment used by landing \n     forces; and\n       (C) is responsible, in accordance with the integrated joint \n     mobilization plans, for the expansion of peacetime components \n     of the Marine Corps to meet the needs of war.\n\n                      TITLE X--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                     Subtitle A--Financial Matters\n\nSec. 1001.

Madam Speaker, when economic sanctions were lifted on \nLibya a decade ago, the United States secured an agreement that the \nQadhafi regime compensate victims of terror attacks, such as the \nbombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n  Today Iran, a state sponsor of terror, owes more than $43 billion in \ndamages to victims of Iranian-sponsored terrorism from over 80 \ndifferent court-ordered decisions. Not 1 cent has been paid by Iran. \nAnd, yet, the President is moving forward to lift economic sanctions, \ngiving Iran a $100 billion windfall without compensating terrorist \nvictims.\n  Madam Speaker, we should make sure that American victims of Iranian \nterror receive their judgments before any economic sanctions are \nlifted. We need to pass the Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism \nAct to ensure that Iran will not see any sanctions relief until it \nfirst pays the money they owe to the families of Americans killed by \nIranian-sponsored terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6700-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PROJECT MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I will just cut to the chase. We \nare all aware of the boondoggle that is the Denver, Colorado, VA \nmedical facility construction project.\n  The ongoing Denver veterans' hospital project has nearly tripled in \ninitial VA cost projections. It is more than $1 billion over budget, \nwhich is a gross disservice to our veterans during a time of scarce \nresources.\n  Section 502 of this legislation inserts basic project management \nrequirements, like those I learned as a management consultant, over \ncertain so-called super-construction projects at the VA, like the \nDenver facility.\n  Sadly, project costs and schedule overruns aren't unique to the VA, \nbut they exist throughout the Federal Government. That is why I have \nintroduced the Project Management Improvement and Accountability Act. \nThis legislation would instill basic project management principles \nthroughout all levels of the Federal Government, ensuring taxpayers \nsave much-needed money during this down economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/house-section/article/H6700-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD MUST GO\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as our eyes turn toward New York both \nin terms of the Pope's visit last week and his call for us to address \nthe mandatory needs of refugees around the world, in the last 24 hours, \nwe heard from the President of Russia, Mr. Putin, and our President on \nSyria.\n  I think it is important for this Congress to begin to look again at a \nman by the name of Assad, who is not only poisoning his own people, but \nbombing hospitals and ambulances and creating a situation of \ndevastation. I think the President is correct that Assad must go, and \nthere must be a reconciliation as to how that proceeds.\n  To Mr. Putin, who has a stake in this area, through Syria, you have \nto come with the world family and begin to think of those who are \nsuffering. We can work together, but Assad cannot stay. We must find a \nway for the good people of Syria to be able to return in peace and \njustice and equality.\n  The United Nations must take a stand.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, undeniably, the issue that we hear about \nthe most in our districts across America is the need to create a \nclimate that grows jobs to allow the dignity of work to be realized by \nour constituents and to enable them to earn a sound paycheck.\n  We can ill-afford to play games with the jobs agenda. We need to do \neverything within our power to be able to provide for those resources \nand develop those policies that will create that climate that grows \nprivate sector jobs and enables public sector jobs to administer the \nservices that we require as a Nation.\n  For years, I have been coming to this floor, speaking with great \nfervor about the Make It In America agenda, making certain that we take \ngreat pride in that opportunity that we, as a Nation, have always \nembraced: the pioneer spirit, the innovation that challenges us today.\n  That Make It In America agenda has many, many needs. I have spoken to \nthe need for implementing sound manufacturing policies, retrofitting \nour centers of employment, our manufacturing centers, so that they can \ncompete with cutting-edge technology on their side.\n  I have advanced the concern and the issue of funding research, making \ncertain that we do things smarter, which will enable us to be more \ncompetitive in those economic sweepstakes on an international scale.\n  I have focused on STEM education, making certain in this innovation \neconomy that we have those scientists, technology-driven types, \nengineers, math majors, that can take us forward with the sort of \nskills and talent that we require.\n  I have talked about improving our infrastructure to make certain that \ncommerce's demands for sound infrastructure will be met so that they \ncan ship their products and transport their products. I have talked \nabout the need to grow our exports as a Nation.\n  Well, I believe this can be boiled down to a simple message. The idea \nis to make more, use less, and sell it everywhere, in other words, \npromote domestic manufacturing, enhance our efficiency--energy \nefficiency and, across the board, all types of efficiency--and then \nenable us to then export American-made goods.\n  Well, this trio has been hindered of late because of a refusal to \nreauthorize in this House the Export-Import Bank, which is a great \nservice that allows for loans, loan guarantees, and can stand as an \ninsurance policy, a government creditor, for contracts when bid upon by \nour private sector industries and businesses. That damage, that delay, \nhad been troublesome.\n  I have come to this floor many times. I have joined with my \ncolleagues in press conferences. I have invoked our leadership to bring \nthe measure to the floor because I think, if we do, it passes.\n  I have talked also about signing on. I have signed onto petitions to \ndischarge, to make certain, again, that we raise the public \nconsciousness to this growing concern of lacking the reauthorization of \nour Export-Import Bank.\n  Well, the damage came and hit my district. I would say to America we \nin Congress, this House and its leadership, are playing with fire \nbecause now we have a major corporation--in this case, GE in my \ndistrict--that will be transitioning hundreds, 500 or more, jobs to \nFrance because of the lack of an Export-Import Bank here.\n  There are some 84, 85 Export-Import Banks around the world. Some 60-\nplus\n\n[[Page H6701]]\n\nnations have this concept at their grasp. So the French Government has \nauthorized the Export-Import Bank to be utilized by GE.\n  Now I witness hundreds of jobs in my own district that will be \ntransferred to another set of workers, damaging the American Dream of \npeople that I represent. This is unthinkable, unthinkable.\n  This could be avoided. All it takes is a simple exercise to bring an \nissue to the floor, bring the bill to the floor, of which I am a \ncosponsor, and act on it. I believe wholeheartedly that, in a \nbipartisan fashion, that measure would pass.\n  So tonight we are going to use these minutes to advocate for the \nExport-Import Bank, to have that vote brought to the floor. We will \nbegin with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is a friend, a \nleader in our House, and is our minority whip.\n  Representative Steny Hoyer, thank you for joining us this evening.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) has been a \nleader on our agenda of Make It In America. It is a jobs plan which has \nincluded reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank as a way of helping our \nbusinesses and workers compete on a level playing field \ninternationally.\n  Since the bank's charter expired on July 1, many small- and medium-\nsized exporters have been left without a critical resource, forced to \ncompete with foreign companies that have the support of more than 80 \nforeign export credit agencies.\n  Uncertainty over the bank's future has already led businesses to \nannounce jobs being moved overseas. My friend from New York talked \nabout General Electric moving hundreds of jobs from his district and \nother districts as well.\n  Jeff Immelt, the president and CEO of GE, was here. He talked to \nDemocrats and Republicans and said: You are hurting American jobs. Yet, \nwe do not have the Export-Import Bank reauthorization on the floor even \nthough, Madam Speaker, it enjoys a majority support in this House.\n  We have heard a number of very sound arguments for why Congress ought \nto pass a multi-year reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank without \nfurther delay.\n  One of those, Madam Speaker, came from Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom \nDonohue, who wrote on September 17--this is the Chamber of Commerce \npresident, not Steny Hoyer, the democratic leader.\n  He said this: Every major trading nation has an export credit agency \nlike Ex-Im. . . . Failure to reauthorize Ex-Im would amount to \nunilateral disarmament in the face of other governments' far more \naggressive export credit agencies. He went on to say: American \ncompanies are being forced to compete with one hand tied behind their \nback.\n  Another comes from 28 Governors on a bipartisan basis who sent a \nletter to us and said this: Failure to act--meaning failure to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank--will place American industries at a \nsignificant disadvantage in the global marketplace and harm businesses \nin our States.\n  The Governors, bipartisan, said: We strongly urge you--we, the \nCongress; we, the House of Representatives--to pass a long-term \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  Let me add, Madam Speaker, another voice to this discussion as well. \nThat is the voice of Speaker Boehner, who said in April: There are \nthousands of jobs on the line that would disappear pretty quickly if \nthe Ex-Im Bank were to disappear. The Speaker has also said, when he \ntook office, that the House ought to work its will.\n  Madam Speaker, the votes are on the floor of this House to pass the \nreauthorization. Republicans and Democrats are working together to help \ncreate American jobs, retain American jobs, grow our economy, and be \ncompetitive internationally. It is now time to put the principle into \npractice of letting the House work its will.\n  Sixty Republican Members of this House have cosponsored a bill to \nreauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  If you add up the 180-plus Democrats who have signed a discharge \npetition and those 60 Republicans, you get to 240. You only need 218, \nso clearly we have the votes to pass it.\n  I say to the Speaker and the majority leader, the House's will is \nclear. The effects of allowing the Ex-Im shutdown to continue are \nclear: more and more jobs being sent overseas. Our responsibility as \nthe representatives of thousands of businesses and workers is very \nclear. Bring the Export-Import Bank to the floor for a vote.\n  I want to thank Ranking Member Maxine Waters, Ranking Member Gwen \nMoore, and Representative Denny Heck for their continued leadership on \nthis issue. I want to thank my friend Representative Tonko from New \nYork for leading today's Special Order on such a critically important \nissue, an issue that we all speak to, that we all say we are committed \nto, that we all say we want to work towards, and that is creating jobs \nfor Americans in America. I thank my friend from New York.\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from Maryland for his voice on this \nissue.\n  It is clear that the Democrats in this House are staunchly for \nreauthorization of this concept. When people talk about the tools in \nthe toolkit that are required, growing exports is a very important part \nof the equation for economic recovery and economic growth.\n  This concept of an Export-Import Bank reduces the deficit by some \n$675 million, at last annual count, and grows jobs to the tune of \n164,000, per the last count. So reduce the deficit and grow jobs; isn't \nthat the mantra that we hear time and time again from folks who \nrepresent all of America in this House of Representatives? It stands to \nreason that we bring the bill to the floor for a vote.\n  America should not tolerate this. The business community, the \ncommerce voices of this Nation, from chambers of commerce across this \ncountry is resonating with we the Democrats in this House. We need \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. What don't we understand? \nLet's go forward and encourage that that vote be taken very, very soon.\n  One of the people that I get to serve with is a longtime friend. We \nhave served in the New York State Assembly together, and we now serve \nhere in the United States House of Representatives together. We have \nbeen very concerned about job growth in New York State and, in \nparticular, along that manufacturing corridor called the Erie Canal \nwhich gave birth to a number of mill towns that then became epicenters \nof invention and innovation. Today they stand as inspiration as to how \nto speak to that pioneer spirit that is within our DNA as a nation.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), my good \nfriend. Thank you for sharing your thoughts this evening. Thank you for \njoining us.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Thank you, Mr. Tonko. I am delighted to be here with \nyou.\n  Mr. Tonko has pointed out that he and I were elected to the New York \nState Assembly on the same day. We have worked diligently while we were \nthere for the people of New York to try to better their lot, and it is \nso wonderful now that we are working for all 50 States and New York, \nagain, in mind. The people who sent us here knew that we stood for \nthings like the Ex-Im Bank, knew that we understood that if we did not \nhave a strong economy, we couldn't do much of anything else in our \ndistrict like provide a good education and health care, and that the \neconomy was the backbone of what we are doing.\n  I appreciate your yielding me this time to discuss the importance of \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Tonko, it is incredible to me, frankly, that we should have to \ncome to the House floor to call for the Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization. \nIt is an important agency that has worked to ensure a level playing \nfield around the world for the United States exporters for more than 80 \nyears. Last year alone, Ex-Im supported 164,000 United States jobs \nthrough $20.5 billion in export insurance, loans, and loan guarantees, \nand all while returning $675 million to taxpayers, because it is \nessentially a revolving fund which is paid for by the user fees. So \nhere we have an agency sponsored by the government costing us basically \nnothing, putting money back into the Treasury, which makes companies \neligible to be able to sell their goods throughout the world.\n\n[[Page H6702]]\n\n  Now, my district of Rochester, New York, is home to advanced \nmanufacturers on the cutting edge of research and development, and we \ndo need the Ex-Im Bank to help market our products worldwide. The Ex-Im \nhas supported 685 jobs and $158 million in exports in Rochester since \n2010. In June, I toured Lumetrics, which is a leading Rochester \nmanufacturing firm that Ex-Im has helped support the sales of precision \ninstrument gauges to customers in 14 countries.\n  Now, unfortunately, since June 30, manufacturers like this in \nRochester and across the country have lost a valuable tool and many \nnights' sleep because a handful of members of the House majority are \nblocking the Ex-Im's reauthorization for reasons we cannot divine. As \nMr. Hoyer pointed out, we have Governors, the Chamber of Commerce, \npeople all over this country, as well as corporations, telling us that \nthis won't do.\n  We are now starting to see the effects of this misguided policy. As \nstated before, General Electric announced that it was shipping 500 jobs \nabroad because other countries are willing to provide the financing \nhelp that we no longer will. Boeing has lost two major satellite \ncontracts to foreign competitors because of the Ex-Im Bank. Those are \ntwo of our largest employers. I am even more concerned with the \nhundreds of small manufacturers and thousands of employees whose jobs \nare now at risk without the Ex-Im Bank's support, and for no reason \nthat we can come up with.\n  I call on the House leadership to bring a reauthorization bill to the \nfloor. It would pass without question and would allow this Ex-Im Bank \nto get back to the important work of helping to create quality, \nAmerican jobs.\n  I thank you so much, Mr. Tonko, not only for putting this together, \nbut for the extraordinary work that you have done here and in Albany to \nbetter the life of the people we serve.\n  Mr. TONKO. You are most welcome. I thank the gentlewoman from New \nYork for lending her voice to this discussion.\n  As was made mention by the gentlewoman from New York, many small \nbusinesses, startups, innovative types, entrepreneurs, and medium-sized \nbusinesses utilize the Export-Import Bank. This is not just a tool for \nlarge industry. When we look at something like GE, when people say: \n``Well, doesn't a large business, an industry like that, sit upon \nenough funds to make this happen, to make this contract work?'' they \nrequired for this contract on which they bid to have a government \ncreditor to back up this bid. That means the Export-Import Bank.\n  There are certain elements of this concept that are utilized for \ndifferent contracts, and in this case, the government creditor status \nof the Export-Import Bank made the deal possible for GE.\n  So, with that, we now move to a good friend, a very rigorous voice \nfor his constituents in Minnesota and a very aggressive voice for job \ncreation across this country.\n  Representative Nolan, thank you for joining us for this Special \nOrder.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Thank you, Mr. Tonko.\n  I want to commend you. There is no more powerful and articulate \nadvocate for good jobs--protecting good jobs and creating new jobs--in \nthis Congress than you, yourself, Mr. Tonko.\n  In that regard, I would be remiss if I didn't also commend \nRepresentative Heck for some of his important leadership on this \nimportant issue, and Mr. Hoyer for his buy American initiatives.\n  Mr. Tonko, as you and perhaps others know, I spent 32 years of my \nlife in business as an owner and operator of a sawmill, a pallet \nfactory, and an export trading company. In the process, you learn a few \nthings. One is I learned that you expand an economy, you create new \nwealth, and you create new jobs in three important ways:\n  One is through innovation and discovery, developing new products and \nputting them out in the marketplace. Another is by providing financial \nincentives for people to invest in new products and new business. \nThirdly, you do it by exporting those products to the rest of the \nworld. That is one of the ways you bring some of your wealth back into \nyour country.\n  That is one of the reasons why it is so vital and that it is so \nimportant. That is what the Export-Import Bank is all about, as you \npointed out so eloquently, especially for small- and medium-sized \ncompanies; because the fact is the big companies, the big \nmultinationals that are based here in the United States, they have got \noffices all over the world. They have got relationships with all the \ninternational banking institutions. They have got all the resources \nthat they need to qualify a buyer or to provide the financing for the \nproduction and the sale of their product.\n  But the small- and the medium-sized companies don't have those kind \nof resources. They don't have those same kind of advantages. Yet they \nmay be small and medium-sized by American standards, but by world \nstandards, they are still big, good-sized companies, and they have got \ngood products the rest of the world wants and the rest of the world \nneeds, things that can improve the life of people all over the world.\n  To succeed in exporting, again, as you have pointed out, they need \nsome help, and they need some support identifying and qualifying a \ncustomer. They don't have those offices around the world. Their local \nbanks don't have those kind of offices around the world, so it makes it \nmore difficult for them to secure the financing, to qualify the buyers, \nand to expand their sales into that export market. That is where the \nEx-Im Bank comes in. The Export-Import Bank provides all of these \nessential services.\n  That is why the banking community supports a reauthorization. That is \nwhy the National Manufacturers Association supports reauthorization, \nand that is why the National Chamber of Commerce supports this \nreauthorization. Anybody that knows anything about businesses and \ncreating jobs supports the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Again, as you pointed out, there is bipartisan support for this here \nif the Speaker would just allow us to have a vote on this because the \nAmerican Export-Import Bank helps American businesses expand their \nexport operations, increase their profits, and create all kinds of \ngood-paying jobs.\n  Last year alone, Ex-Im was responsible for supporting 164,000 jobs. \nThat is a remarkable, remarkable accomplishment. In my own district, \nthere are at least a dozen companies that are using the Export-Import \nBank to support their export sales creating hundreds of good jobs. They \nexported some of the world's finest products. In fact, Cirrus Aircraft \nin Duluth, Minnesota, one of our Nation's premier aircraft \nmanufacturers, exports more than 30 percent of their products, and they \nrely on the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Remember--remember--as you pointed out, just as importantly, the \nExport-Import Bank doesn't cost the taxpayers a penny. The companies, \nthe local bankers, all the parties to these transactions pay a fee for \ntheir services, and those fees pay for the Bank's operations. It is an \nincredible operation. Over the last two decades, the Ex-Im Bank has \ncontributed over $7 billion to deficit reduction from the profits they \nmade through this.\n  We should have more government entities that can do this. However \nfortunate we are, Mr. Speaker, to have banking services like this and \nenjoy such broad support from both those who are concerned about \nreducing the deficit and from those who are concerned about expanding \nexport sales, expanding business opportunities, and creating new jobs, \nthat is what the Export-Import Bank does. It creates jobs, it expands \nopportunities, and it reduces the deficit.\n  Yet for reasons that truly defy explanation, there are elements in \nthis Congress that oppose reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank and all \nthe good that it does for business in reducing deficit.\n  So I applaud you, and I call on my colleagues to come to their good \nbipartisan senses and do what needs to be done here. Let's get this \nExport-Import Bank up and running again, growing our economy, creating \ngood jobs, supporting our entrepreneurs, and bringing down the deficit.\n  Mr. Tonko, thank you so much for this Special Order and all the work \nyou are doing to help bring this about and make it happen.\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page H6703]]\n\n  We have very little time remaining, so we are going to reach to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) and the gentlewoman from Ohio \n(Ms. Kaptur) to offer a close here.\n  We thank Representative Lipinski for joining us this evening on a \nvery important topic. Thank you for your strong voice in this matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Tonko.\n  I will just take a short time here to add my voice in strong support \nof reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. It has been 3 months since the \nBank's charter ended, and American companies and workers are suffering.\n  Mr. Tonko, you had mentioned what GE has recently done. We see \nmanufacturing jobs being shipped overseas due to the inability of \ncorporations and small businesses to access vital guarantees and \nfinancing. Every major trading nation in the world, other than the U.S. \nright now offers export financing. Without it, our manufacturers and \nworkers are at a competitive disadvantage, something we cannot afford.\n  In 2014 alone, the Ex-Im Bank financed over $27 billion of exports \nand supported 164,000 jobs in the U.S., all while generating a $675 \nmillion surplus. When we are looking for money, the Ex-Im Bank \ngenerated a large surplus.\n  The Bank is vital to supporting small businesses. Nearly 90 percent \nof Ex-Im Bank transactions directly support small businesses. We need \nsmall business to succeed in this Nation if this Nation is going to \nsucceed. Small businesses create the large majority of the jobs in this \ncountry. Small businesses need the Ex-Im Bank.\n  So it is time to reauthorize the Bank and support American jobs in \nmanufacturing. We cannot wait any longer. We need to bring this to the \nfloor, get this done, and get more Americans back to work.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. Tonko, for your work on this.\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) for \njoining us on this very important topic.\n  Finally, we will go to the gentlewoman from Ohio, (Ms. Kaptur), who \nis such a strong voice for American jobs, American workers, and hits \nhard at that agenda.\n  It is not surprising to see you on the floor to join us in this \neffort. Welcome, Representative Kaptur.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Thank you so much, Congressman Tonko, for bringing us \ntogether and, as always, helping to be a vanguard for jobs in America \nand the importance of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today 3 months after my Republican colleagues in \nthe majority have failed, failed, failed in their responsibility to \nguard our economy by not reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. Since \n2009 alone, the Ex-Im Bank has supported over 1.3 million jobs in our \ncountry. Yet today, it has been put into idle, in limbo, as Republicans \nlet it wither on the vine.\n  Reauthorizing the Bank means jobs--let me repeat, jobs--here in \nAmerica. Because when exports increase to other countries, American \ncompanies hire more workers to meet the added global demand.\n  Anyone serving in Congress who doesn't understand how important--\nvital--the Export-Import Bank is to jobs in America and to financing \nthose exports to other nations shouldn't be serving here. You can't \nlive in a cave and hope to compete globally.\n  Of special note, the Export-Import Bank pays for itself, contributing \n$675 million alone in 2014 and nearly $7 billion over the last 20 years \nto the U.S. Treasury. It is well-managed and has an extremely low \ndefault rate. Yet today, at a time when America needs more jobs to keep \ngrowing, the Republican majority has shifted the country again into \nidle.\n  More than 50 countries have an Export-Import Bank--I won't go through \nthem all, China, Japan, Brazil, and Canada--many of our biggest trading \npartners. In many markets like Mexico, we can't move our products in \nthere without the Export-Import Bank.\n  Ask Superior Products in Cleveland, Ohio, or A.J. Rose Manufacturing \nin Cleveland. Or how about First Solar in Perrysburg, Ohio; 98 percent \nof its exports are tied to Export-Import Bank financing.\n  Republicans have really put us on the brink of losing thousands more \njobs in our country. Look at General Electric and what it just did. It \ndecided because they didn't have Ex-Im Bank financing, they are going \nto move their operations to Britain and hire 1,000 people. Now, how \nbackwards is that kind of thinking? It could not be any clearer that \nthe shutdown of the Export-Import Bank will cost us so many jobs in \nthis country.\n  And how demoralizing to people who fight for American jobs and \nAmerican workers every day. What we know here, and we have seen it \noperate last week and this week, an extreme wing of the Republican \nParty has ignored warnings from their colleagues--leading economists, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and countless other organizations--as \nthey hold hostage the Export-Import Bank, frankly, for reasons no \nrational person can understand. They are even ignoring its charter and \nthe immeasurable good it does for this country and the ability of our \ncompanies to compete in foreign markets which are so difficult--so \ndifficult--for them to leap over and to get over the walls, the \nbarriers, that prevent our products from going abroad.\n  It is our desire that American companies will be able to compete and \nwin. We try for it every day. That is why many of us ran for office. \nAnd to have this kind of wrench thrown in the wheel of progress, of \neconomic progress, for our country is something that any rational \nAmerican simply can't understand. It doesn't have to be this way.\n  I thank the gentleman so very much for his time.\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for her insight and her \npowerful statement.\n  It is very clear, it is very straightforward: support American \nworkers; support small business; support exporting of American \nmanufactured goods; support industry. Let's grow our economy.\n  We are going to close with a very forceful voice, one with great \npassion, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who also has been \nimpacted by this failure to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. \nRepresentative Moore, thank you so much. It is an honor to serve with \nyou. Thank you for being here.\n  Ms. MOORE. Thank you Representative Tonko. I want to associate myself \nwith all the comments from my great colleague, Marcy Kaptur.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can tell you, when I was elected to Congress, no one \ncould have paid me to believe that we would be on this floor fighting \nthe Republican Party to prevent them from basically neutering the \neconomic progress of business here. And this is what has happened.\n  As the gentlewoman from Ohio just mentioned, GE, very close to my \ndistrict, announced plans to leave our region, 350 jobs and 400 \nsuppliers that they have notified that they are moving their facility \nplants to Canada. They say that the suppliers generate almost $47 \nmillion in revenue in Wisconsin alone--$47 million in Wisconsin alone. \nBut they are leaving, they say, because they desperately cannot make \nthe deals work without financing from the Export-Import Bank.\n  And many people have said, oh, they wanted to do this anyway and they \nare using it as an excuse, but GE says that this is the main reason, \nthat they continue to urge Congress to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank \nbecause it is a very, very competitive world. And in a slow growth and \nvolatile world, they have got to go where the markets are; they have \ngot to compete in 170 countries.\n  And so I just wanted to express my grief, my condolences, to the 350 \nemployees, to the entire supply chain, and to recognize that once \nagain--once again--policies of this misguided Republican majority are \ngoing to increase the misery index among the people who live in my \nregion.\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.\n  We have exhausted our time here this afternoon, but I will state \nclearly, we cannot afford to dull the competitive edge of American \nbusiness, American industry. We cannot afford to impact negatively the \nAmerican worker. We should not suffocate the American Dream simply by \nthis recalcitrance, this determination to shut down an Export-Import \nBank that has helped as a tool in the toolkit.\n\n[[Page H6704]]\n\n  Allow us to be strong.
