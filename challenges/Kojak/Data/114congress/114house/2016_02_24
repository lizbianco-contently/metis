The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I am not here to give a political speech. \nThis is not the right venue for that. But I would like to share some \nobservations I have about visiting Nevada last week.\n  The first observation is that among a broad and diverse segment of \nvoters, there is a great deal of excitement about the political \nprocess. It almost doesn't matter which candidate people prefer or even \nwhich party, there is so much enthusiasm to participate.\n  In Nevada, the form of participation is the caucus, and it requires a \ngreater time commitment than simply punching a ballot at your local \nprecinct. Yet, I witnessed thousands of people who were taking hours \naway from their jobs, at their own expense in many cases, to \nparticipate in that process.\n  You can't come away from that kind of activity and not be inspired \nthat Americans are taking their right to vote, their opinions about who \nshould be the next nominee of their party or the next President very \nseriously. It was really remarkable.\n  Still, there were some people I spoke with who could not afford to \ntake hours away from their jobs, some because they couldn't get \npermission and others because they simply could not afford to give up a \ncouple of hours of wages, clock out to vote, even when it means not \nhaving your vote count.\n  Las Vegas, where I was, is a 24/7 working city; and for many, \nSaturday is the busiest day of the week, especially for tips.\n  This election year, as we travel around our districts or campaign in \nother States, I hope my colleagues in both parties will really examine \nhow local governments and States are facilitating or disenfranchising \nAmerican citizens who are eligible to vote.\n  In Nevada, participation in a caucus at a set time of the day with \nlittle or no flexibility serves almost like a poll tax for hourly \nworkers. Voters have to weigh the power of their vote against dollars \nthat would not be in their pockets if they exercise that vote.\n  If you can vote, you should vote, and we should make sure that the \nlaws of our Nation and our communities encourage rather than discourage \nthe participation of every citizen.\n  Another striking observation I made over the weekend was the \ndiversity of the American electorate: women and men, straight and gay, \nU.S.-born and naturalized, old and young, working class, retired, \nstudents, military, executives. Nevada put on a display of how much \nprogress our Nation has made in a few decades.\n  I saw the energy and the determination of young voters, new voters, \nnewly 18, newly citizens, newly engaged in the political process. \nEverywhere I have traveled, including the high schools in my district \nin Illinois, I see 17- and 18-year-old Latinos anxious and eager to \nparticipate, and they are motivated to register and vote and inspired \nby their candidates and their parties.\n  Today, tomorrow, and every day for decades about 2,000 U.S.-born \nLatino citizens of the United States will turn 18 and be eligible to \nvote. Every day, 2,000 of them turn 18, and they are eager to get \ninvolved.\n  There is a similar energy in the people I meet who are applying for \ncitizenship. There are over 8 million immigrants with green cards who \nare eligible to apply for citizenship right now. And with fee waivers \nfor those with limited funds, many of them can apply for free. And they \nare applying in droves.\n  This coming Saturday, I will be at a workshop in Denver, Colorado, \nfor people learning about the process and applying for citizenship.\n  A coalition of groups led by the National Partnership for New \nAmericans but also encompassing Mi Familia Vota, a range of labor \nunions, and advocacy groups large and small across 30 States have \ninvited me to participate in this nonpartisan activity to promote civic \nengagement and citizenship in immigrant communities across this \ncountry. Their goal is to help 1 million eligible immigrants become \ncitizens so they can vote in primaries and general elections this year \nand make sure they are at America's table.\n  In communities like Denver and Chicago, there is a hunger for \ncitizenship despite all the barriers, despite the\n\n[[Page H858]]\n\ncosts, and despite the anti-immigrant tone coming from our TVs and \ncandidates. In fact, it is the anti-immigrant tone that people tell me \nover and over is what is motivating them to apply, study for the tests, \nand better their English.\n  It is that energy that gives me great confidence in our Nation and in \nthe direction our Nation is heading this year.\n  Immigrants are a part of a growing American coalition of working \nclass voters: women, straight people and LGBT, environmentalists, \nLatino, Asians, Black, White, old and young, Muslim and Christians, \nJewish and agnostic. They are coming together and mobilizing.\n  Together, even as some politicians push them away and try to divide \nup with suspicions of our fellow Americans, together, their diversity \nand dedication to democracy is a beautiful thing to witness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H858-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AMERICA: LEARN FROM GREECE INSOLVENCY DAMAGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice data reveals that America's financial condition has taken a \nsharp, ugly turn for the worse. America's estimated 2016 deficit is \n$105 billion worse than 2015's already dangerous $439 billion deficit.\n  America's debt has blown through the $19 trillion mark and is \nprojected to blow through the $29 trillion mark in a decade.\n  America's Comptroller General and CBO warn that America's financial \npath is ``unsustainable,'' meaning America faces a debilitating \ninsolvency unless we get our financial house in order.\n  Mr. Speaker, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat \nit.\n  In that vein, America must learn from Greece, a country betrayed by \ndecades of financially irresponsible leadership. In the past 5 years, \nGreece has repeatedly failed to meet its debt obligations and subsisted \non three bailouts from the European Union.\n  The result?\n  The Greek economy is in a shambles. Greece has a 52 percent labor \nparticipation rate, 10 points worse than here in America. Greece's \nunemployment rate was recently 25 percent, approximating America's \nworse unemployment rate in the Great Depression. Worse yet, Greeks \nunder the age of 25 suffer from a 48 percent unemployment rate.\n  Financial irresponsibility ultimately forces draconian austerity \nspending cuts. Greece has cut public health care spending from 6.8 \npercent of GDP in 2010 to roughly 5 percent today, thereby risking \nGreek lives. Cancer screening has been cut. HIV, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria rates have surged as fewer Greeks receive proper treatment.\n  The public pensions Greek elderly citizens rely on for survival have \nbeen cut an average of almost 50 percent since 2010 and are again on \nthe chopping block.\n  Greek tax rates are exploding. Income taxes on farmers have doubled \nfrom 13 percent to 26 percent. Self-employed professionals and farmers \nsay proposed social security and income tax increases will combine to \nconsume as much as 75 percent of their incomes.\n  Greece's banking system is on the brink. In the summer of 2015, pre-\nEuropean bailout, the Greek Government froze citizens' bank accounts, \nlimiting cash withdrawals from ATMs to $67 per day. Greeks could not \neven access their own money.\n  Post-bailout and as Greeks began fearing their savings accounts would \nbe confiscated to pay for government debt, as occurred in nearby \nCyprus--yet another insolvent country--Greeks withdrew cash from banks.\n  The run on banks caused the Greek Government to intervene and limit \nthe right of Greek citizens to withdraw their own money, which caused \ncitizens to cut deposits into Greek banks, which undermined the Greek \nbanking system, which dried up the availability of loans for new \nbusiness needed to create jobs in a rebounding economy.\n  Violent demonstrations are resulting. For example, on February 4, \n2016, Athens, Greece, ABC News reported:\n  ``Riot police have used tear gas in clashes with protesters during a \nmass rally in Athens as Greeks demonstrated against government pension \nreforms needed to meet demands of international creditors.''\n  Mr. Speaker, there is an old adage that ignorance is bliss. I don't \nknow about that, but I do know that ignorance is dangerous.\n  In 2009, Greece spent 3.2 percent of GDP on its national defense. \nFive years later, Greek defense spending was cut to 2.3 percent of GDP, \na 28 percent cut.\n  Now, perhaps the world will not suffer from Greece's defense spending \ncuts, but what would be the effect on world peace if America's defense \nspending suffered a similar fate?\n  Mr. Speaker, time is running out. Washington must balance the budget \nbefore America's debt burden spirals out of control before it is too \nlate to prevent the debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that awaits \nus.\n  I pray the American people will be good stewards of our Republic in \n2016 and elect Washington officials who both understand the threat \nposed by deficits and debt and have the backbone to fix it. Quite \nfrankly, Mr. Speaker, America's future depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H858-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H858-H859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OPIOID ABUSE/MEDICAL MARIJUANA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, last night Frontline on PBS had a \ncompelling documentary on the opioid and heroin epidemic. We are now \nseeing politicians diving in. Governors across the country are sounding \nthe alarm. It is being featured by Presidential candidates in both \nparties.\n  President Obama's budget has some very good suggestions highlighting \ntools to reduce drug overuse, overdose, evidence-based prevention \nprograms, prescription drug monitoring, and prescription take-back \nevents. There are a variety of things that are going in the right \ndirection.\n  Yet, it is a little frustrating for me that the simplest, cheapest, \nsafest solution to help these troubled people is not embraced: medical \nmarijuana.\n  Actually, the public is largely there. For the last 20 years, the \ntide has been building for medical marijuana, even as the crisis on \nopioids has slowly started to take hold. It began with voter approval \nin California in 1996 and in Oregon 2 years later. Now 23 States have \nlegalized medical marijuana, and two-thirds of Americans live in States \nwhere at least some form of medical marijuana is authorized.\n  There is a reason for this movement. A meta-analysis of 79 studies in \nThe Journal of the American Medical Association found solid evidence \nthat medical marijuana is effective in treating chronic pain. There is \nno evidence of serious side effects among medical marijuana users who \nare actually less likely to drink alcohol or take other painkillers. \nAnd those States with medical marijuana actually have fewer overdose \ndeaths.\n  Isn't this worth exploring? Especially when there is evidence that \navailability of medical marijuana dispensaries is associated with a \nsignificant decrease in substance abuse admissions and a reduction in \nopioid overdose deaths.\n  Recently, we have even had former NFL players come out and describe \nhow they used medical marijuana to self-medicate rather than being shot \nup with painkillers by team doctors and being prescribed opioid pills.\n  What is perhaps most frustrating for me is the wrong-headed approach \nthat prohibits Veterans Administration doctors from even talking to \ntheir patients about medical marijuana in the States where it is legal. \nThat is ironic because the VA has its own veterans health crisis \nbecause their patients are dying from prescription overdoses at rates \ntwice the national average. Opioid prescriptions by VA doctors have \nsurged 270 percent over the last 12 years. They are prescribing \nsignificantly more opioids to patients suffering from PTSD and \ndepression than other veterans, even though those are the patients most \nat risk of overdose and suicide. Nearly 1 million veterans who receive \ntreatment for pain continue to consume those pills beyond 90 days.\n  It is clear that most veterans would probably be better off if we \nmore fully utilized medical marijuana to treat\n\n[[Page H859]]\n\nconditions of pain, depression, and PTSD.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  At the very least, we ought to allow the Veterans Administration \ndoctors to work with their patients on this matter. That is why I will \nagain be introducing my amendment that would make it clear that VA \ndoctors in States where it is legal can work with their patients on \nmedical marijuana.\n  Since I first introduced this legislation, I have watched growing \nsupport on the floor of the House for an amendment that would \naccomplish this. There has been interest in the Senate. Veterans groups \nare aware of this discrimination and the Veterans Administration's \nsorry record when it comes to helping our veterans with these chronic \nconditions by using conventional painkillers that lead to addiction and \ndeath.\n  Medical marijuana appears safer, effective, and is a low-cost way to \ndeal with chronic pain. Nobody dies from an overdose of medical \nmarijuana. Let's add this to our discussion, promote more effective \nresearch, and let VA doctors meet with their patients to talk about \nthis as an alternative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H859-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PILOTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as the author of legislation that \nawarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the Women Airforce Service \nPilots, better known as the WASP, I rise in strong support of this \nbill, H.R. 4336, the Women Airforce Service Pilots Arlington Inurnment \nRestoration Act, presented by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. \nMcSally), my great friend and colleague. This legislation seeks to \nrestore eligibility to these brave women pioneers for burial at \nArlington National Cemetery with full military honors.\n  The WASP were the first women in U.S. history to fly our military \naircraft. During World War II, a time of great global conflict, these \ncourageous women volunteered to fly noncombat missions so that every \navailable male pilot could be deployed in combat.\n  The WASP served our Nation without hesitation and with no expectation \nof recognition or praise. More than 25,000 women applied for the \nprogram, but only 1,074 selected women earned their wings. Between the \nyears 1942 and 1944, the WASP logged more than 60 million miles. With \nthe exception of direct combat missions, the WASP flew the same \naircraft as male pilots.\n  Although they took the military oath, the WASP were not recognized as \nmilitary personnel for their time in service. Their patriotic \ncontributions went unrecognized for many decades. It wasn't until 1977 \nthat Congress granted them veteran status; and then in 2002, the \nArlington National Cemetery decided to allow the WASP, among others \nlisted as Active Duty designees, to receive benefits consistent with \nthe status that they had so rightfully earned. Unfortunately, last \nyear, the Department of the Army rescinded this decision and ruled that \nthe WASP were ineligible for burial at that site, citing a lack of \nspace.\n  This is simply unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. These women deserve to be \ntreated honorably, and our military branch should allocate the \nnecessary space to accommodate these courageous women who sacrificed so \nmuch for our country.\n  We cannot just consider these women to be ineligible. These honorable \nwomen answered the call to serve during World War II. They did not turn \ntheir backs on the American people nor on their fellow servicemen. \nTheir rights at Arlington National must be restored. We have to do this \nfor the present and future generations to come.\n  Today, women in our military fly every type of aircraft, from the F-\n15 to the space shuttle, and I know this because my daughter-in-law, \nLindsay Nelson Lehtinen, has flown combat missions both in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for the Marines. This opportunity was afforded to Lindsay \nthanks to the service of the Women Airforce Service Pilots. They were \nthe trailblazers. They set the stage for women in the military.\n  I have been fortunate enough to personally meet some of these heroic \nwomen. As pictured in this poster, I presented south Florida WASP Ruth \nShafer Fleisher and Frances Sargent with copies of the bill that I \nintroduced and passed in Congress with the help of Susan Davis, and \nwhich was signed by the President, that honored the invaluable \ncontributions of these heroic female pilots. We had this celebration at \nthe Wings Over Miami Air Museum, which has served as the foundation for \nour community to learn more about veterans and aviators, including our \nproud WASP.\n  Throughout my years in Congress, I have also had the pleasure of \nmeeting other south Florida WASP, including Shirley Kruse, pictured \nhere, Bee Haydu, and Helen Wyatt Snapp. Although Frances and Helen are \nno longer with us, they still live in our hearts and in our minds, and \nthey are embedded in the rich history of our great Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to do what is right for our valiant, patriotic \nwomen and their wonderful families. The House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs will bring up Congresswoman McSally's bill tomorrow, Thursday, \nduring a markup. I encourage all of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support and pass this important and necessary bill so that we \ncan continue to honor these women pioneers.\n  These women must receive the recognition that they are due. We must \ngive them back the right that they earned, to be buried at Arlington. \nThank you very much to these brave patriots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H859-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H859-H860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REAUTHORIZATION OF CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nefforts to reauthorize child nutrition programs.\n  Last year the House and the Senate worked together in a bipartisan \nfashion to reauthorize our elementary and secondary education programs. \nI rise today to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to carry \nforward that momentum to complete a much-needed review and renewal of \nFederal child nutrition programs. In doing so, Mr. Speaker, I would \nurge my colleagues to employ similar goals and objectives: simplify, \nstreamline, and empower State and local education agencies when \nreauthorizing these programs.\n  In particular, this approach can benefit our students and families by \nfinding a path forward to simplify and streamline existing Federal \nnutrition and meal requirements without sacrificing the beneficial \ndietary value that school meals bring to students' daily lives. Much \nlike we empowered our teachers to establish the curriculum and \nstandards to best teach students they know so well, we likewise should \nempower those who know what our students will actually eat: the school \nprofessionals who work with the goal of making sure our children are \nable to enjoy healthy, nutritious meals.\n  Likewise, we can use this opportunity to continue efforts to ensure \nthat our existing Federal nutrition programs are providing adequate and \nappropriate training to school professionals, as well as the resources \nnecessary to improve and enhance our school meal delivery system.\n  Mr. Speaker, this opportunity will allow us to strengthen existing \nprograms that strive to get nutritious meals to children year-round, \nand at earlier ages. Existing programs like the Summer Food Service \nProgram can be enhanced and made more efficient to make sure they \neffectively reach those children who are most in need of quality, \nhealthy meals. We can collaborate with Head Start, afterschool, and \nearly childhood programs to better engage them in existing Federal \nprograms that offer nutritious meals to young children most in need.\n  We have a strong infrastructure in place to provide children and \nfamilies with quality, healthy meals, and we have an excellent \nopportunity to improve these programs. I respectfully call on my \ncolleagues on both sides of\n\n[[Page H860]]\n\nthe aisle to work together to accomplish this effort before another \nschool year comes to a close.\n\n\n    Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs Act\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nthe Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs Act, \nlegislation that I have cosponsored.\n  In the midst of a slow economic recovery, one of the issues plaguing \nboth our workforce and our job creators is a persistent mismatch of \nemployer needs and employee skills. Right now, 10 million unemployed \nAmericans are seeking work, while 4 million jobs remain unfilled. \nFortunately, this problem can be solved with a bipartisan commitment to \ncommonsense workforce development initiatives, as demonstrated by the \nLeveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs bill.\n  By promoting apprenticeship programs, this legislation creates \nopportunities for highly motivated workers to earn a salary, while \ngaining the skills they need to succeed in high-demand fields.\n  I am proud to say that employers in my congressional district in \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania have already recognized the value of \napprenticeship programs by making hundreds of these opportunities \navailable to those looking to build their job training and skills.\n  I commend Congressman Rodney Davis for his efforts on this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport it.\n\n\n               Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nreauthorizing the Older Americans Act.\n  The Older Americans Act provides social and nutritional support to \nmembers of our senior population and their caregivers. Enacted in 1965, \nthis legislation has improved health outcomes, independence, and \nquality of life by offering meal delivery, respite care, and other \nessential services to the most vulnerable members of our population.\n  Reauthorization of this legislation gives Congress an opportunity to \nmodernize multipurpose senior centers; improve falls prevention and \nchronic disease self-management training; strengthen laws to combat \nabuse, neglect, and exploitation; and support our local Area Agencies \non Aging.\n  Mr. Speaker, I offer my support to work with my colleagues to review \nand advance the legislation passed by the United States Senate last \nyear, as it is an effort that will not only help protect seniors across \nmy district and the U.S., but will ensure that our existing Federal \nsupport programs are appropriately tailored to meet the present-day \nneeds of our senior citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H860-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PENTAGON WASTEFULNESS IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I have been coming to the floor for weeks and \nmonths to complain about the waste of money and life in Afghanistan. In \nthe last couple weeks, I had an opportunity to read two articles. The \nfirst is titled, ``This is How the Pentagon Wasted $17 Billion in \nAfghanistan,'' by Emily Leayman. I would like to quote a couple of \nexamples of the Pentagon's waste that she describes in her article.\n  The Pentagon spent ``$8 billion for a failed drug war: Despite a 14-\nyear effort, Afghanistan now leads the world in heroin production.'' \nThe Pentagon also spent ``$486 million for useless aircraft: Speaking \nof planes, 20 planes could not be flown, and most were sold for scrap . \n. . Legislators like Senators John McCain and James Lankford are fed up \nwith the lack of accountability in spending.''\n  Senators McCain and Lankford have joined me in bringing to the \npublic's attention the lack of accountability in Afghanistan. It is \nastounding, to say the least.\n  Mr. Speaker, last month John Sopko, the Inspector General for \nAfghanistan Reconstruction, testified before the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services about a recent report he wrote on the waste in \nAfghanistan. In that report, he exposed that the Pentagon paid $6 \nmillion to buy nine male Italian goats--the reason they bought the \ngoats from Italy was because they are blond in color--to send to \nwestern Afghanistan to set up a farm and try to boost the cashmere \nindustry there in Afghanistan. Now, the Pentagon doesn't even know \nwhere the goats are. And the sad thing is, as Mr. Sopko said to the \nSenate, ``We don't know where the goats are. They might have been \neaten''--$6 million. Mr. Speaker, American people could do a lot with \n$6 million, I assure you. And they wouldn't be spending $6 million for \nnine goats, that I am certain.\n  The report that Mr. Sopko made reference to is titled, ``Report Cites \nWasted Pentagon Money in Afghanistan.'' Mr. Speaker, the waste goes on \nand on and on, and yet we in the House every year will send more and \nmore money to Afghanistan. We have already been there 14 years. We are \ngoing to be there another 8 years because President Obama signed an \nagreement with Mr. Ghani to be there for 9 more years. We have already \nbeen there 1 year, and that means 8 more years. That is 22 years.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  General Campbell, who has been the leader in Afghanistan, but is \nleaving, says that we need more years to train the Afghans to have a \nsecurity force. I guess we are going to be there 30 years. I will be \ndead and gone, for sure, by then.\n  What a waste of life and money in Afghanistan. It is time for this \nCongress to meet its responsibility and put pressure on the \nadministration and stop funding Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a poster here. The reason I bring this poster to \nthe floor is to show the sad tragedy of war. There is a wife and a \nlittle girl. The husband and daddy is in a flag-draped casket.\n  The reason I bring this matter to the floor is that I have signed \nover 11,000 letters to families and extended families who died in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Last Sunday I signed one letter for an Army \nsergeant who died in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I thought: How sad. How \nsad it is for that family. It is just so sad.\n  It doesn't have to happen. We need to debate bringing our troops home \nfrom Afghanistan, and we need to debate stopping the funding for the \nwar in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, before closing, I want to remind the House that this is \nthe longest war in the history of America. I don't know who said it, \nbut they said it right: Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires.\n  I know there is going to be a headstone that says that the empire \nknown as America spent so much blood and money in Afghanistan. It is \nfinancially broke. We are $19.1 trillion in debt right now.\n  Let's bring our troops out of Afghanistan. Let them fight the civil \nwar themselves and decide what they want for Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform, \nbless the families of our men in uniform. And, God, please continue to \nbless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H860-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H860-H861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                STOP ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about an important \ncongressional reform initiative that I have introduced in this body.\n  I have had the opportunity to study Congress from virtually every \nangle. I graduated from college as a young intern who drove up here \nhaving never been north of Tennessee. As my predecessor said and I \nshared: I never thought I would meet a Member of Congress, much less \nhave the great opportunity and honor to be one.\n  Through virtually every staff role over the past 15 or 20 years, I \nhave had a chance to study this body. There are a few experiences now, \nas a sitting Member of Congress, that I simply cannot accept.\n  One of them--the most pressing one--is the amount of time that \nMembers of Congress are expected or, in some cases, directed to spend \non raising money.\n  We all know it. Every Member of Congress understands that you arrive \nwith great expectations only to learn the obligation to spend time \nraising money. There is a quiet anger among many Members about that.\n\n[[Page H861]]\n\n  It is not comfortable to talk about, frankly. This is one of the more \nuncomfortable speeches I will ever give in the well of this House. We \nmust talk about it. Because when does this become the expectation?\n  This is an orientation slide for freshmen Members of Congress that \nwas produced by one of the two major parties of this Congress a few \nyears back, suggesting that, as a Member of Congress, your first \nresponsibility is 4 hours a day not in your office, but across the \nstreet in a call suite asking people for money, another 1 to 2 hours a \nday networking and raising money, and only 2 hours a day doing your \njob.\n  Members of Congress might have a quiet anger, but the American people \nwill have a very loud anger when they understand that we are not \naccomplishing things here because we are spending too much time raising \nmoney. Let's turn that anger into resolve and change this body and \nchange Washington forever.\n  Former Members of Congress are happy to talk about this, retiring \nMembers who write confessions saying they spent 4,200 hours raising \nmoney, former majority leaders of the other body now writing a book \nlamenting how much time they spent raising money, a colleague of ours \nleaving this House calling fundraising the main business of Congress.\n  But what do they all have in common? They are all retiring or \nretired. Why don't we do something about it, as sitting Members of \nCongress? Why don't we fix this now when we have the opportunity \ninstead of lamenting it when we are gone?\n  This is why I have introduced what I call the Stop Act. It is very \nsimple. It is 3 or 4 pages. Every Member of this body can read it \nbefore they vote on it. It simply prohibits direct solicitation of a \ncampaign contribution by a sitting Member of Congress.\n  State legislators in the State of Florida and across the country are \noften prohibited from directly soliciting. There are 30 States where \njudges are elected, and they are prohibited from directly soliciting \ncontributions.\n  I want to say thank you to my colleagues who have cosponsored this. \nIn just over 3 weeks, we have six cosponsors: Mr. Nolan of Minnesota, \nMr. Jones of North Carolina, Messrs. Duffy and Ribble of Wisconsin, and \nMessrs. Mica and Nugent from my State of Florida.\n  The message is very simple on this. It says to Congress to get back \nto work. Let's do our job, the job we were elected to do. We will never \nsolve border security and immigration reform. We will never balance the \nbudget. We will never address national security and foreign policy. We \nwill never address tax reform if we have a part-time Congress in a \nfull-time world.\n  In any other profession, if you spend 20 to 30 hours a week doing a \njob other than you are hired to do, you would be fired. But, in \nWashington, we accept this as the political culture.\n  Many will say the issue is dark money, the issue is transparency. \nFine. We can have a campaign finance debate. But that is not what this \nis about. This is about congressional reform.\n  I will close with this, Mr. Speaker. Each one of us made a promise to \nroughly 700,000 people in the community from which we come and \nrepresent. We made a promise to do our job, not to ask them for money. \nWe took an oath.\n  We each took an oath, swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution \nof the United States. The last line of our oath says: ``I will well and \nfaithfully discharge the duties of this office on which I am about to \nenter.''\n  Friends, we are not well and faithfully discharging the duties of \nthis body when we are spending 20 hours a week asking people for money \nand not doing our job.\n  We are not well and faithfully discharging the duties of this office \nwhen fundraising is the main business, when we have Members missing \nvotes to raise money, when the most important question sometimes among \ncolleagues is not what legislation you are working on, but how much \nmoney you have raised. We are not well and faithfully executing the \nduties of this House when we are not doing our job.\n  I stand here not to judge my colleagues. I stand here to try to \nchange the system. Let's restore credibility to this House. Let's honor \nthe greatness of this body with greatness of integrity, greatness of \ncommitment, greatness of resolve.\n  Let's recognize the great calling of this body and the even greater \ncalling of this Nation. Let's stand together today and change \nWashington forever.\n  Friends, colleagues, I urge you, while you are here and before \nretiring and lamenting the amount of time you spent raising money, \ncosponsor the Stop Act. Join me in this effort to change Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H861-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message in writing from the President of the United States was \ncommunicated to the House by Mr. Brian Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H861-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H861-H862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HARPERS FERRY, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, there are few places in our \ncountry that have both strong historical significance and scenic \nbeauty. Harpers Ferry is perhaps the greatest example of both.\n  Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, was founded in 1734 by Robert Harper, \nwho purchased the land for 50 guineas, or around $262. Over the next \n282 years, this quaint town was the backdrop for some of the most \nimportant events in American history.\n  From the earliest settlement of this great Nation through the \nfounding of the railroads, the beginning of Meriwether Lewis' adventure \nwith William Clark out West, John Brown's raid, numerous Civil War \nbattles and skirmishes, and the beginning of the civil rights movement, \nHarpers Ferry has stood the test of time and watched our American \nhistory unfold.\n  As for the scenic beauty, none have described it better than one of \nour Nation's great founders, President Thomas Jefferson. After visiting \nHarpers Ferry on October 25, 1783, the author of the Declaration of \nIndependence said he viewed ``the passage of the Potomac River through \nthe Blue Ridge as perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in \nnature.''\n  Let me tell you, this picture does not do the town justice.\n  Harpers Ferry is a national treasure that has been enjoyed by \nmillions of families for centuries. This past July, however, this \nquaint town of only 283 residents was struck by a large fire that swept \nthrough the downtown business district and destroyed 10 businesses, \nwhich is 30 percent of the commercial district, and 2 apartments.\n  Even before the embers from the fire cooled, members of the community \nhad begun to take action and began making plans to rebuild.\n  The town council, the Merchants Association, and the community at \nlarge stepped up to take care of the people who were displaced by the \nfire. Jobs and housing were found for everyone who needed them, and \nspace was offered for businesses that were able to immediately reopen.\n  The Harpers Ferry Historical Town Foundation established a fund to \ncollect and distribute money to help displaced residents, \nbusinessowners, and employees meet their most immediate needs.\n  Over the past several months, in addition to the support the fund \nreceived from people who live in the eastern panhandle of West \nVirginia, thousands of visitors from across the country and some from \nabroad have contributed to this fund.\n  The president of West Virginia University, Dr. G. Gordon Gee, brought \na team to Harpers Ferry to help the town and the town council establish \na plan. This plan enabled property owners to rebuild and restore their \nbuildings, to develop a marketing plan, and to provide engineering and \narcheological services to prevent the demolition of their historical \ntreasures.\n  The superintendent of the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, \nRebecca Harriott, stepped forward with meeting spaces, security \nservices, and additional personnel to protect town residents and \nvisitors from the fragile, burned-out spaces.\n  The Jefferson County Commission provided in-kind and financial \nsupport to reimburse the town for the unanticipated expenses of \nfighting the fire and providing for safety in the middle of\n\n[[Page H862]]\n\nHarpers Ferry's busiest part of the tourist season. Local, State, and \nFederal officials were a constant and reassuring presence for the town.\n  The town council and the Historic Landmarks and Planning Commissions \nhave worked together to streamline processes and enable property owners \nto quickly move ahead with the restoration of the burned buildings.\n  This past Monday I personally visited Harpers Ferry in Jefferson \nCounty, where I live with my wife and three children, to see the \nprogress that is being made to repair the structures.\n  The mayor, Greg Vaughn, was kind enough to show me around the damaged \nbuildings and introduce me to those who were impacted by the fire. I \ncan't tell you how encouraging it was to see how the town has come \ntogether to rebuild after the fire.\n  Harpers Ferry is no stranger to disaster: war, fire, floods. This is \na town that endures. Today, Mr. Speaker, Harpers Ferry is still open \nfor business, still thriving, still an elegant and evocative journey \ninto the formative years of our Nation. I invite you to come visit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H862-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEROIN EPIDEMIC\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a problem that is near \nand dear to my heart.\n  Cheaper than cigarettes and more accessible than alcohol, heroin has \nbecome a plague on communities all across our country. Heroin takes a \nlife every 3 days in the Chicago suburbs. Unfortunately, a similarly \ndeadly trend is taking place all over our Nation.\n  Although heroin is not often considered a serious suburban problem, \nstatistics show the epidemic is quickly growing. Nearly one-quarter of \nthe people who try heroin become addicted, and heroin deaths have \nliterally quadrupled in the United States in less than a decade.\n  But the statistics don't even begin to tell the whole story. As the \nco-chair of the Suburban Anti-Heroin Task Force in the State of \nIllinois, I have seen firsthand the deadly impact of these drugs.\n  But I still can't even begin to fathom the pain of losing one of my \nchildren to a drug overdose. I can't imagine what families throughout \nthe country have been put through because of this terrible drug.\n  There is hope. Thanks to the great work of the Lake County Opioid \nInitiative, Live4Lali, and many other organizations in the 10th \nCongressional District, we have already had tremendous success saving \nlives with an overdose reversal aid called naloxone.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  When used properly, naloxone helps restore breathing that has been \nstopped by an overdose. First responders in Lake County, Illinois, have \nnow saved over 56 lives in just a little over 1 year. That is 56 \nfamilies who won't have to experience the same type of unbearable pain \nas those who have lost a loved one.\n  With increased access, the World Health Organization predicts that \nnaloxone could save an additional 20,000 lives each and every year. \nThat is why I introduced a new bipartisan piece of legislation this \nweek with Congresswoman Katherine Clark.\n  Our bill, Lali's Law, will help States increase access to naloxone. \nThe bill is named in memory of Stevenson High School graduate Alex \nLaliberte, who, sadly, passed away from a drug overdose.\n  Alex, like many high school students, played sports at Stevenson High \nSchool. He did well at school. He cared about his friends. He cared \nabout his family. But during his sophomore year of college, he began \nbeing hospitalized for what was a mysterious illness.\n  Unknown to his family and to the doctors, Alex had an addiction to \nprescription drugs and was being hospitalized for his withdrawal. He \nwould stay in the hospital until he received his fix, leave the \nhospital, and repeat the cycle again and again. He continued this \npattern until he died of an overdose a few days after his final exams.\n  The primary purpose, Mr. Speaker, of this bill, is to help fund State \nprograms that allow pharmacists to distribute naloxone without a \nprescription so that we can prevent the repeat of Alex's story.\n  Many States use these programs to allow local law enforcement \nofficers to carry and use naloxone, just like the success we have \nalready seen in Lake County.\n  The police officers in Lake County asked to be able to carry it \nbecause they would come to a scene often faster than the paramedics. \nThey could respond within 5 minutes and refused to sit idly by and \nwatch these people die of an overdose.\n  Lali's Law is an example of what is possible when we set aside \npartisanship and get to work for the people that we represent. Lali's \nLaw will bring Alex's story to the United States Congress, here, and \namplify the lifesaving benefits of Live4Lali's hard work and the work \nthat they did to pass a similar piece of legislation in the Illinois \nState Legislature.\n  It is my hope that, through this bipartisan bill, Alex's lasting \nlegacy will include helping countless people get a second chance at \nrecovery and saving their families from unbearable heartbreak.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative and join \nus in the fight against heroin and prescription drug abuse. Together we \ncan truly save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H862-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President \nannounced a dangerous proposal, to close Guantanamo and bring \nterrorists to America. One of the proposed locations is near \nCharleston, South Carolina, creating a risk of attacks to adjacent \nschools, churches, neighborhoods, and ports.\n  I have visited Guantanamo twice. This is the right location to house \nterrorists who are obsessed to kill American families.\n  The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by the President, \nbars the closure of Guantanamo. Congress voted that remote Guantanamo \nis the safest location for mass murderers of American families, which \ndiscourages further attacks, and no one wants to be in Communist Cuba.\n  I appreciate Speaker Paul Davis Ryan, Senators Tim Scott and Lindsey \nGraham, Governor Nikki Haley, Attorney General Alan Wilson, and the \nSouth Carolina House delegation for their efforts to prevent the \nclosure of Guantanamo to protect American families.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H863-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, all of us were saddened in the last 2 \nweeks at the loss of the longest serving jurist, Justice Scalia.

It was recently done in 1988, under President Reagan, with \nJustice Kennedy, when he was nominated by a Democrat-controlled Senate, \n97-0.\n  It is important that we express to the American people that we are \nwilling to do our duty. I would adhere to the Latin term in English: \nthe last expression of the people prevail. The President of the United \nStates was duly elected in 2012. His term has not ended.\n  I applaud the President for doing his constitutional duty. I think it \nis important for us to do our constitutional duty, the Congress of the \nUnited States, and address the question on making sure the Court is \nfull to do its duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H863-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO HARPER LEE\n\n  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, last week the world lost a literary giant and \nAlabama lost a legend. A native of Alabama's First Congressional \nDistrict, Nelle Harper Lee was born and died in Monroeville, Alabama, \nthe city that served as an inspiration for the town of Maycomb in her \nlegendary novel ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''\n  Nelle received many honors throughout her life, including being \ninducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor, receiving the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, and being awarded the National Medal of Arts.\n  She was known as a private woman, but her writings inspired \ngenerations, promoted acceptance, and taught us all important life \nlessons.\n  Sadly, she passed away in Monroeville on February 19 at the age of \n89.\n  One of the best lessons Nelle taught us was about tolerance. As she \nwrote in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``You never really understand a \nperson until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you \nclimb into his skin and walk around in it.''\n  May we all take time to reflect on the life of Nelle Harper Lee, and \nmay we all continue to live out her lesson of tolerance each and every \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H863-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H863-H864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AUTUMN JOHNSON KILLED BY GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n\n[[Page H864]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, on the evening of February 9, this little \nprecious angel, 1-year-old Autumn Johnson, was in her crib when a \ngunman approached her family's Compton home and opened fire on the \nconverted garage where they lived.\n  Autumn was struck by a single bullet to her head. Two sheriff's \ndeputies on the scene didn't think they could wait for the paramedics \nand rushed little Autumn in her father's arms to the hospital in their \nsquad car. She was declared dead at the hospital.\n  Yesterday sheriffs arrested her suspected killer. The motive is still \nunknown, but law enforcement suspects gang involvement. I hope that \njustice is served, but I know that nothing can make up for what \nAutumn's parents have lost.\n  I attended her funeral on Saturday, and my heart broke into a million \npieces when I saw Autumn in her little lavender casket. Before she was \nburied, her young father put her pink teddy bear in beside her.\n  When is the breaking point? When will we decide that our communities \nhave seen enough bloodshed? When will we get serious about investing in \nour young people and giving them better opportunities than gangs? When \nwill we in Congress finally do our part to prevent gun violence?\n  Autumn's life mattered, and it is time we started acting like it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H864-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING CAROL MOONEY, PRESIDENT OF SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute \nto a champion of higher education in my district.\n  For the last 12 years, Dr. Carol Mooney has honorably served as \npresident of Saint Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana. She is \nbeloved by her peers and praised for strengthening Saint Mary's fiscal \nand academic standings. Her work has directly impacted the lives of \nstudents on campus, providing them with the highest quality education \npossible.\n  As its first lay alumna president, Mooney spearheaded Saint Mary's \nmost successful fund-raising campaign, raising over $105 million in \ngifts and pledges. She also oversaw the expansion of numerous \nundergraduate and graduate programs. Clearly, her dedication to and \npassion for education has been felt far and wide.\n  On behalf of the people of Indiana's Second Congressional District, I \nthank President Mooney for her commitment to improving the state of our \ncommunity and society at large and wish her all the best as she enters \nretirement later this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H864-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                RECOGNIZING THE WORLD WAR II GHOST ARMY\n\n  (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a group of men who \nplayed a crucial and unique role in the Allied victory in World War II.\n  The Army's 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, also known as the Ghost \nArmy, used tactical deception to divert enemy troops. Recruited from \nart schools and ad agencies, these men created false radio \ntransmissions, along with decoy tanks, planes, and other vehicles, to \ndeceive German soldiers while concealing the true movement of our \nAllied troops.\n  The unit's members included celebrated artists like Bill Blass and \nEllsworth Kelly, and men like the late Mickey McKane, who lived in my \ndistrict. Mickey was recruited from the Pratt Institute and put his \nexpertise in architectural design to good use on the battlefields of \nEurope.\n  The Ghost Army's activities were classified until 1996, which meant \nthat for years their heroics went largely unrecognized. Last year, my \ncolleague Peter King and I introduced legislation to collectively award \na Congressional Gold Medal to the unit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and give the Ghost \nArmy the recognition it deserves. I hope you will join me tomorrow \nnight on the Hill, where I will be hosting a screening of an acclaimed \n2013 PBS documentary, The Ghost Army.\n  As the proud daughter and daughter-in-law of World War II veterans, I \nam honored to advocate for those who sacrificed so much for our \nvictory.

In his new job, Officer Adams builds \nrelationships with heroin users, often at their most vulnerable \nmoments, convincing them to seek treatment.\n  Sometimes his cell phone rings in the middle of the night. A \ndesperate caller pleads with Eric for help. He arrives with compassion \nand information. Just last year, he helped 78 Granite Staters seek \ntreatment.\n  In Congress, members of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the \nHeroin Epidemic are working to direct more resources to innovative \nprograms like Laconia's.

He went \non to have a successful career in the film industry, earning an Academy \nAward and a Grammy for his work as a sound engineer.\n  Ray and his wife, Jean, were married in 1950. The two honeymooned in \nYosemite National Park and celebrated each anniversary by returning \nthere.\n  Ray became ill and the Dream Foundation stepped in. The Dream \nFoundation is a wish-granting organization for terminally ill adults \nthat is based in Santa Barbara, California. They ensured that Ray and \nJean would be able to visit Yosemite for their 65th wedding \nanniversary.\n  Last September I had the privilege of meeting Ray and his son David \nwhen they traveled to Washington, D.C., for the launch of the Dream \nFoundation's Dreams for Veterans Program.

That is why I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor and pass H.R. 3893, a \nbill I sponsored, the Areawide Integrated Pest Management Act, which \nwould bring local stakeholders together with researchers and other key \nplayers in order to find sustainable, cost-effective, and comprehensive \nsolutions that will better help all of us to manage and prevent the \nspread of these harmful pests and invasive species.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H865-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DEADLINE FOR A STRATEGY TO COMBAT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM\n\n  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, last week the Obama administration failed to \nmeet a congressionally mandated deadline to submit a strategy to combat \nIslamic terrorism.\n  To comply with the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, President \nObama was required to submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy to \ndefeat ISIS by Monday, February 15, 2016. That was over a week ago. We \nstill have not received his strategy. Confronting this threat is of \nutmost importance to the safety and security of the United States and \nour allies.\n  While there is an absence of leadership from our Commander in Chief, \nthe House has taken several steps to keep America safe from terrorism. \nWe passed the Visa Waiver Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention \nAct to help prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States. \nWe also passed the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, a \nbill to pause the government's Syrian refugee program.\n  Just yesterday the House passed two additional measures to ensure our \nFederal agencies are working to disrupt the travel of terrorists and \nthose seeking help from terrorists.\n  The House alone cannot keep America safe. We need action from this \nadministration, and submitting an incomplete plan to remove dangerous \nterrorists to the United States from Guantanamo Bay doesn't count. It \njust threatens our security more. ISIS is a very grave threat that is \nclearly not contained.\n  Today I urge the President to comply with the National Defense \nAuthorization Act and submit a plan to Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H865-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HEALTH SAVINGS ACT GIVES MORE FLEXIBILITY TO MEET HEALTH CARE NEEDS\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, hardworking families in Minnesota and \naround the country want more flexibility, more choice, and lower costs \nwhen it comes to their own health care. Instead of a top-down approach, \npatients should be able to work with their doctor to determine what is \nbest to meet their health care needs.\n  One of the best tools to provide more flexibility for patients are \nhealth savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. HSAs and FSAs \nare a great way to save for future medical expenses.\n  However, due to certain loopholes in current law, employers are often \ndiscouraged from contributing to their employees' accounts. That is why \nI have introduced legislation, the Health Savings Act, that would \nremove this loophole and encourage companies to contribute directly to \ntheir employees' HSAs and FSAs.\n  The bill also would bring in seniors and Active Duty military \npersonnel into the mix by allowing contributions to be made to those \naccounts under Medicare and TRICARE. It also makes commonsense fixes to \nthe current rules regarding HSAs and FSAs. For instance, patients would \nnow be able to purchase over-the-counter medications such as aspirin or \nallergy medicine without getting a prescription from their doctor \nfirst.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's give the American people more choice and more \nflexibility.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on S. 238, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today I rise in support of S. 238, the Eric Williams Correctional \nOfficer Protection Act of 2015.\n  Eric Williams was born on August 24, 1978, in Wilkes-Barre, \nPennsylvania. He was the son of Donald and Jean Williams. Eric spent \nmost of his life in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, where he attended the \nNanticoke public schools and graduated from Greater Nanticoke Area High \nSchool in 1996.\n  Eric was an avid soccer player. He played youth soccer, was a member \nof the high school team, and continued playing in adult leagues. In \naddition, to his love of soccer, Eric was an avid sportsman. He enjoyed \nhunting, fishing, and bowling.\n  Eric graduated with a criminal justice degree from King's College in \nWilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and was a graduate of Lackawanna College's \npolice program. He went on to become a security specialist and then a \npolice officer with Jefferson Township, Pennsylvania.\n  In September of 2011, Eric began his career as a corrections officer \nat the U.S. Penitentiary in Canaan. In his spare time, he volunteered \nby visiting jails, talking to inmates about health and spiritual \nissues.\n  On the night of February 25, 2013--3 years ago tomorrow--Eric was \nsupervising more than 100 high-security inmates at the USP in Canaan. \nWhile making his rounds for nightly lockdown just before 10 p.m., \ninmate and gang member Jesse Con-ui launched an unprovoked, brutal, and \ncowardly attack against Senior Officer Williams. Con-ui knocked Eric \ndown a staircase, fracturing his skull. He proceeded to stab Eric more \nthan 200 times with a homemade prison shank.\n  When authorities found Eric's body, he had only a set of keys, a pair \nof handcuffs, and a handheld radio on him, clearly not enough to defend \nhimself against such a brutal attack. Eric was 34 years old when he was \nmurdered.\n  The Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of 2015 will \nensure that our brave corrections officers have the necessary equipment \nto properly defend themselves from this type of attack in the future.\n  S. 238 requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to issue pepper \nspray to any Bureau of Prisons officer or employee who may have to \nrespond to an emergency situation to reduce acts of violence committed \nby prisoners.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  This is a much-needed piece of legislation to ensure the safety and \nsecurity of Bureau of Prisons employees as well as the inmates in their \nfacilities. This bill passed the Senate 2 months ago and, if passed \ntoday, will be presented to the President.\n  I want to particularly thank Congressman Marino, who represents the \ndistrict where Eric lived and who has been a staunch advocate for \nmaking pepper spray available to Bureau of Prisons employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the senior member of the House Judiciary Committee \nand as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations, as the Representative of \nHouston, I am privileged to be able to support this legislation, \nlegislation that, I am very glad to say, had been included in our draft \nprison bill, a bipartisan bill. But because of the urgency of this \nmatter, I am very glad to be on the floor of the House with the \ncosponsors, sponsors, and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. \nGoodlatte; and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Conyers, \nas well, joins in the importance of this effort.\n  My heart aches for Eric Williams' family, and it aches for the \ncircumstance that caused him to lose his life. Obviously, this young \nman was committed to public safety, the criminal justice system, and, \nin fact, the rehabilitation of those who were incarcerated, even in \nhigh-risk circumstances.\n  I rise to support S. 238, the Eric Williams Correctional Officer \nProtection Act of 2015, to make sure that this provision, providing a \ntool of safety for these brave corrections officers, does not go out of \nexistence.\n  I want to extend my thanks again to Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte and \nRanking Member Conyers, as I indicated, for their ongoing, bipartisan \nleadership.\n  But again, let me refer back to Eric Williams, the namesake of this \nlegislation and the tragedy of his death. I want to offer my sympathy \nto the family members and to again say that this death did not have to \nhappen.\n\n[[Page H867]]\n\n  As I discuss the bill, I want to make the point that we should not \nshortchange the resources needed for the men and women who are on the \nfront lines of protecting us and securing a criminal justice system to \nmake it work. In this instance, that is what happened.\n  A death had occurred earlier, but the pilot program did not reach to \nEric's facility, and that is inexcusable. But, fortunately, this \npermanent adding or expanding of this bill will make sure that every \nhigh-risk facility under the Bureau of Prisons will have this pepper \nspray.\n  The Judiciary Committee unanimously passed the groundbreaking prison \nreform bill, as I said, 2 weeks ago. This measure was included.\n  S. 238 codifies a pilot program that has increased Federal prison \nsafety nationwide. It is crucial. However, it is set to expire in a few \ndays, and I look forward to my colleagues bringing forth the criminal \njustice bill.\n  It is important to move this bill now. Tomorrow marks 3 years since \nthe death of Correctional Officer Eric Williams, who was stabbed by an \ninmate at a high-security facility. He was working alone, as I said, \nwith 100 inmates, high risk. Armed with only a radio, keys, and \nhandcuffs, he was unable to defend himself against the aggressive \nattack. If Officer Williams was equipped with pepper spray, then he \nmight still be here with us today.\n  Passing S. 238 will honor Officer Williams. The provisions of this \nbill require BOP to issue oleoresin capsicum spray, known as pepper \nspray, to certain staff at a higher security prison. This requirement \nis truly common sense and does not apply to minimum or low-security \nfacilities. It only applies to staff that may respond to an emergency \nsituation in the prison.\n  S. 238 includes critical safeguards to ensure pepper spray is used \nappropriately and only when necessary to prevent acts of violence, it \nis determined that pepper spray is not dangerous, only in limited \ncircumstances.\n  The legislation requires the officer or employee to complete a pepper \nspray training course before being issued the spray, annually \nthereafter.\n  It establishes parameters for using the spray, and it may only be \nused to reduce acts of violence. In doing so, S. 238 makes it clear \nthat pepper spray may not be used to punish or coerce inmates, or in an \nexcessive, inappropriate fashion.\n  Finally, let me say that it is with sadness, but with pleasure, that \nwe provide this legislation and move it quickly so that we can provide \nthat permanent armor, if you will, to protect these officers who are \ndealing with high-risk inmates.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  As a senior Member of the House Judiciary Committee; as the Ranking \nMember of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations; as the representative from Houston and as a co-sponsor \nof legislation that includes this same measure, I rise in support of S. \n238, the ``Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of 2015.''\n  Let me extend my thanks to Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking \nMember Conyers for their ongoing leadership on bipartisan criminal \njustice reform.\n  When the Judiciary Committee unanimously passed a groundbreaking \nprison reform bill just two weeks ago, that bill included the measure \nbefore us today.\n  S. 238 codifies a pilot program that has increased federal prison \nsafety nationwide.\n  This crucial program, however, is set to expire in just a few days.\n  While I look forward to working with my colleagues to bring our \nbipartisan criminal justice reform bills before this Chamber soon, we \nmust pass S. 238 now to avoid letting this important program expire.\n  Tomorrow marks three years since the death of Correctional Officer \nEric Williams, who was stabbed by an inmate at a high security facility \nin Waymart, PA.\n  Officer Williams was working alone in a unit of more than loo \ninmates.\n  Armed only with a radio, keys, and handcuffs, he was unable to defend \nhimself against the aggressive attack.\n  If Officer Williams was equipped with pepper spray, then he might \nstill be here with us today.\n  Passing S. 238 will honor Officer Williams.\n  The Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of 2015 \nprovides officers in higher security facilities with the means to \nprotect themselves when necessary.\n  S. 238 requires BOP to issue oleoresin capsicum spray, known as \npepper spray, to certain staff at higher security prisons.\n  This requirement is truly common sense: it does not apply to minimum \nor low security facilities; and it only applies to staff that ``may \nrespond to an emergency situation'' in the prison.\n  S. 238 includes critical safeguards to ensure pepper spray is used \nappropriately and only when necessary to prevent acts of violence.\n  Specifically, this legislation: requires the officer or employee to \ncomplete a pepper spray training course before being issued the spray, \nand annually thereafter; and establishes perimeters for using the \nspray--it may only be used to reduce acts of violence committed by \nprisoners against themselves or others.\n  In doing so, S. 238 makes it clear that pepper spray may not be used \nto punish or coerce inmates, or in an excessive and inappropriate \nfashion.\n  The need to provide permanent protective equipment cannot be \noverstated.\n  Mass incarceration has led to dangerously overcrowded federal \nprisons.\n  Such conditions can frequently lead, or at least contribute to, \nunnecessary violence.\n  High and medium security level facilities make up 42 percent of the \ntotal BOP population.\n  In FY2013 these facilities were operating 52 percent and 45 percent \nover capacity, respectively.\n  Officers in these facilities must be equipped to protect themselves \nand others.\n  In 2010, there were almost 1,700 assaults on BOP staff--about 49 per \n5,000 inmates.\n  BOP requires officers on regular duty to carry a radio, body alarm, \nand keys.\n  Outside the pilot program and aside from emergency situations and \nspecial teams, officers do not carry pepper spray or batons.\n  Officers must rely on communication skills and training to de-\nescalate confrontations.\n  These are critically important skills and we know that our well-\ntrained federal correctional officers are generally able to use these \nskills to avoid violence.\n  In some instances, however, these skills may not be enough and, when \nthey are not, these officers must not be defenseless.\n  The issuance of pepper spray, alongside proper training, will go a \nlong way to assisting these officers when all else fails.\n  We ask a lot of federal correctional officers.\n  We support these officers with training and skills, but that is not \nalways enough.\n  When faced with acts of violence against themselves and others, they \nmust be well-positioned to cut that violence short.\n  It is therefore vital that we pass S. 238 now.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me; the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations; Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation; American Federation of Government Employees, and Council \nof Prison Locals; in supporting the Eric Williams Correctional Officer \nProtection Act of 2015.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Marino), a member of the Judiciary Committee and a \nsubcommittee chairman who has been an advocate on this issue and whose \ndistrict was directly impacted by the murder of Eric Williams.\n  Mr. MARINO. I thank Chairman Goodlatte for bringing this legislation \nto the floor, and I thank Mr. Conyers for supporting this as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Eric Williams \nCorrectional Officer Protection Act.\n  I was not fortunate enough to know Eric Williams while he lived, but, \nas I have met and worked with his parents, his coworkers and friends, I \nhave come to grasp the depth of his loss to them all.\n  As the chairman stated before me, on the night he was brutally \nmurdered, Eric was alone and outnumbered, over 100 to 1, in a high-\nsecurity Federal penitentiary.\n  USP Canaan, where Eric was murdered, is one of three such high-\nsecurity institutions in my congressional district. And I might add \nthat Congressman Goodlatte and I toured the facilities at Lewisburg and \nat Allenwood several months ago and saw firsthand what takes place \nthere. In each of them, corrections officers and other prison staff are \nconstantly outnumbered while they work among the most violent criminals \nin the Federal prison system.\n  Until the BOP implemented its OC spray pilot program, each of these \ncorrectional officers was also completely unarmed. Inmates, on the \nother hand, constantly find ingenious ways to fabricate weapons for use \nagainst BOP employees and other inmates.\n  But, as I have visited and met with corrections officers at USP \nCanaan,\n\n[[Page H868]]\n\nFCC Allenwood, and USP Lewisburg, I have heard firsthand accounts why \nOC spray is a necessary tool for their job. It is a sign of why this \nproven pilot program must be permanently authorized.\n  I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for his support and assistance on \nthis critical piece of legislation, and my colleagues sitting with me \nhere today and on the other side of the aisle. Over many months now, he \nand the staff have worked with mine to ensure that we bring this to the \nfloor.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, \nfor his efforts to push the bill through the Senate.\n  While straightforward and short, the bill means life and/or death for \ncorrections officers and BOP employees across the Nation. The loss of \nEric Williams and two other Federal corrections officers in recent \nyears is tragic and absolutely preventable.\n  Tomorrow, February 25, marks 3 years since Eric's death. To honor his \nservice and his memory, I urge my colleagues to do right for those who \nprotect us and support this bill.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Barletta).\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Eric Williams \nCorrectional Officer Protection Act.\n  First, let me explain the title of the bill.\n  Eric Williams was a constituent of mine from Nanticoke, a senior \ncorrectional officer at the U.S. Prison at Canaan in Waymart, \nPennsylvania, which is just outside of my district. On February 25, \n2013, that is 3 years ago tomorrow, Eric Williams was working in the \nprison when he was suddenly attacked by an inmate. The inmate knocked \nOfficer Williams down a flight of steps. He then stabbed him more than \n200 times with a homemade shank. That inmate is now charged with first \ndegree murder, first degree murder of a United States corrections \nofficer, and possessing contraband in prison. Prosecutors are seeking \nthe death penalty.\n  Needless to say, at the time of the attack, Officer Williams was \nunarmed. Now, it makes sense that officers don't carry firearms into \nareas where inmates could gain access to them, but this bill tells the \nBureau of Prisons to supply pepper spray to prison officers or other \nemployees who could be involved in emergency situations with inmates.\n  If Officer Williams had been equipped with pepper spray 3 years ago, \nhe might have been able to defend himself against that cowardly, \nambush-style attack, and perhaps he would be alive today. This will \ngive correctional officers that fighting chance that Officer Williams \ndid not have.\n  I have had the privilege of meeting with Eric Williams' parents, Don \nand Jean. They are now part of an organization called Voices of JOE. \nThe letters of J-O-E stand for Jose Rivera, Osvaldo Albarati, and Eric \nWilliams. They were killed because of their jobs in the correctional \nsystem.\n  For them, Mr. Speaker, and all of our correctional officers who risk \ntheir lives every day, I urge support of the bill.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWest Virginia (Mr. McKinley), who is the chief sponsor of the House \nversion of this bill.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 238, the Eric \nWilliams Correctional Officer Protection Act, and urge its immediate \nadoption.\n  Two years ago, our office met with the family of Eric Williams. We \nheard the tragic story of how he was brutally murdered in the line of \nduty at the penitentiary at Canaan.\n  In coordination with Senator Toomey's office, we then introduced the \nbill, in concert with Congressmen Barletta and Marino, the companion \nbill in the House. We reintroduced it again this past year and are \nthrilled that the Toomey bill has passed the Senate and has come before \nthe House today. This bill will permanently authorize Federal \ncorrection officers to routinely carry pepper spray in medium-, high-, \nand maximum-security prisons.\n  Think about what we heard a minute ago. At the time of his death, \nOfficer Williams was only equipped with a radio, a set of keys, and \nsome handcuffs.\n  Any worker should feel safe and secure when they go to work, but that \nis not the case in our Federal correctional institutions. These men and \nwomen have no line of defense against conflicts within the prison \nwalls. This bill will go far in providing Federal correctional workers \na much-needed tool so that they may defend themselves and others if \nattacked by violent prison inmates.\n  I thank the Judiciary Committee and leadership for their quick action \nin bringing this issue to the floor, and I urge all my colleagues to \nhonor the memory of Officer Eric Williams by voting ``yes'' and sending \nthis bill to the President's desk.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time to close.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time \nto close.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me state the obvious. All of us are appalled and \nsaddened by the loss of this correctional officer. We express again our \nsadness and sympathy to his family although 3 years later. Eric \nWilliams did not deserve to die.\n  Our Federal prisons across America are dangerously overcrowded. Such \nconditions can frequently lead or at least contribute to unnecessary \nviolence. High- and medium-level security facilities make up 42 percent \nof the total Bureau of Prisons population.\n  In FY 2013, these facilities were operating 52 percent and 45 percent \nover capacity, respectively. Officers in these facilities must be \nequipped to protect themselves.\n  In 2010, there were almost 1,700 assaults on BOP staff and about 49 \nper 5,000 inmates. BOP requires officers of regular duty to carry a \nradio, body alarm, and keys.\n  Outside the pilot program and aside from the emergency situation and \nspecial teams, officers do not carry pepper spray all the time. \nOfficers must rely on communication skills and training to deescalate \nconfrontations. Sometimes that is not enough. These are important \nskills.\n  We know that well-trained Federal correctional officers are generally \nable to use these skills to avoid violence, but not all the time. We \nmust not have one single time where we have an officer at the risk of \nlosing their life and they have no protection.\n  In some instances, however, these skills may not be enough. When they \nare not, these officers must not be defenseless. Issuance of pepper \nspray alongside proper training will go a long way to assist these \nofficers.\n  We ask a lot of Federal correctional officers. In the comments made \nabout Mr. Williams, he was engaged in counseling and rehabilitation \ndiscussions.\n  We support these officers with training and skills. We do expect for \nthem to interact. When faced with acts of violence against themselves \nand others, they must be well positioned to cut that violence short.\n  So I ask my colleges to join in passing S. 238. I thank the author of \nthe bill who persisted in introducing it on many occasions, my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee, including Mr. Marino, and \nothers, our chairman and ranking member.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, and the Council of Prison \nLocals in supporting the Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection \nAct of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto close.\n  Very simply, a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet Mr. and \nMrs. Williams, Eric's parents. They came to the House Judiciary \nCommittee on the day that we marked up our prison reform legislation \nand included matters related to protecting the security officers in \nthat legislation.\n  They came after Eric had been brutally murdered. So they knew that\n\n[[Page H869]]\n\nnothing they did there that day would save him, that he had already \nbeen lost. But they came for one important reason. They don't want to \nsee that happen to any other Federal prison security guards anywhere \nanytime. They strongly support this legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues to pass this legislation in Eric Williams' name \nand out of respect for the concern his parents have that officers who \nserve their country in our Federal prisons are kept safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 238.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H869-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H869-H874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3624, FRAUDULENT JOINDER PREVENTION \n                              ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. During consideration of this resolution all time yielded is \nfor the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on House Resolution 618, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward \nthis rule on behalf of the Rules Committee.\n  It is a structured rule that provides 1 hour of general debate \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee for H.R. 3624, the Fraudulent Joinder Prevention \nAct of 2016.\n  In addition to consideration of H.R. 3624, the House will also debate \nand vote on two amendments on the House floor.\n  Yesterday the Rules Committee received testimony from the sponsor of \nthe bill and a minority representative of the Judiciary Committee. \nSubcommittee hearings were held on this legislation, and it was marked \nup and reported by the Judiciary Committee. This bill went through \nregular order and enjoyed meaningful discussion at the subcommittee and \nfull committee level.\n  H.R. 3624 is strongly supported by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business and the Chamber of Commerce because of the \nsignificance of this issue to small businesses in northeast Georgia and \nacross the Nation.\n  This legislation will protect innocent local parties, often small \nbusinessowners, from being dragged into expensive lawsuits. It achieves \nthis goal in two specific ways.\n  First, the bill empowers judges to exercise greater discretion to \nfree an innocent local party from a case where the judge finds there is \nno plausible case against that party.\n  It applies the same plausibility standard that the Supreme Court has \nsaid should be used to dismiss pleadings for failing to state a valid \nlegal claim, and we believe the same standard should apply to release \ninnocent parties from lawsuits.\n  Second, the bill allows judges to look at evidence that the trial \nlawyers aren't acting in good faith in adding local defendants. This is \na standard some lower courts already use to determine whether a trial \nlawyer really intends to pursue claims against the local defendant or \nis just using them as part of their forum shopping strategy.\n  It is important to emphasize that Congress has the authority to \nregulate the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts. The present \nstandard has been described as poorly defined and subject to \ninconsistent interpretation and application and the consequences \nsignificant and real.\n  H.R. 3624 is consistent with the views of our Founding Fathers and \nthe principles of federalism enshrined in the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman Buck, and their \nstaff for their work in bringing forth this important litigation \nreform.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Collins) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule \nand in strong opposition to the underlying legislation. In short, this \nis a lousy bill.\n  At the end of last year, Republicans and Democrats came together to \npass four major pieces of legislation that were sent to President \nObama's desk and enacted into law.\n  We passed a bipartisan budget agreement, a multiyear tax package, a \nhighway bill, and legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act that had all been stalled for years.\n  That is how Congress is supposed to work, Mr. Speaker. Quite frankly, \nI thought at the end of last year that maybe these successes would be \ncontagious and that it would become the norm to actually work together \nin a bipartisan way and to pass meaningful legislation that would \nactually become law.\n  But this Republican leadership, I am sad to say, has returned from \nthe holiday break with more of the same tired ideas and partisan \nlegislation that is going nowhere. We are wasting time with this \nlegislation today, which is going nowhere. We are wasting taxpayer \ndollars spending our time dealing with legislation that is going \nnowhere.\n  Instead of considering legislation to create jobs, boost our economy, \nor lift struggling Americans out of poverty,\n\n[[Page H870]]\n\nthis Republican leadership is once again bringing to the floor a \ncompletely unnecessary bill that puts the interests of large \ncorporations ahead of the rights of the American people to pursue \njustice through our court system.\n  It is not even the first time this week Republicans have played \npolitics with our judicial system. Just yesterday Senate Majority \nLeader Mitch McConnell and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee confirmed that Senate Republicans will not hold hearings or \nany votes on any nominee by President Obama to fill the current vacancy \non the U.S. Supreme Court, leaving a vacancy on our highest court for \nat least a year or more.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the life of me, I can't understand why my Republican \nfriends have spent so much time during the last 7 years doing \neverything they can to try to obstruct this President's agenda and \nevery idea that this President has had.\n\n  The contempt that Republicans have demonstrated for this President \nfrom day one, when the Senate majority leader made clear that they \nwanted to make President Obama a one-term President and that the \nRepublicans were going to do everything they could to stop every piece \nof legislation that he proposed because they wanted him to have no \nsuccess stories, I think illustrates why this place has become the \nCongress of dysfunction.\n  We need to do better. We need to understand that, in Washington, \nD.C., our job is to try to get things done, not simply put roadblocks \nin the way.\n  Interfering with our judicial system to score political points sets a \ndangerous precedent, and the underlying bill that we are set to \nconsider later today is just one more attempt to unbalance the scales \nof justice.\n  H.R. 3624, the so-called Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act, works to \ncreate a wild west environment for big corporations by making it harder \nfor ordinary citizens to hold them accountable for their actions. It is \nsimply another Republican handout to big business.\n  H.R. 3624 is an attempt to create a solution to a problem that \ndoesn't exist. The issue of determining if a local party has improperly \njoined a case is already dealt with in our judicial system. There is no \nreal evidence that the current system is failing to address any \nfraudulent joinders.\n  This bill creates redtape and bureaucracy, something I am constantly \nhearing my Republican friends complain about, all to make our courts \nfriendlier to big business.\n  H.R. 3624 looks to move judicial cases that are supposed to be \nhandled in State courts up to the Federal system, where trials take \nlonger and are more expensive.\n  This makes it significantly harder for an individual who has been \ninjured by a corporation to take them to court and to be able to \nreceive the compensation that they may be entitled to, that they \ndeserve.\n  The costs are even higher for those seeking justice when you consider \nthat this change would force many individuals to travel long distances.\n  This is unjust and unfair. Maybe it pleases a certain group of \ncontributors, but it is certainly not in the interests of the average \nAmerican citizen.\n  Clogging up our Federal court system with unnecessary cases that \nshould be handled in State courts is simply not in the best interest of \nthe American people. Congress should not be taking away the power of \nthe courts to determine where a case should be heard.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans would be outraged to learn that we are even \nconsidering a bill that would tilt the scales even more in the \ndirection of big corporations.\n  This is the people's House. We are supposed to be on the side of the \npeople, not on the side of big corporations.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this rule, to reject this \nunderlying bill, and to get on the side of the American people. If we \nwant to do something constructive, maybe what we ought to do is pass a \nbill that allows the American people to sue the Congress for \nmalpractice because that is what this is about.\n  This really is malpractice, that we are wasting our time on a bill \nthat essentially is a giveaway to big corporations and we are not doing \nthe business that the people sent us here to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the \nprevious question. If we do defeat the previous question, I am going to \noffer an amendment to the rule to bring up a resolution that would \nrequire the Republican majority to stop its partisan games and finally \nhold hearings on the President's budget proposal.\n  I don't know why this is so controversial. We ought to have a \nhearing, and we ought to talk about various ideas on how to deal with \nour budget. The President of the United States is entitled to have a \nhearing up here in the House of Representatives.\n  I urge my colleagues again not to follow suit of the Senate, which \nis, again, blocking any hearings on a new Supreme Court nominee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) to discuss this proposal.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time.\n  This is my eighth year in service on the House Budget Committee. For \nthe last 7 years, every year, the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget has come to the House Budget Committee and has presented the \nbudget of the President of the United States--the President of the \nUnited States, who has been duly elected by the people of this country \nfor two terms.\n  Now the House Budget Committee decides that it wants to break 40 \nyears of tradition and not allow the administration to present the \nPresident's budget to not just the committee, but also to the country. \nThis isn't just unprecedented, this is disrespectful to the members of \nthe committee and the Members of this House. It is certainly \ndisrespectful to our President and the office of the Presidency. And \nabove all, it is disrespectful to the American people who expect their \nelected leaders to at least review the budget of the President they \nelected.\n  As I have said before, the American people have elected President \nObama twice. They did it for a reason. One of the reasons was that we \nwere facing one of the greatest financial crises in the history of this \ncountry. The record since President Obama has taken office is pretty \ngood. During his time in office, he has overseen one of the most \nmonumental recoveries in our Nation's history.\n  Consider some of the things that have happened over the past two \nterms of the Obama administration. Over the last 6 years, 14 million \nnew jobs have been created; unemployment is now down to 5 percent; our \nbudget deficit is at the smallest it has been in 8 years, down $1 \ntrillion from the year President Obama took office; corporate profits \nare up more than 165 percent; the Dow Jones average has doubled; the \nS 500 has more than doubled, up 140 percent; the NASDAQ has tripled, \nrising 222 percent; more than 16 million Americans now have health \ncoverage who previously didn't; and new business formations are running \nat their highest rate in 17 years.\n  With that record of economic leadership, you would think that not \njust the American people, but certainly the House Budget Committee \nmembers would want to hear what this President has to say about his \nvision for the economy going forward and for the budget of this \ngovernment. But no, once again, for the first time in 40 years, we \ndon't have time or, apparently, the interest to listen to what the \nPresident has to say.\n  I shouldn't say ``we.'' This is the Republicans on the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Budgets are the way we prioritize our values and our preferences for \nfuture action. I know why the Republicans don't want to hear the \nPresident's budget, because they don't want the American people to \ncompare what the President would like to do with what their own budget \nwill do. Now, we don't\n\n[[Page H871]]\n\nknow exactly what that Republican budget is going to look like this \nyear, but we do know that the Republican budget is going to resemble \nthe Paul Ryan budget of 2012 and 2011.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman from Kentucky an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. That budget was so distasteful to the American people \nthat his running mate in 2012, Mr. Romney, was forced to disavow it. We \ncan make our own judgments, but we can't make our own judgments if we \ncan't see and we don't let the American people see the administration \ndiscuss their priorities versus the Republican priorities.\n  This really is an insult, once again, to the American people that \nRepublicans are too scared of the contrast that will be presented to \neven allow the President's budget, the constitutionally elected \nPresident of the United States, to have his budget discussed in front \nof the American people. It is shameful.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I include in the Record an editorial that appeared in the New York \nTimes, entitled, ``Republican Budget Tantrum.'' The editorial concludes \nwith this paragraph saying:\n  ``The President's budget request is a detailed and worthy entry in \nthe contest of ideas. Its aim is to move the Nation forward. If \nRepublicans had compelling ideas and a similar commitment to progress, \nthey would engage with the proposals in the budget. But they don't. So \nthey won't.''\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 9, 2016]\n\n                       Republican Budget Tantrum\n\n                        (By The Editorial Board)\n\n       By law, dating back to 1921, the president of the United \n     States must submit an annual budget request to Congress. On \n     Tuesday, President Obama submitted his eighth and final \n     budget. And like all presidential budgets, it is a statement \n     of values and priorities, a blueprint for turning ideas into \n     policies, a map of where the president wants to lead the \n     country.\n       This week, even before the president's budget was released, \n     the Republican chairmen of the budget committees announced \n     they would not even hold hearings with the White House budget \n     director to discuss the proposal.\n       Their decision is more than a break with tradition. It is a \n     new low in Republican efforts to show disdain for Mr. Obama, \n     which disrespects the presidency and, in the process, \n     suffocates debate and impairs governing.\n       Mr. Obama's budget proposes to spend $4 trillion in the \n     2017 fiscal year (slightly more than for 2016). That total \n     would cover recurring expenses, including Medicare and Social \n     Security, as well as new initiatives to fight terrorism, \n     poverty and climate change, while fostering health, education \n     and environmental protection. If Republicans find those \n     efforts objectionable--as their refusal to even discuss them \n     indicates--they owe it to their constituents and other \n     Americans to say why.\n       Would they prefer to renege on Social Security benefits? Do \n     they think $11 billion to fight ISIS, as the budget proposes, \n     is too much? Is $4.3 billion to deter Russian aggression \n     against NATO allies a bad idea? Does $19 billion for \n     cybersecurity to protect government records, critical \n     infrastructure and user privacy seem frivolous? And is $1.2 \n     billion to help states pay for safe drinking water or $292 \n     million to send more preschoolers to Head Start really \n     unaffordable?\n       Republicans have objected that the president's budget does \n     not do enough to tackle the nation's borrowing. But according \n     to the White House's estimate, the proposal would reduce \n     deficits by $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years. That would \n     be sufficient to hold deficits below 3 percent of the \n     economy, a level that is widely considered manageable and \n     even desirable, because a wealthy and growing nation can \n     afford to borrow for projects that would be financially \n     burdensome if paid for all at once.\n       If Republicans have a plan to pay for the necessary work of \n     government while eliminating deficits entirely, they should \n     present it.\n       The problem is that Republicans do not have viable \n     alternatives. The budget proposes a $10-a-barrel tax on crude \n     oil to help pay for $320 billion in new spending over 10 \n     years on clean-energy transportation projects. Congressional \n     Republicans, unable to break free of their no-new-taxes-ever \n     stance, have derided the oil tax. But what is their plan to \n     pay for projects to modernize transportation and promote \n     green technology in the absence of a new tax?\n       The budget would also raise $272 billion over the next \n     decade by closing tax loopholes that let high-income owners \n     of limited-liability companies and other so-called pass-\n     through businesses avoid investment taxes that apply to all \n     other investors. Most of the money would be used to \n     strengthen Medicare's finances. What is the Republican plan \n     to strengthen Medicare?\n       The president's budget request is a detailed and worthy \n     entry in the contest of ideas. Its aim is to move the nation \n     forward. If Republicans had compelling ideas and a similar \n     commitment to progress, they would engage with the proposals \n     in the budget. But they don't. So they won't.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would just say that we are reading in \nthe press that the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Republican \nchairman of the Budget Committee, is now punting on the Republican \nbudget because apparently there is not enough red meat in there to \nsatisfy the Tea Party--or the Freedom Caucus or whatever they call \nthemselves this particular week--which is very, very disturbing. But I \nthink it is important that the Republicans do their job, just like the \nPresident did his job. And while you are waiting to do your job, I \nthink you should maybe have a hearing on the President's budget so that \nmaybe some of these ideas, my friends might be able to react to and \nmaybe even find some agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, the refusal of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle to hold a hearing on the President's budget is an \nunprecedented show of disrespect. The lack of respect I have seen for \nthis President is abominable, it is disgraceful, and it does not \nrepresent the American character.\n  Chairman Price of the Budget Committee, Mr. Speaker, recently \nremarked he wanted to ``save the President the embarrassment'' of \nhaving his Budget Director come testify before the Congress.\n  Save him the embarrassment? He should be embarrassed.\n  This is the first time, Mr. Speaker, since 1975 that the Budget \nCommittee has not given the basic courtesy of reviewing the President's \nbudget, regardless of politics, regardless of whether we had a \nDemocratic President or a Republican President, or regardless of \nwhether we had a Democratic Congress or we had a Republican Congress--\nsince 1975.\n  This crass display of partisanship diminishes the ability of Congress \nto do its job. It certainly doesn't help us in reaching across the \naisle, or maybe I am missing something. Had the committee held a \nhearing on the President's budget, you would know that it creates \nopportunity for all, not just those at the top. It invests in growing \nthe economy and ensuring the United States is competitive in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Look, we set the parameters in December, just a few months ago, and \nnow what you want to do politically is tell us you can't live within \nthose parameters. That is what you are telling the American people. We \nagreed to that. We voted on it.\n  Now the majority has punted--to use the term--its responsibility and \npostponed releasing a budget as it tries to cater to the extreme \nrightwing of its party.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. By the way, we were going to be marking up that budget \nthis week; am I correct? I will stand corrected, Mr. Speaker, if I am \nwrong. We were supposed to be marking up that budget. Now, we have to \nask: Why aren't we marking up that budget?\n  We call on you to use this extra time during this delay to do your \njob and hold a hearing on the President's budget. It is the right thing \nto do. It is the moral thing to do.\n  Gee, what does that mean? I asked you if you want to work in a \nbipartisan way. This would be a demonstration of how to do that.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members to direct \ntheir remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying again to my colleagues that they \nshould defeat this rule, which is a restrictive rule. They should vote \nagainst\n\n[[Page H872]]\n\nthe previous question so we can actually bring forward the resolution \nthat would allow for there to be a hearing on the President's budget \nproposal, and we should defeat the underlying bill.\n  We should defeat the underlying bill because it is a giveaway to big \ncorporations and big special interests. It is a bill that seems like it \nwas written in the Republican congressional campaign committee to make \nbig contributors happy. It does nothing to protect the well-being and \nthe interests of average Americans, of small businesses, and of people \nwho do not have a lot of wealth.\n  For those reasons, we ought to reject the underlying bill, we ought \nto have a debate on the President's budget proposal, and we ought to \nhave a debate on whatever the Republicans come up with on their budget \nproposal.\n  Speaker Ryan said that this would be the year of ideas, but it seems \nthat any idea that isn't the idea of a small group of very, very \nrightwing Republicans is not welcome to be talked about, never mind \ndeliberated on, in this Congress. We need to listen to all ideas, and \nthat includes what the President has proposed.\n  By the way, this is a President who, notwithstanding all of the \nattempts by my Republican friends to try to frustrate all of his \nlegislative efforts, has a record of accomplishment nonetheless, and \none that I think we Democrats are very, very proud of.\n  But the fact of the matter is he is the President. He was elected not \nonce, but he was elected twice. The American people elected him twice. \nHe is our President for another year, whether my friends like it other \nnot. He ought to be given the respect--and not just him, but the \nPresidency ought to be given the respect--to not play these kinds of \npolitical games when it comes to the budget.\n  I hope that the previous question will be defeated so that we can \nbring this amendment to the floor for a vote.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, we have a lot to do. Let's stop bringing \npress releases to the floor for votes, and let's start doing business \nthat will actually help the American people. This has become a place \nwhere trivial issues get debated passionately but important ones not at \nall. We need to change that. There is a reason why Congress is so low \nin the public opinion polls. What is happening today is an example of \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of \nmy time.\n  It has been interesting. Again, I want to just remind everyone, Mr. \nSpeaker, that this is a rule debate about a bill that is coming forward \nto discuss a fraudulent joinder, which is something that impacts our \ncommunities and impacts our legal system. Just as a reminder, I am \ngoing to ask that you vote for the rule and for the underlying bill, \nH.R. 3624, which will have plenty of debate forthcoming.\n  It has been an interesting thing in the last few minutes to discuss \nwith my colleagues across the aisle and talk about real ideas and press \nreleases. Well, it is interesting. It has always been the prerogative \nof Congress and committee chairmen to invite whom they want and how \nthey run their committees, and that is continuing in that tradition.\n  I think it is interesting that at the time it was announced, no \nhearing on the President's budget was needed; we had no reason to \nbelieve the President's budget would balance or show any real interest \nin doing the fiscal challenge.\n  If you want to talk about press releases, go look at what was handed \nout just a few weeks ago. In the President's budget, it had a great \npicture of a mountain on the front. It was great symbolism because it \nbasically just symbolized that this is a budget of debt; it is a \nmountain of debt; it has no hope, no promise--never will--to balance \nour budget.\n  Do you want to talk about real ideas? It reminds me of when I was \ngoing back and I was raising my children when they were smaller, and I \nwould say it is time to eat and they would say: Daddy, we want candy. \nDaddy, we want this.\n  I would say: You have to eat real food.\n  Real ideas mean that in this country we take them seriously.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  It means a budget that can actually balance.\n  When you have military leaders, business leaders, and community \nleaders saying that the greatest threat to America right now is our \ndebt and deficit situation, and, yet, the President, in his own press \nrelease--if you would, a large budget--says that we are never going to \nbalance, that we don't hope to balance, I do not understand the \ndisconnect from the kitchen table to the White House's kitchen table. \nUndoubtedly, there is a disconnect, because you put forth an idea that \nis not serious, and you are not putting forth an idea that balances. It \nis the compelling idea that makes us move forward.\n  The budget debate that Congress is having right now is one that the \nAmerican people are demanding. It is about how we advance a budget that \nbalances and that addresses fiscal challenges so we can have a strong \nnational defense, a healthy economy, and healthy retirements and \nsecurity for seniors and families. The President's ``status quo'' \nbudget doesn't do that. In fact, it doesn't do anything with regard to \nwhat we have talked about.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was back in my district last week, as many of us were. \nOne of the many things we are hearing in this election season is the \nreality that there is a disconnect between Main Street and inside this \nbeltway. As long as there are ideas down a certain avenue called \nPennsylvania that say we want to put a budget up that has no hope of \nhelping this country out of the situation it is in, then we are not \ndealing in reality, then we are not dealing in real ideas. We are \nsimply dealing in the fantasy that, one day, it will all just be \nbetter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I remind our Democrat friends who are adamant about \nbringing the President's budget into the mix that they are welcome to \noffer it up when a vote comes; but the last time the President's budget \nhit the floor, it got all of two votes.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 618 Offered by Mr. McGovern\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 624) \n     Directing the Committee on the Budget to hold a public \n     hearing on the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request \n     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as a \n     witness. The resolution shall be considered as read. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the \n     resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening \n     motion or demand for division of the question except one hour \n     of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of the resolution specified in section 2 of \n     this resolution.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous\n\n[[Page H873]]\n\n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

NO. 114-102)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and ordered to be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States, including section 1 of title II of Public \nLaw 65-24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (50 U.S.C. 191), sections \n201, 202, and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et \nseq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby report \nthat I have issued a Proclamation to modify and continue the national \nemergency declared in Proclamations 6867 and 7757.\n  The Proclamation recognizes that certain descriptions of the national \nemergency set forth in Proclamations 6867 and 7757 no longer reflect \nthe international relations of the United States related to Cuba. \nFurther, the Proclamation recognizes the reestablishment of diplomatic \nrelations between the United States and Cuba, and that the United \nStates continues to pursue the progressive normalization of relations \nwhile aspiring toward a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Cuba.\n  The Proclamation clarifies the national emergency related to Cuba and \nspecifically provides the following statements related to U.S. national \nsecurity and foreign policy:\n It is U.S. policy that a mass migration from Cuba would \nendanger the security of the United States by posing a disturbance or \nthreatened disturbance of the international relations of the United \nStates.\n   The unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the \njurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in \nviolation of U.S. law and contrary to U.S. policy.\n   The unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban \nterritorial waters is detrimental to U.S. foreign policy, and counter \nto the purpose of Executive Order 12807, which is to ensure, among \nother things, safe, orderly, and legal migration.\n   The possibility of large-scale unauthorized entries of U.S-\nregistered vessels would disturb the international relations of the \nUnited States by facilitating a possible mass migration of Cuban \nnationals.\n  I have directed the Secretary of Homeland Security (the \n``Secretary'') to make and issue such rules and regulations as the \nSecretary may find appropriate to regulate the anchorage and movement \nof vessels, and authorize and approve the Secretary's issuance of such \nrules and regulations, as authorized by the Act of June 15, 1917.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Proclamation I have issued.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                    The White House, February 24, 2016.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H874-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H874-H875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 3004, introduced by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. \nClyburn), amends the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Act by extending \nthe authorization for the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor \nCommission.\n  The corridor exists to preserve and foster the unique cultural \ncommunities formed by Americans of African descent along the Atlantic \ncoastal islands of four States and that existed in relative isolation \nfor many generations.\n  During those years, a distinct and uniquely American culture evolved, \na culture that is gradually slipping from us in the march of the modern \nworld.\n  Although the heritage corridor was authorized through October 12, \n2021, the Commission was only authorized through October 12, 2016. \nWithout any legislative change, the corridor will have to be managed by \na different, as yet unconstituted, entity.\n  I urge passage of the measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill simply extends the authorization of the \nGullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission from 10 to 15 \nyears.\n  Congress designated the Gullah/Geechee Heritage Corridor in 2006 to \npromote and interpret the story of African Americans known as Gullah/\nGeechee who settled along the coast of North Carolina, South Carolina, \nGeorgia, and Florida.\n  The enabling legislation for the corridor, while providing a 15-year \nauthority for technical and financial assistance, only gave the \nidentified local coordinating entity a 10-year authorization. This bill \nmatches up the two authorities so the Commission can continue its work.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for \nbringing this issue to our attention and all of his work on behalf of \nthe Gullah/Geechee Heritage Corridor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n3004, which would extend authorization for the Gullah/Geechee Cultural \nHeritage Corridor Commission through October of 2021.\n  The low country and sea islands of our southeastern States, including \nthe First Congressional District of Georgia, are home to some of our \nNation's most treasured cultures. One of the most unique is the Gullah/\nGeechee people.\n  Over the past three centuries, the Gullah/Geechee people have \ndeveloped and preserved their own distinct language and culture that \nretains many of their African traditions. The Gullah/Geechee Cultural \nHeritage Corridor was created to recognize the cultural contributions \nof the Gullah/Geechee and to assist in preserving and interpreting \ntheir history, language, folklore, art, and music.\n  The Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission coordinates \nwith local officials and communities to preserve and honor the Gullah/\nGeechee heritage for years to come.\n  H.R. 3004 would extend the Commission's authorization for an \nadditional 5 years so that they may continue their mission of \npreserving the valuable contributions of the Gullah/Geechee culture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), my distinguished \ncolleague.\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3004, a bill that makes a \ntechnical change to the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Act.\n  Gullah/Geechee is a blend of African and European language, culture, \nand traditions found along the coast and sea islands of North Carolina, \nSouth Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, where former slaves began their \nfreedom in isolated and remote communities and nurtured unique cultural \ntraditions.\n  The Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Act, signed into law in 2006, \ncreated the Gullah/Geechee Heritage Corridor to preserve and protect \nthe remaining vestiges of this living culture, which has been \nthreatened by development in these coastal communities.\n  Called Gullah in the Carolinas and Geechee in Georgia and Florida, \nthese enclaves of language and culture provide a significant link to \nAfrican American heritage. As a former history teacher and historic \npreservation advocate, the establishment of the heritage corridor is \none of my proudest achievements in Congress.\n  This bill before us corrects a technical issue by extending the \nauthorization of the Commission created by the original legislation to \ncoincide with the heritage corridor, which runs to 2021. Without this \nchange, the heritage corridor would continue to exist but would need to \nbe managed by a new entity, eroding the progress the current Commission \nhas made toward implementing its management plan. Enacting this \nlegislation will ensure continuity in the management of the corridor so \nthat its mission is carried out as efficiently and effectively as \npossible.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking members of the Committee on \nNatural Resources and Subcommittee on Federal Lands for their support \nof this bill and for moving it swiftly to the House floor today for \nconsideration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Rice).\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. I thank the distinguished gentleman for \nyielding.\n  The Gullah/Geechee culture is infused throughout the low country of \nSouth Carolina. In fact, it is a big part of what makes the low country \nof South Carolina so unique. From Daufuskie on the southern end to \nLittle River Neck on the northern end, that culture permeates our \ngeography and our people.\n  My father's family, my grandfather's family, my brother, and myself \nwere raised in the midst of the Gullah/Geechee culture. In all of our \ncities--again, from north to south; in Charleston, Myrtle Beach, and \nGeorgetown--you can see those traditions infused throughout those \ncommunities.\n\n[[Page H876]]\n\n  The traditions of the Gullah/Geechee arts, oral history, literature, \nmusic, cuisine, and others, have made a distinctive impact on the \ncoastal Carolina culture. Growing up on the coast, I have fond memories \nof the Gullah/Geechee people and their way of life.\n  Authorizing the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission \nis important to preserving and managing the uniqueness of their \nimportant traditions. I support the reauthorization of the Commission \nand the passage of H.R. 3004.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3004.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H876-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H876-H877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2880, introduced by our colleague, John Lewis, \nredesignates the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in \nthe State of Georgia as the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical \nPark. It also authorizes the National Park Service to include the \nPrince Hall Masonic Temple in the Historical Park's boundaries.\n  The Prince Hall Masonic Temple long served as the headquarters of the \nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference. This historic and \ndistinguished civil rights organization was cofounded by Dr. King, who \nalso served as its first president. Including the Prince Hall Masonic \nTemple within the unit's boundary allows the National Park Service to \nprovide technical assistance to the building's owners with respect to \nrepairs, renovations, and maintenance that would preserve its historic \nintegrity.\n  It can be said that every American figuratively walks in the \nfootsteps of the American Founders and those who followed them and who \nperfected their vision. Because of their work, we enjoy the blessings \nof a free government that exists to protect the God-given natural \nrights of every person and a free society where every person will be \njudged, in Dr. King's words, ``on the content of his character.''\n  Our historical parks give us the opportunity literally to walk in the \nfootsteps of these great Americans who have struggled over the \ncenturies to secure this vision. Those who gathered around Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., in the 1950s walked the streets of this neighborhood, \nand its preservation gives us and future generations a tangible link \nwith them.\n  One of them was our distinguished colleague, Congressman Lewis, and I \ncommend him for his work. It is altogether fitting that a man who did \nso much to establish this legacy brings to the House today a bill to \nfurther preserve it, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2880 is a simple piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan \nsupport. The bill will accomplish two primary goals: to redesignate the \nMartin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia, \nas a National Historical Park, and to adjust the boundary of the park \nto include the Prince Hall Masonic Temple. These actions will enhance \nthe ability of the National Park Service and the community to tell the \nvery important story of Dr. King.\n  The site, which is the final resting place of the great civil rights \nleader, continues to connect visitors with the historical and \ncontemporary struggles for civil rights in this country. These stories \nare as relevant today as they were half a century ago. This legislation \nwill provide the site with the proper acknowledgment that it deserves.\n  I want to thank Congressman Lewis, who remains an important civil \nrights leader, for bringing this important bill forward.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Lewis).\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise as the proud sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  First, let me thank Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and all \nthe staff of the Natural Resources Committee for their hard work and \nsupport of this act.\n  Mr. Speaker, my bipartisan bill will create the first National \nHistoric Park in the State of Georgia. This technical change from a \n``Site'' to a ``Park'' will make it easier for the National Park \nService to share the history of the American civil rights movement with \nnational and international visitors to Atlanta.\n  These historic spaces are located in my congressional district in \ndowntown Atlanta, on and around Auburn Avenue. This is where Dr. King \nwas born and raised, where he was nurtured and taught, where he \npreached and loved.\n  I was a teenager when I first met Dr. King in 1958, at the age of 18. \nThis conversation forever changed my life, but I was not the only one. \nMany, many people were touched by this man's genius and compassion for \nall humankind. Dr. King's mission was to create the beloved community, \na community of justice, a community at peace with itself.\n  Dr. King had the power to bring people together to do good. His \nmessage was love, his weapon was truth, and the method was the way of \nnonviolence and passive resistance.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led a nonviolent movement that changed \nthe face of our Nation. He inspired people from all over our country \nand from all over the world.\n  My simple act will improve the services and educational opportunities \nfor visitors to this wonderful space and this wonderful piece of \nhistory. It will preserve this important part of our history for \ngenerations yet unborn.\n  Again, I would like to thank the chair and ranking member for their \nsupport, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this simple, \ncommonsense legislation.\n\n[[Page H877]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, there is no greater voice of the civil \nrights movement here in this Congress and in this Nation than our dear \nfriend, Congressman John Lewis.\n  I am both excited and honored to be able to support this legislation \nthat changes what was a ``Site'' in its early beginnings to the \nimportant designation of a National Historic Park honoring Martin \nLuther King, Jr.\n  I first want to thank John Lewis for his conscientious and hard work \non behalf of the King family. As I sat here and listened to Congressman \nLewis relaying his story, I had the slight privilege to have worked for \nthe Southern Christian Leadership Conference on the very street that he \nhas mentioned. After him, I was able to come to the then-offices of the \nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference in this historic area.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rothfus). The time of the gentlewoman \nhas expired.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. It was a small office where so many historic persons \nwere, in essence, able to walk in the midst of those hallowed streets. \nDr. King came. I don't know whether he parked a car or walked into that \noffice. Of course, we have all of the other surrounding areas and other \nnames of historic persons that had the ability to walk down those \nstreets and into that area.\n  We take great pride in the preservation of our National Park areas. \nAnd I must compliment the National Park Service, because it has a love \nand affection for all those lands that it takes care of. You can see it \nwhen you are able to visit these national sites throughout our country \nthat we have had a chance to visit.\n  In my colleague's district will be an added place for Dr. Martin \nLuther King's resources and things his hands touched. What an \nappropriate time in our history to be able again to thank this man of \npeace, of nonviolence, and to remind ourselves that America is really a \ngreat country to have given birth to him. Along with the plight and \nconditions in which he lived in at the time and the conditions which he \nwas subjected to, to our knowledge, he never became embittered. He \nalways, although frustrated at moments, recognized love and \nnonviolence.\n  I hope that with the recognition he will get and the protection of \nthese wonderful assets, people will come there for solace. It will be \nanother place, along with the monument here in Washington, where people \nwill come here for solace and the recognition that nonviolence and \npeace and the human dignity of all people are virtues of this Nation \ncarried forward by a great and wonderful and heroic leader--someone \nwhom I at least had a small moment to be associated with through his \norganization after his death. And I thank him.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2880, the ``Martin Luther King, Jr. \nNational Historical Park Act.''\n  In 1980, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 96-428), establishing the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site.\n  H.R. 2880 redesignates the ``Martin Luther King Junior, National \nHistoric Site'' as the ``Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical \nPark.''\n  This name change is important because it recognizes the greater \nphysical extent that the site represents not only for African American \nhistory, but American history.\n  This legislation will improve the preservation and ensure the \ncontinuous protection of this historic district.\n  When passed, in 1980, the law set the boundaries of the site along a \nportion of Auburn Avenue in Atlanta.\n  This area includes the birthplace of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr.; the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where both he and his father \npreached; and the immediate surrounding area.\n  That law also designated a preservation district that extended \nprotection beyond the immediate neighborhood surrounding the birthplace \nand church to include the broader Sweet Auburn commercial district.\n  Since 1980, Congress has twice modified the boundaries of the site \nand preservation district (P.L. 102-575 and P.L. 108-314).\n  H.R. 2880 will extend the boundaries of the site to include the \nPrince Hall Masonic Temple, which is where the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference (SCLC) established its initial headquarters in \n1957.\n  The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a co-founder and the first \npresident of the SCLC.\n  It is fitting that we remember the life and legacy of a man who \nbrought hope and healing to America.\n  The life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. reminds us that \nnothing is impossible when we are guided by the better angels of our \nnature.\n  Dr. King walked the walk, going to jail 29 times to achieve freedom \nfor others.\n  He knew he would pay the ultimate price for his leadership, but kept \non marching and protesting and organizing anyway.\n  It is proper that we remember this man of action, who put his life on \nthe line for freedom and justice every day.\n  So it is fitting that we pass H.R. 2880 and expand, protect, and \npreserve the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Park so that for \ngenerations to come it remains a living memorial to the men and women \nwho led the movement that helped our nation live up to the true meaning \nof its creed and inspired non-violent movements for social change the \nworld over.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would urge adoption of the measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2880, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H877-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H877-H879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      KOREAN WAR VETERANS MEMORIAL WALL OF REMEMBRANCE ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Korean War Veterans Memorial \n     Wall of Remembrance Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WALL OF REMEMBRANCE.\n\n       Section 1 of the Act titled ``An Act to authorize the \n     erection of a memorial on Federal Land in the District of \n     Columbia and its environs to honor members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States who served in the Korean War'', \n     approved October 25, 1986 (Public Law 99-572), is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Such memorial shall include a Wall of Remembrance, which \n     shall be constructed without the use of Federal funds.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n[[Page H878]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1475, introduced by Congressman Sam Johnson, would \npermit a privately funded addition of a Wall of Remembrance to the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial.\n  The Wall would list the names of all members of the U.S. Armed Forces \nwho were killed in theater during the Korean war as well as the number \nof all of the American POWs and MIAs.\n  They call the Korean war America's forgotten war. During the 3 years \nof that war, 5.8 million Americans worldwide served in the U.S. armed \nservices, 22 nations fought alongside us to preserve the freedom of \nSouth Korea. 54,246 Americans died worldwide during this conflict, \n8,200 were missing in action, and an additional 103,284 were wounded.\n  The sacrifice they made and the freedom they secured for the people \nof South Korea must never be forgotten. This measure assures the names \nof the fallen shall live on.\n  This bill comes to us from one of only three Korean war veterans who \nstill serve their country today in this House, the legendary \nCongressman Sam Johnson of Texas, from whom we will be hearing shortly.\n  Representatives Charles Rangel and John Conyers, Jr., also \ndistinguished themselves in that war, as they have in this House, and \nare original cosponsors.\n  I urge passage of the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the construction of a Wall of \nRemembrance at the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the National Mall.\n  Similar to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Wall will list the \nnames of the U.S. military personnel killed in action during the Korean \nwar, along with the number of servicemen and -women wounded in action, \nlisted as missing in action, and those who were listed as prisoners of \nwar.\n  Construction of the current Korean War Veterans Memorial was finished \nin 1992, and it is considered a complete work of civic art. However, \nthe Korean war veterans' community has identified the addition of a \nWall of Remembrance as a priority, and they have advocated for \nlegislation to authorize its construction for years.\n  Their hard work and dedication has led to this bill before us today, \nwhich is currently cosponsored by 291 Members of the House.\n  The National Park Service, the agency responsible for the management \nof the current memorial, has expressed concern with the idea of adding \na new feature in an area of the National Mall known as the Reserve, \nwhere Congress has prohibited the construction of new memorials.\n  As this bill moves forward, I encourage the sponsors to work with the \nNational Park Service and other relevant stakeholders to make sure that \nthe new feature complements the current memorial.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we are all deeply honored to serve in \nthis House with the author of this measure, a genuine hero who served \ncourageously in both the Korean and Vietnam wars and who endured many \nyears of suffering as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He not only saw the \ncourage and heroism of those who fought in Korea, he was one of them.\n  I am honored to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson).\n  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to start off by thanking my fellow Korean \nwar veterans, Congressman Charlie Rangel and Congressman John Conyers, \nfor their support.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Rob Bishop, the Natural Resources \nCommittee, and the House leadership for bringing the bill to the floor.\n  Additionally, I want to thank my fellow Korean war veterans who have \ntirelessly advocated for this bill. It has been a long time coming.\n  Mr. Speaker, sadly, the Korean war is often referred to as the \nforgotten war; yet, the magnitude of sacrifice made by Americans during \nthis conflict was enormous. More than 36,000 Americans gave their \nlives.\n  My fellow Korean war veterans and I believe that the magnitude of \nthis enormous sacrifice is not yet fully conveyed by the memorial in \nWashington, D.C. That is where this bill, H.R. 1475, the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act, comes into play.\n  This bill, which already has the support of over 300 of my \ncolleagues, would allow for the creation of a Wall of Remembrance at \nthe site of the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the National Mall.\n  Similar to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall, the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance would eternally honor the brave \nAmericans who gave their lives in defense of freedom during the Korean \nwar. It would list their names as a visual record of their sacrifice.\n  Furthermore, the Wall would also list the total number of all of \nAmerica's wounded, missing in action, and prisoners of war.\n  As a veteran and POW, I can tell you that these memorials are a \nspecial place for servicemembers and their families to pay their \nrespect to fallen comrades and loved ones.\n  As a constitutional conservative who values our great Nation's \nhistory, I believe these memorials also serve as a unique and physical \nreminder that freedom is not free.\n  Future generations need to know and appreciate the sacrifices made by \nthe servicemembers who fought and died to protect freedom. These \nmemorials can physically convey what oftentimes our words fail to do.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, as a fiscal conservative, I am proud to say this \nproject will not cost taxpayers one dime. In fact, the cost has been \n100 percent privately fund-raised, and this bill prohibits any Federal \nfunding for this project.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we remember the service and sacrifice of those who \ngave their lives in the Korean war, we can only humbly acknowledge that \nwe are the land of the free because of our brave men and women.\n  These heroes are shining examples of everything great that America \nstands for. I can't think of a better way to individually honor each \nman and woman who gave their life in Korea than through this Wall of \nRemembrance.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the soldiers who \nfought to ensure that South Korea could achieve the prosperity and the \nfulfillment it enjoys today. Without our soldiers, that would not have \nhappened. These soldiers deserve to be recognized for their \ncontributions.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, which would \nexpand the current Korean War Memorial to include a Wall of Remembrance \nin our Nation's Capital. This addition will honor the service and \nsacrifice of those who fought in the Korean War.\n  I want to thank my good friend and committee mate, Congressman Sam \nJohnson, for introducing this legislation and, also, for his heroic \nmilitary service to our country in both the Korean and Vietnam wars.\n  Through the Speaker, Sam, we owe you so much, and we could never \nrepay you and the likes of Rangel and Conyers, et cetera, who put their \nlives on the line to not only defend America, but to defend the Korean \npeople.\n  In addition to a wall, this legislation will allow us to demonstrate \nour Nation's appreciation for the service of the Korean Augmentation to \nthe United States Army, the Republic of Korean Armed Forces, and the \nnations of the United Nations Command, who were killed in action, \nwounded, listed as missing in action, or were prisoners of war.\n  The Korean War Memorial Wall can ensure that future generations \nremember and honor the pride and dedication of those who served, the \nlegacy they continued, and the freedom they preserved.\n  You have heard the numbers about how many folks served, how many of \nour own brave soldiers and sailors and marines fought in the Korean \nwar: almost 6 million; over 100,000 were wounded and over 36,000 gave \ntheir\n\n[[Page H879]]\n\nlives. So this is a fitting recognition for those who bravely served in \ndefense of our Nation.\n  I visited my brother-in-law the other day, who lives in a veterans' \nnursing home. He was a soldier in the Korean war, a victim. Many in \nthat home fought in the same war, those who are still alive.\n  Talking to them, one thing I noticed is they don't want to talk about \ntheir experiences ever. I remember talking to my brother-in-law, Joe, \n30 years ago. He didn't want to talk about it. His brother, who served \nthere, didn't want to talk about it. His other brother, Freddie, did \nnot want to talk about it. He served there, also.\n  So this is not only remembrance. More importantly, it is thank you. \nThank you so much for what you did.\n  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned their names before, Congressmen Rangel and \nConyers. We owe them so much. I read Congressman Rangel's book twice \nabout the experiences that he had in service to our country. We can \nnever forget this. God bless, and I thank them.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), a distinguished veteran of the \nKorean war.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman for making this \npossible, Colonel Bill Webb, of the Korean Memorial Foundation, and, of \ncourse, my buddies and colleagues, Congressmen Johnson and Conyers.\n  Why this is so important to me is not for those who are living, but \nfor the memories of our colleagues who died overseas and whose family \nhave very little to explain as to why they were there.\n  I really think that this Congress and Congresses before us have lost \nall of the meaning of having the power and the only power to support \nthe declaration of war.\n  When I went overseas in 1950, I hadn't the slightest idea as to why I \nwas going. Quite frankly, I didn't even know where Korea was.\n  But because of my age and having been in combat, I have received more \naccolades from the grateful people from the country of South Korea than \nI deserve. But I know that they are thanking the United States and the \nUnited Nations for saving them from coming under communism.\n  I could not possibly have any bad feelings. Indeed, it is a great \nsense of honor that I could have played some small part in preserving \ndemocracy in South Korea, albeit as a volunteer to the Army, but \ncertainly not a volunteer to go into combat.\n  But the truth of the matter is that we shouldn't have young men and \nwomen being placed in harm's way in any situation without men and women \nand their families knowing that they did this because the security of \nour great Republic was threatened.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Each time I feel heavily and scream out that we should have a draft \ninstead of an All Volunteer Army, I know that it appears as though I am \nputting a burden on so many people who don't necessarily want to belong \nto the military. But serving our great country is a privilege, and all \npeople should share if indeed there is a threat to our national \nsecurity. If there isn't a threat to our national security, there is no \nreason in the world morally or legally that our troops should be there.\n  So putting up this wall, to me, is symbolic because they can call it \nthe forgotten war. And, believe it or not, after seeing how some of our \nVietnam veterans were treated when they came home, you can almost thank \nGod that no one missed you. They didn't know where you were, or didn't \ncare about the Korean war, because politics got in the way of how we \ntreated those people who fought, got wounded, and died in Vietnam.\n  Of course, since then, we have had dozens of times where we have \nheard Members of Congress say that we have to have more boots on the \nground, that we can't win a war by air, that we have to be there, we \nhave to intervene, and we have to show how strong America is. And they \nknow in their hearts that no one from their families, their \ncommunities, or even anyone they know will be included in that number \nof Americans that they are asking to go.\n  So I think when you put the names of people who have actually lost \ntheir lives, which means destroyed the lives of so many other people \nwho loved them, when you think of those who got wounded, they should at \nleast be able to say what they did for their families, community, and \ntheir country. They shouldn't just be used as pawns on the board to \nfulfill the political commitments of a party or a cause that doesn't \ninvolve the security of the United States. Maybe, just maybe, when \npeople come to sightsee, and they see the names of people that they \ndon't know, it could remind them that these are not just human beings; \nthese are Americans who had the same dreams as they did, except they \nmade a sacrifice.\n  So let me laud and thank the Members of Congress that have caused the \ncasualties of the forgotten war not to be forgotten. Let us try to do \nsomething about those that follow those of us that were in combat in \nKorea and explain how wrong we were in Vietnam and we should have said, \nnever, never, never again.\n  Let us look at the ways we have just sent troops who, like me, saw \nthe flag go up and heard the President say that we have to go, and we \nnever asked, and we couldn't legitimately ask why, but we did. Let us \npreserve the American lives for those causes that at least if they \ndon't come back home or they don't come back normal, that we can say \nthat it was protecting the flag, it was protecting our country, and it \nwas protecting our national security.\n  Right now, with all the fears we have that are going on in the Middle \nEast, I am not certain whether or not that will impact our great \ncountry, but I am prepared to listen to those who know better than I. \nAnd if, indeed, there is a threat to our country, then everyone should \nbe prepared to be called, even by lottery, because it is not just for \nthe wealthy and the educated to be excluded. It shouldn't be just those \nwho need a job that get the opportunity to defend our country. But \nevery time you say ``troops on the ground,'' ``boots on the ground,'' \n``lives on the ground,'' I truly think that just putting their names on \na memorial wall should mean something for generations that follow.\n  I hope and pray that we don't have names that go on boards. But if \nthere is a reminder of how many people died over the years to keep this \ncountry great, let us be in the position as a Congress to say that we \nknow specifically why they died and we gave them all the support that \nthey needed to make the sacrifice.\n  Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important that we remember those who died in the \nwar and those who served in the war because their achievement remains \nalive today. It is personified in a free and prosperous Republic of \nKorea that has been a beacon of hope to the oppressed people throughout \nthe Asian Continent and a steady counterbalance to the malignant \npresence of the North Korean dictatorship.\n  From the dais in this Chamber, Douglas MacArthur paid tribute to \nthese brave souls with these words. He said: ``I have just left your \nfighting sons in Korea. They have met all tests there, and I can report \nto you without reservation that they are splendid in every way .  .  . \nThose gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers \nalways.''\n  And so should they with us. This bill assures that this will not be a \nforgotten war, and our honored dead will not be forgotten by name.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H883]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 812, which is sponsored by our \nrespected colleague from Idaho, Congressman Simpson. This measure \nreforms tribal sovereignty made to America's Indian nations.\n  Specifically, this bill provides new authority to tribal governments \nto manage and develop their trust assets according to their own best \njudgment and the wishes of their own constituencies rather than an \nhistorically inept and often clueless bureaucracy in Washington. These \nnations are either sovereign or they are not, and the essence of \nsovereignty is self-determination.\n  Under this act, participating tribes will have the option of entering \ninto disagreements with the Department of the Interior to take over \nmanagement of the resources within their own jurisdictions. This bill \nalso builds upon other congressional initiatives like the HEARTH Act of \n2012, which deferred to a tribe's own judgment about what is in the \nbest interests for their own lands.\n  This bill has strong bipartisan support both here in the House as \nwell as the U.S. Senate. Additionally, the bill is supported by the \nNational Congress of American Indians, Confederated Tribes of the \nColville Reservation, the Intertribal Timber Council, and the \nAffiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, which include 57 tribal \ngovernments in Oregon, Idaho, Washington, southeast Alaska, northern \nCalifornia, and Montana.\n  I urge passage of the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 812 will take an important step in fulfilling our \nfiduciary responsibility to Indian tribes by modernizing the Indian \ntrust asset management system.\n  The Indian Trust Asset Reform Act will streamline the bureaucratic \nprocess that has often been a hindrance to successful trust management, \nwhile also rightfully giving tribes the options to manage their own \nassets.\n  Through the trust asset demonstration project created in the bill, \ntribes can, at their own election, develop asset management plans with \nthe Secretary of the Interior in order to better manage and develop \ntheir lands and natural resources.\n  As has been shown time and time again, tribal governments are the \nones best suited to make decisions for their own people and their own \ncommunities.\n  Additionally, while the Office of the Special Trustee, or OST, has \nimplemented positive reforms since its creation in 1994, the time has \ncome to transition to a more modern, efficient, and accountable system \nfor the management of Indian trust resources.\n  To that end, H.R. 812 would consolidate the functions of the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs and the OST into one office within the Department of \nthe Interior, headed by a new undersecretary of Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. Speaker, we fully support H.R. 812, and I urge its swift \nadoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), the author of \nthis measure and an indefatigable fighter for the Indian nations of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the full committee \nchairman, Mr. Bishop; the ranking member, Mr. Grijalva; the \nsubcommittee chairman, Mr. McClintock, and the ranking member, Ms. \nTsongas, for considering this bill.\n  The relationship between Native Americans and the United States \nGovernment is complicated, not well understood, and filled with \ninconsistencies. Today Indian Country faces a number of serious \nchallenges, ranging from addressing abject poverty to trying to promote \neconomic development in the face of inefficient bureaucracy.\n  The Federal Government has a trust responsibility to meet its \ncommitments to Indian Country. Yet in many cases, Federal agencies \nhinder, rather than help, tribes provide for their members. This is \nillustrated by the settlement of the Cobell litigation and the scores \nof tribal trust lawsuits over the past few years, which have cost \ntaxpayers more than $5.5 billion.\n  A number of tribes, including many in the Northwest, have been \nworking to address some of the challenges that they face in managing \ntribal trust assets. Many tribes are capable of effectively and \nefficiently managing their own assets--and often are better equipped to \ndo so than the agencies currently responsible for that management. Yet, \nin order to have a say in how these assets are managed, they must swim \nupstream against a muddled Federal bureaucracy.\n  This is why I introduced H.R. 812, the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act. \nThis legislation had its origins with the tribes themselves, which is \nwhere Congress should always start when it takes up issues affecting \nIndian Country. H.R. 812 was developed and has been endorsed by the \nAffiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians, the United South & Eastern Tribes, the Intertribal \nTimber Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  H.R. 812 will do several things to modernize the Federal Government's \nrole in managing Indian trust property. First, it would establish a \nvoluntary demonstration project to give Indian tribes more control over \nthe management of their trust assets. This will provide Indian tribes \nwith new flexibility to direct management of these assets under tribal \nstandards rather than Federal standards that are often outdated and \ninefficient.\n  As part of the negotiated demonstration project, Indian tribes would \nbe able to conduct forest management activities on their own tribal \nlands through a process similar to the HEARTH Act of 2012, which the \nadministration has strongly supported and has proven successful in \npromoting tribal self-determination and self-governance.\n  H.R. 812 would also authorize the Indian tribes and Indian \nbeneficiaries, on a voluntary basis, to obtain appraisals of their \ntrust property without having to wait for the Department of the \nInterior to approve them. This new authority would provide relief to \nall in Indian Country who currently endure lengthy delays in selling or \nleasing their trust land while they wait for the Department to review \nand approve appraisals.\n  Finally, the bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \nconsult with Indian Country and provide certain information to Congress \nabout the Office of the Special Trustee. OST was originally intended as \na temporary entity to oversee certain financial reforms of Indian trust \nfunds at the Department of the Interior. More than 20 years later, OST \nhas significant involvement in the day-to-day transactions. Tribes have \nlong complained about the miscommunications, delays, and inefficiencies \nthat result from trying to navigate the processes of both OST and the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. The information the bill requires the \nSecretary to provide will assist Congress in determining the future of \nOST.\n  It is worth noting that this bill has undergone a number of changes \nsince introduction. The bill has been revised to incorporate input not \nonly from the committees of jurisdiction in both Chambers, but also \nfrom the Department of the Interior, the Department of Justice, tribal \norganizations, and individual Indian tribes.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has found that H.R. 812 would not \naffect the Federal Government's overall costs.\n  I would also point out that H.R. 812 is a voluntary program intended \nto provide tribes with new flexibility to promote economic development. \nWhere tribes are not willing or able to take on these responsibilities, \nthey will not have to.\n  H.R. 812 is just one aspect in a larger conversation on improving the \nmanagement of tribal trust assets. If enacted into law, this bill would \nbe an important step in providing tribes with the autonomy they need to \nmanage their assets and spur economic growth in their communities.\n  I want to thank Chairman McClintock and his committee, and Chairmen \nBishop and Young and their staffs for their work on this bill. They \nhave held two hearings and graciously taken input from tribes and the \nadministration, which is why we are here today with this legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Finally, I want to thank the tribes that have offered their expertise \nin the crafting of this bill. Just like the intentions of the \nunderlying bill, Indian\n\n[[Page H884]]\n\nCountry deserves to be in the driver's seat when making decisions about \ntheir own future.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. \n812, the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act, and I commend it to you for \nyour positive consideration.\n  When you stop and think about it, this word ``trust'' actually has \ntwo pretty distinct meanings. It can be the belief that someone or \nsomething is honest, trustworthy, the belief that you can take them at \ntheir word.\n  On the other hand, ``trust'' can also be a financial or a property \narrangement. A trust is legally held or managed by someone else. It \ncould be for your kids or your grandkids or any beneficiary.\n  But the irony is a trust in the property management sense is that \nthat often arises out of a lack of trust, as in honesty, when it comes \nto the person or source receiving the money. It is not a check handed \nover. It is a financial arrangement with conditions or requirements.\n  When it comes to Indian Country, they have plenty of historical \nreasons to lack trust when it comes to the Federal Government; but, the \nFederal Government does not have reasons to not trust Indian Country's \nability to manage their own resources, and natural resources are what \nhave always been the most important asset in Indian Country.\n  The Indian Trust Asset Reform Act is based on the simple notion that \nIndian Country prospers when tribes have the opportunity to make their \nown decisions and chart their own paths. This is what self-\ndetermination looks like. This is what sovereignty looks like.\n  Many tribes, particularly those in my home State of Washington, are \namong the largest employers and natural resource managers in the entire \nregion. Tribes in the Pacific Northwest have an abundance of trust \nresources on their land, from timber to rangeland, to fishery \nresources.\n  These tribes count on the ability to make decisions quickly to adjust \nto changing circumstances and to maintain vibrant communities for their \nmembers and the region as a whole.\n  H.R. 812 advances this idea by giving tribes new authority to propose \nand enter into management plans with the Department of Interior, plans \nthat put the tribes in the driver's seat.\n  H.R. 812 also returns more control to tribal members, who are often \nfrustrated by, as has been noted earlier, years-long delays that they \nmust go through in obtaining Federal approval to sell or lease or \notherwise manage their trust lands.\n  H.R. 812 would give individuals and tribes a new option to complete \nthese transactions without having to wait for the Department of \nInterior to go through all that lengthy review and approval process.\n  Accordingly, it will save time, it will save money, but, most \nimportantly, it will allow the tribes to make their own decisions about \nhow to use their historic lands.\n  When we find commonsense fixes like this, we restore some of the \ntrust, in the first meaning of the word, and build upon the trust that \nis already there.\n  Twenty-seven years ago, if I may make a personal note, I had the \nprivilege to join the office of Governor Booth Gardner in a role that \nwould quickly become chief of staff. Fairly shortly, we signed off on a \ndocument known as the Centennial Accord. My good friend and colleague \nfrom Washington State will recall it well.\n  Basically, it was the first memorialization in the history of the \nUnited States that recognized the government-to-government relationship \nbetween the tribes and the State of Washington.\n  I have said regularly since, in an intermittent public service career \nextending back 40-some years, I have no higher point of pride than the \nsmall role I played in that, lo, those many years ago.\n  Accordingly, I would like to thank Congressman Simpson very much for \nhis leadership on this bill and for allowing me the privilege to be the \nDemocratic lead cosponsor.\n  I would like to add my expression of gratitude to Chairman McClintock \nand the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) as well as our \nranking member, all those involved.\n  I would like to thank the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians and \nits Trust Reform Committee. Let it not go unsaid that there was a \ndecade of work leading up to today, a decade of work.\n  ``Sovereignty'' means sovereignty. ``Government-to-government'' means \njust exactly that. The fact of the matter is we have a moral and a \nlegal and sometimes a treaty obligation to fulfill that government-to-\ngovernment relationship. It is the right thing to do.\n  It is in that spirit that I submit H.R. 812 for your favorable \nconsideration.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my colleague on the \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman from California (Mr. \nMcClintock) for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, last summer more than 400,000 acres of tribal land in \nthe Northwest burned with the Colville and the Yakama Tribes, which are \nin my district, enduring the worst fire season in a generation.\n  The Colville Indian Reservation alone saw 250,000 acres burned, \nconsumed, by that blaze, much of which consisted of commercial timber.\n  The Indian Trust Asset Reform Act, H.R. 812, will authorize Indian \ntribes on a voluntary basis to carry out forest management activities \non their own tribal lands without requiring review and approval by the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. It will allow the Colville, the Yakama, and \nother tribes across the West to move salvage log sales more quickly \nthan is possible under the current BIA process.\n  Providing tribes who maintain their timber resources with the \nauthority to make these management decisions will expedite on-the-\nground activity and open new doors to attract investment. In fact, I \nwould argue that we should also give more control to States and \nlocalities in addition to these tribes.\n  The new authority derived in H.R. 812 will provide additional \nbenefits to tribes with timber resources. The Colville Tribe has been \nattempting to reopen a sawmill in Omak, Washington, also in my \ndistrict, since 2009.\n  One of the primary impediments to reopening has been the BIA's \nunwillingness to approve longer term agreements between the tribe and \nthird-party investors. This new authority in this bill will allow \ntribes to enter into these type of agreements on their own, resulting \nin the creation of additional jobs as well as economic activity.\n  Last September, while catastrophic wildfires continued to burn across \ncentral Washington, Secretary Jewell visited the Colville Reservation \nand saw the devastation firsthand. Mr. Speaker, before the next fire \nseason begins, significant resources will be needed to replant these \nforests as well as rehabilitate these landscapes.\n  The administration has not done enough to provide these tribes with \nthe resources they need. We must correct that. We must make this change \nin order to ensure that these forests can continue to be a viable and \nproductive resource for the tribes and communities in my district, my \nState, and the rest of the country.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 812, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H884-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H884-H886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nKENNESAW MOUNTAIN NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD PARK BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT ACT OF \n                                  2015\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kennesaw Mountain National \n     Battlefield Park Boundary Adjustment Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park was \n     authorized as a unit of the National Park System on June 26, \n     1935. Prior to 1935, parts of the park had been acquired and \n     protected by Civil War veterans and the War Department.\n       (2) Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park protects \n     Kennesaw Mountain and Kolb's Farm, which are battle sites \n     along the route of General Sherman's 1864 campaign to take \n     Atlanta.\n       (3) Most of the park protects Confederate positions and \n     strategy. The Wallis House is one of the few original \n     structures remaining from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain \n     associated with Union positions and strategy.\n       (4) The Wallis House is strategically located next to a \n     Union signal station at Harriston Hill.\n\n     SEC. 3. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT; LAND ACQUISITION; \n                   ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) Boundary Adjustment.--The boundary of the Kennesaw \n     Mountain National Battlefield Park is modified to include the \n     approximately 8 acres identified as ``Wallis House and \n     Harriston Hill'', and generally depicted on the map titled \n     ``Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, Proposed \n     Boundary Adjustment'', numbered 325/80,020, and dated \n     February 2010.\n       (b) Map.--The map referred to in subsection (a) shall be on \n     file and available for inspection in the appropriate offices \n     of the National Park Service.\n       (c) Land Acquisition.--The Secretary of the Interior is \n     authorized to acquire, from willing owners only, land or \n     interests in land described in subsection (a) by donation or \n     exchange.\n       (d) Administration of Acquired Lands.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior shall administer land and interests in land acquired \n     under this section as part of the Kennesaw Mountain National \n     Battlefield Park in accordance with applicable laws and \n     regulations.\n       (e) Written Consent of Owner.--No non-Federal property may \n     be included in the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield \n     Park without the written consent of the owner. This provision \n     shall apply only to those portions of the Park added under \n     subsection (a).\n       (f) No Use of Condemnation.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     may not acquire by condemnation any land or interests in land \n     under this Act or for the purposes of this Act.\n       (g) No Buffer Zone Created.--Nothing in this Act, the \n     establishment of the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield \n     Park, or the management plan for the Kennesaw Mountain \n     National Battlefield Park shall be construed to create buffer \n     zones outside of the Park. That activities or uses can be \n     seen, heard, or detected from areas within the Kennesaw \n     Mountain National Battlefield Park shall not preclude, limit, \n     control, regulate or determine the conduct or management of \n     activities or uses outside the Park.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) and the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. \nTsongas) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 3371, introduced by our colleague Barry Loudermilk, expands the \nboundary of the Kennesaw National Battlefield Park.\n  It also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \napproximately 8 acres of land only by donation or exchange from willing \nsellers. The expanded area includes the historic Wallis House and \nHarriston Hill.\n  Wallis House is one of the few remaining structures associated with \nthe Kennesaw Mountain Civil War battle, while Harriston Hill was \nstrategically significant as the Union signal station.\n  The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in June of 1864 was critical to the \nUnion campaign to split the Confederacy, and although it was a tactical \nvictory for the Confederate, it opened the way for the Union's \nstrategic victory of taking Atlanta.\n  The sacrifices of more than 3,000 Union troops on Kennesaw Mountain \nmade possible Sherman's famous telegram to Lincoln 3 months later that \n``Atlanta is ours, and fairly won.''\n  These battlefields remind succeeding generations of Americans of the \nprice paid by so many for the preservation of our Constitution and the \nliberty it protects and the enormous responsibility that each of us has \nto maintain and defend that same Constitution today.\n  I urge passage of the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This bill adjusts the boundary of the Kennesaw Mountain National \nBattlefield Park in Georgia to include two historically significant \nstructures, the Wallace House and Kolb's Farm, and to assist in the \npreservation of the story of the Atlanta Campaign.\n  Between June 19 and July 2, 1864, a series of battles occurred here \nbetween Union and Confederate forces. The loss of Kennesaw Mountain \nremoved one of the last major geographic obstacles protecting Atlanta, \nwhich eventually fell to the Union Army in September of 1864.\n  The bill will allow for the donation of approximately 8 acres to \nKennesaw National Battlefield Park, a unit of the National Park \nService.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Georgia, Representative Barry \nLoudermilk, for continuing to support the preservation of the history \nof this great country.\n  The Civil War was a significant event in the history of this country \nand remains relevant as we grapple with civil rights discussions today.\n  The preservation of these sites reinforces Congress' dedication to \nequality and enables the National Park Service to interpret and tell \nour national story.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), the author of this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 3371, a bill that \nwill add valuable historical property to the Kennesaw Mountain National \nBattlefield Park.\n  This park, which is located in Georgia's 11th Congressional District, \nis a site of significant battles that took place during America's \nbloodiest conflict, the Civil War.\n  Our Nation has long recognized the importance of preserving \nhistorical sites, especially those battlefields where Americans fought \nand died for freedom. Sites such as Kennesaw Mountain National \nBattlefield Park allow us to look back in time and get a glimpse of \nevents that help shaped our Nation.\n  It is extremely important that we understand our history; otherwise, \nwe will be destined to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n  A recent study of American history education revealed that, while 98 \npercent of college students could identify that Snoop Doggy Dogg was a \nrapper, only 23 percent of college seniors could identify that James \nMadison was the father of the Constitution.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it is now more important than ever that the generations \nfollowing us have access to these historic sites and to the educational \nopportunities they provide, or we risk losing touch with our history. \nIt is extremely important to restore the comprehensive study of \nAmerican history in our schools. However, it is equally important to \npreserve the places at which significant events in our history took \nplace.\n  This bill that I have sponsored will simply allow Kennesaw Mountain \nNational Battlefield Park to acquire two pieces of property that will \nadd to the historic and educational value of this battlefield.\n  One of the properties this bill will preserve is a home that was \nbuilt in 1853 by Mr. Josiah Wallis. Mr. Wallis built this home for his \nfamily, but it was eventually used as a hospital by the Confederate \nArmy during the Civil War.\n  In 1864, the Wallis House fell into the hands of General William \nSherman of the Union Army during his campaign to take Atlanta. The \nhouse served as\n\n[[Page H886]]\n\nSherman's headquarters during the Battle of Kolb's Farm, which was a \nresounding victory for the Union Army; but the victory was not without \ncost. When the smoke cleared, over 350 Union soldiers and over 1,000 \nConfederate soldiers lay dead.\n  Five days later, Union General Oliver Howard used the Wallis House as \nhis headquarters and communications center during the Battle of \nKennesaw Mountain, one of the bloodiest 1-day battles of the entire \nwar. This was also the last major battle before Atlanta fell to Union \nforces. While the assault by General Sherman was a tactical failure in \nits costing the lives of 3,000 of his men, the battle also inflicted \nheavy losses on the Confederates. After losing another 1,000 men, the \nConfederate Army could not stop General Sherman on his march to \nAtlanta.\n  Adjacent to the Wallis House are 8 acres of land, known as Harriston \nHill. This property offers a sweeping view of the valley leading to the \nConfederate line on top of Kennesaw Mountain, and it was used by the \nUnion as a signaling position during the battle. This location is \nessential for park visitors to understand the strategic positions taken \nby the Union and Confederate Armies during the battle.\n  In addition to being critical sites in Civil War history, the Wallis \nHouse and Harriston Hill are two of the few original locations \nremaining from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain that are associated with \nthe Union Army. Most of the park's current attractions correspond with \nConfederate history, so these additions will prove to be major \nhistorical acquisitions that will enhance the value of the park and \nprovide insight into the Union's side of the story.\n  In 2002, the Cobb County Government purchased the Wallis House and \nHarriston Hill in order to prevent the house from being demolished. \nSince then, the county has been seeking to transfer the property to the \npark. My bill simply modifies the boundary of Kennesaw Mountain \nNational Battlefield Park to include the house and the hill, and it \nauthorizes the park to acquire the property by donation. Along with the \nCobb County Government, this bill is supported by the National Park \nService, by Kennesaw Mountain Park, and by several park volunteer \norganizations and historical societies in my district.\n  This legislation is an essential step toward preserving our Nation's \nheritage, and it is a valuable part of Civil War history. The Wallis \nHouse and Harriston Hill will provide tremendous educational and \nhistorical value to Kennesaw Mountain Park; and it is my hope that the \npark will quickly acquire this property and will restore it to its \noriginal condition for visitors to enjoy for generations to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 3620) to amend the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation \nArea Improvement Act to provide access to certain vehicles serving \nresidents of municipalities adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National \nRecreation Area, and for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. VEHICULAR ACCESS AND FEES.\n\n       Section 4 of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation \n     Area Improvement Act (Public Law 109-156) is amended to read \n     as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 4.

The program shall include an annual fee \n     not to exceed $200 per vehicle. All fees received under the \n     program shall be set aside in a special account and be \n     available, without further appropriation, to the Secretary \n     for the administration and enforcement of the program, \n     including registering vehicles, issuing permits and vehicle \n     identification stickers, and personnel costs.\n       ``(d) Exceptions.--The following vehicles may use Highway \n     209 and shall not be subject to a fee or permit requirement \n     under subsection (c):\n       ``(1) Local school buses.\n       ``(2) Fire, ambulance, and other safety and emergency \n     vehicles.\n       ``(3) Commercial vehicles using Federal Road Route 209, \n     from--\n       ``(A) Milford to the Delaware River Bridge leading to U.S. \n     Route 206 in New Jersey; and\n       ``(B) mile 0 of Federal Road Route 209 to Pennsylvania \n     State Route 2001.''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 3620, introduced by Congressman Tom Marino, amends the Delaware \nWater Gap National Recreation Area Improvement Act to allow a road in \nthe recreation area to continue to be used by commercial vehicles that \nserve the local communities adjoining this federally designated land. \nIt is entirely in keeping with one of our principal objectives for \nFederal land use policy: to restore the Federal Government as a good \nneighbor to the communities impacted by the Federal lands.\n  Before the Federal Government took control of 70,000 acres of land \nadjacent to the Delaware River in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, highway \n209 served as a major trucking route for commerce. Legislation that \ncreated the recreation area and implemented it sought to prohibit \ncommercial vehicles from using this public highway, promising to \nestablish alternate routes. Yet, despite three extensions of the \ndeadline, local residents and businesses in the communities of Delaware \nTownship, Dingman Township, Lehman Township, Metamoras Borough, Middle \nSmithfield Township, Milford Borough, Milford Township, Smithfield \nTownship, and Westfall Township in Pennsylvania are directly threatened \nby the impending limitation.\n  H.R. 3620 would protect the people of these communities from this \nunnecessary disruption and inconvenience by\n\n[[Page H887]]\n\nallowing commercial vehicles serving these communities to continue to \nuse this long-established highway. Specifically, it directs the \nDepartment of the Interior to establish a fee and permit program for \ncommercial vehicles serving these communities.\n  This bill enjoys broad support in the affected communities, and \nCongressman Marino should be commended for his efforts to resolve this \nvexing issue for his constituents.\n  I urge the passage of the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This bill amends the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area \nImprovement Act to extend the authorization of a waiver for certain \ncommercial traffic on U.S. Route 209, a federally owned highway that \nruns through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.\n  When Congress decided to restrict commercial traffic on the portion \nof the highway that runs through the recreation area, the law included \nan exemption for certain vehicles that belong to nearby businesses and \nmunicipal governments. This bill provides a 5-year extension of that \nexemption in order to facilitate continued access for local residents.\n  It is supported by the National Park Service, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe author of this measure, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nMarino).\n  Mr. MARINO. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill to reauthorize commercial \ntraffic along Route 209 through the Delaware Water Gap National \nRecreation Area.\n  For nearly 5 months now, uncertainty has reigned over this 21-mile \nstretch of road that is running through my district. Over 30 years ago, \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania--as the chairman so eloquently \nstated--transferred Route 209, then a State road, to the National Park \nService.\n  As commercial thru traffic is banned on roads within our national \nparks, it would also be so on this stretch of Route 209; but, at that \ntime, a 10-year exemption was made to support the local freight \ntransportation industry and because acceptable alternative routes were \nunavailable. After multiple extensions, the most recent commercial \nvehicle authorization expired at the end of September of 2015.\n  To address the problem, county and township officials from the \nsurrounding areas met with the National Park Service and my staff to \nnegotiate a new plan. They recognized the continued need to allow some \ncommercial vehicle access, and they settled on the carefully crafted \nlanguage we are considering today.\n  The work to produce this extension acknowledges the continued need of \nemployers, businesses, and homeowners I represent in Pike and Monroe \nCounties. The expiration in September cast a cloud on the local \nbusiness community and put countless jobs in jeopardy. Passing this \nbill so that it can be swiftly considered by the Senate is imperative \nas the weather warms and business activity increases through the \nregion.\n  I thank Chairman Bishop for his support and assistance in bringing \nthis bill to the floor as quickly as possible. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous materials on the subject of this \nSpecial Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Nebraska?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I had the extraordinary privilege of \nbeing in the room when Pope Francis was given a small cross, a \ncrucifix. This crucifix belonged to a young Syrian man who had been \ncaptured by the jihadis and then given a choice--convert or die--and he \nchose. He chose his ancient faith tradition.\n  He chose Christ.\n  And he was beheaded.\n  His mother was able to recover his body and the crucifix that he wore \nand bury him, and then she subsequently made her way to Austria by \nwhich this cross came into the possession of the Holy Father.\n  This type of incident--the killings, the beheadings, the \ncrucifixions, the immolations--occurs day, after day, after day to the \nbeleaguered religious minorities of the Middle East--the Christians, \nthe Yazidis, and others--who have ancient faith traditions, who have \nevery right to be in their ancient homelands as does anyone else.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  This is a genocide. This is a deliberate attempt to exterminate an \nentire set of peoples based upon their faith.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the year 2004, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell \ncame to the United States Congress and in a committee hearing--the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee--he declared what was happening in \nDarfur in Sudan a genocide. In making that simple declaration, using \nthat powerful word, he helped put an end to that grim reality.\n  Thankfully, what is happening now that should give the beleaguered \ncommunities of the Middle East some hope is that there is an \ninternational coalition developing that has recognized the fact that \nthis is a genocide being committed.\n  Nearly 200 Members of the United States Congress, this body, have \nsigned on and are cosponsoring a resolution that declares this a \ngenocide. The International Association of Genocide Scholars has stated \nit as such.\n  Others, including the Yazidi community, the United States Catholic \nbishops, Pope Francis himself, Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio, both \nPresidential candidates, have declared this to be a genocide.\n  Genocide is a powerful word. It evokes special meaning. It creates \nthe conditions for when there hopefully is inevitably and perhaps \nmiraculously\n\n[[Page H888]]\n\nsome proper settlement in the Middle East--security arrangements, \npolitical, economic, and cultural settlement--that the religious \nminorities of that area who once made up the rich tapestry of that \nregion will have their rightful place restored and reintegrated back \ninto those communities.\n  This would give hope again to persecuted peoples. It provides a \ngateway for the discussion of further policy recommendations, for \ninstance, that could place people who are being forced to flee under \nthe threat of genocide in proximity to where their ancient homeland is \nso that, once stability is restored, they can return and reclaim what \nis rightfully theirs.\n  A little while back when the Yazidi community, primarily women and \nchildren, were trapped on Mount Sinjar, President Obama, to his credit, \nacted quickly.\n  The House of Representatives had passed a resolution calling for \nadditional humanitarian assistance, and the President, with great \ndeliberateness, decided to save their lives. I want to personally state \nthat I am grateful for that.\n  I represent the largest Yazidi refugee community in America. This is \nan ancient faith tradition that usually enjoyed a quiet and peaceable \nlife in areas of Iraq and who began to come under increasing pressure \nduring the Iraq war and now are, of course, subjected to ISIL's attempt \nto exterminate them. They were saved by quick action.\n  So in an exchange with Secretary Kerry today, I commended the \nadministration for that quick action to save the Yazidis and I asked \nthe administration to actively consider and call this what it is, a \ngenocide.\n  When we do so, again we create the conditions not only for which the \ninternational consciousness on this problem will be raised and other \ninternational organizations, including the European Union Parliament \nwho have spoken to it. Other parliaments around the world have also \ndeclared this a genocide.\n  However, in our complicated times, we rush from urgency to urgency. \nIt is difficult to keep the mind focused because the horrors that \ncontinue to come at us are so extreme we almost get numb to it all. \nYet, we have to act. In doing so, we can save lives.\n  We can reposition and potentially preserve the remnant of the rich \ntapestry of minority voices that are critical to stability in the \nMiddle East and are critical to saving civilization itself and stopping \nthis grievous assault on human dignity.\n  That is why I urged the Secretary to make the declaration of \ngenocide. It was a thoughtful exchange, but we will continue to do so.\n  I am so grateful to so many of my colleagues who, again, have signed \nonto this resolution that calls it such, a genocide against the \nChristian Yazidis and others.\n  I am also grateful to have some colleagues here, including my good \nfriend, Congressman Dan Lipinski of Illinois, who has tirelessly spoken \nto the issue of human rights and stood for life, stood for stability, \nstood for justice on the whole spectrum of issues that are facing \nhumanity now.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) so that he may \ngive us his consideration on this essential topic.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I only have a few minutes this afternoon. \nNo matter how busy things get, there has to be time to come here to \nstand up for basic human rights.\n  I thank Congressman Fortenberry and, also, Congresswoman Eshoo for \norganizing today's Special Order and for all the work that they have \ndone to speak out on this issue of protecting all of those minority \ngroups who are under threat, so many murdered, driven from their homes.\n  It is very important that we focus the eyes of Congress and the \nNation on this humanitarian tragedy that is happening in Syria and \nIraq. I think it is very important. It is really past time, as far as I \nam concerned, but it is never too late.\n  We need to stand up and pass H. Con. Res. 75 for this Congress to \ndeclare that there is a genocide that is going on. The genocide is \nagainst not just Yazidis, but also Christians, Turkmen, and other \ngroups in Syria and Iraq and in the region.\n  Since 2013, when ISIL began their murderous march through Syria and \nnorthern Iraq, the world has witnessed the targeted killing of all of \nthese groups that I have mentioned. As I said, we should have done this \na while ago. The United States should have stood up and declared this a \ngenocide.\n  Now, it seems there are reports, at least, that the United States may \nbe declaring that there is a genocide of the Yazidis. While certainly \nno one is going to downplay that, as my colleague mentioned, we all \nremember what happened with the Yazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar and the \nquick intervention that helped to save so many lives and the continued \ngenocide going on against the Yazidis.\n  We don't want to downplay that in any way, but I think it is \nimportant that we recognize it is not just the Yazidis who are \nsuffering from genocide.\n  In fact, the State Department's report on International Religious \nFreedom for 2014 acknowledged that ISIL was systematically targeting \nreligious minorities it considered heretical and that their abuses \ndisproportionately affected religious minorities, with between 100,000 \nand 200,000 Christians and an estimated 300,000 Yazidis displaced in \nIraq.\n  Now, these numbers have only gotten greater since that time. In \nSyria, that same report states that ISIL has executed Christians, \nkidnapped priests, and forced tens of thousands to flee across the \ndesert or face ISIL's genocidal campaign.\n  Leaders across the world, including the European Union Parliament and \nPope Francis, have recognized that genocide is being committed by ISIL \nagainst many ethno-religious groups, and the United States must join \nthem in condemning these crimes as a genocide.\n\n  Here in Congress, we remain in a critical position to promote \nreligious freedom and ensure that it remains a priority in our foreign \npolicy.\n  That is why I was an original cosponsor of Congressman Fortenberry \nand Congresswoman Eshoo's H. Con. Res. 75, which expresses that \nCongress views the attacks on Christians and other ethnic and religious \nminorities as war crimes, crimes against humanity, and, yes, genocide. \nWe must not wait or be apprehensive about speaking the truth.\n  The administration and Congress must prioritize religious freedom and \nprotect all minorities in the Middle East from the ongoing genocide. It \nshould begin here in Congress by passing H. Con. Res. 75. I certainly \nwant to ask all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nresolution.\n  Again, we continue to see the horrible crimes being committed in \nSyria and Iraq. We are not here today to say that there are easy \nsolutions, that any of this is easy to solve.\n  We have to not look away, but we need to look at what is going on in \nSyria and Iraq and call it for what it is, a genocide. It is a genocide \nagainst a number of groups, including Christians there in Syria and \nIraq.\n  By Congress standing up, it means something. The world takes notice \nwhen it happens. We must do more. It is our duty to do more to protect \nthese people, starting out with this declaration of genocide.\n  I want to again thank Congressman Fortenberry for all the work he is \ndoing on this issue and many other human rights issues, standing up for \nlife itself, which is something critically important that we all must \ndo here.\n  I thank Congressman Fortenberry for organizing this Special Order and \nfor all of his work on this issue.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lipinski as well \nfor his tireless commitment to justice, to human dignity, to human \nflourishing.\n  Really, ultimately, that is what this resolution is intended to do, \nto call it what it is, a genocide, in order that there might be the \nproper settlement, when we finally come to the day when there is a \nproper security arrangement in the Middle East, when there is a \nreintegration of the religious minorities who, again, made up the rich \ndiversity of the Middle East in a prior time who are critical to the \nongoing stability of Iraq and Syria and other places.\n  I am grateful as well that the gentleman pointed out the \nextraordinary work of our colleague, Congresswoman\n\n[[Page H889]]\n\nAnna Eshoo, a Democrat from California. I am a Republican.\n  We have other Republicans here who will speak in a time when Congress \nseems so divided on every issue--again, we have 200 of our colleagues--\nin a transpartisan initiative to say that this is unjust, this must be \nstopped.\n  By our actions of calling it a genocide, we not only elevate \ninternational consciousness, but again we create the conditions for the \nproper redress once we come to some proper settlement in the Middle \nEast.\n  I am so grateful for the gentleman's time and efforts on this behalf \nand for his leadership in Congress. I thank the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Lipinski.)\n  Let me turn to my good friend as well, Congressman Jody B. Hice, a \nnew Member of Congress from Georgia, who has shown initiative, \nentrepreneurial endeavor, integrating quickly as an impact player, if \nyou will, in the proceedings here in Congress. I am grateful for his \nwillingness to speak on this topic, but, more than that, grateful for \nour growing friendship.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nEshoo) for bringing attention to this incredibly important issue and \nthe absolute carnage that is occurring in the Middle East against \nChristians, Yazidis, and people of other religious faiths and \nminorities.\n  You know, the right to practice a chosen religion is a right that I--\nand I believe all of us--believe should be universal. Yet, the \nreligious persecution, especially by such violent means that is \noccurring now, is absolutely deplorable.\n  ISIS has shown its true nature in the treatment of these religious \nminorities. We have all witnessed in recent months the violent \nexpansion of ISIS in the Middle East as they have single-mindedly \npersecuted those who adhere to different faiths.\n  In fact, those who refuse to convert have been driven from their \nhomes, brutally tortured, crucified, raped, murdered, enslaved, and not \nby just few in number. We are talking thousands that fall under this \nhorrific scenario.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  The systematic violence of ISIS toward communities of Yazidis, \nChristians, Kurds, Turkmen, whatever it may be, as you have well \nmentioned, goes far beyond war crimes. We are talking absolute \ngenocide.\n  In looking at all this, it was interesting to me that, when the world \ncame together after the atrocities of the Second World War in an effort \nto define genocide, they actually defined it as an actor committing \ncertain acts against a designated group with an intent to destroy the \ngroup in whole or in part.\n  ISIS has. They absolutely have the intent to destroy, in whole, \nChristians, Yazidis, and all religious groups throughout the Middle \nEast. In fact, their entire propaganda even brags about the abhorrent \ncrimes that they are committing, and they show absolutely no signs of \nwillingness to stop these atrocities.\n  It is clear to me that we have an obligation--not only a moral one, \nbut a legal obligation--to prevent these atrocities from occurring. In \nfact, 3 weeks from now this administration must fulfill its own legal \nobligation to make a determination on whether it will name ISIS' crimes \nas acts of genocide or not.\n  The time has come. In fact, the time is long past for our Nation and \nour world to officially recognize these crimes by ISIS for what they \ntruly are and to commit fully to defeating ISIS. We simply cannot \nignore this any longer, and we must bring H. Con. Res. 75 to the House \nfloor as soon as possible.\n  Again, I thank you for yielding this time and thank you for your \nleadership in this regard.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his \nthoughtful commentary and leadership as well on this essential issue. \nIn fact, it is not an issue at all. This is an assault on all humanity. \nThis is a threat to civilization itself.\n  If a group of people can succeed in exterminating another group \nbecause they have the power to do so, because they do not believe in \nanother's religion, they violate that sacred space that is essential to \nall persons and, therefore, the conditions of liberty that are \nnecessary for human flourishing.\n  This goes beyond the grotesque tragedy in the Middle East. It is a \ncall to the entire responsible community of nations to act, to say that \nwe will not allow eighth-century barbarism that happens to have 21st-\ncentury weaponry to rule in a land, destroy, kill, maim, and \nexterminate entire groups of people because of their religious \ntradition. It is wrong. It is unjust. If not addressed, all of \ncivilization is at threat. That is the core of the problem here.\n  I thank you so much for your willingness to spend a little bit of \ntime and your leadership on these critical points. Thank you so much.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, it is H. Con. Res. 75, House Concurrent \nResolution 75. It has been introduced here in the House, and there is a \nsimilar resolution in the Senate. It will be forthcoming in the coming \nweeks. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs will be considering this \nresolution soon.\n  I am hopeful that, again, with my colleague, the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Eshoo), and others, who have shown just extraordinary \nleadership and deep concern and compassion for those who are in need, \nwe can continue to build the numbers and make the case to all of our \ncolleagues and our government that it is time to call this genocide \nand, by declaring such, again setting the conditions that will be \nnecessary to reintegrate people, those who have survived, back into \ntheir ancient lands for which they have a rightful claim.\n  I heard a story recently from a commander who had been in Mosul \nduring the height of the Iraq war. Part of their obligation and \nresponsibility was to protect the various religious minorities who were \nthere. He talked about seeing the very beautiful Christian church that \nwas there.\n  All the Christians are gone from Mosul. The remaining ones had the \nArabic letter N, Nun, spray-painted on their door in blood red. That is \na symbol for the word Nazarene, which some use as a derogatory term to \nChristians. They were told: Convert, leave, or die. Many had to flee \nwith whatever they had on their back.\n  Of course, we know the horrific stories of those who gave their life \nin fidelity to their faith. This is a systematic attempt to wipe \ncertain peoples off the map. It is not fair. It is unjust. It must be \ncountered with a worldwide response.\n  The designation of genocide is that critical first step, again, \ntoward the possibility of restoring some tranquility of order whenever \nthere is the right type of security and economic and cultural \nsettlement that must come to the Middle East if it has any chance, \nagain, to flourish.\n  We can lead in this regard. We must lead. Other countries around the \nworld have already taken up this banner. As I said earlier, the \nEuropean Parliament has declared it so.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the ability to converse today with my \ncolleagues on this threat, this threat to civilization itself, and our \nneed to act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H889-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Buck (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nillness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/house-section/article/H889-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 2234.
