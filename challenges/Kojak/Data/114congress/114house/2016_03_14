However, Ted's \nlong record of public service began more than 40 years ago, when he was \nelected to the Oakdale City Council in 1974. He spent an impressive 26 \nyears of service as a city council member and mayor.\n  Ted's commitment to Minnesota and his community goes well beyond \nelected office. As a Marine Corps veteran, he was also involved in the \nOakdale Veterans Memorial Committee.\n  Ted Bearth was a beloved member of our community and a dedicated \npublic servant. Despite his declining health, he stayed involved and in \ntouch with county staffers and fellow commissioners. He was known for \nhis strong leadership and ability to forge lasting connections.\n  I wish Ted's family peace during this difficult time and assure them \nthat he will be greatly missed by many Minnesotans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1303-10", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1303-H1304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF NANCY DAVIS REAGAN\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week the American \npeople lost a devoted public servant, Nancy Davis Reagan.\n  As a former staff member of the Reagan administration, I will always \nappreciate the devotion of Nancy Reagan to the American people, \nespecially to her husband ``Ronnie.''\n  Nancy Reagan will always be cherished for how she inspired a Nation \nand showed that goodwill prevailed. She demonstrated that service by \nshowing\n\n[[Page H1304]]\n\nsmall acts could make a world of difference. Nancy's fierce love for \nher husband and her country was her service.\n  A passionate advocate for drug awareness and prevention, Nancy Reagan \nlaunched the ``Just Say No'' program to fight drug and alcohol abuse \namong young people to promote fulfilling lives. She strived to always \nmake a positive impact for our citizens.\n  Mrs. Reagan showed that no act of kindness, no act of love, is too \nsmall to be meaningful. She practiced what she preached, living every \nday to the fullest. In every sense of the word, she was the very model \nof a First Lady, wife, and mother.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  Happy 13th birthday, Addison.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1304-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DINA KIM RECEIVES PRESIDENT'S VOLUNTEER SERVICE AWARD\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncongratulate Dina Kim, a senior at State College Area High School, \nlocated in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, on earning the \nnational President's Volunteer Service Award.\n  This award honors people across the Nation who have volunteered 100 \nhours per year or more in service to their communities. Dina has worked \nfor years as a translator for Compassion Korea and was a former \nvolunteer in Malaysia, helping to teach English to refugee students.\n  Dina started volunteering with Compassion Korea when she was in fifth \ngrade. The organization allows people from around the world to sponsor \na child in need from another country. Dina works to translate letters \nfrom children to their sponsor families in Korean.\n  Dina Kim estimates that she has accumulated 600 hours of volunteer \nservice both in State College, her former home in Texas, and in \nMalaysia.\n  She will graduate this year and plans to attend college, majoring in \nlinguistics. She is an example of the great contributions young people \ncan bring to the communities we serve.

AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL POWER ACT.\n\n       Subsection (d) of section 205 of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 824d(d)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: ``Any absence of action by the Commission that \n     allows a change to take effect under this section, including \n     the Commission allowing the sixty days' notice herein \n     provided to expire without Commission action, shall be \n     treated as an order issued by the Commission accepting such \n     change for purposes of section 313.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As we begin consideration of this legislation, I thank the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) for bringing this matter to the \nattention of our committee.\n  The Federal Power Act sets forth processes to set rates for \nelectricity, including opportunities for the public to protest a rate \nchange filed with FERC. New rates take effect if FERC approves them or \nif FERC fails to issue an order approving or denying the filed rate \nwithin 60 days. The failure to approve or deny a rate may result from \nagency delay or, in some limited cases, from a vote that results in a \ndeadlocked Commission, for example, a 2-2 vote. In such cases, the \nrates become effective by operation of law even when these rates were \nnot approved by a majority of Commissioners.\n  The Federal Power Act provides administrative redress for members of \nthe public to protest Commission rate decisions. However, if these \nrates become effective by operation of law--for example, a deadlock, 2-\n2--the administrative processes are not available to the public because \nFERC did not actually issue an order for the public to protest. The \npublic literally gets shut out.\n  I don't want to speak for the gentleman from Massachusetts, but I \nthink some of his constituents recently experienced this firsthand. As \na result of that and of the hard work of Mr. Kennedy's, of his staff's, \nand of the committee staffs' on both sides of the aisle, this \nlegislation was drafted, and we considered it in committee. We have it \non the floor today, and I would urge all of the Members to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the House for allowing me to discuss the Fair RATES Act, H.R. \n2984, and for bringing it to the floor for a vote.\n  I also thank Chairman Whitfield, Chairman Upton, Ranking Members\n\n[[Page H1305]]\n\nRush and Pallone, as well as the committee staffs on both sides, for \ntheir work with our office to help this bill move forward. In \nparticular, to echo Chairman Whitfield's comments, he has been an \nincredible partner with us as we have tried to move this bill forward, \nand I am truly grateful for his assistance in doing so.\n  Mr. Speaker, every year regulators in New England hold energy \ncapacity auctions to ensure that we have sufficient energy that is \ngenerated to meet consumer demand. Two years ago, during an auction, \nthere was a shortfall that triggered administrative pricing at triple \nthe current capacity payments, skyrocketing from about $1 billion to $3 \nbillion.\n  That rate increase hasn't even reached our constituents yet, and our \nregion already pays the highest energy rates in the continental United \nStates. Next June, a significant portion of their bills will triple due \nto that auction.\n  When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviewed the rate \nincrease, it was down to four commissioners and it deadlocked 2-2. One \nDemocratic Commissioner and one Republican Commissioner raised concerns \nabout whether those rates were just and reasonable for consumers. \nHowever, the rates took effect by operation of law without any action \nfrom FERC; and because there was no official decision by FERC, there \nwas no decision to appeal, holding our constituents voiceless.\n  Another annual auction just took place last month with rates, again, \nthat were three times higher than they are today. Those rates are, \nagain, being reviewed by a shorthanded FERC, which sets up the \npotential for the exact same outcome of consumers, once again, being \nshut out of the process.\n  With bipartisan support and endorsements from the American Public \nPower Association, the New England Public Power Association, the \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association, my bill, the Fair \nRATES Act, would simply ensure that avenues of good governance remain \nopen. It provides that if at any time rate changes take effect by \noperation of law without Commission action, deadlocked or otherwise, \naggrieved parties retain the right to protest those rates through the \nprocess that is outlined by the Federal Power Act.\n  I am the first to admit that this is a complex issue, but my bill is \na simple fix to a complex problem. When we as lawmakers identify a flaw \nin one of our laws, especially one that unduly harms our constituents, \nit is our obligation to act to amend the law.\n  The unpredictability of my region's energy rates means families can't \nsave for the future and local businesses can't grow. The least we can \ndo is to ensure that they will never be held voiceless when their \nelectric bills arrive at the end of each month; so I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to give particular thanks to the committee \nstaffs on both the majority and minority sides, including Patrick \nCurrier, Allison Trexler, Rick Kessler, Caitlin Haberman, and Alexander \nRatner.\n  Finally, I have to acknowledge somebody on my own team, Eric Fins, \nwho knows more about energy rates and capacity markets than he ever \nthought he would, and I am grateful for that. He is now writing a law \nschool essay on the topic.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I do want to thank the \ngentleman from Massachusetts, once again, for bringing this important \nissue before us.\n  We must allow the public to have administrative process relief, and \nthis legislation will do that in those cases when FERC does not \nactually issue an order; so I would urge the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2984.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1305-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1305-H1307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ENERGY EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank Representative Eshoo of California, a member of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee, for her work on this bill.\n  This legislation would require Federal agencies to coordinate with \nthe Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Energy, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to develop an implementation strategy, \nincluding best practices and measurement and verification techniques \nfor the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-\nsaving information technologies. OMB would be required to track and \nreport on each agency's progress.\n  In 2013, the U.S. data centers consumed an estimated 91 billion \nkilowatt-hours of electricity, enough electricity to power all of the \nhouseholds in New York City twice over; and, I might say, they are on \ntrack to reach 140 billion kilowatt-hours by 2020. This amounts to \nroughly 2 percent of all the electricity used in the U.S. each year. \nFederal data centers are responsible for at least 10 percent of all \nU.S. data center energy use.\n  Consequently, this bill seeks to improve the energy efficiency of \nFederal data centers by, in part, requiring the Department of Energy to \nupdate a 2007 report on data center energy efficiency and maintain a \ndata center energy practitioner certification program. DOE also would \nestablish an open data initiative to help share best practices and \nsupport further innovation and develop a metric that measures data \ncenter energy efficiency.\n  So this is a very important bill that focuses on efficiency in these \nFederal data centers, and I would urge all of the Members to support \nthis legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1268, the Energy Efficient Government \nTechnology Act, sponsored by two Energy and Commerce Committee members, \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo) and the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger).\n  H.R. 1268 promotes the use of energy-efficient and energy-saving \ninformation technologies and practices across the Federal Government, \nespecially in data centers.\n  The bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the \nEISA Act, to require Federal agencies to coordinate with OMB, DOE, and \nEPA in developing an implementation strategy for maintenance, purchase, \nand use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies.\n  The legislation highlights specific items that should be considered \nin the strategy and sets performance goals to evaluate agencies' \nefforts. It would also amend EISA to require DOE and EPA to collaborate \nwith stakeholders as they implement the data center efficiency program \nand other measures to improve data center efficiency.\n  This legislation was reported with unanimous consent last month by \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee, and the provisions of H.R. 1268 \npreviously passed committee in 2015 as part of H.R. 8.\n  I commend Ms. Eshoo and Mr. Kinzinger. This is good, bipartisan \nefficiency legislation that deserves all of our support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today in support of my \nlegislation, the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act. I thank \nChairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, and my legislative partner \nCongressman Adam Kinzinger for their strong support of this bill.\n  This bill is all about bringing our federal government's IT and data \ncenters into the 21st century. The federal government is the nation's \nlargest landowner, employer, and energy user and should lead by example \nin this field. By requiring federal agencies to utilize the best \ntechnologies and energy management strategies, this legislation will \nreduce the federal government's energy use, save taxpayer dollars, and \nset the standard for the private sector.\n  Today, the world generates more data in twelve hours than was \ngenerated in all of human history prior to 2003. This data must be \nstored and processed at data centers which are the backbone of the 21st \ncentury economy but can be highly energy inefficient. While we now \nroutinely hear about data centers, this was not the case when I began \nexamining this issue over a decade ago. In those days I had to explain \nto my colleagues what a data center was. Today, most people understand \nthat data centers are a critical part of our national infrastructure \nand are found in nearly every sector of our economy. According to the \nGSA, the federal government alone has\n\n[[Page H1307]]\n\nmore than 2,000 data centers which store everything from Social \nSecurity and tax records to e-books at the Library of Congress.\n  Data centers are critical to our economy and our lives, but they can \nbe extremely inefficient when it comes to energy use. Experts estimate \nthat most data centers could slash their energy use by up to 80 or 90 \npercent by simply implementing existing technologies and best \npractices. Several Silicon Valley companies have taken the lead in \ndeveloping efficient, sustainable data centers, but we can do much more \nacross both the private sector and government.\n  H.R. 1268 will drive energy efficiency improvements across the \ngovernment's IT and data centers by requiring federal agencies to:\n  1. Utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies;\n  2. Formulate specific goals and periodically evaluate their energy \nefficiency; and\n  3. Make data center energy usage statistics public in a way that \nempowers further innovation.\n  Importantly, the bill requires government agencies to formulate \nspecific performance goals and a means to calculate overall cost \nsavings. The Department of Energy estimates that implementation of best \npractices alone could reduce the government's data center energy bill \nby 20 to 40 percent. And the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions \nfound that widespread adoption of energy efficient information \ntechnologies could save the federal government over $5 billion in \nenergy costs through 2020.\n  In 2005, I authored language in the Energy Policy Act which mandated \nan EPA study on the energy use and energy costs of data centers. This \nreport was transmitted to Congress in 2007 and served as a driver of \nboth private and public investment in energy efficiency. Based on \nwidespread agreement across government, industry and academia, the bill \nbefore us today requires an update to this important report. H.R. 1268 \nalso creates a new ``Open Data'' initiative to make federal data center \nenergy usage statistics publicly available in a way that empowers \nfurther innovation.\n  The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act passed the House last \nCongress with 375 votes. It passed the House again in this Congress as \npart of H.R. 8, and it is included in the Senate's comprehensive energy \nbill which is currently being debated. This noncontroversial, \nbipartisan bill has strong support from both industry and energy \nefficiency advocates, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1268, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1307-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1307-H1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FEDERAL POWER ACT AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 4427) to amend section 203 of the Federal Power Act, as \namended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Section 203 of the Federal Power Act establishes requirements for the \nsale, disposition, merger, purchase, and acquisition of certain utility \nassets and facilities. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress \namended section 203 by dividing the section into separate statutory \nsubsections, adding a new subsection granting FERC jurisdiction to \nreview sales of certain generating facilities and increasing the \nminimum monetary threshold from $50,000 to $10 million for three of the \nfour statutory subsections. This monetary threshold serves as a floor \nto ensure that public utilities would only be required to file and FERC \nto review proposed transactions of a minimal material significance.\n  As amended by Congress in 2005, the subsection in section 203 of the \nFederal Power Act that pertains to mergers and consolidations of FERC \njurisdictional facilities did not include an express minimum monetary \nthreshold of $10 million or any other amount. FERC has since \ninterpreted this statutory change as eliminating the de minimis \nexceptions for mergers and consolidations. As a result, mergers and \nconsolidations of any amount, no matter how small, require FERC \napproval.\n  This legislation, H.R. 4427, which was introduced by Mr. Pompeo of \nKansas, remedies this discrepancy by amending section 203 to expressly \ninclude a minimum monetary threshold of $10 million for mergers and \nconsolidations of FERC jurisdictional facilities, thereby mirroring the \nexisting $10 million monetary threshold set forth in the other three \nsubsections of section 203.\n  As explained by the general counsel of FERC, ``adding a $10 million \nde minimus threshold to the `merge and consolidate clause' . . . could \nease the administrative burden on the Commission staff and the \nregulatory burden on industry without a significant negative effect on \nthe Commission's regulatory responsibilities.''\n  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to pass this legislation \nintroduced by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Pompeo).\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4427, legislation by the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Pompeo), which would add a $10 million threshold to trigger \nFERC review of a merger or consolidation under section 203 of the \nFederal Power Act.\n  This is a significant change to current law as established by the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 that essentially did away with the Public \nUtilities Holding Company Act, PUHCA, as it had existed for 70 years, \nin order to reduce the burden on industry.\n  But it also fundamentally altered and strengthened section 203 of the \nFederal Power Act to protect against potential market abuses that might \narise without the protections of PUHCA. With that reasonable compromise \nauthored by then-Chairmen Barton and Domenici, it earned the bipartisan \nsupport of Ranking Members Dingell and Bingaman.\n  Testimony we heard at a recent Energy and Power Subcommittee hearing \nhighlighted that, last year, roughly 20 percent of section 203 \napplications fell beneath the $10 million threshold. That is a \nsignificant number of applications.\n  Furthermore, in multiple conversations with FERC general counsel and \nothers, it became clear that, if the bill were to be enacted in its \noriginal form, FERC would have no way to know if attempts were being \nmade to evade the review threshold by structuring major\n\n[[Page H1308]]\n\nmerger consolidation activity as a series of below-threshold \nconsolidations. FERC has already told us that it has the tools to deal \nwith efforts to evade review through such schemes if it finds out that \nthey are occurring.\n  However, the clear problem was, which FERC acknowledged, that the \nbill, as introduced, would leave the Commission with no standardized \nway to acquire information to even know that these below-threshold \ntransactions were actually occurring. I think we can all agree that \nFERC should not have to rely on trade publications or word of mouth to \nknow that merger consolidation activity is occurring involving \nregulated entities.\n  The easiest way to address this problem is by requiring regulated \nentities engaging in merger or consolidation activity to simply have to \nnotify FERC that a transaction is occurring, and that is exactly what \nthe committee did when it adopted by voice vote an amendment by \nSubcommittee Ranking Member Bobby Rush.\n  The bill, as reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee, requires \nFERC to begin a rulemaking process to develop a short, simple \nnotification process for transactions between $1 million and $10 \nmillion. The bill also includes statutory direction to FERC to minimize \nthe notification burden on industry to the maximum extent possible.\n  What we envisioned is a standard form of a page or less, able to be \ncompleted online, that simply informs FERC that a transaction is \noccurring or has recently occurred, who is involved, what the \nappropriate amount of that transaction is, and a brief description of \nthe transaction. The bill we are considering now also adds language \nrequested by industry, supported by both the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee, which provides further certainty by setting a \nreporting deadline of not later than 30 days from the consummation of a \nreportable transaction.\n  I commend the gentleman from Illinois and the gentleman from Kansas, \nalong with Chairman Upton, Chairman Whitfield, and Ranking Member \nPallone, for coming together and addressing this issue. It is a \nsensible piece of legislation that reduces the burden not only on \nindustry, Mr. Speaker, but also on the government, while ensuring the \npublic good is protected.\n  I urge passage of the legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Massachusetts made \nreference, this bill will reduce regulatory burdens, bring important \nparity to the statute, while also protecting ratepayers by providing \nimportant notice requirements. I would urge its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMontana (Mr. Zinke), who is the author of this legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in firm support of H.R. 2080, \nwhich reinstates and extends the deadline for construction of the Clark \nCanyon Dam hydroelectric project.\n  The dam is located outside of Dillon, Montana, and will provide \ncritical electricity to both Montana and Idaho. That is why I am proud \nto have the entire Idaho delegation with me and the entirety of the \nMontana delegation in support of this bill.\n  The issue is the red tape. Despite the importance of the project, the \nred tape with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has created an \nimpassable deadlock in it that won't allow for construction of it. Even \nthough we all recognize that hydroelectric power is clean and it is \nappropriate and the project is enormously important to Montana and \nIdaho, the bureaucratic red tape has just prevented it from going \nforward.\n  This is why we are here. Congress must act, and Congress will act. I \nam sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will agree that \nthis is a worthy project for Congress to use our authority and to \nintroduce the legislation to authorize such projects and independently \nmove ahead.\n  This is why I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 2080.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2080, a bill sponsored and led \nby the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke) to reinstate and extend the \ndeadline for commencement of construction on the hydroelectric project \ninvolving Clark Canyon Dam.\n  Mr. Speaker, on August 26, 2009, FERC licensed the Clark Canyon Dam \nproject at the Bureau of Reclamation's Clark Canyon Dam on the \nBeaverhead River in Beaverhead County, Montana.\n  Section 13 of the Federal Power Act requires licensees to commence \nconstruction of the hydroelectric project within a time fixed by the \nlicense, no more than 2 years from its being issued. It also authorizes \nFERC to issue one extension of that deadline for no more than 2 years.\n  In March of 2015, FERC terminated the license for the Clark Canyon \nDam hydroelectric project after the licensee did not commence \nconstruction by the already extended deadline of August 2013.\n  The bill authorizes FERC to reinstate the terminated license for the \nClark Canyon Dam hydroelectric project to extend for 6 years the date \nby which the licensee is required to commence construction. FERC has no \nobjections to this legislation, and the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce reported the bill by voice vote without dissent.\n  I hope my colleagues will support passage of H.R. 2080. I commend the \ngentleman from Montana for all his work in bringing this to the floor.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation \nto give additional time for the development of Clark Canyon Dam, for \nwhich a license has been issued in the past. I urge passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2080.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the\n\n[[Page H1309]]\n\nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1309-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXTENDING DEADLINE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT INVOLVING \n                               GIBSON DAM\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMontana (Mr. Zinke), the author of this legislation.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in firm support of H.R. 2081, which \nreinstates and extends the deadline for construction of the Gibson Dam \nhydroelectric project.\n  Similar to the project before, the Gibson Dam--this is situated in \nAugusta, Montana--is a partnership between the Greenfields Irrigation \nDistrict of Fairfield, Montana, and Tollhouse Energy of Bellingham, \nWashington.\n  The project was officially licensed by FERC in 2014, and a 2-year \nextension was also granted that year. Unfortunately, delays once again \nin paperwork and redtape require that Congress act to extend the \ndeadline.\n  I am fairly confident that my colleagues on the other side will also \nsupport this bill, being that the same issue before us is dams provide \na clean source of power.\n  The project has been reviewed multiple times, and it is in the best \ninterests of Montana and our country. The dam itself is important not \nonly to Montana and local farming communities, but it also protects \npivotal wildlife in areas around it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2081.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \nagree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 121) expressing the \nsense of the Congress condemning the gross violations of international \nlaw amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity by the \nGovernment of Syria, its allies, and other parties to the conflict in \nSyria, and asking the President to direct his Ambassador at the United \nNations to promote the establishment of a war crimes tribunal where \nthese crimes could be addressed, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.\n  The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 121\n\n       Whereas the Government of Syria, led by President Bashar \n     al-Assad, has engaged in widespread torture and rape, \n     employed starvation as a weapon of war, and massacred \n     civilians, including through the use of chemical weapons, \n     cluster munitions, and barrel bombs;\n       Whereas the vast majority of the civilians who have died in \n     the Syrian conflict have been killed by the Government of \n     Syria led by President Bashar al-Assad and its allies, \n     specifically the Russian Federation, the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran, and Iran's terrorist proxies including Hezbollah;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria reportedly has subjected \n     nearly 1,000,000 civilians to devastating sieges and \n     manipulated the delivery of humanitarian aid for its own \n     gain, thereby weaponizing starvation against populations, \n     such as in Madaya;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria continues to target \n     schools, water, electric, and medical facilities as a way to \n     deny civilians access to critical infrastructure and basic \n     services;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria has conducted massive and \n     widespread enforced disappearances, systematic torture, and \n     killing, amounting to what the United Nations Independent \n     International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab \n     Republic recently described as ``extermination'' at the hands \n     of the State;\n       Whereas the same Commission of Inquiry described these and \n     other actions perpetrated by the Government of Syria as war \n     crimes and crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria and its allies have carried \n     out mass atrocities without regard for international norms or \n     human decency;\n       Whereas the Government of Syria and its allies have \n     attacked various religious and ethnic minority populations in \n     Syria, including Christians, Turkmens, and Ismaelis;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has not only enabled the \n     Government of Syria's perpetration of these crimes but has \n     committed its own violations of international law by leading \n     deliberate bombing campaigns on civilian targets including \n     bakeries, hospitals, markets, and schools, contrary to United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, adopted on December \n     18, 2015, which demanded ``that all parties immediately cease \n     any attacks against civilians and civilian objects'';\n       Whereas the attacks by the Government of Syria and its \n     allies have focused on civilian targets and the United \n     States-backed opposition, and have led to the expansion of \n     the Islamic State in Syria;\n       Whereas other parties to the conflict in Syria, including \n     the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the al-Nusra \n     Front, have engaged in torture, rape, summary execution of \n     government soldiers, kidnapping for ransom, and violence \n     against civilians;\n       Whereas these continued violations of international law, \n     without any promise of accountability, jeopardize hope for \n     establishing a meaningful and lasting peace through the \n     Geneva and Vienna processes;\n       Whereas Syria is not a state-party to the Rome Statute and \n     is not a member of the International Criminal Court;\n       Whereas the United States supports the collection and \n     analysis of documentation related to the ongoing violations \n     of human rights, the coordination of Syrian and international \n     actors working on documentation and transitional justice \n     efforts, and education and outreach on transitional justice \n     concepts and processes, including efforts of the Syria \n     Justice and Accountability Center sponsored by the United \n     States and various other states and multilateral \n     institutions;\n       Whereas the international community has previously \n     established ad hoc or regional tribunals through the United \n     Nations to bring justice in specific countries where war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide have been \n     committed;\n       Whereas ad hoc or regional tribunals, including the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the \n     Special Court for Sierra Leone, have successfully \n     investigated and prosecuted war crimes, crimes against \n     humanity, and genocide, and there are many positive lessons \n     to be learned from such tribunals; and\n       Whereas any lasting, peaceful solution to the conflict in \n     Syria must be based upon justice for all, including members \n     of all factions, political parties, ethnicities, and \n     religions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns the continued use of unlawful and \n     indiscriminate violence against civilian populations by the \n     Government of Syria, its allies, and other parties to the \n     conflict;\n       (2) urges the United States and its partners to continue to \n     demand and work toward the cessation of attacks on Syrian \n     civilians by the Government of Syria, its allies, and other \n     parties to the conflict;\n       (3) urges the Administration to establish additional \n     mechanisms for the protection of civilians and to ensure \n     consistent and equitable access to humanitarian aid for \n     vulnerable populations;\n       (4) urges the United States to continue its support for \n     efforts to collect and analyze documentation related to \n     ongoing violations of human rights in Syria, and to \n     prioritize the collection of evidence that can be used to \n     support future prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity committed by the Government of Syria, its allies, \n     and other parties to the conflict;\n       (5) urges the President to direct the United States \n     representative to the United Nations to use the voice and \n     vote of the United States to immediately promote the \n     establishment of a Syrian war crimes tribunal, a regional or \n     international hybrid court to prosecute the perpetrators of \n     grave crimes committed by the Government of Syria, its \n     allies, and other parties to the conflict; and\n       (6) urges other nations to apprehend and deliver into the \n     custody of such a Syrian war crimes tribunal persons indicted \n     for war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in \n     Syria, and to provide information pertaining to such crimes \n     to the tribunal.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the U.N. Security Council should move immediately to \nestablish a Syrian war crimes tribunal. H. Con. Res. 121, which I \nintroduced, is a bipartisan piece of legislation backed by Chairman \nRoyce as well as by Eliot Engel and others, calling upon the \nadministration to pursue this policy goal, including using our voice \nand vote at the United Nations.\n  Mr. Speaker, past ad hoc/regional war crimes tribunals, including \ncourts for Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia, have made a \nsignificant difference, holding some of the worst mass murderers to \naccount with successful prosecutions followed by long jail sentences.\n  Who can forget the picture of the infamous former President of \nLiberia, Charles Taylor, with his head bowed, incredulous that the \nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone in 2012 meted out a 50-year jail term \nfor his crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n  According to the Syrian Center for Policy Research, approximately 5 \nyears of wanton bloodshed in Syria has killed either directly or \nindirectly an estimated 470,000 people. Other estimates put the death \ntoll at a quarter of a million.\n  While the United Nations long ago abandoned estimating the death toll \ndue to its inability to verify the veracity of the numbers, the war in \nSyria has caused a massive loss of life, including genocide against \nChristians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities, especially women \nand children.\n  The International Syria Support Group, co-chaired by the United \nStates and Russia, as we all know, brokered a cessation of hostilities \nthat kicked in on February 27 that applies to all parties except ISIS \nand al-Nusra.\n  While we all hope and pray the cease-fire holds as it goes into the \nthird week\n\n[[Page H1313]]\n\nand humanitarian groups gain access to sick, frail, and at-risk people, \nthe atrocities committed against Syria's population demand \naccountability and justice.\n  There have been--I think I should point this out because many people \nwho are following the news know this--numerous violations of the cease-\nfire by Assad and his forces.\n  In an opinion piece in Newsweek a few hours ago, it was noted that \n``regime forces are openly bombing and, in some cases, launching ground \noperations to capture key rebel territory without making any pretense \nof attacking the Nusra Front.''\n  Further, the Syria Ceasefire Monitor ``reports 111 violations as of \nMarch 9--almost all perpetuated by the Assad regime or Russian \nforces.''\n  A Syrian court is needed for all the past, present, and--God forbid--\nlikely future atrocities being committed in Syria.\n  Rigorous investigations by a new Syrian court, followed by \nprosecutions, convictions, and serious jail time for perpetrators of \ncrime on all sides will not only hold those responsible for war crimes \naccountable, but will send a clear message that such barbaric behavior \nhas dire personal consequences. The victims and their loved ones, Mr. \nSpeaker, deserve no less.\n  Can a U.N. Security Council resolution establishing a Syrian war \ncrimes tribunal prevail? Yes, I believe. With a serious and sustained \ndiplomatic push by the United States and other interested parties, past \nsuccess in creating war crimes tribunals can, indeed, be prologue.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Notwithstanding Russia's solidarity with Serbia during the Balkan \nwar, especially with Slobodan Milosevic, the International Criminal \nCourt Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was unanimously approved. \nDitto for the special court in Sierra Leone in 2002. The Rwanda \ntribunal was created in 1994, with China choosing to abstain rather \nthan to veto that court.\n  At a Syrian war crimes court, no one on any side who commits \ngenocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity would be precluded \nfrom prosecution.\n  As I said, in the early 1990s, the Russians knew that the Yugoslav \ncourt was designed to hold all transgressors liable, whether they be \nBosnian or Croats and not just Serbians and, again, they didn't veto \nthat particular court as it was established.\n  I believe the Russians and the Chinese can be persuaded to support or \nat least abstain from blocking establishment of such a court.\n  An ad hoc or a regional court has significant advantages over the \nInternational Criminal Court, or the ICC, as a venue for justice. For \nstarters, neither Syria nor the United States is a member of the ICC, \nalthough mechanisms exist to push prosecutions there.\n  The ICC, however, has operated since 2002, and only boasts of only \ntwo, two, just two, convictions. By way of contrast, the Yugoslav court \nconvicted 80 people; Rwanda, 61; and Sierra Leone, 9. Moreover, a \nsingularly focused Syrian tribunal that provides Syrians with a degree \nof ownership could significantly enhance its effectiveness.\n  I chaired a Congressional hearing on establishing a Syrian war crimes \ntribunal back in 2013, and included such great leaders as David Crane, \nthe former prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and \nfounder and chairman of the Syria Accountability Project.\n  Mr. Crane testified that the Syria Accountability Project has \ncollected data ``and built a framework by which President Assad and his \nhenchmen''--this is his quote--``along with members of the opposition \ncan be prosecuted openly and fairly.''\n  He and his team have ``developed a crime base matrix which catalogs \nmost of the incidents chronologically and highlights the violations of \nthe Rome Statute, the Geneva Conventions, as well as domestic Syrian \ncriminal law.''\n  Significantly, with respect to the ICC, Mr. Crane testified that ``it \nlacks the capability and the political and diplomatic sophistication to \nhandle such a mandate.''\n  Indeed, I would like to relay some words that I had with David Crane \njust a few hours ago; and he reminded us that it is important that the \nCongress continue the quest to seek justice for the oppressed and work \non justice for the Syrian people, in particular, as we recall the fifth \nanniversary of the beginning of the civil war in that country. \nTomorrow, March 15, marks the fifth anniversary of this horrific \nconflict.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, accountability that is aggressive, predictable, \ntransparent, and applicable to all perpetrators of genocide and crimes \nagainst humanity on all sides of the divide must be pursued now.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey for authoring and \nbringing this resolution to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, Syria and much of Iraq face two great evils. ISIS is \nwell-known to us, and its evil is established by them on their own Web \nsites every day.\n  The second evil is the extremist Shiite alliance, consisting of Iran, \nAssad, Hezbollah, and many of the Shiite militias based in Baghdad to \nBasra. And, of course, this Shiite alliance is aided by Russia, \nalthough today there were reports that give us a glimmer of hope that \nRussia will be diminishing its role in the Syrian conflict.\n  The Shiite extremist alliance, I believe, is even more dangerous than \nISIS since they include two state actors and a nuclear program. And the \nextremist Shiite alliance has killed more Americans than ISIS, from the \nMarines who died in Lebanon in the 1980s, to the IEDs that were \nmanufactured in Iran and deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  There is a substantial difference in style between these two evil \nforces. When ISIS kills people, they put the beheadings on YouTube. \nWhen Assad kills thousands with his barrel bombs, or even with chemical \nweapons there for a while, Assad had the good taste to deny it. But \ndifferent styles do not mask the fact that we are confronted with two \ngreat evils; and this resolution, I think, is an important step in \ndealing with those evils.\n  This resolution condemns the gross violation of international law, \nperpetrated by the Assad regime and those forces supporting Assad, \nwhich have amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n  We all hope that the current ceasefire holds and even holds better \nthan it has, but 5 years of civil war in Syria has shown us the use of \nweapons we thought were relegated only to the history books, including \nchemical weapons used by the Syrian government against its own \ncivilians.\n  Assad has conducted deliberate bombings of schools, hospitals, and \nhumanitarian sites for the clear purpose of causing civilians to flee, \nand overall, he has conducted a brutal war that has killed hundreds of \nthousands of Syrians and sent millions fleeing the country.\n  He has been aided in this process by the Iran Revolutionary Guard \nCorps, whose chief spokesman redisclosed just last week how proud the \nRevolutionary Guard Corps is of helping Assad and how Tehran is helping \nto finance both Hezbollah and the Shiite militias that are helping \nAssad.\n  The resolution before us today makes specific mention of the role \nthat Iran and the Shiite extremist militias are playing, and that is an \nimportant part of the resolution. So I agree with the gentleman from \nNew Jersey. It is time to show the people who are committing these war \ncrimes that there will be a tribunal, that they will be personally held \nto account.\n  And while I would hope that would drive home a message that would be \nrelevant both to those who direct ISIS and those surrounding Assad, I \nthink it will have a bigger impact on the generals around Assad who do \nnot view themselves as martyrs, but view themselves as powerful \nindividuals in Syria who would wish to travel and enjoy the good life \nwith money they have stolen and taken from the Syrian people.\n  So I do not see that I have any speakers on our side, and I have been \nnotified that I should not expect any, and for that reason, I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) for his very eloquent remarks \nand strong support for this resolution. I urge support and passage of \nthis resolution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on \nthe motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith)\n\n[[Page H1314]]\n\nthat the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent \nresolution, H. Con.

Con. Res. 75\n\n       Whereas Christians and other religious and ethnic \n     minorities have been an integral part of the cultural fabric \n     of the Middle East for millennia;\n       Whereas the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n     (ISIL) and associated extremists are committing egregious \n     atrocities against ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq \n     and Syria, including Christians (including Assyrian Chaldean \n     Syriac, Armenian, and Melkite communities, among others), \n     Yezidis, Turkmen, Shabak, Sabaean-Mandeans, and Kaka`i, among \n     others;\n       Whereas ISIL specifically targets these religious and \n     ethnic minorities, intending to kill them or force their \n     submission, conversion, or expulsion;\n       Whereas religious and ethnic minorities have been murdered, \n     subjugated, forced to emigrate, and subjected to grievous \n     bodily and psychological harm, kidnapping, human trafficking, \n     torture, and rape;\n       Whereas ISIL engages in, and publicly argues in favor of, \n     the sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women, including pre-\n     pubescent girls;\n       Whereas ISIL atrocities against Christians, Yezidis, and \n     other minorities have included mass murder, crucifixions, \n     beheadings, rape, torture, enslavement, the kidnaping of \n     children, and other violence deliberately calculated to \n     eliminate their communities from the so-called Islamic State;\n       Whereas ISIL has deliberately destroyed and looted numerous \n     cultural sites, religious shrines, churches, monasteries, and \n     museums in order to eradicate the cultures of ethnic and \n     religious minorities from the territory it attempts to \n     control;\n       Whereas these atrocities have been undertaken with the \n     specific intent to bring about the eradication of those \n     communities and the destruction of their cultural heritage;\n       Whereas ISIL operations have in fact driven minority \n     religious and ethnic communities from their ancestral \n     homelands;\n       Whereas under applicable international law referenced in \n     section 2441 of Title 18 of the United States Code, murder, \n     torture, mutilation, rape, cruel treatment, and hostage-\n     taking of non-combatants constitute war crimes;\n       Whereas crimes against humanity, as defined by the \n     International Military Tribunal convened at Nuremberg in \n     1945, and in various international instruments since then, \n     include murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and \n     other inhumane acts committed against any civilian \n     population, as well as persecution on political, racial, or \n     religious grounds in connection with such crimes;\n       Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed and ratified by \n     the United States, defines genocide as ``any of the following \n     acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in \n     part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as \n     such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious \n     bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) \n     Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life \n     calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole \n     or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births \n     within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the \n     group to another group'';\n       Whereas on August 7, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry \n     declared that ``ISIL's campaign of terror against the \n     innocent, including Yezidi and Christian minorities, and its \n     grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning \n     signs and hallmarks of genocide'';\n       Whereas in August 2014, the United States conducted \n     targeted airstrikes and humanitarian assistance operations to \n     help break the siege of Mount Sinjar, saving the lives of \n     thousands of Yezidi men, women, and children;\n       Whereas His Holiness, Pope Francis, has noted that ``entire \n     communities, especially - but not only - Christians and \n     Yezidis have suffered and are still suffering inhuman \n     violence because of their ethnic and religious identity'' and \n     that, for Christians being killed for their faith in the \n     Middle East, ``a form of genocide -- I insist on the word -- \n     is taking place, and it must end'';\n       Whereas a March 13, 2015, report by the Office of the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights detailed \n     ``acts of violence perpetrated [by ISIL] against civilians \n     because of their affiliation or perceived affiliation to an \n     ethnic or religious group'' and stated that ``[i]t is \n     reasonable to conclude that some of these incidents, \n     considering the overall information, may constitute \n     genocide'';\n       Whereas in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs \n     Committee on May 13, 2015, Dominican Sister Diana Momeka, \n     whose convent was driven from Mosul, Iraq, described the ISIL \n     offensive as ``cultural and human genocide'' and stated that \n     today ``[t]he only Christians that remain in the Plain of \n     Nineveh are those who are held as hostages'';\n       Whereas in December 2015, the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum's Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of \n     Genocide issued a report focused on the treatement of \n     minorities in Nineveh from June to August 2014, which found \n     that ISIL had ``targeted civilians based on group identity, \n     committing mass atrocities to control, expel, and exterminate \n     ethnic and religious minorities'' and, in that context, \n     ``committed crimes against humanity, war crimes, and ethnic \n     cleansing against [Christian, Yezidi, Turkmen, Shabak, \n     Sabaean-Mandean, and Kaka'i] communities in Nineva'' and \n     ``perpetrated genocide against the Yezidi people'';\n       Whereas on December 7, 2015, the United States Commission \n     on International Religious Freedom called on the United \n     States Government ``to designate the Christian, Yezidi, \n     Shi'a, Turkmen, and Shabak communities of Iraq and Syria as \n     victims of genocide by ISIL'' and urged world leaders ``to \n     condemn the genocidal actions and crimes against humanity of \n     ISIL that have been directed at these groups and other ethnic \n     and religious groups'';\n       Whereas on February 3, 2016, the European Parliament \n     expressed the view that ISIL ``is committing genocide against \n     Christians and Yezidis, and other religious and ethnic \n     minorities'';\n       Whereas Syrian President Bashar al Assad's violence against \n     the Syrian people has attracted foreign fighters from around \n     the world, who have supported and committed ISIL atrocities; \n     and\n       Whereas according to some estimates, the conflict among all \n     parties to the Syrian civil war has killed 470,000 and \n     displaced 11,000,000 people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the atrocities perpetrated by ISIL against Christians, \n     Yezidis, and other religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq \n     and Syria constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \n     genocide;\n       (2) all governments, including the United States, and \n     international organizations, including the United Nations and \n     the Office of the Secretary-General, should call ISIL \n     atrocities by their rightful names: war crimes, crimes \n     against humanity, and genocide;\n       (3) the member states of the United Nations should \n     coordinate urgently on measures to prevent further war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Iraq and \n     Syria, and to punish those responsible for these ongoing \n     crimes, including by the collection and preservation of \n     evidence and, if necessary, the establishment and operation \n     of appropriate tribunals;\n       (4) the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Lebanese Republic, \n     the Republic of Turkey, and the Kurdistan Regional Government \n     in Iraq are to be commended for, and supported in, their \n     efforts to shelter and protect those fleeing the violence of \n     ISIL and other combatants until they can safely return to \n     their homes in Iraq and Syria; and\n       (5) the protracted Syrian civil war and the indiscriminate \n     violence of the Assad regime have contributed to the growth \n     of ISIL and will continue to do so as long as this conflict \n     continues.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n\n[[Page H1315]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Jeff Fortenberry and \nhis lead cosponsor, Anna Eshoo, for their extremely important \nresolution, H. Con. Res. 75, as amended, calling on the Obama \nadministration to declare the annihilation of Christians, Yazidis, and \nother minorities, for what it is, a genocide.\n  On December 4 of last year, a coalition of prominent religious \nleaders wrote President Obama and stated, ``Christian and Yazidi \nminorities in Iraq and Syria are being targeted for eradication in \ntheir ancient homelands solely because of their religious beliefs.''\n  They had been prompted by reports of an ``imminent'' State Department \nfinding that ISIS was committing genocide against the Yazidis, a \nfinding they ``wholeheartedly'' endorsed, but were ``deeply troubled,'' \nlike we all were, that the genocide of Christians was going to be \nbypassed or excluded.\n  Apparently press reports had claimed that the rationale for excluding \nChristians was that, unlike the Yazidis, Christians had a choice to \nconvert to Islam and pay an Islamic tax, or be killed, tortured, \nenslaved, or held hostage.\n  In direct rebuttal of that argument at a hearing that I held on \nDecember 9, Carl Anderson, the Supreme Knight of the Knights of \nColumbus, stated:\n\n       Many times the payment of the tax is not presented as an \n     option for these Christians. In instances where the Yazidi \n     tax has been enacted or extracted, it has failed to ensure \n     that the Christians could live as Christians, that they were \n     protected from rival jihadists, or even other members of \n     ISIS, or that the amendment of payment was not raised over \n     time until it became impossible for some of them to pay, \n     causing the family's home, and even their children, to be \n     confiscated, and the adults to be killed or forced to become \n     Muslims.\n\n  It is a very, very poor argument that has been made by the State \nDepartment, so we believe they have made this. Hopefully, they will \nrectify it.\n  Let me also point out to my colleagues that the Genocide Convention \ndefines genocide as ``the killing and certain other acts committed with \nthe intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, \nracial, or religious group.''\n  The religious leaders who signed the December 4 letter compiled \nextensive files supporting a finding that ISIS' treatment of Iraqi and \nSyrian Christians absolutely meets this definition. They include:\n\n       Evidence of ISIS assassinations of church leaders; mass \n     murders; torture, kidnapping for ransom in the Christian \n     communities of Iraq and Syria; sexual enslavement and \n     systematic rape of Christian girls and women; its practices \n     of forcible conversions to Islam; its destruction of \n     churches, monasteries, cemeteries, and Christian artifacts; \n     and its theft of lands and wealth from Christian clergy and \n     laity alike.\n\n  They went on to cite ``ISIS' own public statements taking credit for \nmass murder of Christians, and expressing its intent eliminate \nChristian communities from the Islamic State.''\n  The letter recounted how ``ISIS jihadis have stamped Christian homes \nin Mosul with the red letter N for Nazarene in the summer of 2014,'' \npointing out how the ``elimination of Christians in other towns and \ncities in Iraq and Syria began long beforehand.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I held a hearing 3 years ago extolling and urging the \nadministration to recognize the genocide against Christians, and our \nwitnesses, the private witnesses who spoke, gave instance after \ninstance of crimes against Christians that were done simply because \nthey were Christians.\n  At a December 9 hearing, we heard from four witnesses. I mentioned \none a moment ago, Carl Anderson, from the Knights of Columbus. We also \nheard from Dr. Stanton, of Genocide Watch, who said, ``Failure to call \nISIS' mass murder of Christians, Shiia, Muslims, and other groups in \naddition to the Yazidis by its proper name, genocide, would be an act \nof denial as grave as the U.S. refusal to recognize the Rwanda genocide \nback in 1994.''\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Bishop Kalabat, a Chaldean bishop, was extremely pointed in his \nremarks when he said that ``the Obama administration, including \nPresident Obama himself, have neglected to mention that the ISIS \natrocities were committed against Christians. They rightly mention \natrocities committed in Iraq against the Yazidis, and they are \nhorrific.'' The bishop went on, ``But there are also atrocities of \nrape, killings, crucifixions, beheadings, hangings that the Syrian and \nIraqi Christians have endured, and they are intentionally omitted.'' He \ncompellingly stated that ``the U.S. Government should not turn a blind \neye to the genocidal atrocities faced by Iraq's ethnic and religious \nminorities, including the Christians, the Yazidis, and others.''\n  Finally, in very, very powerful testimony, the head of Yezidi Human \nRights Organization-International, Mr. Ismail, stated that though his \npeople, the Yazidis, were on the verge of annihilation, he called upon \nthe administration not to neglect the others who are also on the verge \nof annihilation, and said, ``the Yazidis and the Chaldo-Assyrian \nChristians face this genocide together.''\n  Now is the time to act. We cannot let the cries of the victims go \nunheeded as we once did when we confronted the genocide in Rwanda and \nother genocides that have occurred around the world. Mr. Speaker, I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to vote for H. Con. Res. 75.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I rise in strong support of the resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution deals with the crimes of ISIS.\n  I want to thank my colleague from California, Anna Eshoo, and our \ncolleague from Nebraska, Jeff Fortenberry, for their drafting of this \nresolution which I and so many others have cosponsored, and I want to \nthank the chair and ranking member of our committee for their work in \npreparing the amendment that we adopted in committee.\n  This resolution, H. Con. Res. 75, identifies the violent acts of ISIS \nby their right name: war crimes, crimes against humanity, and, where \nappropriate, genocide. We could and will be conducting a complete \nanalysis in the future to identify which atrocities of ISIS are merely \nwar crimes and which atrocities of ISIS are part of an overall systemic \ngenocide. But it is clear that at least some of the war crimes are part \nof a planned genocide against religious minorities in the areas that \nISIS occupies.\n  This resolution also includes a call upon the United States and all \nthe states of the U.N. to conduct measures designed to prevent these \ncrimes and genocide in the future. Now, it is said that People of the \nBook, most relevantly Christians, are being told by ISIS that they only \nhave to pay a jizya and they will be allowed to live, a special tax \nimposed upon them. But the fact is that we know that the Yazidis are \nnot even given that option but are subject to extermination; whereas, \nChristians may be told to pay the tax and then, when they run out of \nmoney, be executed because they are not paying more. So we know that \nISIS is guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide.\n  In addition to passing this resolution, we ought to focus on the most \nsignificant thing the United States is doing against ISIS, and that, of \ncourse, is our airstrikes. I believe our airstrikes have been subject \nto rules of engagement that are far too limited. For example, we have \nlearned that we try to cut off ISIS' flow of money by hitting the \ntanker trucks that are taking the oil out of ISIS areas for sale, but \nwe are only hitting those trucks when they are parked, not when they \nare moving.\n  It is true that, if you hit a moving truck, you may kill the driver, \nand that driver may be an ISIS soldier or may be a civilian; but if you \nlook at the strategic bombing that we engaged in during World War II, \nnot just the strategic bombing of Germany, but the strategic bombing of \noccupied France and occupied Belgium and so many other occupied \ncountries, you will see that we hit munitions plants and transportation \ntanker trucks whether or not those people operating the transportation \ndevices and operating in the munitions plants were civilian or \nmilitary.\n  If we are going to get serious against ISIS, we have to be willing \nnot to target civilians but, instead, to do everything we can to \nprevent killing civilians; but we have to be willing to hit\n\n[[Page H1316]]\n\nstrategic targets even if we are not 100 percent sure that all civilian \ncasualties will be avoided.\n  So I look forward to our working both diplomatically and militarily \nfor the destruction of ISIS and eventually holding ISIS' leaders to \naccount for their war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the author of \nH. Con. Res 75.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank my colleague and \ngood friend, Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, for his tireless \nefforts on a whole, broad spectrum of assaults on human dignity. He is \nconstantly trying to elevate the conscience of this body and the \nworldwide community. I thank the chairman, as well, for coordinating \nthis effort and speaking favorably to it, as well as Chairman Royce and \nRanking Member Engel, who passed this through the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n  I need to also, because she is not here, thank Anna Eshoo, a \nDemocratic colleague from California.\n  We are living in a time when our country looks at Congress and sees \nstagnation, anger, and gridlock and not being able to get things done. \nWhat we have before us today is a transpartisan resolution. It has \nrisen above the petty and difficult differences that we often work out \nhere on the floor of the House of Representatives. It has risen above \nit because of its essential nature. Not only is there a grave injustice \nhappening in the Middle East to the people, to the Christians, Yazidis, \nand other religious minorities who have as much a right to be in their \nancient homeland as anyone else, but this is a threat against \ncivilization itself.\n  When a group of people, ISIS--8th century barbarians with 21st \ncentury weapons--can systematically try to exterminate another group of \npeople simply because of their faith tradition, violating the sacred \nspace of individuality, conscience, and religious liberty, you \nundermine the entire system for international order building out of \nrule of law and proper social interaction--civilization itself. That is \nwhy so many Members have come together here in a bipartisan, \ntranspartisan way and said, ``Enough.''\n  This is a genocide against Christians and Yazidis. It is a crime \nagainst humanity and against others, as well, who are suffering because \nof their religious faith.\n  By the way, it should be noted that the group of people who have been \nmost killed by ISIS are innocent Muslims, as well.\n  This is an important resolution to speak clearly about what is \nhappening in the land.\n  Why is it important? Because it raises the international \nconsciousness, and it compels the responsible communities of the world \nto act. Secondly, it creates the potential preconditions for when there \nis a security settlement in the Middle East that will allow these \nancient faith traditions to reintegrate back into their homeland and \ncontinue to contribute to the once-rich tapestry that made up the \nMiddle East.\n  That is why this is so essential. It is just. The responsible \ncommunities of the world must act, and it is essential for \ninternational order and international stability if there is going to be \na chance for any type of hope and long-lasting viability of order and \ntranquility in that area.\n  As my colleague, Mr. Smith, mentioned, Genocide Watch has labeled \nthis genocide. The International Association of Genocide Scholars has \ncalled this genocide. The Yezidi Human Rights Organization-\nInternational has said this is genocide. Pope Francis has said that \nthis is genocide and has decried the scandal of silence and the scandal \nof indifference in this regard--again, another reason why action by \nthis body is so essential.\n  In addition to that, I want to leave you with one quick story.\n  I represent the largest Yazidi community in America. I have been \ndealing with this community for many, many years, many of whom \nresettled in Lincoln, Nebraska, because they were given special visas \nto come to America because they worked side by side with our soldiers \nduring the Iraq war as translators. Because of the grave threat that \nthey were under, they were given special privileges to become citizens \nhere, and many settled in my State of Nebraska, my hometown, Lincoln.\n  I have been working with the community for a number of years about a \nnumber of concerns. About a year and a half ago, a group came to see \nme. Young men who had worked as translators were on the verge of tears. \nThey were passionate and angry. I don't blame them for being angry. \nTheir mothers, their sisters, and their family members were trapped on \nMount Sinjar. They were pleading with me: Congressman, act. Do \nsomething now. We can't wait.\n  To the Obama administration's credit, shortly thereafter--and the \nHouse had passed a resolution creating some groundwork for trying to \nstop the annihilation of Yazidis--the Obama administration, President \nObama, acted, and I am thankful for that.\n  This week we have an opportunity to continue to plead and urge the \nState Department to act as well. I know they are under an evaluation as \nto this real genocide that is happening. I respect their process, but I \nthink the facts are clear; and it is my sincere hope that Secretary \nKerry and the State Department will meet their lawful deadline this \nweek and declare this fact: there is a genocide against Christians and \nYazidis, and civilization itself is at stake.\n  I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for yielding me the \ntime.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank \nMr. Fortenberry for his very eloquent remarks and for reminding us that \nthis is an existential threat to Christians, but really, as well, to \ncivilization. I thank him again for the resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Staten Island, \nNew York (Mr. Donovan). He is a member of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Jersey (Mr. \nSmith) for allowing me this time to express and rise in support of H. \nCon. Res. 75.\n  When considering the long history of civilization, we look back in \nhorror at the unimaginable pain mankind is capable of inflicting on \nitself, and each succeeding generation wonders how a people stood idly \nby as warring factions destroyed innocent life and property.\n\n  Last year, the world watched a beach turned red as executioners sawed \noff the heads of 21 Coptic Christians on the shores of the \nMediterranean Sea. Two weeks ago, terrorists stormed a retirement home \nfull of nuns caring for the elderly and frail. And in the months in \nbetween, ISIS systemically killed or enslaved thousands of Yazidi \npeople.\n  Scripture speaks of perseverance and endurance in faith under siege \nand not growing weary. Matthew says:\n\n       Blessed are those who are persecuted because of their \n     righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.\n\n  But that doesn't excuse our silence. Political correctness cannot \nstand in the way of our moral obligation as a free and decent people. I \nsupport the resolution and hope we can have the moral conviction to \ncall this massacre what it is: genocide.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas, Judge Poe, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, ISIS, this evil group, has been intentionally targeting \nChristians worldwide because of their religious belief. ISIS not only \ntargets Christians, it targets any religious group, including some \nMuslims who disagree with them.\n  As the previous speaker from New York mentioned, they are proud of \nthe fact that they murder people, that they behead people, and that \nthey put their murders on television for the world to see. These \natrocities committed by this terrorist group in the name of a perverted \njihad religion are the worst crimes we have seen in our lifetime.\n\n[[Page H1317]]\n\n  More than that, ISIS' massacres of religious and ethnic minorities \nfits the definition of genocide. The definition of genocide is clear. \nIt is the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial or cultural \ngroup. That is exactly what ISIS is doing. ISIS has already forced \nhundreds of thousands of Christians to leave their ancestral homes.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  For the first time since Jesus, there are almost no Christians left \nin this part of the world. There were 1.5 million Christians in Iraq in \n2003--1.5 million. Since that time, terrorists have either killed or \nforced Christians to run for their lives.\n  Today, 13 years later, there are 66 percent fewer Christians in this \narea. Some of those who could not get out before ISIS came in and took \nover their areas have been tortured, crucified, executed, and murdered \nin the most inhumane possible ways, tortured because of their belief.\n  ISIS has not only targeted Christians, it has targeted other \ncommunities. The Yazidi community of Iraq has been tortured. ISIS \nslaughtered almost all of the men in one community on Mount Sinjar and \nthen sold the women and the girls off into slavery, this demonic desire \nof theirs, and gave them to their fighters. It is just another example \nof tragic cases of genocide in world history.\n  ISIS will not stop, Mr. Speaker, exterminating these people, until \nthey bow down to their ideology, and their ideology is based on hate. \nISIS does not just target those under its control. The terrorists seek \nto cleanse the world, the whole world, from all people who do not \naccept their belief, including other Muslims.\n  It is time the United States and the rest of the world make it clear \nto all what ISIS is doing. We must denounce murder, this genocide, that \nis occurring because of people's religious belief.\n  I am glad that this resolution is coming forward. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of H. Con. Res. 75.\n  Mr. Speaker, justice demands ISIS be held accountable for what it \ndoes. Justice must be done. After all, isn't justice what we do in the \nUnited States?\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Texas for his \nspeech and the gentleman from Nebraska who spoke earlier for his \nintroduction of this resolution, along with my colleague, Anna Eshoo, \nfrom California. And, of course, I commend Chris Smith for a lifetime \nof work on human rights.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes to \nclose.\n  I thank my good friend, Mr. Sherman, for his good, bipartisan, strong \nremarks expressed today during both of these debates on the war crimes \ntribunal and now on Mr. Fortenberry's genocide resolution, another \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their moving words today. Judge \nPoe, again, hit the nail right on the head, as did our friend from New \nYork.\n  I think we need to say it and we need to say it with exclamation \npoints, that declaring genocide is a solemn and extremely serious step \nnot to be taken lightly.\n  I am very proud of the work that the Foreign Affairs Committee did. I \nwant to thank our chairman, Ed Royce, and the ranking member, Eliot \nEngel, for their work on this resolution.\n  All of us understand the seriousness of calling crimes genocide. It \nrepresents an assertion that a legal definition has been met and that \nwe are witnessing acts of physical and mental violence intended to \ndestroy a group in whole or in part.\n  The targeted depravity of ISIS against the Yazidis, Christians, and \nother minorities more--I will say it again--more than meets that \ndefinition.\n  But far more than the legality, speaking clearly of genocide, is an \nappeal to the conscience of the world. It evokes the moral gravity and \nthe imperative of never again.\n  The United States must not wait any longer to find its voice and call \nthese bloody purges what they are: genocide. We and our partners must \ndefeat ISIS so that Christians, Yazidis, all religious communities, and \nall the people of Syria and Iraq, can live in peace, free from this \ngrotesque persecution.\n  I urge passage of the resolution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules \nand agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (S. 2426) to direct the Secretary of State to develop a \nstrategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the International \nCriminal Police Organization, and for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 2426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL \n                   CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Safety, security and peace is important to every \n     citizen of the world, and shared information ensuring wide \n     assistance among police authorities of nations for \n     expeditious dissemination of information regarding criminal \n     activities greatly assists in these efforts.\n       (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in the \n     International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) is \n     beneficial for all nations and their police authorities. \n     Internationally shared information with authorized police \n     authorities is vital to peacekeeping efforts.\n       (3) With a history dating back to 1914, the role of \n     INTERPOL is defined in its constitution: ``To ensure and \n     promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all \n     criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws \n     existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''.\n       (4) Ongoing international threats, including international \n     networks of terrorism, show the ongoing necessity to be ever \n     inclusive of nations willing to work together to combat \n     criminal activity. The ability of police authorities to \n     coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an \n     essential element of crisis prevention and response.\n       (5) Taiwan maintained full membership in INTERPOL starting \n     in 1964 through its National Police Administration but was \n     ejected in 1984 when the People's Republic of China (PRC) \n     applied for membership.\n       (6) Nonmembership prevents Taiwan from gaining access to \n     INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, which \n     provides real-time information on criminals and global \n     criminal activities. Taiwan is relegated to second-hand \n     information from friendly nations, including the United \n     States.\n       (7) Taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on \n     criminals and suspicious activity with the international \n     community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting \n     efforts and leaving the entire world at risk.\n       (8) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations and has consistently \n     reiterated that support.\n       (9) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235, a law \n     authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate and implement \n     a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at \n     the annual summit of the World Health Assembly and subsequent \n     advocacy by the United States, Taiwan was granted observer \n     status to the World Health Assembly for six consecutive years \n     since 2009. Both prior to and in its capacity as an observer, \n     Taiwan has contributed significantly to the international \n     community's collective efforts in pandemic control, \n     monitoring, early warning, and other related matters.\n       (10) INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its \n     meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the \n     Organization''.\n       (b) Taiwan's Participation in INTERPOL.--The Secretary of \n     State shall--\n       (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan \n     in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and \n     mechanisms thereafter; and\n       (2) instruct INTERPOL Washington to officially request \n     observer status for Taiwan in\n\n[[Page H1318]]\n\n     INTERPOL and to actively urge INTERPOL member states to \n     support such observer status and participation for Taiwan.\n       (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan in \n     INTERPOL.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to \n     Congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the \n     United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer status \n     for Taiwan in appropriate international organizations, \n     including INTERPOL, and at other related meetings, \n     activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The report shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of the efforts the Secretary has made to \n     encourage member states to promote Taiwan's bid to obtain \n     observer status in appropriate international organizations, \n     including INTERPOL.\n       (2) A description of the actions the Secretary will take to \n     endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in appropriate \n     international organizations, including INTERPOL, and at other \n     related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in strong support of S. 2426, the Senate version of a bill \nthat previously passed the House with strong bipartisan support.\n  I especially want to commend Chairman Matt Salmon for authoring the \nHouse version of this important measure and Senator Gardner for doing \nthe same on the Senate side. Their leadership on this issue is much \nappreciated.\n  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today will help secure \nobserver status for Taiwan at INTERPOL. The bill requires the Secretary \nof State to develop and execute a strategy to ensure that Taiwan \nparticipates in INTERPOL's next general assembly meeting in Indonesia. \nWith this piece of legislation, we are sending a clear message that \nsafety and security are a priority.\n  Taiwan, Mr. Speaker, as we all know, is a model of democratization \nand openness, a thriving nation of 23 million people. Its successful \ntransition from authoritarianism to a thriving democracy is a shining \nexample for so many other nations.\n  The sole reason that Taiwan is excluded from the international \norganizations is the persistent opposition of the communist government \nof mainland China.\n  But China's opposition puts politics over the safety and security of \npeople. In a world where terrorism and international drug and human \ntrafficking networks are global in scope, the response must be \ncoordinated globally as well.\n  At this time, Taiwan relies on delayed, secondhand information from \nthe United States about international criminals and criminal \nactivities, making it more vulnerable to security threats. Likewise, \nTaiwan cannot share the law enforcement information it gathers to the \nbenefit of INTERPOL members.\n  It makes no sense to exclude Taiwan from INTERPOL due to a political \npique, just as it makes no sense to exclude Taiwan from the World \nHealth Organization, another example of the government of mainland \nChina putting politics over the health and safety of people.\n  But there is another reason for having a good global citizen such as \nTaiwan as a member of INTERPOL: INTERPOL is an organization that is in \nneed of reform.\n  A number of authoritarian countries abuse the INTERPOL red notice \nsystem not against criminals, but to harass political dissidents and \nexiles who are unable to travel internationally for fear that they will \nbe arrested and face extradition in their home country, where they \nsuffer persecution, imprisonment, and even death.\n  For example, Jacob Ostreicher, a legitimate American businessman who \nwas the victim of an extortion ring involving corrupt Bolivian \nGovernment officials and jailed in Bolivia, a matter on which my \nsubcommittee held three hearings and for which I traveled to Bolivia \nwith our colleague Nydia Velazquez, has, since his return to the United \nStates, discovered that he has been red-noticed by vindictive Bolivian \nGovernment officials.\n  The red notice effectively prevents him from traveling abroad. He is \ncurrently going through a time-consuming and costly process to clear \nhis name.\n  To help encourage reform at INTERPOL, we should welcome democracies \nsuch as Taiwan.\n  I also believe strengthening Taiwan's law enforcement capabilities \nbenefits American citizens as much as it does the Taiwanese.\n  Every year, Mr. Speaker, tens of thousands of Americans travel to \nTaiwan, and this bill will certainly help Taiwan's police protect \nAmerican citizens and other internationalists as they travel to Taiwan. \nIt is a good bill. It is an important bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of this bill. Just to put the legislative \nhistory in the Record, the House passed H.R. 1853 overwhelmingly late \nlast year. In fact, the vote on this floor was 392-0.\n  We sent the bill to the Senate. Instead of acting on the House bill, \nthe Senate xeroxed our bill, put their own name on it, and now sends it \nback here.\n  If I was driven by ego, I might try to serve in the other body. But \nthe decision to send the bill back to us with their own names on it is \na trend we are seeing in the Foreign Affairs area, a trend that I do \nnot condemn because it allows us here on this floor to consider well-\ndrafted House bills twice and to vote on them twice and to emphasize to \nthe administration how serious we are about their being enacted.\n  I want to thank the Senate author for his decision that we consider \nthis bill a second time. The vote last time was 392-0. My hope is that \nwe have a similar vote today.\n  I commend the gentleman from New Jersey for describing why this bill \nis important. Since I have previously commented how important it is \nthat we discuss Foreign Affairs bills not once, but twice, on the floor \nof this House, I would be remiss if I did not add my own comments.\n  When this bill was introduced in the House, it was by the chair and \nranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Mr. Salmon and \nmyself.\n  I appreciate the Senate commending our draftsmanship, since imitation \nis the most sincere form of flattery.\n  Why is this bill necessary? Because Taiwan functions day to day as an \nindependent country and it needs to function in that manner inside \ninternational organizations.\n  To date, Taiwan has been admitted to only one international \norganization, the World Health Organization, and there it has only \nobserver status.\n  The fiction that Taiwan acts as, functions as, a part of China \ncomplicates and interferes with so many international organizations, \nbut it should not be allowed to interfere with law enforcement against \ncriminal gangs and international criminal syndicates.\n  As things stand now, Taiwan gets some of the information it needs \nfrom the international police organization known as INTERPOL, but it is \nnot consistently made available. It is not reliable.\n  Taiwan doesn't have realtime access to INTERPOL's networks and \nsystems. This doesn't just hurt the people of Taiwan, but hurts people \nall over the world who are potential victims of criminals who cannot be \napprehended because we don't have an efficient sharing of information \nas part of this multilateral law enforcement agency.\n  It is for this reason that the bill directs the President to develop \na strategy to obtain at least observer status for Taiwan in the \nInternational Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL.\n  I commend the gentleman from New Jersey for managing this bill here \ntoday, and I commend the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific \nSubcommittee, Mr. Salmon, for introducing this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Committee on \nForeign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and \nTrade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I left Houston early this morning, I met with \nPresident Ma from Taiwan, and we had an interesting and wonderful \ndiscussion.\n\n[[Page H1319]]\n\n  Taiwan and the United States share a lot in common. Historically, \nduring World War II, for example, all the way up until today, the \nUnited States has been a great partner with Taiwan so as to make sure \nthat area of the world is free, that it is a democracy. It is a \nthriving democracy and the folks in Taiwan are proud of the fact of the \nrelationship that they have with the United States. This is another way \nthat we can help this thriving area, this thriving democracy, stay up \nto date on the world criminal gangs that are roaming throughout the \nworld.\n  Organized crime is an international crime now, Mr. Speaker, as you \nbeing a former judge would know. They are more sophisticated and they \nare more in-depth about how they promote their criminal syndicates \nthroughout the world. Most importantly, it is international. Crime has \nnow moved to sophistication beyond what it was when both the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee and I were practicing at the courthouse as judges.\n  Why not help out this organization, this group of people--Taiwan, 20 \nmillion-plus individuals--so that it can keep up with the information \nand the intelligence about crime, which affects the whole world?\n  It affects not only free societies, it affects societies that aren't \nso free.\n  INTERPOL is the group. It is the organization that tracks \ninternational crime. Taiwan should have this information. It should \nhave at least observer status to know what is going on with these \ncriminal syndicates throughout the world. China doesn't want Taiwan to \nhave INTERPOL access or even observer status. It is a political thing \nfor China. As my friend from New Jersey mentioned, China, it would \nseem, would want Taiwan to have access to information about criminals--\nor outlaws, as we call them.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. As the ranking member \npointed out so eloquently, it is such a good piece of legislation that \nthe Senate just copied it, put its name on it, and sent it back to us \nbecause it wants us to vote on it twice. We will vote on it twice and \nwe will show all concerned, especially the folks in Taiwan and the \ninternational community, that we support its right to know the \ninformation about criminals that lurk throughout the world.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, Taiwan already missed the INTERPOL General Assembly \nmeeting that took place last fall in Kigali, Rwanda. Our hope is that \nwith the passage of this bill, the United States will be able to figure \nout a way for Taiwan to observe the General Assembly meeting later this \nyear in Indonesia.\n  It is time that we insist that Taiwan be an observer to INTERPOL so \nthat everyone can benefit from increased safety and security. Blocking \nTaiwan from INTERPOL is not in the interest of any nation. And as Judge \nPoe just mentioned a moment ago, even the People's Republic of China \nwould benefit because this is all about trying to catch and to inhibit \ncriminals from moving effortlessly across borders; so it is in its \ninterest as well not to block Taiwan.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Salmon-Sherman bill which is \nbefore us today.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of S. 2426, \ndirecting the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to obtain \nobserver status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police \nOrganization (INTERPOL).\n  Last year, I supported H.R. 1853, which passed here in the House of \nRepresentatives, directing the Administration to develop a strategy to \nobtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police \nOrganization (INTERPOL), and for other purposes.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations, the empowerment of law \nenforcement in order that they be able to carry out their mandate in \nupholding the rule of law and preservation of peace and security are \nimperatives I believe we must continue to seek to facilitate here in \nthe homeland as well as in the global community from Nigeria to Taiwan \nand everywhere in between to maintain global stability and combat \nviolent extremism.\n  Our world today is fraught with global terrorism, with groups such as \nISIL, Boko Haram, al-Shabab and their other affiliates, utilizing \ninformation sharing and technologies to advance their vitriolic causes.\n  This is why organizing, inclusion and empowerment of nations willing \nto work together to combat domestic and global terrorism is in our \nglobal and national security interest.\n  This measure facilitates the United States' and the global \ncommunity's ability to move swiftly to empower police and law \nenforcement in our collective efforts of coordinating, preempting and \nacting swiftly in unison, strategically in combatting terrorism, crisis \nprevention and response and maintaining, peace, security, law, order \nand respect for the rule of law.\n  I join this bipartisan measure which seeks to facilitate INTERPOL \nmember states' efforts to promote Taiwan's ability to bid to obtain \nobserver status in the INTERPOL.\n  Indeed, since 1964, Taiwan had maintained full membership, but was \nejected 20 years later when the People's Republic of China (PRC) \napplied for membership.\n  Part of what the United States Administration can do is to take the \nlead in endorsing Taiwan in obtaining its observer status.\n  Let me underscore that the Administration and our Secretary of State \nare doing a fantastic job in diplomatic efforts on behalf of our \nnation, earning us goodwill in the global community.\n  The United States has expressed its affirmative intentions in support \nof Taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations, \nas delineated in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review.\n  For instance, Public Law 108-235 authorized the Secretary of State to \ninitiate and implement a plan to endorse and obtain observer status at \nthe annual World Health Assembly for six consecutive years, owing to \nTaiwan's significant contribution to the global community's efforts of \naddressing pandemic control and global public health issues of our day.\n  Indeed, the INTERPOL's constitution allows observer status at \nmeetings by police entities who are not members of the Organization.\n  The current status of non-membership status preludes Taiwan from \ngaining access to INTERPOL's I-24/7 global communications systems, an \nimportant real time information sharing infrastructure on domestic and \nglobal criminals.\n  The current state of affairs relegates Taiwan to hearsay or second \nhand information from friendly nations such as the United States.\n  This impedes Taiwan's ability to move swiftly in information \nacquisition as it relates to its domestic and global crime fighting \nefforts.\n  As a senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security, global and \nnational security efforts and infrastructures that promote global \ncommunications to achieve peace and stability are very important to me.\n  This measure seeks to protect our security interests in Taiwan as \nwell as the global security of the world.\n  Taiwan's inaccessibility to critical information readily made \navailable to its law enforcement forces places our entire world at \nrisk.\n  This measure seeks to facilitate Taiwan's direct and unobstructed \nparticipation in the International Criminal Police which promotes \nglobal security.\n  I support and urge the support of this measure because it is \nbeneficial for all nations and their police authorities to be able to \nshare information with authorized police authorities in their law \nenforcement and peacekeeping efforts in combatting local and global \ncrimes, including the contemporary crime of violent extremism.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this measure, \nwhich would direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to \nobtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police \nOrganization, also known as INTERPOL.\n  As a co-chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I support the \ndynamic U.S.-Taiwan relationship based on our shared values, deep \neconomic ties, and a history of close collaboration.\n  Gaining observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL would further enhance \nU.S.-Taiwan relations and provide for a pragmatic integration of Taiwan \ninto an international compact.\n  Taiwan's contributions to INTERPOL will strengthen law enforcement \ninitiatives to fight human trafficking, arms smuggling, terrorism, and \nother criminal threats.\n  Integrating Taiwan into an international law enforcement body like \nINTERPOL increases communication and information sharing to the benefit \nof the people of Taiwan and INTERPOL member countries.\n  This is a practical step that serves the interests of the U.S., \nTaiwan, and INTERPOL, and I would urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2426.\n\n[[Page H1320]]\n\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Shuster) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto\n\n[[Page H1321]]\n\ninclude extraneous materials on H.R. 4721.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4721, the Airport and Airway Extension Act \nof 2016.\n  This bill extends the authorization of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration programs through July 15, 2016. The bill also extends \nthe revenue collection authorities for the Airport and Airway Trust \nFund through March 31, 2017. The current FAA authorization expires at \nthe end of this month.\n  Without this bill, the authority to collect aviation taxes will \nlapse, depriving the trust fund of more than $30 million per day. That \nis $30 million a day for air traffic control, airport development, and \nother aviation programs that can never be recovered.\n  Additionally, airports will be unable to receive grant money that has \nalready been awarded to them, putting dozens of construction projects \nacross the country at risk of delay, cost overrun, or cancelation.\n  H.R. 4721 will avoid these unnecessary consequences while Congress \nworks to finish a long-term aviation bill.\n  On February 11, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee \napproved H.R. 4441, the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and \nReauthorization Act, or the AIRR Act.\n  The AIRR Act provides the transformational reform we need to \nmodernize our antiquated air traffic control systems; to ensure the \nsystem is safe and efficient; and to ensure the U.S. leads the world in \naviation.\n  The AIRR Act takes ATC out of the Federal bureaucracy and establishes \nan independent, not-for-profit corporation to provide and modernize ATC \nservice. This corporation will be governed by an independent board and \nrepresentatives of the public interest. This independent entity will \nprovide a service. It will not be given the public airspace.\n  And the FAA will continue to be our Nation's aviation safety \nregulator. Let me stress that the FAA will continue to be the Nation's \naviation safety regulator and that Congress will have full oversight \nover that entity.\n  The bill includes protections for general aviation and for service to \nrural communities. This structure gets ATC away from political \ninfighting and from an FAA management structure that has wasted \nbillions of dollars in trying to modernize the system.\n  I believe this reform will benefit passengers first, our communities, \nall system users, and will ultimately save taxpayers and the traveling \npublic billions of dollars.\n  The AIRR Act also streamlines the FAA certification process so as to \nimprove America's competitiveness and to protect jobs. It includes a \nrobust safety title, protects investment in airport infrastructure, and \npromotes passenger service reforms.\n  We have worked every step of the way under an open process in order \nto address concerns and find common ground to move forward. In the \nmarkup, the committee approved 44 amendments, mostly on a bipartisan \nbasis, to make the AIRR Act a better bill; but our work isn't done yet. \nWith so much at stake, it is critical that we get this reform right.\n  We are working with Members in the House to get the ball over the \ngoal line. Last week, Members of the Senate Commerce Committee \nintroduced its FAA reauthorization bill, and I look forward to working \nwith Chairman Thune. We have worked well with the Senate Commerce \nCommittee on the highway bill, on passenger rail reform, and on a \nSurface Transportation Board reauthorization. I believe we can be \nsuccessful on an aviation bill as well.\n  I am confident that we can produce a transformational FAA bill that \nwill restore our global leadership position in aviation and ensure that \nthe United States has the safest, most efficient aviation system in the \nworld. In the meantime, we need to pass this short-term extension, and \nI urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Here we are in the first or second short-term extension of the FAA, \nhopefully the last. The Senate has introduced a bill and I have had an \nopportunity to review the Senate bill. If you put the bills side by \nside, you will find very substantial agreement. In fact, there is very \nsubstantial agreement in the House over many of the critical provisions \nof the bill that relate to safety, to the future regulation of drones, \nto flight attendant risk, and numerous other provisions that were \nagreed upon during the markup.\n  The one major disagreement between the House and the Senate bills is \nthe same disagreement that exists here in the House, which is over the \nprivatization of the air traffic operations in this country.\n  I am not going to regurgitate the entire debate again here on the \nfloor. The point is, with both bills being so similar, absent \nprivatization, we could move well within the temporary extension.\n  In fact, we could probably have a bill done--well, we are not here \nvery much. Congress is having, I think, a record few number of \nlegislative days this year--but whenever we are going to be around \nagain. I think there is a week in April and maybe a couple of days in \nMay when we are going to be here and we could get this done. That seems \nto me to be the more prudent course.\n  The chairman and I do agree on what needs to be addressed at the FAA. \nFirst off, the biggest problem the FAA has is the United States \nCongress--the stupid shutdowns, sequestration, and other things which \nhave interrupted critical work, including procurement, and which have \ncertainly interrupted the orderly operation of the air traffic control \nsystem.\n  How do we protect the FAA from Congress and idiots who want to shut \ndown the government?\n  That is a tough one. I propose mandatory spending. The FAA is \nvirtually self-funding. With the current tax structure and without \nadopting a controversial new private fee structure that would be put \nthrough by the nonprofit corporation, the existing tax structure can \npay for virtually 100 percent of the FAA, as it is, on an ongoing \nbasis. If we adopted some efficiencies with a couple of other reforms, \nit would be in very, very robust shape and we would no longer have to \nrebut the idiocy of government shutdowns.\n  Now, there are certainly other parts of the government I care about \nthat shouldn't be shut down, but at least mandatory spending here, like \nwith Social Security checks and veterans' benefits, would say no, this \nis critical; it will continue even if, for some reason, Congress is so \ndysfunctional as to shut down funding for the government.\n  Secondly, procurement. Congress has been trying to reform procurement \nat the FAA since 1996. Unfortunately, back then, Congress didn't \nmandate procurement reforms. They merely gave the FAA license to depart \nfrom Federal procurement procedures if they so wished. In the end, \nunfortunately, either through the initiative of the FAA's or perhaps of \nsome of the people down at the Office of Management and Budget, the \nprocurement reforms were not done. In fact, they ended up with a system \nthat is pretty much the same as the other, which is perhaps even less \nfunctional than those of other Federal agencies.\n  Finally, personnel. Again, in 1996--20 years ago--Congress, in \nrecognizing this problem, gave the FAA the opportunity, the discretion, \nto adopt different personnel procedures, particularly as it relates to \nthe mid-level bureaucratic bulge in the agency which does lead to some \nanalysis, paralysis, and other problems that slow down needed measures \nor actions by the FAA.\n  I offered a very simple amendment that addressed those three things. \nIt shouldn't be controversial. It says let the FAA fund itself with the \nexisting tax structure and make that mandatory spending so we never \nshut them down again. Let's have procurement reforms and personnel \nreforms that are mandatory.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Unfortunately, that amendment failed and, instead, this privatization \nproposal prevailed. But that now has brought us to this point where, \nwhat is the path forward?\n  Okay. We are now going to extend this agency temporarily until just \nbefore the longest summer break in history for Congress. Well, I guess \nback in\n\n[[Page H1322]]\n\nthe 1940s and 1950s they used to take the summers off. But at least \nsince the invention and installation of air-conditioning, it is the \nlongest summer break in history.\n  So we have to get it done before then. Otherwise, Congress won't be \nback until sometime in September for a couple of days when it is not \nlikely to do any major legislation.\n  The stability and the predictability that we need with the FAA, the \nreforms we need--not just the ones I mentioned, but the reforms in \ndrones, the reforms to give flight attendants the same mandatory rest \nhours and many, many other provisions--that are in agreement between \nthe House and the Senate should not have to wait.\n  So I would hope that we won't drag this out until just before \nCongress adjourns and, instead, that we move forward with all dispatch \nafter the Senate acts this week, if the Senate acts this week--you \nnever can predict the Senate--and begin to correlate the few \ndifferences that I see between the bills.\n  Then, at some point, I think it will be time to give up on the \nprivatization proposal and move forward and put this bill into place.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yielf myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, just a couple of points to point out. Again, we talk \nabout privatization, but this is a not-for-profit corporation that is \ngoing to be governed by the stakeholders.\n  The government will have representatives, and the others that use the \nsystem will be on there to make sure that this entity operates in the \nmost efficient, safe manner possible. Just to point out, over 50 \ncountries around the world have done this and they have done it \nsuccessfully.\n  As the gentleman points out, in the bill that we passed, there is \nmuch agreement, but there are significant differences on this point.\n  The gentleman also points out, which I agree with, Congress is part \nof the problem. It is not just the bureaucrats at FAA. It is the way \nCongress funds things.\n  His solution to mandatory spending, though, I would oppose \nsignificantly because that takes the Congress out of the equation. It \ngives the FAA money.\n  They will get it automatically without Congress going through \nappropriations or any kind of real oversight by Congress. If it comes \ndown to it, it will be very difficult to change. The track record is \nvery, very clear.\n  As the gentleman points out, over time we have reformed over and over \nand over, given the FAA the ability to do things that other agencies \ndon't have.\n  But to paraphrase my good friend and colleague from Oregon who has \nsaid this a number of times, the only agency worse than the Department \nof Defense for procurement is the FAA. They just can't get it right. \nAnd Congress is an accomplice in that failure.\n  So, again, that reform I think will go great distances to make this a \nmodern FAA system, to be able to get it to operate with the GPS-based \nsystems, give us much more capacity, improve the airspace, decrease the \ntime it takes to fly places for the traveling public, and decrease the \namount of energy burned up, which will be good for the environment.\n  Again, I will continue to work with my colleagues and with the Senate \nto try to do something, which, really, its time has come, to \nsignificantly reform the FAA and do something that, again, over 50 \ncountries have done. Britain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, our \nallies around the world have done it successfully and with very, very \nsafe results.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, well, let's just set the record straight. Only two \ncountries have privatized. That is Canada and Great Britain.\n  In the case of Great Britain, the government and the taxpayers had to \ncome in and bail out the corporation. In the case of Canada, it was a \nvery prolonged transition, 7 or 8 years, which would set back NextGen \nfor a generation. So those were not without their problems.\n  There is a MITRE report, which looks at all of the other conversions \naround the world which were government corporations, not private \ncorporations. So there are only two that have gone to private \ncorporations.\n  All the other countries that have changed over have gone to \ngovernment corporations, and they also had transition issues. I mean, \nit is very instructive.\n  We haven't held hearings on the MITRE report or the recent GAO report \nthat point to the potential for disruption and seeing that this \nproposal won't cause the sorts of disruptions that happened in other \ncountries.\n  On the issue of mandatory spending, we would still, as the \nauthorizers, have the authority to direct that agency much more so than \nwe will have if we give it to a private corporation.\n  According to the most recent CBO report, they deem that this \ncorporation will be mandatory spending and it will be a private \ncorporation which will have the authority to tax.\n  So we are giving authority to a private corporation to establish some \nsort of a fee or tax structure--they can't tax; so it will be fees of \nsome sort--a fee for the amount of space that you take up in an \nairplane when you are flying over the country--who knows what those \nfees will be--we don't know--which would be potentially disruptive and \npotentially disadvantage other users of the system, which is why you \nhave all the regional airlines that fly 62 percent of the flights every \nday opposed to this bill.\n  You have Delta Air Lines, the largest airline, opposed to bill. You \nhave the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association opposed to this bill. \nYou have business aviation opposed to this proposal because they don't \nknow what this fee structure will be and how it might or might not \ndiscriminate against them.\n  So what I propose is that you keep the existing structure, which \neverybody can live with. Now, the airlines don't like it because every \ntime I buy an airline ticket and I pay the excise tax, the airlines say \nthat is their money.\n  I say no. That is actually a tax that is levied on me, as a \npassenger, which goes to the government. It is not their money.\n  But they think they can create a system where it won't be taking \nmoney out of their pocket, which they say the excise taxes do. But I \ndon't know where the $10 billion or so a year is going to come to.\n  Then, of course, the Office of Management and Budget also in this \nreport found last week that, with mandatory spending by this private \ncorporation, there will be a $19.848 billion deficit over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  Let me repeat that. Mandatory spending by a private corporation \nassessing some sort of new fee structure on users of the system, \nincluding passengers, and the OMB says that that would increase the \nFederal deficit by $19.848 billion.\n  Of course, the majority is always free to waive the rules and they \ncan ignore that. I mean, the rules have been waived numerous times to \ncreate more deficit around here, just by the discussion on the other \nside that they want to address the deficit whenever we eliminate taxes, \nwaive the rules, and pretend that actually eliminating taxes will raise \nmoney or it is budget-neutral.\n  I guess, in this case, they could waive the rules and say the \nmandatory spending by the private corporation that will lead to \nadditional deficit doesn't matter and it doesn't exist.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for pointing out the potential for \na prolonged period to get to NextGen.\n  We forget it has been a prolonged period. For over 20 years, we have \nbeen trying to get NextGen in the current system, and we haven't been \nable to get it.\n  It is the GAO, it is the Inspector General of the Transportation \nDepartment, and it is numerous reports that have said there is no end \nin sight as to when we can get NextGen, a GPS-based system.\n  Let me just point out--the gentleman mentioned Canada, which is a \nmodel we are looking at very closely. We certainly have made it to be \nan American model. But what has Canada done?\n  Canada, in this type of system, a not-for-profit corporation--which \nthis corporation will not be able to raise taxes,\n\n[[Page H1323]]\n\nwill not be able to put taxes. It will go to a user fee-based system.\n  What has Canada done? They have decreased the cost of those user fees \nby 30 percent over the last 20 years, a 30 percent decrease.\n  What they are doing this year is that the Canadian Nav Can will \nlaunch its first batch of satellites, and over the next 13, 14 months, \nuntil the next year of 2017, they will launch 70-plus satellites. They \nwill have visibility of 100 percent of the world's global airspace.\n  Today all of us together see about 30 percent. The Canadians will do \nthis based on a system that we are trying to move toward to implement. \nSo it has been a great success for Canada. It has lower costs. They are \ngoing to have a system that is deployed. It is safe.\n  The only good news about Canada doing it is that they are one of our \nbest allies. It is not the Russians and the Chinese doing it. If they \nwere doing it, we would be hell-bent on trying to get this done.\n  Let me just point back to, this is a system that the stakeholders \nwill be in charge of at the board level. The FAA will still be the \nregulatory agency.\n  So, again, this is something that is a long time coming. The Clinton \nadministration tried to do it. The Bush administration tried to do it.\n  The time has come. We should do this. We should not let the Canadians \nhave the ability that we don't have, even though they are our allies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have been down this path somewhat exhaustively, except we haven't \nheld exhaustive hearings to bring in the stakeholders, poke at this \nidea, see if there are alternatives and other ways to make the FAA into \na more efficient agency.\n  Actually, the Canadians are not launching a satellite. They are \nputting a module on a satellite, and they are allowing people to \nactually license in or lease in with them, which the FAA could do.\n  That is not the critical part of the infrastructure we need here in \nthe U.S. That satellite-based system will not be able to improve the \nground-based system that we have here in terms of our very, very busy \nairports. We land more planes in a day at LaGuardia than Canada lands \nin--I don't know how many days.\n  So the issue of our system and more efficiency in our system depends \non many things, including one thing which is a glaring omission in both \nthe House and Senate bills: runways, aprons, terminals. Guess what. \nBoth the House bill and the Senate bill stiff the airports.\n  We haven't allowed them to assess a reasonable increase in the \npassenger facility charge in many, many, many years. So even if this \nsystem becomes more efficient, one way or another, at some point, you \ncan't get more planes into LaGuardia without building another runway. \nThat is not going to happen. So we can't even talk about that.\n  There are other places where we could improve efficiency with another \nrunway, where you could improve efficiency with more terminal space, \nmore gates, more apron. Yet, the airports are not being allowed to \nassess a user fee to get there.\n  I actually was an original advocate for the passenger facility charge \nmany years ago when I saw the unfairness of the previous system.\n  I live in Springfield, Oregon, across the river from Eugene. Eugene \nhas the airport on their property. They had to build a new airport, and \nthey could only assess the fees in taxes against the people of Eugene. \nYet, people from Corvallis, people from Springfield, people from \nRoseburg, all use that airport.\n  So I thought it would be only fair to assess a passenger facility \ncharge for those sorts of improvements, which I probably enjoy more \nthan most people, flying more than most people. But we haven't allowed \nan increase in that, and certainly the costs of construction have not \ngotten any cheaper.\n  Many of the airports are bonded out. They don't have the capability \nof issuing more bonds without more revenue flow, but we seem to be \nignoring that.\n  So if you want to look at the system to increase efficiency as a \nwhole and to help the passenger experience, you have got to look at the \nsystem as a whole, and I am afraid we are a little bit short there.\n  Back to the corporate model, we don't know what the user fees will \nbe, which, again, is why business aviation, general aviation, the \nNation's largest airline and the regional airlines, which fly 62 \npercent of the airplanes every day, are all opposed to this black hole.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Suddenly we are going to have a private corporation that assesses \nsome sort of user fee, which is raising more than $10 billion a year to \npay for itself, and then the gentleman says that safety will remain \nwith the FAA. It will, with no funding.\n  So it is a crisis that every once in a while, you know, idiots take \nover, and we shut down the government, and that messes up air traffic \ncontrol, and then we go into sequestration. But it is okay if they shut \ndown every inspector in the FAA and everything else that goes into \nsafety in the FAA and everything that goes into certification at the \nFAA because that will all remain with the vestigial agency over in the \ngeneral fund with no funding source, because the assumption is all of \nthe existing excise taxes are going to be repealed and replaced by new, \nunknown user fees by the private entity.\n  So what is that new system and how and where is the money going to \ncome from for safety, for certification and all the other critical \nfunctions of the FAA? That is left to the total discretion of Congress, \nwith no funding source. At least today you can look at that and say: \nWell, we are paying for 93 percent of it through taxes that are being \nraised, that are dedicated; all we have got to do is come up with 7 \npercent. But now it will be: Wow, we have got to come up with 100 \npercent to fund those inspectors and those certifiers and all those \npeople over there. Wow, this is great; let's bifurcate the agency. Plus \nthe communications problem.\n  And, by the way, the certifiers will have to certify the new systems \nthat the private corporation is proposing to put in place, so the \ncertifiers are now laid off because of a dumb government shutdown but, \nhey, they can move ahead over here. Well, no, they can't move ahead. \nThey can't deploy any new systems because they are user fee-based, and \nthese people over here are general fund-based.\n  So I do not believe this solves the problem. I think it would be \nbetter to say, if you want to do this, do it the way President Clinton \ndid propose, which is a government corporation. He did not propose \nprivatization. Virtually the vast majority of the countries in the \nworld have gone with government corporations. If you do that, you don't \nhave some of the bizarre problems that they are trying to work around \nhere with the Constitution, which prohibits giving regulatory authority \nto a private entity.\n  Well, they work around that by saying everything the corporation \nwants to do has to be approved by the Secretary, who, by the way, will \nhave a giant new office of experts to advise him or her on whether or \nnot to approve the new fee structure, whether or not to approve the new \nroutes, whether or not to approve this or that or anything that is \nregulatory in nature. That all still has to go back to the Secretary, \nwho, by the way, is subject to Congress and the appropriations process \nand political appointment.\n  We aren't solving the problem. If this goes forward, you are not \nsolving the problem. I posit that you are creating more.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 11\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will say, point out for the Record, correct the \nRecord, first, the gentleman is correct: Canada is not launching \nsatellites. They are launching modules to go on satellites by the \ncorporation that they own about half of to deploy this GPS-based \nsystem. So, the gentleman is correct. Technically they are not \nsatellites, but they are components to go on satellites which will, in \nfact, see 100 percent of the global airspace, which America should be \ndoing.\n  The next thing I would like to correct is we have had numerous \nhearings\n\n[[Page H1324]]\n\non this. We have had over half a dozen hearings. In fact, we had one \njust before we marked the bill up. We have had over 12--I think maybe \neven 14 or 15--roundtable discussions with both sides of the aisle and \nstakeholders from all over the industries who sat there and talked to \nus about what they thought is good and what is bad.\n  The concern about safety--as I said, safety stays in government, and \ntoday the FAA safety certification portion of it is paid by the general \nfund. That is appropriate. The other fees, the taxes, we plan to \neliminate most of those taxes, eliminate those taxes and go to a user \nfee-based system.\n  There is plenty of money there. That will go to run the ATC system. \nThis way it will be in a user fee-based system, which history has shown \nus what Canada has done. History has shown us, I think, in many, many \ncases, when you take something outside the government that can go \noutside the government, it is run more efficiently. We will get out of \nthe starts and the stops of the appropriations process, of the \ngovernment shutdowns, of the 23 extensions last time.\n  This will be a better program. And the Secretary and the FAA will \nstill maintain that regulatory oversight, which, in fact, means that \nCongress will maintain regulatory oversight. And I don't know when \nCongress has not had oversight and, in many cases, screwed up many of \nthe private industries in this country by our overreach and our \noversight by putting rules and regulations in place that don't work. In \nthe case of the FAA, we rolled those back in many cases, let them go \noutside the Federal Government human resources rules and regulations. \nWhat did they do? They just kept on doing the same old thing.\n  So this is an opportunity for us, again, with extensive hearings, \nwith extensive experience around the world, looking at people who have \ndone it successfully. Again, I believe the time has come for us to do \nthis, to make this a modern aviation system that I believe will improve \nsafety, although we have an incredibly safe system today.\n  It will reduce the cost for the traveling public. It will make their \nflight times faster, more efficient, and it will be good for the \nenvironment. I don't see, really, anything in this that many, many \nMembers of this House can't embrace.\n\n  I will continue to talk about it and continue to push it because I \nreally believe the time is now to have a modern air traffic control \nsystem that will be the envy of the world, just as our aviation system, \nour airlines, the development of our airlines, and our manufacturers \nhave been for years. If we don't do it, I think we stand to diminish \nourselves in the world.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we invented aviation. We ought to make sure \nthat we continue to be the leaders in the world when it comes to \naviation, whether it is flying planes, building planes, or controlling \nthe airspace in the most efficient and safe way.\n  Again, I urge all my colleagues to support this short-term extension \nthat is on the floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this short-term bill to extend the FAA \nauthorization for three months and tax revenue for one year gives us \nmore time to negotiate bipartisan reforms that are needed. While I will \nsupport this extension, I'm concerned that Republicans are using this \nbill to buy time for privatization.\n  Let me be clear: we should not privatize the FAA. Privatizing the FAA \nwould put control of our skies in the hands of a private corporation \nthat put profits over passenger safety. It gives that private \ncorporation the power to tax the flying public who have no alternative. \nIt would increase complexity and lead to higher costs for passengers. \nIt would reduce air service to small and rural communities. And it \nhands a private corporation billions of dollars' worth of taxpayers' \nproperty and other assets--free of charge.\n  Capt. Chesley Sullenberger, the US Airways pilot who landed his \ndisabled aircraft on the Hudson River in 2009, agrees. He told \nPOLITICO: ``There ought to be other, better ways to make sure that air \ntraffic control has long-term, consistent funding for capital \nimprovements other than eviscerating access to the air traffic control \nsystem for anyone other than airlines.''\n  I think we can all agree that there are improvements that can and \nshould be made to the FAA, and this bill gives us time to work toward \nthem. But we should not cloak those improvements in a bill that gives \nup Congress's jurisdiction and harms taxpayers.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, there are times in history we are ashamed \nof, times when people were faced with great evil and the world looked \naway.\n  Cambodia's Communist regime massacred its people. Many in the world \nmade excuses for them. Stalin purged Russians and starved the nation of \nUkraine. He was praised by a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.\n  The Jewish people of Europe were systematically murdered by Hitler, \nbut the world was too afraid to see the truth. The scales were only \nlifted from their eyes when millions were already dead. At the time, \npeople made excuses for their decision to look away. They said the \npolitics were too dicey, or it wouldn't be diplomatic, or sometimes \nthey couldn't believe that such evil exists.\n  When we look back, those excuses don't make sense. They don't matter. \nWhat matters is that people were dying and the world didn't notice. \nEvil does exist, but ignoring it or refusing to call it by its name \ndoes not make it go away.\n  ISIL is murdering Christians. They are targeting people who share my \nfaith, the faith of many people in this House, people who believe in \nJesus Christ. Because of that belief, they are being marked for \nexecution. ISIL is murdering and enslaving religious and ethnic \nminorities everywhere they gain power, and we know it.\n  We know what they are doing, and if we don't say it, we should be \nashamed. ISIL is committing genocide. They are targeting non-Muslims, \nChristians, Yazidis, and more, and pushing them to extinction.\n  But we also can't ignore what else is happening in Syria. The Assad \nregime and its allies are indiscriminately killing on a breathtaking \nscale. Torture, rape, chemical weapons, barrel bombs, forced \nstarvation--the Syrian regime is targeting civilians and millions are \nsuffering.\n  The world cannot look away. The Obama administration cannot dance \naround the question. Today the House stands firmly to proclaim to the \nworld that genocide is happening, that evil is real, and that it must \nbe stopped. We urge the administration to join us.\n  We must look evil in the face and confront it, because if we do not \nwake up, more innocent blood will be shed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1327-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING INTERNATIONAL PI DAY\n\n  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join \nmathematicians, math lovers, and millions around the world in \ncelebrating International Pi Day. Observed every year on March 14, \nbeginning at 1:59 p.m., Pi Day recognizes the mathematical constant \nknown as pi. It also coincides with the birthday of one of science's \ngreatest minds and former resident of my district, Albert Einstein.\n  While many will celebrate today by indulging in a tastier type of \npie, today offers a much more serious reminder of the importance of \ntechnology, engineering, and math, fields that help strengthen our \nNation's economy and security. Studies have shown little improvement in \nmath and science test scores in the United States since 1995.\n  And so as we honor the concept of pi and the legacy of Einstein, I \nask my colleagues to join me in renewing our commitment to outstanding \nSTEM education in our schools and support of STEM at the Federal level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1327-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING WAYZATA HOCKEY TEAM\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, Indiana has its basketball, Texas has its \nfootball, but in Minnesota it doesn't get much better than the annual \nhigh school hockey tournament.\n  I would like to congratulate the Wayzata High School boys hockey team \nfor taking home the title with a tough 5-3 victory for the championship \nover Eden Prairie. The Trojans, under Coach Pat O'Leary, fought back \nfrom a 3-1 deficit to claim their first ever State hockey title.\n  The State hockey tournament is always a tremendous event, with fans \nfrom around Minnesota descending on St. Paul to fill up the Xcel Energy \nCenter to cheer on their teams.\n  The players at Wayzata should be very proud of their accomplishments \non and off the ice. I want to recognize their commitment not just to \ntheir sport, but to spending time in the classroom and in the community \nto become outstanding student athletes.\n  Mr. Speaker, the family, friends, and fans are very proud of the \nWayzata High School hockey team.

Mr. Speaker, Iran once again has blatantly scoffed \nat the West by breaking its agreements.\n  Just this last week, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps test-\nfired several ballistic missiles. The missiles were reportedly designed \nto hit our ally Israel and were inscribed in Hebrew, ``Israel must be \nwiped out.''\n  Under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, Iran is forbidden from \nundertaking any work on missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. \nBut the Iranians will do what suits them. The West--specifically, the \nUnited States--probably will do nothing about this test. The Ayatollah \nconveniently breaks international agreements.\n  Under the same U.N. agreement, the Ayatollah is prohibited from \nbuying conventional arms for the next 5 years, but the Ayatollah broke \nhis word again. The U.N. agreement has not stopped Iran from \nnegotiating an arms sale with the saber-rattling Russians.\n  Mr. Speaker, the ink is barely dry on the so-called deal that the \nObama administration made with Iran. Iran is a rogue nation determined \nto destroy the United States and Israel. Meanwhile, the United States \nsits blissfully by and just wrings its hands.\n  Iran must be stopped. Sanctions must be enforced, and eventually the \ncitizens of Iran must change their government.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1327-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1327-H1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING FIRST TWO RECIPIENTS OF CONGRESSIONAL PATRIOT AWARD\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate \nCongressmen Sam Johnson and John Lewis for being named the first two \nrecipients of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Congressional Patriot \nAward.\n  This prestigious award was established to biennially honor two \nMembers of Congress who have placed the interests and the goals of \nnation above all other concerns.\n  As a former U.S. Air Force pilot, Sam Johnson truly understands what \nit means to serve one's country. He flew combat missions in both the \nKorean\n\n[[Page H1328]]\n\nand the Vietnam wars, and he spent nearly 7 years as a prisoner of war \nin Hanoi after he was shot down over Vietnam. I commend Sam Johnson for \nhis tireless work to support America's men and women in uniform as well \nas for his efforts on behalf of all veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also have much praise for another wonderful colleague, \nJohn Lewis. John's record of fighting for civil rights and civil \nliberties dates back to the 1960s, when he was named chairman of the \nStudent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and served as the youngest \nkeynote speaker alongside Dr. Martin Luther King at the March on \nWashington in 1963.\n  Congressmen Sam Johnson and John Lewis have both lived lives of \ndistinction, and I expect that tomorrow night's inaugural ceremony at \nthe Library of Congress will be a great testament to their life of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1328-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PREVENTING CRIMES AGAINST VETERANS ACT\n\n  (Mr. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf \nof our Nation's veterans, who have been targeted by criminals seeking \nto defraud them.\n  Last year, veterans in my district brought to my attention that these \nindividuals are advertising themselves to the veterans community, \nclaiming that, for a fee, they can speed up their claims with the VA.\n  Now, everybody knows that the claims process at the VA is far too \nslow, but these people are deliberately seeking out veterans, \npurporting to speed up this process with their VA claims, which they \ncannot do, then illegally charging them exorbitant fees and then \ndisappearing.\n  I introduced a bill with my fellow Floridian and neighbor, Democrat \nTed Deutch, titled the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act, to \npenalize these fraudsters who are blatantly engaging in a scheme to \ndefraud our veterans.\n  Yes, that is true, these people prey on American veterans. So it is \nour duty to ensure that our heroes are protected under every aspect of \nthe law.

Mr. Speaker, I rise with great sadness and \noverwhelming grief to acknowledge the passing of my beloved staff \nmember, Tiffany Joslyn.\n  As we return to Washington, I did not want one day to pass without a \ntribute to her, although I will return again with more details and more \nexpressions of how talented she was.\n  Tiffany died Saturday, March 5, in a very tragic car accident while \ntraveling between Rhode Island and Massachusetts, having gone home to \nmourn with her family on the passing of a relative.\n  The greatest tragedy of all is that not only did Tiffany lose her \nlife, but her beloved only brother died and his wife was injured in the \nsame accident.\n  I come today to acknowledge her light and to tell her parents of the \ngreat respect Tiffany has garnered throughout the Washington community \nand beyond.\n  She was a brilliant writer. She served as Deputy Chief Counsel of the \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations \nof the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Republicans and Democrats loved her well. She had the kind of spirit, \ngenerosity, and eagerness to get the job done that everyone loved.\n  Tiffany had a passion to help the most vulnerable and those who were \ncaught up in the criminal justice system unfairly, but also those who \ndeserved restoration and rehabilitation. Together we were on a journey \nto continue to find a way to reform the criminal justice system.\n  She made great progress. Two of the bills we worked on have already \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee, and I am praying that they come \nto the floor not only in her name, but in the names of all the \nvulnerable people that would benefit from her great work.\n  To her family, this tragedy is so enormous that words cannot comfort, \nbut you should know that your daughter and your late son were lights to \nso many. May good bless them as they rest in peace, for they left a \nlegacy. It will go on and on.\n  I am ever grateful for the opportunity to work with Tiffany, a young \nwoman with a big heart and maybe even an old soul. She had a lot to \ngive and a lot of intellect to make a difference in this world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1328-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1328-H1336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GENOCIDE IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. \nFortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, we are living in a time of great \npolitical difficulty. That is not a secret to anyone.\n  Just moments ago the House of Representatives did something \nessential. We came together not in a bipartisan fashion, but in a \ntrans-partisan fashion, rising above the petty difficulties that we \nseemingly cannot ever resolve, and spoke to the heart of something that \nis essential for all of humanity. We declared together what is \nhappening in the Middle East to Christians, Yazidis, and others to be \ngenocide.\n  I am extraordinarily proud of this body for speaking clearly, for \nspeaking factually, and for speaking about this grave injustice that is \nhappening to so many ancient faith traditions.\n  This is a grave injustice, and it is an assault to human dignity. \nThis grave injustice is a threat to civilization itself when one group \nof persons, namely, ISIS, can systematically target another group of \npersons because of their faith.\n  That destroys the very basis for international order, tranquility \namong people, and for civilization itself. That is why what we did \ntonight in speaking so clearly and rising above differences in a \nunanimous fashion is so extraordinary.\n  I owe an extreme debt of gratitude to my colleague, Anna Eshoo from \nCalifornia. Anna has been a stalwart leader in this effort. Her own \nethnic background is Chaldean. She has an intimate familiarity with the \nMiddle East and the suffering of this group of people.\n  Anna has led Congress on her side of the aisle and my side of the \naisle, in partnership with me, to continue to try to confront the \nscandal of silence, the indifference toward what is happening to these \nancient faith traditions that have as much a right to be in their \nancestral homeland as anyone else.\n  In June of 2014, in the Iraqi city of Mosul, there was an eerie \nsilence one morning. For the first time in two millennia, the church \nbells didn't ring.\n  Mosul is one of those diverse cities in the Middle East. It had a \nrich tapestry, a vibrancy of various faith traditions: Christians, \nYazidis, Muslims.\n  There were differences of religious perspectives, sometimes tension, \nbut they found a way to continue to contribute an interdependency \ntoward the well-being of that community.\n\n  They were invaded by eighth century barbarians with 21st century \nweaponry:\n\n[[Page H1329]]\n\nISIS. The Christians who were there were told to leave, convert, or die \nby the sword.\n  Many fled with just what was on their back. The remaining Christians \nin the homes had this painted on their door. This is the Arabic symbol \nfor the letter N.\n  It stands for Nazarene, which is a derogatory term used by some in \nthe Middle East to describe the Christians. This was painted on their \ndoor as a sign that it was time for them to go or they would die, \nexcept it wasn't painted in nice gold like this. It was painted blood \nred.\n  We have so many tragedies and difficulties facing humanity, we can \nsometimes become numb to the violence that is happening in so many \nplaces in the world because it is overwhelming.\n  But when you have one group of people who has extreme disregard for \nthat sacred space of humanity, for that sacred space of conscience and \nindividual rights that are expressed in religious freedom, you not only \nhave a threat to a group of people far away, but you have a threat to \nthe underpinnings of civilization itself.\n  I happened to be in the room when Pope Francis was given a small \nChristian cross, a crucifix. This cross had belonged to a young Syrian \nman. He had been captured by the jihadists.\n  He was told: Convert or die. So he chose. He chose his ancient faith \ntradition. He chose Christ. He was beheaded. His mother was somehow \nable to recover his body and this cross and bury him. She fled and came \nto Austria. Through this means, the small cross came into the \npossession of the Holy Father.\n  This is not an isolated story. It has happened over and over and over \nagain, as persons who were denied their life or denied the very \nconditions for life and they had to flee. This is called genocide.\n  The International Association of Genocide Scholars, the prestigious \nacademic body, has labeled this genocide. Genocide Watch has called \nthis genocide. The Yazidi international community has labeled this a \ngenocide. Pope Francis has said so. Presidential candidates on both \nsides of the aisle have said so. Now the House of Representatives has \ndeclared it so as well.\n  I live in Lincoln, Nebraska, and I am privileged to represent the \nlargest Yazidi community in America. It is not a community that I have \ngotten to know just recently because of all the difficulties that they \nhave had. We have worked with them for many, many years.\n  Many of these Yazidi families were translators for the United States \nArmy during the height of the Iraq war. Because of that, this body, by \nlaw, gave them special citizenship options to live here in America, and \nmany settled in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n  About a year and a half ago, a number of young men in the Yazidi \ncommunity came to see me. They were on the verge of tears.\n  They spoke passionately, even angrily--and I don't blame them for \nbeing angry--Congressman, do something. Our mothers, our sisters, our \nfamilies, are trapped in Sinjar and ISIS is coming for them. We don't \nhave the capacity to stop them. Help us. You are the only ones who can. \nHelp us. Please, do something. There is no more time.\n  The Yazidi community also took its case to Washington. Around the \nsame time a resolution that was led by my good friend, Congressman \nVargas, who will speak momentarily, and passed by us in the House of \nRepresentatives, which called for international humanitarian assistance \nin northern Iraq for the besieged people, laid some of the groundwork, \nwhich was a very prudential decision--and I commend President Obama for \nit--to stopping what was certain to be a slaughter on Mount Sinjar, \nsaving the remnants of the Yazidi people who were still there.\n  So today we, as a body, are calling upon the international community \nas well as the fullness of our own government to act and to call this \ngenocide.\n  This is one of those Yazidi translators. His name is Omar. Again, he \ngained his citizenship because he was so sacrificially helpful to us \nduring the height of the Iraq war. He has lost 36 family members of the \nYazidi community to the violence.\n  He recently went back to the liberated areas of Sinjar and saw the \nbombed remains of the ancient Christian church here. He took it upon \nhimself--a Yazidi man that does not share the Christian tradition--to \nput a makeshift cross over the site where the Christians previously \nlived.\n  Why is this genocide designation important? It is just to Omar and \nhis family. It is just to the Christians who died or had to flee. It is \njust to the other people who are under severe persecution. By the way, \nI should note that the people who have been killed the most by ISIL are \ninnocent Muslims.\n  The genocide declaration, though, declares that there is a systematic \nattempt to exterminate this ancient faith tradition of the Christians, \nYazidis, and others.\n  What it means is we are helping set the preconditions, if you will, \nfor when there is, hopefully, a real security settlement in northern \nIraq and in Syria and in other places and that the Christians, Yazidis, \nand others are fully integrated back into their ancient homeland and \ngiven fullness of rights as citizens, given fullness of protection and \nprocess, full integration into their own governance structures.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  By raising this banner tonight, I think we have done something good. \nIt is a word, but it is a powerful word.\n  In 2004, Colin Powell, then-Secretary of State, came to the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and he declared there what was happening \nin Darfur to be a genocide. In doing so, it helped put an end to that \ngrim reality.\n  So today the House has spoken, and I am proud that we have done so in \na transpartisan manner, with unanimity. What I hope this does is, \nagain, elevate international consciousness, calling upon the \nresponsible communities of the world to seek out constructive, creative \nways to help stop the violence, to help stop the persecution, to push \nfor the right type of security arrangements that will restore what was \nonce the rich tapestry of diversity of perspectives and beliefs in the \nMiddle East.\n  Without that, I have little hope. But with this, and the return of \npersons like Omar and others who respect differences, who have true \nfriendships, who are willing to sacrifice for their deep beliefs, these \nare the nobility of values that the ancient traditions can bring back \nto their shattered homeland; and that is why it is so important that we \nacted today.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me turn to, again, my good friend from California \n(Ms. Eshoo), who has worked tirelessly on this resolution and wants to \nshare her thoughts as well tonight.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from \nNebraska, the very distinguished Mr. Fortenberry. I thank him for his \nwords and for his magnificent remarks here on the floor this evening. \nWe obviously share the same sentiments.\n  I think if anyone is tuned in this evening for what we call a Special \nOrder, the Congress is not really held in great regard today, but there \nis on a day-to-day basis for so many of us a discovery of deep \nfriendship that is created, that comes about because we work so closely \ntogether on something that binds us, where we have not only common \nground, but the deep, deep values of our country that are embedded in \nus and everyone here, people across the country, and that we get to \nwork on it together.\n  Congressman Fortenberry is my brother, and I thank him. I thank him \nfrom the bottom of my heart for the values that he has expressed, the \nwork that he has put into this, and what it means to the people that we \nare speaking for.\n  This resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that the \natrocities that are being perpetrated by ISIS, they constitute war \ncrimes, and they are genocide against religious and ethnic minorities \nin Iraq and Syria and throughout the region.\n  Now, over the past decade we have really witnessed an acceleration. \nIt started when there was the invasion of Iraq, but it has heightened \nas the years have gone on. And now the assault on Christians and other \nreligious minorities, particularly by ISIS, has moved to a level of \nbarbarism that we read about in the history books, and is taking place, \nimagine, in the 21st century.\n  It has included the torture and the murder of thousands, the \ndisplacement\n\n[[Page H1330]]\n\nof millions, including Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, Armenians, \nTurkmen, Sabea-Mandeans, Kaka`e, Amalekites, and the Yazidis that Mr. \nFortenberry has spoken to and represents so magnificently. These are \nfamilies that are being torn apart, fathers and sons being executed, \nmothers and daughters being enslaved and raped.\n  The USA Today columnist, Kirsten Powers, painted a very vivid picture \nwhen she wrote in December of last year:\n\n       In October, Islamic State militants in Syria demanded that \n     two Christian women and six men convert to Islam. When they \n     refused, the women were publicly raped, and then beheaded \n     along with the men. On the same day, militants cut off the \n     fingertips of a 12-year old boy in an attempt to force his \n     Christian father to convert. When his father refused, they \n     were brutalized and they were both crucified.\n\n  Today, there are fewer than 500 Christians remaining in Iraq, down \nfrom as many as 1.5 million in 2003.\n  Now, the United Nations has written, come up with a definition some \ntime ago of what genocide actually is:\n\n       Any of the following acts committed with an intent to \n     destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or \n     religious group, as such: killing members of the group; \n     causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the \n     group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of \n     life calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in \n     whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent \n     births within the group; and forcibly transferring children \n     of the group to another group.\n\n  This is genocide, and this is what is actually taking place today. \nDespite the persecution of these hundreds of thousands of religious \nminorities, the United States has not spoken out; but tonight the \nUnited States House of Representatives has. And this is a seminal \nmoment for the House to have taken this on and to express unanimously \nthat this is genocide.\n  There are many things that we have worked on together, as members of, \nand other members as well, of the House Religious Minority Caucus; \nhumanitarian aid, protection, faster refugee processing for these \nvulnerable communities, and an official statement by the Congress. \nTonight that happened. We have labeled these atrocities for what they \nare, genocide.\n  I think that Congressman Fortenberry has stated in a most eloquent \nway why this is important.\n  First of all, this is one of the great values of our country, one of \nthe great, great values of our country, where we recognize religions of \npeople of all religious backgrounds.\n  Our Constitution, in just a few words, in just a few words, I \nbelieve, has prevented bloodshed, whereas in other places, it takes \nplace.\n  It is as deeply meaningful to me as a first-generation American, the \nonly Member of the entire Congress that is of Assyrian and Armenian \ndescent. This is a repeat of history of my family. It is why I am a \nfirst-generation American, because my grandparents fled, both sides of \nmy family, the Armenian side and the Assyrian side, for this very \nreason, because they were being hunted down and persecuted because they \nwere Christians.\n\n  We know that a century ago the world witnessed--but the House and the \nCongress is still silent on this, and we have to address that, too--\nwhen the Ottoman Empire rounded up and murdered Armenians, Greeks, and \nother minorities in Constantinople. By 1923, there were some 1.5 \nmillion women, children, and men who were lost. It was a systematic \ncampaign that we now know as and call the Armenian Genocide.\n  So for those in my family who told the stories, my grandparents, my \nparents, this is, for me, a bittersweet evening. But I think that they \nare all proud, those who have been called to God, and those who are \nstill with us, that the United States House of Representatives is \ncalling this out for what it is.\n  It matters when the United States speaks. Our voices collectively, \nthis evening, are going to echo around the world; and the stability, as \nCongressman Fortenberry spoke to, of these minority communities, have \nreally been the glue that have held these ancient communities together \nfor so long.\n  I, too, share the hope and pray for the day that there will be peace \nin the region and that they will be recognized and honored in their \ncommunities, on the lands, these ancient lands, with their ancient \nfaiths. I think that is the collective hope of all of us. The stability \nand, I think, the cultural identity of the Middle East depends on this.\n  The United States has always championed human rights, basic human \nrights, and civil and religious liberties, both at home and abroad. \nWhenever we go abroad, those are the issues that we raise with whomever \nwe are meeting with. I think that these are our most cherished values \nand, I think, America's greatest export.\n  During his trip to South America in July of 2015, Pope Francis called \nfor an end to this genocide of Christians in the Middle East, saying, \n``In this third world war which we are now experiencing, a form of \ngenocide is taking place, and it must end.''\n  I think his voice spoke, obviously, for the voiceless.\n  Bishop Demetrios of Mokissos, the Chancellor of the Greek Orthodox \nChurch of Chicago, recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal the \nfollowing:\n  ``It may seem like we in the United States have little ability to \nchange conditions in the Middle East and elsewhere. But that outlook \nhas too often led to inaction and great regret after crimes against \nhumanity have been allowed to unfold without intervention. The United \nStates and other members of the U.N. made a solemn vow in 2005 with the \npassage of the Responsibility to Protect, a response to crimes against \nhumanity. With genocide occurring before our very eyes, we must \nproperly identify the crimes and honor our international commitment \nunder the Responsibility to Protect.''\n  So, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, with the words of Pope Francis, \nBishop Demetrios, countless advocates across our country and around the \nworld, and the 203 bipartisan cosponsors of this resolution, and the \nvoice of the entire House, unanimous vote this evening of this \nresolution, I am very proud.\n  I am very proud and I am lastingly grateful to be a part of this body \nthat has spoken as one on this issue of enormous import and morality \nbecause we, tonight, have let it be known to the world that this is, in \nfact, the horror of genocide that is taking place in the Middle East.\n  Again, it is a moment of great pride to me, certainly to my family \nand to people, not only my own people, but to those across the United \nStates, the religious leaders of all faiths that have spoken out.\n  This tonight, the evening of March 14, 2016, will live on and \nhistorians will record that we indeed did the right thing.\n  So I thank you all.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Historians will record that we indeed did the right thing. So I thank \nyou all.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. I thank the gentlewoman for your impactful, \nimportant, heartfelt, and beautiful words of sympathy and compassion, \nbut also for your action.\n  What you said, particularly regarding not only respecting the ancient \nfaith traditions, but honoring them in their native lands, ought to be \nwhat we are all striving for. So I thank you for your beautiful \nstatements.\n  Now I would like to turn to my friend and colleague, Congressman \nTrent Franks, a Congressman from Arizona who, again, has been a \nstalwart leader on all types of assaults to human dignity as they \nmanifest themselves in so many difficult ways across the spectrum of \nlife. So I am grateful for your friendship and for your leadership as \nwell.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank \nCongressman Fortenberry especially for his leadership and courage on \nthis issue. I thank Congresswoman Eshoo not only for her personal \ncourage, but just for the perspective that she brings to this House \ngiven her ancestors and the family history that she has with some of \nthe challenges that are so parallel to what we are talking about \ntonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe the United States of America has been the \ngreatest national force for good the world has ever known. Our Nation \nhas made sacrifices to the extreme to extinguish some of the worst \nevils that have plagued humanity across the decades. I am honored to \nstand here with my colleagues who have led this fight to call the \nIslamic States' insidious campaign\n\n[[Page H1331]]\n\nof terror against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious communities \nwhat it is: genocide.\n  For months, noble organizations like the Knights of Columbus and \ncountless valiant individuals have worked tirelessly to document \nevidence of genocide against ancient faith communities in Iraq and \nSyria. Hundreds of pages containing accounts of massacres, unimaginable \nbrutality, and uncovered mass graves have been delivered to world \nleaders, including the Obama administration, in an effort to condemn \nISIS violence as the genocide that it most certainly is.\n  Recognition of genocide with the passage of H. Con. Res. 75 is due in \nlarge part to the conviction and commitment of these organizations and \nindividuals--and for that humanity owes them great and profound \ngratitude. Yet today, despite all of the overwhelming evidence, this \nadministration remains stunningly silent.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the words of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a \nGerman Lutheran pastor and anti-Nazi dissident, who said: ``Silence in \nthe face of evil is evil itself: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to \nspeak is to speak. Not to act is to act.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we are now witness to some of the most glaring and \nbrutal attacks against the universal human right of religious freedom \nin history. ISIS has been the very face of evil. We have seen hundreds \nof thousands of civilians flee the land of their spiritual heritage. We \nhave seen mass executions and beheadings. We have seen the destruction \nof ancient places of worship and sacred sites. We have seen women and \nchildren assaulted and sold as commodities in a modern-day slave \nmarket--sometimes little girls for as little as 50 cents.\n  We have seen the Islamic State desecrate, violate, humiliate, and \nstrip innocent men, women, and children of their God-given human \ndignity. And why? Because there is no place for Christians, Yazidis, \nand other religious communities in the Islamic State's self-proclaimed \ncaliphate. The message of this metastasizing cancer is clear: those who \ndo not conform to their abhorrent ideology will be destroyed.\n  Mr. Speaker, this administration has been fully aware that \nChristians, Yazidis, and other religious communities have been \nsubjected to the most extreme kind of brutality and barbaric attacks. \nThe Islamic State has publicly declared their intent to annihilate \nthose who do not submit to their caliphate, stating, ``it will continue \nto wage war against the apostates until they repent from apostasy. It \nwill continue to wage war against the pagans until they accept Islam.'' \nMr. Speaker, justice demands that this be condemned as genocide.\n  Today, the cries of the innocent should compel us to act. Refusal to \nacknowledge and specifically name Christians, Yazidis, and other \nreligious communities in a designation of genocide would be one of the \nmore disgraceful chapters in the Obama administration's shameful and \nabhorrent response to the insidious evil of the Islamic State.\n  The conspicuous silence of this administration and its failure to act \ndecisively not only has the gravest of implications for thousands of \ninnocent fellow human beings, but it also sends a message to the world \nthat the United States of America, which has long served as an impetus \nfor freedom and justice, has either lost the moral conviction to defend \nthe lives of the innocent or the political will to crush the evil that \ndesecrates them.\n  Not to speak is to speak, Mr. Speaker. Not to act is to act, Mr. \nSpeaker. And the world is watching what we will--or, shamefully, will \nnot--say or do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would adjure the President of the United States and \nSecretary Kerry not to callously continue to stand by in silence and \nlet this evil relentlessly proceed.\n  With that, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. I thank my friend, Congressman Franks of Arizona, \nfor his powerful statement. Not to speak is to speak. Of all people in \nthe body, I think that is a marked tribute to the Congressman who has \nworked tirelessly and spoken out on behalf of the protection of \ninnocent persons.\n  Now I want to turn to my good friend, Congressman Juan Vargas from \nCalifornia, who as well has helped in an extraordinary way to further \nnot only this cause, but, again, trying to elevate the nobility of the \nideal that we should all be united in mind, heart, and spirit if we are \ngoing to be persons who respect the rules of law, the standards for \ninternational order, or, more basically, our need for one another.\n\n  I am so grateful for your willingness to speak out on a whole host of \nissues, and thank you for coming tonight, Congressman Vargas.\n  Mr. VARGAS. Thank you, very much, Congressman Fortenberry, and also \nAnna Eshoo for your courage to come forward and for your words today \nand for your powerful words that you gave a moment ago to call genocide \nwhat it is: genocide, what we are seeing with Christians in particular, \nYazidis, and others. So, again, thank you very much for allowing me to \nspeak today.\n  I would also like to congratulate both of you on the passage of H. \nCon. Res. 75, which expresses the sense of Congress that the atrocities \nperpetrated by ISIS against religious and ethnic minorities are indeed, \nas I said, genocide, crimes against humanity. I sincerely hope that the \nObama administration will see the bipartisan show of support for this \ntimely resolution as an impetus to clearly and forthrightly declare \nthese acts genocide, because that is what they are. So I am hoping that \nthey take action.\n  Around the world, political and religious leaders have spoken out to \ncondemn ISIS' acts of raping, kidnapping, torturing, and killing of \nChristians, Yazidis, Shias, Turkmens, and other religious minorities.\n  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the European Parliament, the \nKurdistan Regional Government, and His Holiness, Pope Francis have \ncalled these actions by their proper name: genocide--genocide.\n  I would like to echo the words of Pope Francis, who eloquently \nstated: ``Our brothers are being persecuted, chased away, they are \nforced to leave their homes without being able to take anything with \nthem. I assure these families that I am close to them and in constant \nprayer. I know how much you are suffering; I know that you are being \nstripped of everything.''\n  It has almost been 2 years since the fall of Mosul, when ISIS warned \nreligious minorities living under its jurisdiction to either convert to \nIslam, pay a cumbersome religious tax, or be executed. I won't go \nthrough all the atrocious acts that they have committed. I think that \nthey were spoken of already here in a very dramatic way. Again, they \ndid what they said they were going to do; and that is ISIS said that, \nif you didn't leave, if you didn't convert, you would be executed. That \nis, in fact, what they have done in the most horrific way.\n  We have to act. It is time for us to act. I believe that this mass \nexodus represents the largest forced displacement in the Middle East \nsince the Armenian genocide in Turkey 100 years ago.\n  A genocide, known as the crime of crimes, has both legal and moral \nimplications under both Federal and international law. This means that \nif a genocide is declared, it will demand American leadership and \nresources to prevent and punish the ongoing assault of Christians, \nYazidis, and other religious minorities that are targeted for \nextinction.\n  While I applaud the various actions and commitments the Obama \nadministration has made to alleviate the suffering of thousands of \nvictims of ISIS, I strongly and firmly believe we can, we should, and \nwe must do more.\n  History is full of examples of leaders who opposed these mass \natrocities in abstraction but similarly opposed any action in the \nmoment. I call on President Obama and Secretary Kerry to take the first \nstep in firmly calling this egregious situation a genocide. It is past \ntime to speak the truth to power and not to mince any words, and we \nshouldn't mince any words.\n  Lastly, I would say this. This has been a bipartisan effort. I did \nhave the opportunity to travel to Erbil with Congress Members Darrell \nIssa and John Mica. We were able to talk to victims there of this \nhorrific genocide, and we were able to talk to the Kurds who were, in \nfact, helping dramatically, many of them losing their own lives because \nthey wanted to protect Christians and Yazidis.\n\n[[Page H1332]]\n\n  We have to do more. Unfortunately, we probably won't get much \ninformation. Maybe if I went over and punched my good friend Jeff--out \nof love, of course, brother--maybe we could get some attention to this \nmatter. But we have to shout out, and we have to get the attention of \nthe administration. We have to do something. We have to do something \nbecause this is genocide, and we just can't sit idly by.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. I want to thank my good friend, Congressman Vargas, \nfor your impactful words. If it does take your coming over here to \npunch me, come on, let's go, because that is worth it.\n  I want to also reiterate something I mentioned earlier. It was your \nresolution that called for an international humanitarian intervention \nthat I feel created the environment, the condition, which was \nempowering to the Obama administration to intervene on behalf of the \nYazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar. That is an overlooked fact and \nconsideration around here. But I am glad to say it, and I want to thank \nyou for calling as well, urging the administration to act in this \nregard. You have the moral authority to do so.\n  I know Secretary Kerry has sympathies in this regard, but just like \nthe Yazidis when they were trapped on the mountain, to wait in the face \nof clear facts is to potentially not only lose time, but to lose lives \nand lose the option for, again, setting the preconditions for \nreintegration of these ancient faith traditions back into their \nancestral homelands. So I thank you for your good words.\n  Now I want to turn to my good friend Congressman Sean Duffy from \nWisconsin, an outspoken man of the House who has not been afraid to \nconfront, as well, the various problems facing humanity and the \nassaults on human dignity as they have manifested themselves and \nfractured our society and so many others in so many ways. So I thank \nyou, Congressman Duffy.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding, and I \nam grateful for all of your work, Congressman Fortenberry, Congressman \nVargas, and Congresswoman Eshoo.\n  Sometimes people look at this House and think that all we do is fight \nand disagree. I am not going to talk about you two punching each other \nto get a little more press, but it is a remarkable night when we all \ncome together and stand together on such an important issue as this, \nwhere we all lend our voices to an incredibly important cause.\n\n  We spent a lot of time tonight talking about the atrocities, and I am \ngoing to join in because we can't say enough all that has happened.\n  Two million Christians called Iraq home prior to 2013. Fewer than \n300,000 reside there today. Many were victims of killing or \nkidnappings, others forced to leave their homes by radicals, al Qaeda \nor ISIS.\n  In Syria, Christians accounted for 10 percent of the population, but \ntoday their numbers have declined to less than 1 million. Last summer, \nISIS kidnapped nearly 300 Christians in a Syrian village and then later \nransomed them back to their families for an average of $100,000 per \nperson.\n  When ISIS invaded Mosul, Iraq, in 2013, as Mr. Fortenberry mentioned, \nthey tagged Christian homes with an N for Nazarene, and then they gave \nthe occupants a choice: you can convert, you can flee, or you would \nface death. In July of 2014, ISIS announced that the city, no doubt, \nwas Christian-free--no surprise.\n  In 2014, August, a woman from Bartella, Iraq, recounted the night \nthat ISIS came into her village and then into her home and accused her \nof putting gold coins in her 11-month-old baby's diaper. So they took \nher baby, threw her baby on the couch, beat her baby, and threw her up \nagainst the wall. Eventually, they let her leave, but they kept her \nhusband and made him convert.\n  In February of 2015, ISIS slaughtered 21 Coptic Christians on a \nLibyan beach, pointing them towards Rome, and proclaimed this message: \n``Signed with blood to the nation of the cross.''\n  In March of 2016, this month, four nuns, members of the Missionaries \nof Charity, founded by the late Mother Teresa of Calcutta, were \nexecuted by gunmen in Yemen.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Their crime? They were caring for the elderly and the disabled. Pope \nFrancis called them today's martyrs.\n  Just yesterday gunmen stormed three hotels on the Ivory Coast. Among \nthe 18 people who were killed was a 5-year-old boy--a 5-year-old boy--\nwho was shot in the head. But eyewitnesses report that the friend who \nwas with him was spared his life because he was able to recite a Muslim \nprayer.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are hardly isolated incidents. As we have talked \nabout tonight, this is genocide. The Knights of Columbus submitted a \n280-page report chronicling the persecution of Christians by the \nIslamic State to the State Department this week.\n  The leader of ISIS recently released a video that made very clear \ntheir intent to destroy Christians throughout whatever means possible. \nHe said:\n\n       The co-existence of Christians and Jews is impossible, \n     according to the Koran.\n\n  I don't think we have to scratch our heads and ask ourselves what is \nhappening in Iraq and Syria. Pope Francis recently condemned the \nwholesale slaughter of Christians by ISIS, saying that entire Christian \nfamilies and villages are being completely exterminated.\n  I look at this House tonight and I am proud that we have so many men \nand women who are willing to stand up and lend their voice to this \ngreat cause.\n  We have a reputation in America as being a beacon of light, men and \nwomen who stand up for freedom, better known as freedom fighters, \nfreedom of life, freedom of religion.\n  When there are atrocities in the world, we stand up and lend a voice \nto those who are being persecuted, those who are downtrodden.\n  I am disappointed that the President has been unwilling to join this \nHouse and call the atrocities in Syria and Iraq a genocide. The first \nstep to making sure this ends is that we speak the truth about what is \nactually happening.\n  Hopefully, if the President is watching tonight, he will see that we \nhave both Republicans and Democrats who agree on this very important \nissue. Hopefully, he will join us and take that first step to shedding \nlight on what is happening in Iraq and Syria.\n  Mr. Fortenberry, I commend you for your good efforts on this very \nimportant issue. I am proud to stand with you and the rest of this \nChamber to make sure those who might not know that people care about \nthem as they are going through pain and anguish--we hear about the sex \nslaves, young little girls who are held captive, little Christian and \nYazidi girls--that they know that people hear them, people care about \nthem, and people are doing here in America all we can to help them out \nof this crisis. Thank you for your work.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Thank you for your powerful words, Congressman \nDuffy. The report that you mentioned is right here. Again, it is a 280-\npage report submitted to the State Department just recently.\n  The cover shows that moment where these Coptic Christians from Egypt, \nwho are guilty only of the crime of going to Libya to try to work and \nearn enough money to sustain their families, were captured by ISIS and \nthen beheaded.\n  This report lays out the facts. It is not the opinion of the House of \nRepresentatives. It is not my opinion or yours. The fact is that this \nis a genocide.\n  I am grateful not only to the Knights of Columbus and the \norganization called In Defense of Christians for producing this, but it \nbasically is a thorough documentation of what has happened that adds \nfurther credibility to what we already know and so many people around \nthe world have called genocide.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black), \nmy good friend.\n  Thank you for being here tonight.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I thank you, Mr. Fortenberry, for bringing us together to \ntalk about a most serious topic, one that goes to our heart and makes \nus so sad for what is happening to these remarkable people who stand up \nfor their faith.\n  Mr. Speaker, just today the Associated Press reported that President \nObama would likely miss the March 17 deadline established by Congress \nfor his administration to determine whether or not ISIS has committed \ngenocide.\n\n[[Page H1333]]\n\n  This is unfathomable. How long does it take for this President to \ncall a spade a spade and declare what Americans already know to be \ntrue?\n  This isn't hard. ISIS is evil. They have engaged in systematic \npersecution and mass killing of Christians and other religious and \nethnic minorities throughout the Middle East.\n  The United States has a moral responsibility to lead in the fight \nagainst ISIS, but we can't defeat a threat that we refuse to \nacknowledge exists.\n  I am proud to participate in tonight's Special Order and to support \nCongressman Fortenberry's resolution because we need to go on Record \nand declare the belief of crisis that ISIS has without a doubt \ncommitted genocide and must be dealt with accordingly.\n  Mr. Speaker, we in the United States cannot turn a blind eye when our \nbrothers and sisters around the world are murdered, tortured, and \nkidnapped for their faith.\n  It is long past time to dispense with this hyper-political \ncorrectness and to call these heinous acts by their true name. These \nare crimes against humanity. Stopping the violence starts with \nacknowledging this truth.\n  I thank Congressman Fortenberry for his leadership on this much-\nneeded resolution.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Thank you, Congresswoman Black, for your leadership \nnot only on this issue, but so many others.\n  We often are in very important economic debates, debates about \nfinances and debates about roads. Not often enough, perhaps, do we go \nto the core of the reason for which exists a country and its laws, \nnamely, to protect human dignity. I want to thank you for your \nleadership in this regard. Thank you so much.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nRothfus), my good friend, for his good words.\n  Let me again thank you for your leadership. Your consistency and the \ncontinuity in which you apply your principles is very noble and \nuplifting to me.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Fortenberry, for \nthe steadfast witness that you have given to this cause and other \ncauses of human dignity and to call us together again after this \nhistoric House vote today where the House stands in solidarity with the \nsuffering victims of the Middle East.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn in no uncertain terms the slaughter of \nMiddle Eastern Christians and other religious minorities in Iraq, \nSyria, and the region held by ISIS.\n  These are crimes against humanity and acts of genocide. Everyone \nshould denounce this senseless brutality. The United States and the \nUnited Nations should officially recognize the mass murder of \nChristians and other religious minorities in the Middle East as acts of \ngenocide.\n  We do not hear about this massacre often enough from the media. While \nmany Americans may never have met someone from the Middle East, we are \nall part of the same human family. Christians in America may be set \napart from our brothers and sisters in the Middle East geographically, \nbut we worship the same God and are connected in our humanity.\n  We owe these suffering men, women, and children the greatest \nreverence and gratitude for their fortitude as they endure killings, \ndisplacement from their homes, forced migration, sexual exploitation, \ndestruction of their property, and endure bodily and mental harm.\n  We must not remain silent as we live in the comfort of a Nation where \nour liberties are protected by the law and our culture, to a much \ngreater degree, permits us to peacefully live out our faith.\n  I recall the words from 2001 of Pope John Paul II, Bishop of Rome, \nand His Holiness Karekin II, the Supreme Patriarch of all Armenians, as \nthey commemorated the sacrifices of the Armenian Christians who were \nalso brutalized by genocide for their faith:\n\n       Endowed with great faith, they chose to bear witness to the \n     truth and accept death when necessary in order to share \n     eternal life.\n       The most valuable treasure that one generation could \n     bequeath to the next was fidelity to the gospel so that the \n     young would become as resolute to their ancestors in bearing \n     witness to the truth.\n       The extermination of a million and a half Armenian \n     Christians in what is generally referred to as the first \n     genocide of the 20th century and the subsequent annihilation \n     of thousands under the former totalitarian regime are \n     tragedies that still live in the memory of the present-day \n     generation.\n\n  Fifteen years later their words still ring true as entire communities \nof Christians and other religious minorities are ravaged by genocide \nand religious persecution in the Middle East.\n  This persecution at the hands of ISIS is so horrific that, as Pope \nFrancis and Patriarch Kirill said last month in a joint statement:\n\n       Whole families, villages, and cities of our brothers and \n     sisters in Christ are being completely exterminated.\n\n  It is intolerable to remain silent and turn a blind eye. Silence and \nthe failure to accurately identify not some, but all, of the victims of \nthis genocide condemns these innocent people to a future of continued \nbrutality, destruction, isolation, and genocide.\n  All religious minorities in the Middle East deserve religious freedom \nand the ability to live peacefully within their communities, as they \nhave done for centuries. We will continue to stand in solidarity with \nthem and to denounce the war crimes and genocide being committed \nagainst the law.\n  I want to end with two words, Mr. Speaker, two words: moral clarity. \nThis is the time, Mr. Speaker, for moral clarity. Today this House \nspoke. The whole world now watches. We need the administration to \nspeak.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Thank you, Congressman Rothfus, for your powerful \nwords, and thank you for reminding us that this is about the essence of \nwhat it means to be human, to stand in solidarity with people far, far \naway who we may never know, but whose fate and our fate should be \nintertwined because of our mutual concern not only for one another from \nthe heart, but also for the structures that give rise to essential \nprinciples, such as religious liberty. Thank you for your good words.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. \nComstock), my good friend.\n  Thank you for your tireless efforts as well on this resolution. \nBehind the scenes you have worked very aggressively in this regard.\n  While it has been stated clearly that Anna Eshoo and I led this, \nnonetheless, your work in compelling Members to be involved in this \nquestion and raising consciousness has been invaluable. Thank you so \nmuch.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him \nfor his very important work on this vital issue of religious freedom.\n  I know how closely you worked with my predecessor, Congressman Frank \nWolf, who continues this fight for religious freedom now in his \nretirement from Congress, but his very active work that continues on \nthis important issue.\n  I rise to recognize the ongoing struggle for human and religious \nrights in the Middle East and call on the administration to make a \ngenocide designation for the war crimes committed by ISIS against the \nChristians and other religious and ethnic groups.\n  We had the resolution that we passed tonight, and I thank all of my \ncolleagues for that unanimous vote that really should speak to the \nentire country, but also to the entire world, to everybody who is \nasking: When is there going to be help? When are people going to hear \nour cries of anguish?\n  This resolution had over 200 cosponsors, which I was proud to join \nthe gentleman and so many of my colleagues here tonight and express the \nsense of Congress that those who commit or support atrocities against \nChristians, Yazidis, Kurds, and other religious minorities in the \nregion and those who target them specifically for ethnic or religious \nreasons are committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and \ngenocide.\n\n  ISIS has beheaded young children, raped young girls, and \nsystematically slaughtered people just because of the religion they \npractice.\n  This is 2016. I remember as a young girl in Catholic school when we \nwould study the martyrs and you would think about those ancient times \nand how the first Christians had to suffer and be martyred like that.\n  And then we see four nuns, Sisters of Charity, just trying to help \nthe aged, the infirm, and they are slaughtered in the name of their \nfaith.\n  We need to have more people hearing about this and focusing on this. \nAt this\n\n[[Page H1334]]\n\ntime when we have so many side shows that we see the press covering \nevery single day, this is something that they need to be dedicating \ntheir time and their resources to and to be using this mass media that \nwe have in so many different mediums to get this word out and \nunderstand these atrocities that are going on.\n  I commend Time magazine for featuring a young Yazidi woman. I believe \nit was last December. She was named Nadia. Her firsthand account was \nchilling, a 21-year-old girl. She testified what these monsters had \ndone to her and her family.\n  When she tried to escape and was recaptured, she recounted her story \nby saying: ``That night, he beat me up''--this was the person who was \nkeeping her in slavery--``forced me to undress and put me in a room \nwith six militants. They continued to commit crimes to my body until I \nbecame unconscious.''\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  She spoke of her niece, who had also been kidnapped, who had \nwitnessed a woman who was cutting her own wrists, trying to kill \nherself. They heard stories of women who jumped from bridges. In one \nhouse in Mosul, where Nadia was kept, an upstairs room was smeared with \nevidence of suffering. ``'There was blood, and there were fingerprints \nof hands with the blood on the walls,' she says. Two women had killed \nthemselves there'' so they wouldn't have to suffer anymore.\n  ``Nadia never considered ending her own life, but she said she wished \nthe militants would do it for her. `I did not want to kill myself' ''--\nof course, her faith wouldn't allow it--`` `but I wanted them to kill \nme' '' so she wouldn't end up suffering.\n  Now she is out there telling the world about this, and we need to \nlisten. The European Parliament, the U.S. Commission on International \nReligious Freedom, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the \nIraqi and Kurdish Governments all have labeled these actions as \ngenocide. Now we in the House are on record also.\n  These terrorist organizations are not only persecuting Christians, \nbut Jews, Yazidis, and so many others, as so many of my colleagues have \ndiscussed tonight, they also have killed thousands upon thousands of \nMuslims who refuse to pledge allegiance to their tormentors' extremist \nviews.\n  Last week, the organization of the Knights of Columbus in Defense of \nChristians released a detailed, 278-page report, as Mr. Fortenberry, my \ncolleague, has outlined.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the executive summary from the \nreport that details the actions that constitute genocide. I certainly \nwould recommend, like the gentleman did, that people look at this \ndetailed report, and I would ask that the press cover this.\n\n A Report Submitted to Secretary of State John Kerry by the Knights of \n                 Columbus and in Defense of Christians\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       ISIS is committing genocide--the ``crime of crimes''--\n     against Christians and other religious groups in Syria, Iraq \n     and Libya. It is time for the United States to join the rest \n     of the world by naming it and by taking action against it as \n     required by law.\n       ISIS' activities are well known. Killings, rapes, torture, \n     kidnappings, bombings and the destruction of religious \n     property and monuments are, in some instances, a matter of \n     public record. The European Parliament, the United States \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom, and the Iraqi \n     and Kurdish governments have labeled ISIS' actions genocide. \n     Political leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, \n     former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Office of \n     the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights--have \n     done likewise.\n       Indeed, Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2014 \n     stated: ``ISIL's campaign of terror against the innocent, \n     including Yezidi (sic) and Christian minorities, and its \n     grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning \n     signs and hallmarks of genocide.'' Pope Francis and Cyril, \n     Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, have decried the genocide \n     in these countries against Christians and other religious \n     groups. Most movingly, archbishops and patriarchs of ancient \n     Christian communities in Syria and Iraq have spoken out \n     clearly against this crime and cried over the blood of their \n     people and ISIS' efforts to rid their homelands forever of \n     the Christian faithful.\n       None of these declarations of genocide excluded Christians, \n     who, with the other religious minorities in the region, have \n     endured targeted attacks at the hands of this radical group \n     and its affiliates because of their religious beliefs.\n       On February 4, the Knights of Columbus co-authored a letter \n     to Secretary Kerry requesting a meeting to brief him on \n     evidence that established that the situation confronting \n     Christians and other religious minorities constitutes \n     genocide. While there has never been an official response to \n     that letter, we were contacted by senior State Department \n     officials who requested our assistance in making the case \n     that Christians are victims of genocide at the hands of ISIS. \n     Given the specificity of the information requested, our focus \n     in this report is on the situation confronting Christians in \n     areas that are or have been under ISIS control, primarily in \n     Iraq, Syria and Libya.\n       ISIS has also targeted Yazidis and other religious minority \n     groups in a manner consistent with genocide. Thus, our \n     contention is not that Christians should be designated as the \n     sole group facing genocide, but rather, that given the \n     overwhelming evidence and the international consensus on this \n     issue, that the United States government should not exclude \n     Christians from such a finding. Doing so would be contrary to \n     fact. The evidence we are presenting to the State Department \n     has three major components:\n       1. An executive summary\n       2. A legal brief detailing the case for genocide against \n     Christians\n       3. Substantial addenda, including original source material, \n     reports, from NGOs documenting the situation, evidence \n     provided to the European Parliament during their \n     consideration of this issue, lists of atrocities, and similar \n     data\n       A genocide determination requires two specific aspects: \n     intent on the part of those committing genocide and genocidal \n     acts. Both are addressed at length in the attached brief.\n       Genocide is a crime defined by federal statute and \n     international law. We are asking that Christians be included \n     in finding of genocide and that a recommendation be made for \n     investigation and, in proper cases, for indictment of those \n     responsible. This is required when there is probable cause to \n     believe an offense has been committed by the accused parties. \n     Probable cause is a low standard. When there is probable \n     cause, the duties of the President and the Secretary of State \n     under 22 U.S.C. Sec. 8213 and the Genocide Convention \n     Implementation Act of 1987, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1091-93 \n     require the collection of information ``regarding incidents \n     that may constitute . . . genocide,'' 22 U.S.C. Sec. 8213, \n     and then the President ``shall consider what actions can be \n     taken to ensure that [those] who are responsible for . . . \n     genocide . . . are brought to account for such crimes in an \n     appropriately constituted tribunal.'' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 8213(b).\n       As in any indictment, a finding of probable cause would \n     allow the State Department to report to Congress that it \n     believes genocide has occurred and to recommend that this be \n     proven conclusively through a court process.\n       It should also be noted that a finding of genocide does not \n     require the killing of an entire group. The words of the U.N. \n     Convention on Genocide and the U.S. statute based on it are \n     clear that what is required are acts aimed at destroying a \n     group ``in whole or in part.'' Both the drafting history of \n     the U.N. Convention and its application by courts around the \n     world have rightly shown that destruction ``in part'' is \n     sufficient to a finding of genocide.\n       Similarly, there is ample precedent for finding that forced \n     deportation--often in concert with killing, rape and other \n     forms of violence--qualifies as genocide.\n       As to the issue of intent, it should be noted that \n     individual accounts, the collective evidence and ISIS' own \n     public statements make clear that it targets Christians and \n     seeks to destroy Christianity in the lands they control and \n     beyond.\n       ISIS' magazine is called Dabiq, named after the place where \n     ISIS believes it will win a battle against the army of Rome. \n     It routinely refers to Dabiq as the location where it will \n     destroy the ``Crusader army,'' an unmistakable Christian \n     reference. The magazine last year published a picture of Pope \n     Francis, captioning him as ``the crusader pope.'' Dabiq \n     proclaims ISIS' intention to destroy Christians:\n       We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave \n     your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted. This is \n     His promise to us; He is glorified and He does not fail in \n     His promise. If we do not reach that time, then our children \n     and grandchildren will reach it, and they will sell your sons \n     as slaves at the slave market.\n       Finally, this certainty is the one that should pulse in the \n     heart of every mujihid from the Islamic State and every \n     supporter outside until he fights the Roman crusaders near \n     Dabiq.\n       It has also stated:\n       And nothing changes for the Islamic State, as it will \n     continue to pronounce takfir [abandonment of Islam] upon the \n     Jews, the Christians, the pagans, and the apostates from the \n     Rafidah, the Nusayriyyah, the Sahwah, and the tawaghit \n     [disbelievers]. It will continue to wage war against the \n     apostates until they repent from apostasy. It will continue \n     to wage war against the pagans until they accept Islam. It \n     will continue to wage war against the Jewish state until the \n     Jews hide behind their gharqad trees. And it will continue to \n     wage war against the Christians until the truce decreed \n     sometime before the Malhamah. Thereafter, the slave markets \n     will commence in Rome by Allah's power and might.\n\n[[Page H1335]]\n\n       Elsewhere, Dabiq states ISIS' desire to target Christians \n     under any number of ruses. In addition, a video released just \n     last month by ISIS in Libya states that its adherents should \n     `` `Fight and kill them from their Great Priest (Tawadros II) \n     to the most pathetic one.' '' A second speaker calls for \n     Egyptians to `` `terrorize the Jews and burn the slaves of \n     the Cross.' ''\n       ISIS statements related to the beheading of the Coptic \n     Christians brand Christians as ``polytheists'' for their \n     belief in the Trinity, making Christians the same as \n     ``pagans'' in their view.\n       The plain meaning of these statements, especially in \n     context, is clear: The so-called Caliphate has slated \n     Christianity for destruction--now and in an apocalyptic \n     battle to come.\n       Consistent with its threats have been ISIS' actions. Our \n     fact-finding mission to Iraq earlier this month found stories \n     of rape, kidnapping, forced conversions and murder, in \n     addition to property confiscation and forced expulsion. \n     Almost everything we discovered has not been previously \n     reported.\n       What is publicly known and what our investigation uncovered \n     is substantial, but it has become clear that this still \n     represents only the tip of the iceberg. We are now being sent \n     new stories and new evidence daily. So what is known about \n     ISIS' genocidal atrocities will only increase, and the known \n     scale of the horrors that have occurred can only expand with \n     time.\n       The victims we met or learned of were many. Their stories \n     were of traumatic experiences they and others had endured. \n     There were also the stories of those who could no longer tell \n     them--the killed and the missing. Some of those we learned \n     about had been wounded physically or emotionally, or both.\n       The story of the mother whose child was taken from her arms \n     by ISIS has been reported in the media. We found that her \n     experience was not isolated. Similar reports of family \n     members, adults and children alike, were common.\n       Those we interviewed showed great strength. And some showed \n     great heroism as well, despite the dangers to themselves. \n     There was Khalia, a woman in her fifties, who was captured \n     and held hostage along with 47 others. During her 15 days in \n     captivity, she rebuffed demands to convert, despite a gun \n     being put to her head and a sword to her neck. She literally \n     fought off ISIS militants as they tried to rape the girls, \n     and again later when they tried to take a 9-year-old as a \n     bride. Because of the abuse, 14 men gave in to ISIS' demands \n     and said they would convert to Islam. Khalia would not. \n     Ultimately, the hostages were left in the desert to walk to \n     Erbil. Others in Kurdistan affirmed without prompting that \n     ``she had saved many people.''\n       Like the Yazidis, Christian women face sexual slavery, a \n     main tool the ``Caliphate'' uses to recruit young men and to \n     exterminate religious groups. A now infamous ISIS slave menu \n     lists the prices by age for ``Christian or Yazidi'' women on \n     sale in their slave markets.\n       Murder of Christians is commonplace. Many have been killed \n     in front of their own families. The Syriac Catholic Patriarch \n     of Antioch, many of whose flock lived on the Nineveh plain or \n     in Syria, reports that 500 people were killed by ISIS during \n     its takeover of Mosul and the surrounding region. In Syria, \n     where the organization Aid to the Church in Need has reported \n     on mass graves of Christians, Patriarch Younan estimates the \n     number of Christians ``targeted and killed by Islamic \n     terrorist bands'' at more than 1,000.\n       Melkite Catholic Archbishop Jean-Clement Jeanbart of Aleppo \n     estimates the number of Christians kidnapped and/or killed in \n     his city as in the hundreds, with as many as ``thousands'' \n     killed throughout Syria.\n       In Nineveh, many more were taken hostage seemingly at \n     random, or demanded as hostages in exchange for their \n     families to leave. Many of these have not been heard from \n     thereafter.\n       Shockingly, some see what is happening at the hands of ISIS \n     as not genocidal to Christians. At the root of this argument \n     seems to be the idea that Christians have not been targeted \n     in the same way as others. This is not true. First, \n     Christians have been attacked throughout the region, not \n     simply in the Nineveh area or only during the summer of 2014. \n     Christians have been attacked and killed by ISIS and its \n     affiliates in Syria, Libya, Yemen and surrounding areas. Even \n     before ISIS was constituted, Christians found themselves \n     victims of its predecessors: the Islamic State in Iraq, Al \n     Qaeda and other radical groups.\n       Some argue that Christians should be excluded from a \n     genocide declaration because ISIS supposedly allows \n     Christians to pay jizya--a tax historically made available in \n     Islam to Christians in Muslim lands--while denying this \n     option to groups like the Yazidis, who are considered \n     ``pagans'' by Islam.\n       The premise is false, because what ISIS calls jizya is not \n     comparable to the historical understanding of that term. \n     Rather, jizya--like so many theological concepts that ISIS \n     holds--can mean something contrary to historic Islamic \n     practice, or it can mean nothing at all. As used by ISIS, it \n     is almost always a term for extortion and a prelude or \n     postscript to ISIS violence against Christians.\n       In Nineveh, demands for so-called jizya payments were a \n     prelude to killings, kidnappings, rapes and the dispossession \n     of the Christian population. Not surprisingly, the Christian \n     negotiator Father Emmanuael Adelkello and the other \n     Christians saw this as a ``a ploy from which ISIS could keep \n     the Christians there to further take advantage of them and \n     abuse them.''\n       In Raqqa, the offer was made after ISIS had already closed \n     the churches, burned bibles and kidnapped the town's priests.\n       It is little wonder that Alberto Fernandez--Middle East \n     scholar and, until recently, a coordinator of U.S. government \n     ideological counterterrorism messaging--found ISIS jizya to \n     be ``more a Satan Caliphate publicity stunt than a careful \n     recreation of jizya as practiced by the early Caliphs.'' He \n     added that this shows that ISIS is not similar ``to the \n     sprawling pluralistic caliphates of history.''\n       Furthermore, self-styled ISIS Caliph Abu Omar al-Baghdadi \n     has admitted for nearly a decade that Christians no longer \n     qualify for the historical protection offered by Islamic law. \n     And under his leadership, during the Islamic State's attack \n     on Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad in 2010, ``the \n     gunmen made at least four claims [justifications] for the \n     killings, two general and two specific: all of the Christians \n     were infidels; it is permitted to kill them; the killing was \n     in retaliation for the burning of a Koran by an American \n     pastor, and was also in retaliation for the alleged \n     imprisonment of two supposed Muslim women converts in \n     Egypt.''\n       The Knights of Columbus became involved in supporting \n     Christians and other religious minorities in this region \n     because of our long-standing humanitarian activity and \n     support for religious freedom at home and around the world.\n       Beginning in 2014, our organization began raising money for \n     refugee relief in the Middle East. These funds have helped \n     Christian, as well as Yazidi and Muslim, individuals and \n     families. We have provided funding for general relief in \n     Aleppo; education for refugees now living in Jordan; and \n     food, clothing, shelter, education and medical care in \n     Kurdistan. One of the clinics we fund in Dohuk has been \n     visited by several Yazidi women who recently escaped ISIS \n     sexual slavery, and it has referred them for psychological or \n     specialist medical treatment. To date the K of C has raised \n     more than $8 million for this cause.\n       Long before our involvement on behalf of Christians in the \n     Middle East, the Knights of Columbus stood with persecuted \n     Christians around the world. In the 1920s, we raised \n     awareness and lobbied the American government to help stop \n     the persecution of Catholics in Mexico under the government \n     of Plutarco Calles. In the 1930s the K of C successfully \n     fought against Mussolini's attempted closure of our \n     charitable work in Italy, and throughout the Cold War we \n     stood in solidarity with, lobbied for and supported those who \n     were not permitted to practice their faith in the Communist \n     bloc.\n       Today, the threat is the global persecution of Christians, \n     which the Pew Forum and The New York Times have described as \n     occurring at an unparalleled level. What is happening in the \n     Middle East is a microcosm of this, and perhaps its clearest \n     example. It is for this reason that we have partnered with In \n     Defense of Christians in producing this report and sponsoring \n     the national television advertising campaign in support of \n     the petition located at www.StopTheChristian\n     Genocide.com.\n       It is our hope that our efforts in this regard will be \n     helpful in highlighting and bettering the plight faced at the \n     hands of IS by religious minorities--including Christians. \n     And it is our belief that a declaration of genocide is a key \n     component in that process.\n\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the law states that the President shall \nconsider what actions can be taken to ensure that those who are \nresponsible for genocide are brought to account for such crimes in an \nappropriate constituted tribunal.\n  Further, the President is required to develop a clear strategy to \nstop these organizations based on the most recent iteration of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act that was passed in November.\n  As I mentioned earlier, since his retirement from Congress, my \npredecessor, Congressman Wolf, has worked tirelessly on these issues. I \nam so pleased, and I know he will be so pleased, to see so many of his \nformer colleagues and all of us who were able to pass this unanimously \nthis evening. I thank him for his strong voice and for all of the \nstrong voices who were here tonight so that we can, once again, be \nstanding throughout this country and throughout the world as that \nbeacon of light which so many of my colleagues have talked about.\n  I thank the gentleman for having this Special Order today. I just \nclose in asking for prayer for all of those who are suffering around \nthe world and for all of those souls who have been tormented, tortured, \nand killed.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. I thank Congresswoman Comstock for her powerful \nwords and her faithful leadership. The gentlewoman had big shoes to \nfill after Frank Wolf's retirement, and I am sure\n\n[[Page H1336]]\n\ntonight, if he is watching, he would be very proud of her efforts in \nthis regard and in so many others, leading the fight to try to stop the \nassaults on human dignity.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I was a much younger man, I entered the Sinai \nDesert in Egypt. The year was 1979. I was a college student. At the \nsite of the fighting that had taken place between Israel and Egypt in \nthe 1973 war, there was an all-too-familiar scene of a concrete pile of \nrubble. Scrawled on the side of the concrete pile, both in Arabic and \nin English, were the words: ``Here was the war, and here is the \npeace.''\n  Mr. Speaker, maybe, just maybe, on this, the remnants of this \nChristian church where this cross was planted by this Yazidi man who \nreturned to his hometown of Sinjar just recently in January, one day \nwill see those same words that here was the war, but now here is the \npeace.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1336-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GENERAL LEAVE\n\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be \ngiven 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to add \nany extraneous materials relevant to the subject matter of this \ndiscussion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening for tonight's \nCongressional Black Caucus Special Order Hour: The Work Continues--Why \nVoting Matters in the African American Community.\n  I am so proud to join my classmate, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from \nthe Eighth District of New York. He is a member of the House Judiciary \nCommittee. He continues to be a tireless advocate for social justice, \nworking to reform our criminal justice system and to eliminate the \novercriminalization of the African American community.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here to discuss the current state of voting \nrights in America, which, unfortunately, are under assault. The freedom \nto vote is one of America's most fundamentally, constitutionally \nguaranteed rights. It was 51 years ago this month, Mr. Speaker, that \nover 600 peaceful, orderly protesters set off to march from Selma, \nAlabama, to the State capitol in Montgomery to demonstrate the need for \nvoting rights in the State.\n  Last week, our Congressional Black Caucus chair, Chairman \nButterfield, stated at the first in a series of CBC hearings about the \ncurrent state of voting rights in America and that the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965 is probably one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation that was ever passed in the United States Congress.\n  Certainly, Mr. Speaker, as we know, in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court \nstruck down this crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act in the \nShelby County v. Holder decision. Our work continues because by \ninvalidating section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, the Supreme \nCourt opened the doors for ways to reduce the voting power of minority \ncommunities and it put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to \nmake it harder for millions of Americans to vote.\n\n  Our democracy has far too many missing voices, particularly those who \nare already at a disadvantage due to deep-rooted racial and class \nbarriers in our society. By exercising our right, we can do great \nthings. We can hold this country accountable. We can advocate for \nlegislation that supports social and economic progress, equality and \nfairness for all Americans. We can champion policies that create and \nsustain jobs and that protect against cuts to social and economic \nprograms that are vital to our most at-risk populations. We can move \nforward on efforts to address the school-to-prison pipeline and \ncriminal justice reform. We know that the inequalities in access to \nquality health care still exist between races and that more and more \nBlack children are victims of failing schools.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am calling on all citizens, including on our community \nand national leaders, to join the Congressional Black Caucus to work to \neliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought \nfor, marched, and died for--yes, the Voting Rights Act. It is up to all \nof us to protect the most at-risk among us and to expand opportunity \nfor all people. That begins with passing a voting rights act. Our work \nstill continues, Mr. Speaker.\n  This week, we are celebrating Women's History Month, and I must note \nthe powerful impact that African American women are having at the \npolls. In the past two Presidential elections, Black women led all \ndemographic groups in voter turnout. That is why voting matters to \nAfrican American communities. Black women make up the most dynamic \nsegment of the rising American voters. A great civil rights leader said \nthat women are among the greatest leaders of social reform, and they \nare fighting, literally fighting, for their political rights.\n  This past Saturday I had the opportunity to be with the mothers of \nthe movement. We know who they are. They are the mothers of Trayvon \nMartin, Eric Garner, Dontre Hamilton, Jordan Davis, Sandra Bland, and \nHadiya Pendleton; and we have all heard what happened to their \nchildren.\n  As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, we are calling for \naction on gun control. We need to do more than just stand up on this \nfloor for a moment of silence. We need to make sure that we are passing \ngun control legislation, commonsense legislation, that keeps the guns \nout of the hands of the most dangerous individuals. It is time for us \nto protect our children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to give you some examples of what we should \ninclude in our call for action.\n  I go first to my good friend and colleague and classmate who brought \nit to my attention that we stand up for a moment, and then we sit down. \nThen we come back to this floor, and it is business as usual. We talk \nabout wanting to keep our families safe, and we talk about the mental \nhealth issues. That is all we do, Mr. Speaker. We talk about it.\n  Congresswoman Robin Kelly of Illinois' Second District has \nlegislation, H.R. 224, which would require the Surgeon General of \nPublic Health Services to submit to Congress an annual report on the \neffects of gun violence on public health. This bill has 140 Democrat \ncosponsors. I am asking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nstep up and do more than just stand up for 30 seconds.\n  I am calling on Congress to act on Congressman James Clyburn of the \nSixth District of South Carolina's legislation, H.R. 3051, the \nBackground Check Completion Act, which would guarantee that no gun is \nsold by a licensed dealer until a background check is completed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to say that I am a cosponsor of both of \nthese bills.\n  I will go on and tell you about Chairman Butterfield, the chair of \nour Congressional Black Caucus. He understands that our work continues, \nbecause he has focused his efforts on promoting anti-poverty programs \nand on expanding economic development and job creation. There are a \nnumber of things that have happened in his State.\n  For example, the Moral Mondays are protests in North Carolina that \nare led by religious progressives. These protests are in response to \nseveral actions by the government of North Carolina, which was elected \ninto office in 2013. These events, which spread throughout the South, \nhelped bring attention to voting rights, criminal justice reform, and \nworkers' rights. I think it is very important for us to note that.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight my coanchor and I will talk about a number of\n\n[[Page H1337]]\n\nissues that explain why our work continues. We are going to talk about \nwhy in African American communities it is important for us to \nunderstand, if we don't diversify those who are going to vote, we don't \nrepresent the diversity of this great America that we are here to \nprotect and to serve.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  It is not just members of the Congressional Black Caucus who value \nand understand the importance of us coming together, the importance of \nus celebrating our rich history, all tied to the Voting Rights Act, all \ntied to the movements that we have had of the past.\n  Let me give you a great example because I am so proud that I am going \nto have the privilege to yield time to my good friend, Congressman John \nLarson from the First District of Connecticut.\n  He is here, Mr. Speaker, tonight to join with us as we talk about our \nrich history. He is going to share with us information about the 51st \nanniversary of President Johnson's ``We Shall Overcome'' speech, which \nwas given on March 15, 1965.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from \nOhio and the gentleman from New York for this opportunity to join with \nthem this evening.\n  I am especially proud to associate myself with the gentlewoman's \nremarks and all that the Congressional Black Caucus has stood for as I \nwould generally acknowledge that I think most of Americans stand for as \nwell.\n  I thank them as well for pointing out a historic event that is \nhappening and, in fact, will happen tomorrow evening at the Library of \nCongress.\n  Tomorrow is March 15. As the gentlewoman mentioned, it was 51 years \nago that President Lyndon Baines Johnson gave his now famous ``We Shall \nOvercome'' speech.\n  It was President Johnson that recognized 8 days after Bloody Sunday \nwhat the Nation needed to do. He did this at great political risk, but \nhe did it because of the sacrifice that so many had made.\n  Tomorrow evening at the Library of Congress we will celebrate two \nAmerican heroes with the idea that it is far more important to come \ntogether as a Nation and understand that these issues that we face and \nstruggle with aren't Democrat or Republican, but at their very core are \nAmerican.\n  I want to commend the Bipartisan Policy Center for establishing what \nwill be the first Congressional Patriot Award that will be presented \ntomorrow evening to John Lewis from Georgia and Sam Johnson from Texas.\n  This honor will be perpetuated forever. Not only will it be a medal \nin recognition of their patriotic service to the country, but of their \nservice here in the United States Congress.\n  One person was nearly beaten to death by the Alabama police, the \nother nearly beaten to death by the Vietcong and imprisoned for 8 \nyears, 42 months, in solitary confinement. It was a momentous time in \nour history in 1965.\n  Both of these gentlemen serve in the United States Congress. Both of \nthem had to overcome in their lives incredible obstacles. Both of them, \nafter their experience in 1965 and beyond, came back to serve their \ncountry, to continue to organize, to continue, in the case of Sam \nJohnson, to be a flight commander.\n  John Lewis, as we all know, is the conscience of the House of \nRepresentatives. Sam Johnson is the most admired Republican on the \nfloor. They are both iconic and American heroes, and tomorrow evening \nat the Library of Congress they will be recognized.\n  The Bipartisan Policy Center has been helped by the Library of \nCongress, the fortress of knowledge, an institution started by the \nUnited States Congress, and houses our great history.\n  Tomorrow on display will be the documents of the civil rights \nmovement and the direct participation of John Lewis and the documents \nabout the Vietnam war and the captivity and imprisonment of Sam \nJohnson.\n  Speaking tomorrow evening on behalf of Sam Johnson will be John \nMcCain. Who better to speak about being imprisoned in the Hanoi Hilton? \nWho better to speak about the sacrifice that Sam Johnson made, that his \nfamily made, for people who put their country first?\n  We will be honored tomorrow to have a former Member of this body, an \nambassador of the United States, and the mayor of Atlanta in Andrew \nYoung being here tomorrow evening.\n  Who better to talk about all the issues that the gentlewoman from \nOhio and the gentleman from New York are bringing to the forefront \ntoday than the person who was there by Martin Luther King's side, a \ncolleague of John Lewis? John Lewis holds the seat that Andrew Young \noccupied in this body.\n  Andrew Young continues to be an advocate for voting rights and is in \nthe forefront of that continued and epic battle that goes on in this \ncountry. It will be an outstanding evening.\n  But the point of it all is to understand that, as Members here in the \nUnited States Congress, in the House of Representatives, we must come \ntogether and, as President Johnson said 51 years ago tomorrow evening, \nto overcome, to overcome not only racial prejudices, but to overcome \ndisease, poverty, and ignorance, which is the real plague on this \nNation that keeps us confined.\n  How fitting that this event takes place tomorrow evening and because \nof the benevolence of an outstanding person like David Rubenstein. Who \nbetter to interview John Lewis and Sam Johnson about their experience \nthan David Rubenstein?\n  I thank my colleagues from the bottom of my heart for allowing me the \nopportunity here to echo the sentiments of their purpose here this \nevening and to acknowledge this event taking place tomorrow evening at \nthe Library of Congress of distinguished Americans, their history \nforever perpetuated.\n  And as Webster says above us in the great quote here:\n\n       Let us all, in our time here, in our service to the \n     country, do something worthy of being remembered.\n\n  Let us take to heart the example of John Lewis and Sam Johnson and \nnote especially tomorrow that we shall overcome.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman John Larson.\n  As I was listening to him reflect on the wonderful program that we \nare all going to be able to participate in at the Library of Congress--\nas I listened to his words, 51 years ago the President of these United \nStates could recognize what the Nation needed.\n\n  It disappoints me, as I stand here on this House floor and I think \nabout voting rights and I think about the condition of this Nation \ntoday and where we are when we talk about casting our votes and who we \nare going to cast our votes for. I say thank you for Congressman John \nLewis and Congressman Sam Johnson.\n  As I was listening to the gentleman, I thought about so many of the \nthings that Congressman John Lewis has said to us not only on this \nfloor, not only in private moments, but in our Congressional Black \nCaucus meetings.\n  He represents that sense of history of why we come to continue our \nwork, why we come to continue to stand up for the voting rights.\n  Because he has said to us on numerous occasions, Mr. Speaker, that \nthe vote is the most powerful and most nonviolent tool that we have in \na democratic society. We must not allow the power of the vote to be \nneutralized. We must never go back.\n  So I thank Congressman Larson for taking us forward, for taking us on \nMarch 15 on a journey that we will remember for a lifetime, because, \nyou see, we stand on the shoulders of those individuals who came before \nus.\n  Now our voters stand on our shoulders. Our voters, Mr. Speaker, are \nwanting us, are thirsty for us, to stand up for them so that their vote \ncounts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my coanchor to share some thoughts \nwith us on why our work continues, why it is so important in the \nAfrican American community for us to stand up for not only African \nAmericans, but for our citizens who are discriminated against, those \nwho, when we talk about social and economic programs, we see the \ndisparities in what happens to them in education, in health care, in \nhousing, the juvenile justice system, the criminal justice system.\n  I could not think of any better coanchor or colleague, someone who is \nsuch a great orator, someone who, when he stands up, we listen.\n  Please, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, share with us some of your \nthoughts.\n\n[[Page H1338]]\n\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman, \nRepresentative Beatty, from the great State of Ohio for her leadership \nand for moving us forward throughout the past several weeks as it \nrelates to the Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order, this hour of \npower.\n  It is 60 minutes where we have the opportunity to speak to the \nAmerican people about issues of importance to our country, to our \neconomy, to the integrity of our democracy as we are doing tonight. It \nis an honor to share with you today.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  I also want to acknowledge and thank our colleague, John Larson from \nthe great State of Connecticut, for his continuing leadership and for \ntaking to the House floor today to highlight both the historic \nsignificance of the speech that President Johnson gave from this very \nChamber 51 years ago, on March 15, 1965, about voting in America and \nensuring that every single person, regardless of their race or their \ncolor or their background had an opportunity to exercise their \nfranchise, and to point out to the American people that the Congress \nwill pause tomorrow to honor two true American legends, Representative \nLewis and Representative Johnson, who served the American people before \nthey arrived in the people's House and through their service here in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  It is with great humility that I stand today to address a topic that \nI think is of particular significance at this moment in time that we \nface in America in terms of the turmoil that many may be feeling, \nwatching, undergoing: the economic changes that have been experienced \nover the last few decades.\n  We know that the middle class, in many ways, has been left behind. \nWages have remained stagnant, notwithstanding the increased \nproductivity of the American people over the last 40-plus years. When \nthe economy collapsed, many high-income earners were able to rebound in \nno small part as a result of the bailout that occurred. There are a lot \nof Americans who are still hoping, looking out for their opportunity to \nbe brought back into the economic mainstream by the people they have \nsent to Congress to represent them.\n  Notwithstanding all of the challenges that we have to confront, \nwhether that is our broken criminal justice system or the economy that \nhas still not completely recovered, we have made substantial progress \nunder the leadership of Barack Obama. But of course there is more that \nneeds to be done, and we could welcome some cooperation from folks on \nthe other side of the aisle because all of our constituents were hit \nhard in 2008, yet President Obama has largely been left to his own \ndevices.\n  Notwithstanding all of these issues, central to how our government \nworks is the fact that it is designed to be a government of the people, \nby the people, and for the people. Abraham Lincoln, of course, famously \nuttered those words in his Gettysburg Address.\n  If we are going to have that type of government, then everybody needs \nthe opportunity to be able to participate in choosing their \nrepresentatives in government without obstacle or obstruction.\n  We understand this is a great country, but it is also a country that \nhas had a stain on its history as it relates to denying some the \nopportunity to participate fully in American democracy. That is the \nreason, after all, that, in the aftermath of the Civil War that \nthreatened to tear this country apart, we had a Reconstruction \namendment related to slavery and then a Reconstruction amendment \nrelated to the equal protection under the law and due process for all \nAmericans; and lastly, of course, with the 15th Amendment designed to \nmake sure that, in the Constitution, racial discrimination, as it \nrelates to the exercise of the franchise, would be prohibited.\n  But, unfortunately, notwithstanding the 15th Amendment being ratified \nand put into our Constitution, more than 100 years would pass by until \nthis country really confronted the denial of the right to vote in a \nmeaningful way, particularly in the Deep South, and it happened because \nof the efforts and sacrifice of a great many people: Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, John Lewis, Andrew Young, the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the NAACP, \nand those foot soldiers who were on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March \n7, 1965, and almost lost their lives when they were attacked without \nprovocation by Alabama State troopers as they endeavored to cross that \nbridge on the way from Selma to Montgomery. That, of course, then \nprompted President Johnson to deliver that address, where he so \nfamously uttered the words upon his conclusion that ``we shall \novercome.''\n  The 1965 Voting Rights Act continues to be the most significant piece \nof civil rights legislation ever passed by this Congress, but \nunfortunately we know that it is currently under attack. It is under \nattack because the Supreme Court effectively, in the Shelby v. Holder \ncase, eviscerated its impact by striking down section 4, so-called \ncoverage clause, which effectively eliminated the Department of \nJustice's ability to require States with a history of voting rights \ndiscrimination to have to preclear any changes that it makes.\n  Now, what I have been struggling to figure out during my brief time \nhere in the Congress is why voting rights has become such a \ncontroversial thing when, it seems to me, it is so central to the \nintegrity of our democracy. For decades, in the aftermath of the \npassage of the Voting Rights Act, it was actually pretty bipartisan, \nthis notion that in order for our democracy to work there should be no \nartificial obstacles erected to prevent people--African Americans, \nLatinos, immigrant families, and others--from being able to participate \nin what basically makes America great, what makes us unique: the \nability to elect our representatives and for there to be peaceful \ntransitions of power regardless of ideology, regardless of your region, \nregardless of what State a President may come from in order to keep the \nRepublic going.\n  When you look at the history of the Voting Rights Act, as I \nindicated, it has largely been, until recently, a bipartisan endeavor. \nIn fact, every time the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized--and it has \nhappened four times--not only did it pass with bipartisan majorities in \nthe Congress, but it was signed into law each and every time by a \nRepublican President.\n  In 1970, Richard Nixon signed into law the reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act. In 1975, Gerald Ford signed into law the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. In 1982, President Ronald \nReagan signed into law the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. \nThen in 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. This significant piece of \ncivil rights legislation was enacted into law and then reenacted on \nevery single occasion with the signature of a Republican President, \nindicating that voting, participation in the franchise, having the \nAmerican people in their full, gorgeous mosaic elect their \nrepresentatives is an American thing. But all of a sudden, it has \nbecome controversial.\n\n  Now, I don't know if the timing of the election of our current \nPresident has anything to do with that. Historians will make that \nanalysis as they move forward. It is above my pay grade. I just find it \ninteresting that this notion of voter fraud, which was always a fiction \nput forth by the defenders of the race-based Southern hierarchy to deny \nAfrican Americans the right to vote--and was not an issue when Richard \nNixon was elected; it wasn't an issue when Reagan was elected; it \nwasn't an issue when George Herbert Walker Bush was elected; it wasn't \nan issue when George W. Bush was elected, notwithstanding the fact that \nI am still not convinced he won the State of Florida--all of a sudden, \nin the aftermath of the election of President Barack Obama, apparently \nthere has been an outbreak of this fever that we have got to deal with \nso-called voter fraud.\n  No evidence of the fraud, not a scintilla of evidence has been \nproduced by a single proponent of this argument, but when people were \nelected in 2010, in the immediate aftermath of that election during \nPresident Barack Obama's first term, more than 180 different pieces of \nlegislation in 41 States were introduced, all, in the opinion of many \nobjective observers, designed to suppress the right to vote. And at the \nsame time, this challenge was working\n\n[[Page H1339]]\n\nits way through the Supreme Court from, of all groups of people, \nShelby, Alabama.\n  Now, the irony of that, John Lewis almost lost his life, as \nRepresentative Larson indicated, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge down in \nSelma, Alabama; and yet the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, in a case \nbrought by the folks from Shelby County, apparently thinking that they \nwere victims because of the oppressive nature of the preclearance \nprovision, the Supreme Court, at least for the time being, bought that \nargument.\n  So we find ourselves now in a situation here in the Congress where \nthe Court has said to us: Fix it; update the coverage formula. So \nbipartisan legislation has been introduced, championed by folks like \nJim Sensenbrenner, the author of the 2006 reauthorization and a very \ndistinguished and respected former Republican chairman of the House \nCommittee on the Judiciary, and, of course, John Conyers, John Lewis, \nJoyce Beatty, and many others on the Democratic side of the aisle. Yet \nwe can't get a single hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary on \nsomething seemingly so fundamental to the integrity of our democracy.\n  We are not asking you to turn into progressive Democrats. Just act \nlike Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, whom you hold up as \nsomeone who is the classic embodiment of conservative politics. Just \nact like Ronald Reagan did in 1982 or George W. Bush.\n  Let's fix the Voting Rights Act in advance of the American people \nhaving to determine what comes next as it relates to both this Congress \nand the Presidency--not because it is a good thing for Republicans or \nbecause it is a good thing for Democrats; it is a good thing for the \ncountry: full and robust participation.\n  I just want to add, as I close, that it seems to me that this would \nbe a particularly significant time to deal with the Voting Rights Act \nand to make sure that everybody can participate fully in our democracy \nat a moment when many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nand the Senate have said: We want the American people to decide who \nfills the Supreme Court vacancy.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Now, I am a little skeptical about that, but let's assume that that \nis really your view of the world. If, in fact, you don't want to do \nyour constitutional job right now--once the President sends up a \nSupreme Court nominee and gives that person an opportunity to be heard \nbefore the Senate and the American people--because you claim you want \nthe American people to decide who that nominee is through the vehicle \nof a Presidential election--then let's make sure that all of America \ncan participate in that process. That means let's remove any obstacles \nto voting in every community.\n  We haven't seen a hearing in the House, and we haven't seen a hearing \nin the Senate. I just don't understand. We have had no hearing on the \nSupreme Court nomination. We have had no hearing on the Voting Rights \nAct when the Supreme Court told us to fix it. What exactly is going on? \nThe American people are wondering.\n  We see a lot of frustration right now out there in America directed \nat Washington. That is because oftentimes there are so many critical \nissues that we simply fail to deal with.\n  So I am just hopeful today that, as we mark this occasion tomorrow of \nthese two American heroes being honored--Representative Johnson and \nRepresentative Lewis--we can get back to doing the business of the \nAmerican people in the spirit of service that they themselves have \ndisplayed through their life's work and deal with something so central \nto our democracy such as the right to vote in an unfettered fashion.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Congressman Jeffries, you have given us a lot to reflect \non tonight. You have given us the roll call of how President after \nPresident has reauthorized the Voting Rights Act.\n  As I was listening to you, it appears that there is an uncommon \ndenominator that we now have in this great America: a Black man as \nPresident of these United States.\n  I want to stand here and say, Mr. Speaker, that I am very suspect \nwhen I listen to how eloquently my colleague walked us through the \nhistory and shared with us how 51 years ago our colleague, John Lewis, \nwas putting his life at risk with other great leaders as a very young \nBlack man, that it was because he understood what was at stake.\n  He was probably ahead of his time. But when you think about that, \neveryone in this Chamber should want to have that experience.\n  I can remember a year ago, almost to the date, that I took that \njourney to Selma, Alabama. I took that journey with Congressman John \nLewis and some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who \nstood there and locked and latched hands and talked about how we should \novercome.\n  For a moment, Congressman Jeffries, it gave me that hope that I came \nhere for, that hope that one person can make a difference and change \nthe lives of others.\n  It wasn't 48 hours later that we came back to this institution, to \nthis House floor, and all of that was washed away. It was back to \nbusiness as usual.\n  There were no hearings, whether it is a budget hearing for funds to \nfund things from our infrastructure, things to educate and take care of \nour infants and children, mental health that we have all come to an \nagreement on with all the things that have happened during the time you \nand I have been here, Congressman Jeffries, with the number of lives \nthat have been lost.\n  I think about the Emanuel Nine. We talked about that commonality of \nputting more money into mental health. Yet, the President puts dollars \nin the budget and we can't get a hearing.\n  So why does our work continue? Our work continues because it is so \nimportant for us, as African Americans, to make sure we protect those \nwho are most at risk.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a huge job to do. We are 46 members strong. \nWhile we focus on the lives of African Americans and the African \nAmerican community, we stand here and fight for all children of all \nraces, all ethnicities, because that is what we do because we care.\n  But as I stand here today and reflect on Congressman Jeffries' \noutline of history, outline of the number of lives that have been lost, \noutline of the legal process and what we have gone through, it made me \nrecall, Mr. Speaker, that a week ago I decided to write an editorial to \nmy local newspaper, and it was published. Mr. Speaker, that editorial \nwas titled: ``Work to improve voting rights.''\n\n              [From The Columbus Dispatch, Feb. 29, 2016]\n\n                     Work To Improve Voting Rights\n\n                         (By Rep. Joyce Beatty)\n\n       As Black History Month closes, I am reminded of Martin \n     Luther King Jr., who famously said, ``We are now faced with \n     the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the \n     fierce urgency of now.''\n       We have come a long way since the era of Jim Crow. Indeed, \n     our nation has laws on the books protecting people from \n     discrimination based on sex, age, race, religion, national \n     origin and ethnicity. Moreover, each February, we \n     collectively reflect on the important contributions and \n     accomplishments African-Americans etched into the cornerstone \n     of America.\n       Yet, the more things change, the more they stay the same. \n     What do I mean?\n       Every year, without fail, we celebrate Black History Month \n     and honor the many leaders, heroes and ``sheroes'' of the \n     black community. However, we rarely discuss the systemic and \n     pervasive bathers still preventing African-Americans from \n     achieving the American Dream.\n       Our nation is still plagued by the vestiges of segregation \n     and unequal laws and policies. Today, it is more difficult to \n     exercise one's constitutional right to vote, not easier. \n     Inequalities in access to quality health care still exist \n     between races, and more and more black children are victim to \n     failing schools.\n       As opposed to getting bogged down in the numbers and \n     reciting a long list of statistics and historical grievances, \n     I am calling on all people, including our community and \n     national leaders, to join me in working to eliminate voter \n     suppression I and to restore what so many people fought, \n     marched and died for: the Voting Rights Act.\n       It is up to all of us to protect the most at-risk among us, \n     to defend the foundation of our democracy and to expand \n     opportunity for all people. It begins with the Voting Rights \n     Act.\n       In Congress, I am working tirelessly to rebuild the very \n     foundation of the Voting Rights Act undone by the Supreme \n     Court's Shelby County v. Holder decision. As an original \n     cosponsor of the Voting Rights Empowerment Act of 2015 (H.R. \n     12), I believe we must ensure every American has equal say \n     and the opportunity to vote. This legislation\n\n[[Page H1340]]\n\n     would do just that by expanding access and putting in place \n     common sense protections for our nation's electorate, no \n     matter the color of one's skin.\n       It takes a village. So, let's work together in our \n     neighborhood, at work or with family and friends to make this \n     change possible and to help guarantee every American has fair \n     and equal access to the ballot box.\n       Black History Month should be about the progress that has \n     been made and the journey that awaits us. Remember, the past \n     is our experience, the present is our accountability and the \n     future is our responsibility.\n\n  Mrs. BEATTY. It is 2016. I am writing an article that sounds like I \nwas sitting in 1955. That gives me great concern.\n  So when I think about our topic tonight, our work continues. What \nmatters in the African American community I think we have answered \ntonight.\n  Whether it was from Congressman John Larson, who is not a member of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus, whether it is from Congressman Sam \nJohnson or Congressman John Lewis, Mr. Speaker, I say to you that we \nstand here as members of the Congressional Black Caucus because we are \nthe conscience of the Congress.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Jeffries, as I listen to you talk about the rich \nhistory and what we are dealing with today, I think about you serving \non the Judiciary Committee.\n  I think about how, as Members of Congress and members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, we often talk about our broken prison \nsystem.\n  We often talk about what happens to young children who go to college \nand then find themselves in that pipeline of education to prison.\n  I would like to ask you how you think the decrease in Black voters \nwill affect that broken system.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Well, it is a great question. I look at it in two ways. \nFirst, when you think about mass incarceration as a phenomenon, one \nthat, hopefully, in this Congress we will be able to do something \nabout, in recognition of the fact that America imprisons more people \nthan any other country in the world, increasingly, we have become a \ncountry that over-incarcerates and under-educates. As a result, we have \nlost generations of young people, disproportionately, African Americans \nand Latinos.\n  In 1971, President Richard Nixon declared publicly that drug abuse \nwas public enemy number one. At the time, there were less than 350,000 \npeople incarcerated in America. That was the starting point of the war \non drugs.\n  More than 40 years later we have now got 2.3 million people \nincarcerated in America. A significant number of those folks--\napproximately 50 percent at the Federal level and similar numbers at \nthe State level--are there for nonviolent drug offenses.\n  Yet, every single one of those people who have been incarcerated in \nAmerica has lost the right to vote, some permanently, some temporarily \nwith an opportunity to perhaps recover it. More than a million people \nare currently incarcerated from the African American community. So our \nsystem is broken. Our democracy is in need of adjustment.\n  If there is not an understanding that the absence of refraining from \nparticipating in that democracy through exercising the franchise yields \nconsequences that public policymakers will choose either intentionally \nor through benign neglect to allow things like mass incarceration to \noverwhelm a community, then we are going to continue to see things \nhappen that are not in the best interest of America. Certainly, \nelectoral participation matters to the African American community.\n  The other thing that we have got to look at in the context of the \nright to vote--and there is some bipartisan support because Senator \nRand Paul on the other side of the Capitol has been very visionary in \nthis regard--is that disenfranchising people who have been incarcerated \nin America, paid their debt to society, have moved on with their life--\nbut to permanently restrict them, even in some cases when the \nconviction is for a misdemeanor offense, is un-American.\n  But some have used this type of disenfranchisement related to the \nprison industrial complex to overwhelm many communities because of mass \nincarceration to, again, set up obstacles to full participation in \nAmerican democracy.\n  So we have got to put everything on the table in terms of our effort \nto fix our broken criminal justice system, which I am pleased, to date, \nat least in the House on the Judiciary Committee, has been bipartisan \nin nature.\n  But we have to take an expansive approach to repairing the damage \nthat has been done over more than 40 years of a failed war on drugs, \nwith millions upon millions upon millions of people stamped with a \ncriminal record, I believe in excess of 65 million people during that \ntime period, disproportionately African Americans and Latinos.\n  It is one of many issues that is on the table that, hopefully, will \nresult in folks understanding that the stakes are high as it relates to \nwho represents you. And the vehicle is just to participate.\n  That is the great majesty of our democracy as it was conceived by the \nFounders and those who came after: Government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people, through electoral participation.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Jeffries, I paused for a moment as I was listening \nto you, and you are so absolutely right; the vehicle, the power of \ncasting that vote, the power of making a difference.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think one of the things that is so significant about \nthe Congressional Black Caucus, that is our history. It is our \nfortitude to have the courage to always continue to fight and never \ngive up, because we actually have members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus who were there during that time.\n  When you think about Members like Congressman John Lewis, when you \nthink about Members like John Conyers, John Conyers, a Black man, will \ngo down in history as the longest-serving man in this Congress. Just \nthink about it. A man that shared an office for almost 2 decades with \nRosa Parks, the modern civil rights leader who decided that she was \ngoing to sit down that day because she realized one person could make a \ndifference.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we have gone through our whole history of the Voting \nRights Act, we have gone through the sections of the Constitution, we \nhave gone through what the Supreme Court has done, and yet we can't get \nthe reauthorization of our Voting Rights Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say this to you tonight. The Congressional Black \nCaucus will not give up. We are holding field hearings, as I speak, so \nwe can collect the information to come back here and tell you that the \nvehicle for American people, that vehicle is the ballot box.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today, we have resolved. Members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus don't come just to complain and put issues \nout there. We are scholars. We like hearing that we are the conscience \nof the Congress, but we are the scholars. We are Howard, and Morehouse, \nand Spelman, and Harvard, and Princeton, and Yale. We are the whole \nspectrum of this America that you and I serve.\n  So I ask you today, Mr. Speaker, to consider that when we stand up \nthe next time on this House floor, why Members are sitting down. We are \nsitting down because I think you and Congressman Jeffries and all the \nrest of my colleagues in this Chamber, we have an obligation to do \nmore.\n  Innocent lives are being taken, and there is something we can do \nabout it. We could start with something that has been bipartisan. \nCongressman Jeffries mentioned it a number of times, and that is \nsomething as simple as passing a Voting Rights Act. That would make a \ndifference.\n  I guess my question is: What are we afraid of?\n  Are we afraid if we increase the number of those who have been \ndisenfranchised, those who have been discriminated against, that they \nwill actually vote, they will actually have a voice to make a \ndifference in the way they live in this wonderful America?\n  I am asking you to go to your Republican colleagues and ask them to \nstand with us that we can leave a great legacy in history, because \nhistory will be written. When the first Black President leaves these \nUnited States, we will read of all the wonderful things that President \nBarack Obama did.\n  But we will also have those who will write part of that history of us \nfailing\n\n[[Page H1341]]\n\nto do our job. And I will reflect back on this day when Congressman \nJeffries and I stood at this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order \nHour and we said, the work continues, and why it matters in African \nAmerican communities that we vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, nearly 51 years ago \nthe Voting Rights Act (VRA) was signed into law to prohibit racial \ndiscrimination in voting. It was a defining moment in our nation's \nhistory that would send a clear message that all voters should have \nfree and fair access to the polls in the United States. The Voting \nRights Act became a powerful tool of our democracy that protected voter \nparticipation of individuals from all backgrounds. It has given a voice \nto previously disenfranchised voters, particularly that of minorities \nwho would otherwise be left out of the political process.\n  Since the passage of the VRA, various groups and individuals have \nendeavored to reverse those protections. In 2013 the U.S., Supreme \nCourt ultimately struck down a key enforcement component of the VRA as \nunconstitutional. This decision has enabled a number of states across \nthe country to move forward with discriminatory voter laws, the effects \nof which have not yet been fully realized.\n  Texas is one of 21 states that have implemented new restrictions on \nvoting since the 2010 midterm election. Texas first passed two harsh \nvoter mandates in 2012, which were ultimately blocked under Section 5 \nof the VRA. Texas re-implemented these laws requiring valid photo \nidentification at the polls following the Supreme Court ruling--the \nfirst time a photo ID was required to vote in a federal election in \n2014. The consequences in Texas alone have been dire and \ndisproportionately impact minority voters. The U.S. Department of \nJustice originally estimated that the Texas law could prevent as many \nas 600,000 voters from casting their votes at the polls.\n  The African American community has faced many barriers to voting \nthroughout our history. During the height of the Civil Rights Movement, \nthousands of protesters marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge from \nSelma to Montgomery, Alabama in order to protest the racial injustices \nin voting. The will of the people ultimately prevailed, resulting in \nthe signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 just five short months \nafter the final march. It was an important struggle that still serves \nas a lesson for us today.\n  Voter disenfranchisement poses an incredible threat to the electoral \nprocess. The nationwide efforts to create barriers to voting have \nhighlighted the importance of the protections afforded under the VRA. \nVoting is the principle means through which Americans can have a voice \nin the political process. It allows us to elect candidates who share a \ncommon vision for bettering our nation and advancing our social and \neconomic progress. These efforts to disenfranchise voters stand \ncontrary to our democratic principles as a nation and it is imperative \nthat we fight to reinstate voter protections for all, which have only \nserved to strengthen our democracy and engage voters in the political \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1341-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1341-H1343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DECLARATION OF GENOCIDE COMMITTED BY ISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to be able to speak \non this hallowed floor.\n  A report was made earlier today entitled, ``House Poised to Declare \nISIS Committing Genocide Against Christians, Other Minorities.'' And, \nin fact, this report says: ``The House is poised Monday to approve a \nresolution that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide \nagainst Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East--\nputting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same \nahead of a deadline later this week.\n  ``The resolution passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee with \nunanimous support and is expected to pass the House with bipartisan \nbacking.\n  ``The resolution comes to a vote Monday evening, just days after the \nrelease of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In \nDefense of Christians on ISIS atrocities. The report made the case that \nthe terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria, \nIraq, and other parts of the Middle East is, in fact, genocide.\n  `` `When ISIS systematically targets Christians, Yazidis, and other \nethnic and religious minorities for extermination, this is not only a \ngrave injustice--it is a threat to civilization itself,' Representative \nJeff Fortenberry, Republican, Nebraska, said in a statement. `We must \ncall the violence by its proper name: genocide.'\n  ``The resolution will be voted on ahead of the congressionally \nmandated March 17 deadline for the Secretary of State John Kerry and \nthe White House to make a decision on whether to make such a \ndeclaration. The measure is an effort to force the administration's \nhand on the issue, as the administration has so far declined to take an \nofficial position.\n  `` `Christians, Yazidis, and other beleaguered minority groups can \nfind new hope in this transpartisan, ecumenical alliance against ISIS' \nbarbaric onslaught,' Fortenberry, who is co-chairman of the Religious \nMinorities of the Middle East Caucus and represents America's largest \nYazidi community, said in the statement.''\n  So the measure received the backing of the House Republican \nleadership, Paul Ryan, calling on the Obama administration to take \naction like recent attacks against Christians.\n  The article goes on, from foxnews.com, indicating: ``It is rare for \nCongress to make a genocide determination.\n  ``In addition to the genocide resolution, the House is expected to \nvote on a measure to create an international tribunal to try ISIS \nmembers accused of atrocities.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is pleasing to report that H. Con. Res. 75, \nexpressing the sense of Congress that the atrocities perpetrated by \nISIL--that is, the Islamic State; and it has used different names, \nISIS, ISIL--against religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria \ninclude war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, that passed \nby 393 yeas and zero nays.\n  It is deeply troubling that although this House, in a bipartisan way, \ncould vote 393 for this resolution and zero against, that Secretary of \nState John Kerry and President Barack Obama are having trouble deciding \nwhat they should do.\n  Gee, is it possible they might just notice that in the House of \nRepresentatives we came together unanimously and said what ISIS has \nbeen doing is genocide?\n  For heaven's sake, for the sake of the Christians, the Yazidis, the \nJews in the area, is it too much to ask that this United States \nadministration take notice that there is a genocide going on?\n  And though the administration is not doing much of anything about it, \nis it too much to ask that this administration at least call it what it \nis; that this House, on both sides of the aisle, unanimously said the \nsame thing?\n  Is it too much to ask, even if you are not going to fight the \ngenocide, at least call it what it is, then that will embolden others \nwith courage to stand up and fight more fearlessly? Is that too much to \nask?\n  I hope and pray not, Mr. Speaker.\n  In the meantime, what we find here at home, while we are still having \nthe administration struggle over whether to call genocide genocide, we \nhave a report from ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, \nit is revealed that 124 illegal immigrant criminals released from jail \nby the Obama administration since 2010 have been subsequently charged \nwith murder.\n  The Center for Immigration Studies report on the data from ICE to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee added that the committee is not releasing \nthe names of these masses of murder suspects.\n  `` `The criminal aliens released by ICE in these years--who had \nalready been convicted of thousands of crimes--are responsible for a \nsignificant crime spree in American communities, including 124 new \nhomicides after the thousands of crimes they have already committed \nbefore ICE released them. Inexplicably, ICE is choosing to release some \ncriminal aliens multiple times,' said the report written by CIS' \nrespected Director of Policy Studies, Jessica M. Vaughan.\n  ``She added that 75 percent were released due to court orders or \nbecause their countries wouldn't take them back.\n  ``What's more, her report said that in 2014, ICE released 30,558 \ncriminal aliens''--that is illegal immigrants in the United States who \ncommitted\n\n[[Page H1342]]\n\ncriminal atrocities--``who had been convicted already when they were \nreleased of 92,347 crimes.''\n  Wow. As the world suffers, as this administration cannot determine \nwhether or not to call the genocide of Christians and other minority \ngroups genocide; at the same time, it has been hard at work, out of \nthose thousands, tens of thousands of aliens who have committed over \n92,000 criminal acts against Americans here in this country, the \nadministration has been hard at work and deported 3 percent of the tens \nof thousands of aliens illegally here who have committed over 92,000 \ncrimes, and this administration has deported 3 percent.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  So much for protecting Americans against all enemies foreign and \ndomestic.\n  This article from Paul Bedard says: ``Her analysis is the latest \nshocking review of Obama's open-border immigration policy. And despite \nthe high number of illegal immigrants charged with murder, the list \ndoesn't include those released by over 300 so-called 'sanctuary cities' \nand those ICE declined to even take into custody.\n  ``She said that 124 criminal aliens released by ICE between 2010 and \n2015 were charged with murder during that period and 'associated with \n250 different communities in the United States, with the most clustered \nin California, New York, and Texas.'''\n  I would assert parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, for those that are not \nCalifornia, New York, and Texas, you cannot think for a minute that \nthis is not already in your State. If you haven't heard about, it is \ncoming.\n  This says: ``In a memo about the subsequent crimes of released \nillegals to Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley, ICE \nsaid, 'The aliens were charged with a total of 135 homicide-related \ncrimes subsequent'''--for my liberal friends, that means after--``'to \nrelease from ICE custody. As of July 25, 2015, a total of 39 \nconvictions have resulted from these homicide-related charges. Of the \n121 total aliens, 2 had homicide-related convictions prior to release \nfrom ICE custody.'''\n  ICE released them knowing that they already had homicide-related \nconvictions, and they were released to kill again upon the American \npublic. Though they violated our laws to get here and they violate our \nlaws to stay here, this administration has seen to their release upon \nthe American public further.\n  ``Vaughan added that 'ICE reported that there are 156 criminal aliens \nwho were released at least twice by ICE since 2013. Between them, these \ncriminals had 1,776 convictions'''--that kind of sounds patriotic. \nSince 2013, ICE has released 1,776 criminals with 1,776 convictions \nbefore they are released in 2013, including burglary, larceny, you \nknow, those things that hurt America.\n  This article from cis.org also says: ``Only a tiny percentage of the \nreleased criminals have been removed--most receive the most generous \nforms of due process available and are allowed to remain at large, \nwithout supervision, while they await drawn-out immigration hearings. \nThey are permitted to take advantage of this inefficient processing \neven though they are more likely to re-offend than they are to be \ngranted legal status.''\n  Further down it says: ``Some aliens had multiple ZIP Codes associated \nwith them in ICE's system, so the records include more ZIP Codes than \nthe 121 individual criminal aliens charged''--with murder--``through \n2014. Three more were charged in 2015; ICE did not provide their ZIP \nCodes...ICE reported there are 156 criminal aliens who were released at \nleast twice by ICE since 2013.''\n  That, of course, was in the other article.\n  It goes on to say: ``ICE has previously disclosed that 75 percent of \nthe homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders.''\n  Most of those would be immigration judges who sit at the discretion \nof the Attorney General of the United States. So perhaps people can let \nour Attorney General know that they would like our Attorney General to \npick some immigration judges who might actually enforce our law instead \nof forgo the law so criminal aliens can commit more crimes against \nAmericans.\n  I know, I understand there is so much going on, it is difficult to \ndeal with all these issues at the same time, and that is why the \nadministration is struggling so whether or not to officially say that \nthe genocide going on in the Middle East of Christians and other \nminorities is actually genocide. It is just taking so much brain power. \nEven though in here it was 393-0, the administration right down on \nPennsylvania Avenue here just can't decide if it really might be \ngenocide or not.\n  ``In a separate communication, ICE provided a list of the countries \nthat currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens: \nAfghanistan, Algeria, Burundi, Cape Verde, China, Cuba, Eritrea, \nGambia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Libya, \nMali, Mauritania, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, and \nZimbabwe.''\n  Gee, Cuba?\n  It is a real shame that as this administration negotiated all the \nthings that it was going to give to and do for Cuba that they didn't \napparently bring this issue up: Oh, by the way, the criminal aliens \nthat you have had come into our country are coming back to your country \nbecause they are your citizens illegally in our country. They are \ncoming back to you, like it or not.\n  Apparently, I guess maybe with all the concentration on whether \ngenocide is genocide, they weren't able to remember to bring that up to \nCuba or to China.\n  In Afghanistan, one of my Muslim friends who is a great leader there \nin Afghanistan pointed out a few years ago when he was talking about \nthe leverage that the United States has and should use to get \nAfghanistan to do the right thing by its people and by the United \nStates, I said: Well, why do you think--this was in a visit in \nAfghanistan. I said: Why do you think we have much leverage? This is a \nfew years ago. He said: Do you know what our annual budget is for the \ngovernment in Afghanistan? No. I didn't know. He said: Around 12 \nbillion American dollars. Do you know how much of that the United \nStates provides? He said: We provide about 1\\1/2\\ billion of our 12. \nYou provide most of the rest of it. He said: Yes, you have got plenty \nof leverage.\n  But, apparently, this administration, maybe again they are so \nflustered in trying to decide if ISIS, who has expressly indicated they \nwant to wipe out all Christians and they want to wipe Israel off the \nmap, they are trying to decide if that means that is really a genocide, \nso they haven't had time to notice that we have massive leverage over \nthe Afghan Government to get them to do the right thing and take back \ntheir criminal aliens that are in this country illegally and send them \nback and take them; otherwise, the 10, 12 of your budget that \nwe provide may not get provided anymore.\n\n  But again, I know this administration doesn't want to offend people \nthat are killing American citizens. I get that. It is special being \nthat sensitive.\n  Algeria, China, India, Iran, Mr. Speaker, I just can't help but \nwonder if, before the President authorized $100 billion to $150 billion \ngoing to Iran, if maybe it occurred in someone's mind: Do you know \nwhat? I am going to save some American lives by forcing Iran to take \nback the criminal aliens from Iran that are not lawfully here in the \nUnited States.\n  I wonder if anybody in this administration maybe thought about that. \nDid they think about it and send the President the message and it just \ndidn't get to the President? Or it didn't get to John Kerry, and they \ndidn't think about it on their own: Gee, do you know what? We know Iran \nhas already said they are going to spend some of that $100 billion, \n$150 billion on weapons systems on more terror groups like Hamas and \nHezbollah. Yeah, they have said that we are going to spend more money \non all these things. We knew that. Did it occur that that is bad enough \nthat you are giving money that is going to be used to kill Americans, \nChristians, Jews, Yazidis, it is going to be used to terrorize the \nworld? Maybe you could have helped American citizens out by saying: \nAnd, by the way, before we release it, you are going--and never mind \nthat they violated the agreement over and over--but you, Iran, are \ngoing to need to accept back the criminal aliens from your country that \nare killing and terrorizing Americans in our country illegally.\n\n[[Page H1343]]\n\n  Did nobody think of that? It is incredible, just incredible. \nAmericans are suffering.\n  Then we get this report from cis.org that 61 million immigrants and \ntheir children, young children, now live in the United States. Now, \nmost of those, I think 43 million or so, are here legally. But it is \nworth noting that the number of immigrants and their children grew six \ntimes faster than our Nation's population between 1970 and 2015.\n  From 1970 to 2015, our United States population has grown by 59 \npercent. That is a good, healthy growth. In the meantime, the \npercentage of immigration growth, or the number of immigrants in the \nUnited States--first generation, that is. Most all, everybody here, \neven Native Americans weren't native probably at one time. They have \ncome across somewhere. But first-generation immigrants who actually \nimmigrated in with children, that number has grown by 353 percent over \nthat same period.\n  In many States, the increase in the number of immigrants and their \nminor children from 1970 to 2015 has been nothing short of astonishing. \nIn Georgia, the population grew 3,058 percent; whereas, before that, it \ngrew from 55,000 immigrants to 1.75 million immigrants. That is just in \nGeorgia. So the immigrant level grew 20 times faster, 25 times faster, \nthan the overall State population.\n  So thank God for immigration. Thank God for legal immigration, that \nis. But when we abandon the rule of law and don't give ourselves time \nto welcome legal immigrants into this country and educate them--there \nis a reason that they have to be educated and are supposed to learn our \nlanguage and supposed to learn some history, because there is a \ntremendous amount of responsibility that comes with the right to vote. \nYou need to understand how you say what Ben Franklin said was ``a \nrepublic, Madam, if you can keep it.'' You cannot keep a republic if \nyou don't educate people that are coming in and who are foreign to the \nidea of the responsibilities of maintaining a republic. You don't keep \nit. You can't keep it.\n  On the wave of that came this editorial from Dan Hannan, a member of \nthe European Parliament, dated today. Apparently, he spent part of last \nsummer volunteering in a hostel for underage migrants in the south of \nItaly. He talks about the migrants that came in.\n  He says: ``I have seen refugee columns before, and they tend to be \nmade up disproportionately of women and children. Of the boat people \nlanded by the coast guard while I was in Italy, more than 80 percent \nwere young men. Young men who, I noticed, took out smartphones when \nthey disembarked and looked for Wi-Fi so as to tell their relatives'' \nhow good it was.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  He says:\n  ``Official policy in Europe is based on a misdiagnosis. The migrants \nare treated as refugees, and there is an implicit assumption that their \ndisplacement is somehow our fault. In the weirdly narcissistic \ntradition of the Left, the West is simultaneously blamed for having \nintervened in Libya and for not having intervened in Syria. But the \nlads I was working with in Italy were from countries that we never \nbombed--except with aid money.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time we look seriously at the oath every Member of \nCongress, the Senate, the President, the Vice President, everybody in \nelected Federal office takes. We are supposed to defend this \nConstitution. That means we are to provide for the common defense \nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic. It is high time we took that \nmore seriously.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/house-section/article/H1343-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
