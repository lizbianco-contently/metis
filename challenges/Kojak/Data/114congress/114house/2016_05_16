The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, thousands of people will gather in \nWashington, D.C., this weekend for Feeding the 5000, an event designed \nto bring awareness to the issue of food waste. Participants will be \nserved a communal meal made entirely out of food that would otherwise \nhave been discarded--in other words, wasted. Since 2009, Feedback, a \nglobal environmental organization working to end food waste, has hosted \ndozens of Feeding the 5000 events in cities across the globe.\n  I am pleased to see so many local partners--including government \nagencies, charitable organizations, NGOs, industry, and chefs--joining \ntogether to call attention to food waste, because the truth of the \nmatter is we will need all of these partners working together to solve \nthe issue of food waste.\n  Last year, the USDA announced their first ever food waste reduction \ngoal, calling for a 50 percent reduction in food waste by 2030. USDA is \nworking with charitable organizations, faith-based groups, and the \nprivate sector, and I believe this goal is 100 percent achievable.\n  American consumers, businesses, and farms spend an estimated $218 \nbillion per year growing, processing, transporting, and disposing of \nfood that is never eaten. Up to 40 percent of all food grown is never \neaten; 40 to 50 million tons of food is sent to landfills each year, \nplus another 10 million tons is left unharvested on farms. This food \nwaste translates into approximately 387 billion calories of food that \nwent unconsumed. With 50 million Americans--including 16 million \nchildren--struggling with hunger every year, these are startling \nfigures.\n  We know food waste occurs throughout the supply chain, from \nharvesting to manufacturing, to retail operations and consumer habits. \nBut we must do more to reduce food waste at every stage, recover food \nthat would otherwise have been wasted, and recycle unavoidable waste as \nanimal feed, compost, or energy.\n  Thankfully, there is already a lot of great work being doing to raise \nawareness about the problem of food waste. Just last week, I attended a \nscreening of the documentary film called ``Just Eat It'' at Amherst \nCinema, organized by The Food Bank of Western Massachusetts. ``Just Eat \nIt'' follows a couple, Jen and Grant, as they stop going to the grocery \nstore and live solely off of foods that would have been thrown away. \nJen and Grant were able to find an abundance of perfectly safe and \nhealthy food available for consumption that would have been thrown \naway.\n  It is exciting to see new partnerships forming to study food waste \nand find ways to use this perfectly good food to reduce hunger in our \ncommunities. One such private-public collaboration, ReFED, has brought \ntogether over 30 business, government, and NGO leaders committed to \nwide-scale solutions to U.S. food waste.\n  In March 2016, ReFED released a Roadmap that charts the course for a \n20 percent reduction of food waste within a decade. The Roadmap calls \nfor farmers to reduce unharvested food and create secondary markets for \nimperfect produce. It calls on manufacturers to reduce inefficiencies, \nmake packaging adjustments, and standardize date labeling. It calls on \nfood service companies to further implement waste tracking and \nincorporate imperfect produce and smaller plates into restaurants. It \nurges the Federal Government to strengthen tax incentives for food \ndonations and consider standardized date labeling legislation.\n  The good news is that many in the industry are already taking steps \nto dramatically cut down on wasted food by implementing robust donation \nprograms. For example, Starbucks recently announced it will soon scale \nup its successful food donation pilot program nationwide. In \npartnership with the Food Donation Connection and Feeding America, \nStarbucks will donate unsold food from more than 7,000 company-operated \nstores--salads, sandwiches, and other refrigerated items--to the \nFeeding America food bank network. By 2021, that amounts to almost 50 \nmillion meals.\n  Our college campuses are also stepping up. Both the Campus Kitchens\n\n[[Page H2390]]\n\nProject and the Food Recovery Network will work with college dining \nfacilities and students to provide hunger relief in their local \ncommunities. In my congressional district, Becker College, Holy Cross \nCollege, Smith College, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and \nWorcester Polytechnic Institute all have campus food recovery \ninitiatives.\n  Over the past 35 years, Feeding America has demonstrated an \noutstanding commitment to ensuring food that would otherwise have been \nwasted makes its way to food banks across the country and into the \nhomes of families in need. There are dozens of other industry leaders \nalso taking steps to reduce food waste by implementing manufacturing \nupgrades, maximizing harvests, and utilizing recycling initiatives.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Food Waste Reduction Alliance in \nbringing together industry partners to reduce food waste, shrink the \nenvironmental footprint, and alleviate hunger in our communities.\n  Reducing food waste is one step we can take toward our goal of ending \nhunger in the United States and throughout the world. I am pleased to \nsee so many partners at every level of the food supply chain taking \naction to reduce food waste, but there is still more that needs to be \ndone. Let's solve the problem of food waste, and let's end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2390-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A FIRE CHIEF SAYS GOOD-BYE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Ramsey \nFire Chief Dean Kapler, who recently announced his upcoming retirement.\n  Since 1993, Dean Kapler has been responsible for every aspect of the \nRamsey Fire Department, a responsibility that he handles with \ndetermination and enthusiasm. Over the past 23 years, Dean has \nrecruited and trained 55 firefighters and maintained three fire \nstations. Additionally, he has worked tirelessly to provide better \ncoverage and expand fire service for the Ramsey area.\n  The dedication that Dean Kapler has displayed to his home city of 37 \nyears is further proven by the retirement date he has chosen. His \nretirement will be determined by the completion of the new fire \ndepartment, a project that he has supervised and insists on seeing \nthrough to completion.\n  I want to thank Dean for all the work that he has done for the city \nof Ramsey, and I wish him happiness in his well-earned retirement.\n\n\n      Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant is ``Above and Beyond''\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Xcel \nEnergy's Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant for receiving the Above \nand Beyond Award from the U.S. Department of Defense. This award \nrecognizes employers who have gone above and beyond the legal \nrequirements of supporting Guard and Reserve employees, often by giving \nnonrequired benefits.\n  The role of a Reserve member is critically important to national \nsecurity, but it is a job with an uncertain future. Thankfully, the \nMonticello plant fully welcomes the work ethic, leadership, and applied \nknowledge veterans can bring to a position.\n  Those who serve and sacrifice to keep our Nation safe not only \ndeserve our respect, but also our help when they come home. That is why \nXcel's commitment to hire our veterans is so important.\n  I commend the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant for hiring our \nveterans and for assisting employees who are serving in the Guard or \nReserves. Congratulations and thank you to Xcel Energy for your well-\ndeserved award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2390-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Lancaster General was the only \nPennsylvania health system to be recognized for this honor.\n  Lancaster General was singled out for its work on community programs \nfor the chronically ill, the Amish community, and those dealing with \ntobacco and obesity issues.\n  Recently, the health system launched a community-led effort called \nLighten Up Lancaster that works to increase obesity awareness and \nweight loss. For the Amish, Lancaster General offered a special free \nimmunization program for children in the rural areas.\n  The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania said \nLancaster General Health/Penn Medicine has fully recognized that a \nrelationship with the community is invaluable and key to improving \nhealth and wellness. It is well-deserving of this national recognition.\n  Lancaster General used the $10,000 prize money to pay for technology \nto track and coordinate its social services.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  For the record, this is the same bill that has passed this House \ntwice unanimously. It was over in the Senate, and they sent it back to \nus. It is a very simple bill that would direct the General Services \nAdministration, on behalf of the National Archives, to convey property \nto Alaska, to the city of Anchorage.\n  I am pleased that the sponsor of the House companion bill, as I \nmentioned before, has been passed by the House twice and has now been \nsent back to my senator, Senator Dan Sullivan.\n  The National Archives has determined that it no longer needs the \nproperty and wants to sell it as part of its efforts to shrink its real \nestate footprint and reduce the costs to the taxpayer. The bill will \nrequire fair market value for the property based on an independent \nappraisal. The proceeds will be deposited into the Treasury and will be \nused for deficit reduction.\n  This bill is in line with what we have been urging all Federal \nagencies to do--consolidate and reduce their space and sell unneeded \nproperties.\n  The municipality of Anchorage requested this land be made available, \nand the city council passed a resolution that thanks the delegation for \nsupporting this legislation. I am very excited to get this land into \nthe hands of the municipality of Anchorage for development purposes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I support S. 1492, which directs the GSA, on behalf of the Archivist \nof the United States, to convey 9 acres of property in Anchorage, \nAlaska, to the local municipality in exchange for its fair market \nvalue.\n  The GSA and the Archivist of the United States have come to the \nconclusion that this property is underutilized and is no longer needed \nby the Federal Government. A House version of this bill was reported \nout of committee by a voice vote and was subsequently passed by the \nHouse. Selling this property to the city of Anchorage, Alaska, at its \nfair market value protects the interests of taxpayers who acquired the \nproperty. It also allows the Federal Government to shed the costs of \nmaintaining and securing an unneeded property.\n  Finally, I encourage the GSA to continue using its existing authority \nand expertise to identify and dispose of other pieces of underutilized \nFederal real estate as appropriate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation, and I urge its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, S. 1492.\n\n[[Page H2392]]\n\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2392-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2392-H2395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STOLEN IDENTITY REFUND FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. RENACCI.

NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       No additional funds are authorized to carry out the \n     requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act. \n     Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts \n     otherwise authorized.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Renacci) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within\n\n[[Page H2393]]\n\nwhich to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous \nmaterial on H.R. 3832, currently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise to urge approval of H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund \nFraud Prevention Act of 2016.\n  I introduced this bipartisan legislation with my friend and \ncolleague, Mr. Lewis, to combat tax-related identity theft. On a \npersonal note, it has been an honor to work with Mr. Lewis. He paid me \na great compliment when he said I ``rained passion and truth'' on the \nimportant issue of identity theft. Truthfully, since Congressman Lewis \nwas first elected, he has been a legislator who has brought great \npassion and truth to every endeavor of his storied career. I truly \nthank him for working with me on this legislation.\n  Tax-related identity theft is an evolving criminal activity that \ntargets innocent taxpayers nationwide and robs the Treasury of billions \nof dollars each year. I was grateful for the opportunity last month to \ntestify before the Committee on Ways and Means about my experience with \ntax-related ID theft. Last year, my personal information was stolen, \nand someone used that information to electronically file a fraudulent \ntax return for my wife and me. That return, which included a fraudulent \nW-2 from the House of Representatives, claimed a significant refund, \nwith the proceeds directed to a bank account outside the U.S. So when \nit comes to ID theft, I truly understand the impact that it has on \ntaxpayers in northeast Ohio and across the country.\n  I am committed to cracking down on the growing threat, and this \nbipartisan bill is an important first step forward. I was pleased that \ntwo core components from this bill were included in the PATH Act that \npassed last December. The remaining components of this bill will help \nfurther shield taxpayer dollars from thieves and reduce the hardships \nthat are caused by this criminal activity. They include establishing a \ncentralized point of contact at the IRS for ID theft victims. This will \nmake it easier for victims to resolve their ID theft tax cases and \nensure a unit at the IRS is held accountable for handling a taxpayer's \ncase from start to finish.\n  Another one would improve the taxpayer notification of suspected ID \ntheft. When the IRS determines there has been the unauthorized use of a \ntaxpayer's identity, the IRS would be required--as soon as practicable \nand without jeopardizing an investigation--to notify the taxpayer and \ngive instructions to the taxpayer about filing a police report.\n  The last one I will mention would require the IRS to submit a study \non the feasibility of establishing a program for ID theft victims to be \nable to opt out of electronic filing. This provision would require the \nIRS to report back to Congress within 180 days on this issue.\n  I also thank my friend, Mr. Pascrell, for his work on this issue and \nfor his amendments that were incorporated into the bill during this \nmarkup last month.\n  Mr. Speaker, tax-related identity theft is one of the most pressing \nchallenges that we face in the world of tax administration. This \ncomplex and evolving threat requires cooperation from Congress, the \nIRS, State revenue agencies, and industry stakeholders. While I am \naware that not every tax-related ID theft problem is best served with a \ncongressional solution, this legislation is an important first step in \nfighting ID theft and in better protecting victims.\n  I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2016.\n     Hon. Kevin Brady,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Brady: I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     3832, the ``Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act,'' \n     which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and in \n     addition to the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of \n     your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 3832 that \n     fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, I agree to discharge our committee from further \n     consideration of this bill so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.\n       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3832 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our \n     committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as \n     this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our \n     committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an \n     appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks \n     that you support any such request.\n       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 3832, and would ask \n     that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be \n     included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 3832.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter \n     regarding H.R. 3832, the ``Stolen Identity Refund Fraud \n     Prevention Act of 2016.'' As you noted, the Committee on the \n     Judiciary was granted an additional referral of the bill.\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal \n     consideration of H.R. 3832 so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although \n     you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on \n     the Judiciary is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that \n     fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support your \n     effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of \n     conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this \n     legislation.\n       I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this legislation on the House \n     floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kevin Brady,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I commend my friend from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) for his work on this \nbill. As he knows, I have been interested in this issue of tax fraud \nand identity theft for some time.\n  I am pleased that the bill we are marking up today, H.R. 3832, \nincludes many provisions included in the bill that I put forth, H.R. \n3981, the Identity Theft and Tax Fraud Prevention Act. These provisions \ninclude having a central point of contact for a victim of identity \ntheft and taxpayer notification of suspected identity theft. In \naddition, two of my amendments were included in the bill.\n  The first would create a local law enforcement liaison within the \nCriminal Investigation Division of the IRS. Our police and law \nenforcement officers are out every day, keeping our communities safe \nand tracking down criminals. Too often, coordinating their efforts with \nthe IRS when it comes to identity theft is not as easy as it should be.\n  My amendment helps law enforcement officers do their jobs by creating \na local law enforcement liaison at the IRS. This position will be \ntasked with sharing information and responding to local law enforcement \nwhen they have information or inquiries about identity theft cases. It \nis common sense, and it will make it easier for police officers to go \nto a single place at the IRS when they want to work a case.\n  The second amendment included in this bill deals with the IRS phone \nscam, and this is growing by the day. Imagine sitting at home when you \nreceive a call from a threatening voice on the other end of the line \nthat claims to be the IRS. For too many Americans, this experience is \nall too familiar. These criminals may ask unsuspecting citizens for \ntheir personal information, for their Social Security numbers, or even \nfor bank account information--that has been done; it is very common--\nand will threaten them with arrest or other penalties if the listeners \ndon't comply. These phone scams have become increasingly aggressive and \nharmful to taxpayers.\n  My amendment addresses this problem in practical ways. First, it \nrequires the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to issue \na report that identifies potential technological solutions to the phone \nscam.\n\n[[Page H2394]]\n\n  Second, it would have the IRS provide information to callers who may \nbe put on hold, when calling in, regarding common identity theft tax \nscams and how to avoid them.\n  We need to do all we can to make sure taxpayers are informed and \narmed against these scams. Identity theft and tax fraud is a growing \nproblem in the United States of America. As technology changes and as \ncriminal syndicates target American citizens' tax returns, we have an \nobligation to address the issue.\n  This bill does not go quite as far as I would have liked, and I urge \nmy colleagues to take a look at H.R. 3981. I am also proud to be a \ncosponsor of Congressman John Lewis' bill, the Taxpayer Protection Act \nof 2016, which takes additional steps to increase funding for taxpayer \nservices and to end the use of private debt collectors.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. I congratulate its \nsponsor as it is a good example of how we can work together across the \naisle and find commonsense solutions for the American people. I hope \nthis is a harbinger of things to come. Who knows?\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3832. \nMr. Renacci and I are very good friends, as I am with Mr. Lewis, and it \nis good to see Mr. Pascrell here today.\n  The gentleman is right in that it is nice to see us working together \nto do something about people. This is about people. This is policy that \nconcerns people, and it works in the right direction. I don't think \nthere is anything quite as unnerving as finding out that somebody has \nstolen your identity. I think Shakespeare sums it up right in Othello \nby putting it really succinctly when he says: ``But he that filches \nfrom me my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes \nme poor indeed.''\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Now, Pennsylvania is sixth in population but second when it comes to \nfraud, tax fraud. This is incredible that this could happen.\n  As we sit here today--and as Mr. Pascrell so clearly pointed out, and \nMr. Renacci--this is about protecting people from people who wish to do \nthem harm. They not only wish to take their tax returns, but it robs \nthem of their identity. There is nothing that could be more chilling \nthan losing your identity.\n  As we look at how this goes forward--and I think that this phone \nfraud is the one that is particularly interesting. When the IRS calls \non you, it is not on the phone. It is in writing. And I tell \nconstituents all the time, I also have received those calls saying \nthat: Hey, you know what? You need to get in touch with us right now. \nWe can handle this over the phone with you.\n  I said: Fine. You know what? Leave your name and number, and I will \nget back to you because I am really busy right now.\n  That is followed by a very quick click.\n  There is so much going on in our world today. We are so vulnerable at \nevery single turn. We put so much information out there on ourselves. \nThis is a piece of legislation that protects people. It protects not \nonly their returns, but protects their identity.\n  So I am glad that Mr. Renacci has done this with Mr. Lewis and my \ngood friend Mr. Pascrell. We stand here today with the same purpose, \nand that is to protect the people who sent us here to represent them. \nIt is the least we can do.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to quickly say that what is really happening out there is \nthat many seniors are being preyed upon. When you get a threatening \nphone call, you don't know what to think. And when you are up there in \nage, as some of us are, Mr. Kelly, you don't know what to expect, and \nyou don't know who to turn to.\n  So this is very important, what Mr. Renacci is putting forth right \nnow. I just want everyone to understand that. It has good bipartisan \nsupport, and I hope that we can move this very, very quickly.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Reed).\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.\n  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to join my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Renacci, and Mr. Kelly--in a common \nrefrain. What Mr. Renacci, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Pascrell have identified \nhere is something we have been working on in the committee for quite \nsome time, and that is to make sure that we have a tax administration \nand a Tax Code that respects the privacy of individuals.\n  When that privacy is violated--I cannot speak like my colleague from \nPennsylvania and quote Shakespeare, as I am a simple country lawyer \nfrom western New York--simply, what we need to do is to stand on the \nside of our taxpayers. When tax fraud occurs, real people suffer as a \nresult of it.\n  What Mr. Renacci and all of us have come together here to support are \nsimple, commonsense reforms that are going to help people out like \nTerry. Terry is from Hornell in my district. He reached out to us, Mr. \nSpeaker, about 1\\1/2\\ years to 2 years ago. He, too, was the victim of \nidentity fraud and identity theft.\n  When he went to file his return, he found out that he would not be \ngetting that refund because someone had already stolen that money from \nthe U.S. Government. Terry relied on that money, Mr. Speaker. He needed \nthat money. After many phone calls, after many efforts from our office, \nwe were able to work it out and get that taken care of for Terry.\n  Terry is representative of millions of Americans who have found \nthemselves in this situation, just like Mr. Renacci did. So I applaud \nMr. Renacci for developing these commonsense reforms that are going to \ngive a point of contact at the IRS, that are going to make sure when \npeople engage in identity theft in the tax arena that there are real \npenalties and consequences to that behavior.\n  I strongly support this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my \ncolleagues, just as has been demonstrated here today, to come together \nas we care deeply about the American taxpayer and stand for them as the \nvictims of this crime.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I again want to thank my colleague, Mr. Lewis, for his work with me \nand this legislation. I also truly want to thank Mr. Pascrell. As he \nsaid, I hope it is a sign of things to come, where we can work together \non important issues that face the American people.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund \nFraud Prevention Act of 2016.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016, as \namended. While I support the legislation's underlying goal of deterring \nand preventing tax-related identity theft and tax fraud, I strongly \noppose the bill's expansion of mandatory minimum sentencing.\n  Section 5 of the bill would expand the mandatory minimums found in \nTitle 18 Section 1028A of the United States Code. This section of Title \n18 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of two years for ``aggravated \nidentity theft.'' Under section 5 of this bill, a violation of section \n7206(b) of the Internal Revenue Code would require a judge to impose a \ntwo year mandatory minimum regardless of the circumstances of the case. \nWhile a two year sentence may be appropriate for most individuals \nconvicted under this bill, it should be left to the discretion of the \nsentencing judge to determine the exact sentence based on all the \nrelevant facts and circumstances.\n  Research and evidence in the past few decades has demonstrated that \nmandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' \nmoney, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate \nagainst minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. \nUnfortunately, there are too many mandatory minimums in the federal \ncode.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we expect to do anything about that problem, the \nfirst step has to be to stop passing new ones. The mandatory minimums \nin the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at \na time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have \nbeen a good idea. Therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory \nminimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote No on H.R. 3832.\n\n[[Page H2395]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3832, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2395-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2395-H2397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REAFFIRMATION OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT AND THE SIX ASSURANCES\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the \nconcurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 88) reaffirming the Taiwan \nRelations Act and the Six Assurances as the cornerstone of United \nStates-Taiwan relations, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.\n  The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 88\n\n       Whereas the Cold War years cemented the close friendship \n     between the United States and Taiwan, with Taiwan as an anti-\n     Communist ally in the Asia-Pacific;\n       Whereas United States economic aid prevented Taiwan from \n     sliding into an economic depression in the 1950s and greatly \n     contributed to the island's later economic takeoff;\n       Whereas Taiwan has flourished to become a beacon of \n     democracy in Asia and leading trade partner for the United \n     States, and the relationship has endured for more than 65 \n     years through many shifts in Asia's geopolitical landscape;\n       Whereas the strong relationship between the United States \n     and Taiwan is based on mutually beneficial security, \n     commercial, and cultural ties;\n       Whereas Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton \n     stated in her testimony before the House Foreign Affairs \n     Committee on February 11, 2016, that ``The people on Taiwan \n     have built a prosperous, free, and orderly society with \n     strong institutions, worthy of emulation and envy'';\n       Whereas Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken stated \n     on March 29, 2016, that with Taiwan's January 2016 elections, \n     ``the people of Taiwan showed the world again what a mature, \n     Chinese-speaking democracy looks like'';\n       Whereas on January 1, 1979, when the Carter Administration \n     established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic \n     of China (PRC), it ended formal diplomatic ties with the \n     Republic of China on Taiwan;\n       Whereas, the United States Congress acted swiftly to \n     reaffirm the United States-Taiwan relationship with the \n     enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act just 100 days later, \n     ensuring the United States maintained a robust and enduring \n     relationship with Taiwan;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8) was \n     enacted on April 10, 1979, codifying into law the basis for \n     continued commercial, cultural, and other relations between \n     the United States and Taiwan;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted ``to help \n     maintain peace, security, and stability in the Western \n     Pacific'', which ``are in the political, security, and \n     economic interests of the United States and are matters of \n     international concern'';\n       Whereas the United States Congress significantly \n     strengthened the draft legislation originally submitted by \n     the Executive Branch to include provisions concerning \n     Taiwan's security in the Taiwan Relations Act;\n       Whereas then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy \n     stated in his written testimony before the House Foreign \n     Affairs Committee on March 14, 2014, that, ``Our enduring \n     relationship under the Taiwan Relations Act represents a \n     unique asset for the United States and is an important \n     multiplier of our influence in the region'', and credited the \n     Taiwan Relations Act for having ``played such a key part in \n     protecting Taiwan's freedom of action and U.S. interests the \n     last 35 years in the Asia-Pacific area'';\n       Whereas then-Special Assistant to the President and \n     National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs \n     Evan Medeiros noted on March 28, 2014 that the Taiwan \n     Relations Act was ``an enduring expression to the people of \n     Taiwan about our commitment to their well-being, their \n     security, their economic autonomy, and their international \n     space'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states ``the United States \n     decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's \n     Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future \n     of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states that it is the \n     policy of the United States to ``provide Taiwan with arms of \n     a defensive character'' and ``to maintain the capacity of the \n     United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of \n     coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or \n     economic system, of the people on Taiwan'';\n       Whereas each successive United States Administration since \n     the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act has provided arms \n     of a defensive character to Taiwan;\n       Whereas a 2015 Department of Defense report to Congress on \n     Military and Security Developments Involving the People's \n     Republic of China stated that, ``Preparing for potential \n     conflict in the Taiwan Strait remains the focus and primary \n     driver of China's military investment'';\n       Whereas the United States has an abiding interest in the \n     preservation of cross-Strait peace and stability, and in \n     peace and stability in the entire Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas on July 14, 1982, as the United States negotiated \n     with the People's Republic of China over the wording of a \n     joint communique' related to United States arms sales to \n     Taiwan, President Ronald Reagan instructed his representative \n     in Taiwan, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director James \n     R. Lilley, to relay a set of assurances to Taiwan's then-\n     President Chiang Ching-kuo;\n       Whereas in House and Senate testimony immediately after the \n     issuance of the August 17, 1982, Joint Communique' with the \n     PRC, then-Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and \n     Pacific Affairs John H. Holdridge stated on behalf of the \n     Executive Branch that--\n       (1) ``. . .[W]e did not agree to set a date certain for \n     ending arms sales to Taiwan'';\n       (2) ``. . .[W]e see no mediation role for the United \n     States'' between Taiwan and the PRC;\n       (3) ``. . .[N]or will we attempt to exert pressure on \n     Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC'';\n       (4) ``. . .[T]here has been no change in our longstanding \n     position on the issue of sovereignty over Taiwan'';\n       (5) ``We have no plans to seek'' revisions to the Taiwan \n     Relations Act; and\n       (6) the August 17 Communique', ``should not be read to \n     imply that we have agreed to engage in prior consultations \n     with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan'';\n       Whereas these assurances, first delivered to Taiwan's \n     president by AIT Director Lilley, have come to be known as \n     the Six Assurances;\n       Whereas in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs \n     Committee on October 4, 2011, then-Assistant Secretary of \n     State Kurt Campbell stated that, ``[The] Taiwan Relations \n     Act, plus the so-called Six Assurances and Three \n     Communique's, form the foundation of our overall approach'', \n     to relations with Taiwan; and\n       Whereas in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee on April 3, 2014, Assistant Secretary of State \n     Daniel R. Russel stated that the Six Assurances ``continue to \n     play an important part as an element of our approach to \n     Taiwan and the situation across the strait'': Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) affirms that the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six \n     Assurances are both cornerstones of United States relations \n     with Taiwan; and\n       (2) urges the President and Department of State to affirm \n     the Six Assurances publicly, proactively, and consistently as \n     a cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nany extraneous material in the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 88.\n  I would like to recognize Mr. Chabot for his longstanding dedication \nand support for the people of Taiwan.\n  Mr. Speaker, Taiwan has always been a strong friend and critical ally \nto the United States. Congress has been central to this relationship, \nchampioning a strong relationship with Taiwan through landmark measures \nlike the Taiwan Relations Act and through pressing successive \nadministrations to fulfill their obligation to sell defensive arms to \nTaiwan.\n  Taiwan is now the United States' ninth largest trading partner, and \nit is in the U.S.' interest to have a stable and a prosperous Taiwan.\n  It is an exciting time in Taiwan. In January, a free and fair \nelection once again demonstrated the strength and vibrancy of Taiwan's \ndemocratic system. And in 3 days, we expect the newly elected President \nto be inaugurated in a peaceful transfer of power from one party to \nanother.\n  The people of Taiwan should be proud of their prosperous, free, and \ndemocratic society and what they have been able to accomplish, despite \nhaving to face countless challenges outside of their control.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the\n\n[[Page H2396]]\n\nPeople's Republic of China on January 1, 1979, the U.S. Congress acted \njust 100 days later to pass the Taiwan Relations Act, which would \nensure that the United States maintained a robust and enduring \nrelationship with Taiwan.\n  Three years later, in 1982, President Reagan deepened the U.S. \ncommitment to Taiwan by issuing the Six Assurances to Taiwan, which \nincluded treating Taiwan as we would treat any one of our allies when \nmaking decisions on defensive arms sales, not setting a date for \ntermination of arms sales, and not altering the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is especially important when it comes \nto the Six Assurances. When the Reagan administration delivered the Six \nAssurances, it was by way of a verbal agreement and has largely \nremained as such since 1982.\n  Today, by passing this resolution, Congress is going on record that \nthe cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan policy is not only the Taiwan Relations \nAct, but also the Six Assurances. This important measure solidifies \nPresident Reagan's commitment to Taiwan and urges this administration \nand the ones that follow to publicly, proactively, and consistently \ntake the Six Assurances into account when handling United States-Taiwan \nrelations.\n  I am proud that in the 114th Congress we have already passed \nlegislation which supports Taiwan's inclusion in INTERPOL and that we \nare now also passing a measure which will reassure our friends in \nTaiwan and press the administration to continue to abide by the Six \nAssurances. I am also proud that maintaining a strong relationship with \nTaiwan continues to be a bipartisan issue.\n  I appreciate Mr. Eliot Engel's support on this initiative, the \nranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Let me say that, by \npassing this resolution, we, the United States Congress, are yet again \ntaking another step toward strengthening the U.S.-Taiwan partnership.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this resolution.\n  Let me once again thank Chairman Ed Royce and our colleague from Ohio \n(Mr. Chabot), who introduced this measure.\n  At the end of this week, Taiwan will swear in a new President, \nmarking another peaceful democratic transition in that country. I have \nhad the pleasure of meeting the President-elect, Dr. Tsai Ing-wen, \nseveral times as well as the country's outgoing leader, President Ma. \nAnd though they represent different political parties, it is clear that \nthey are both fully committed to Taiwan's vibrant democracy and open \nsociety. Those values are also at the root of the close ties between \nthe United States and Taiwan.\n  This resolution affirms our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act \nand the Six Assurances. These are the measures that have underpinned \nour relationship with the Taiwanese people since we normalized \nrelations with the People's Republic of China.\n  As Taiwan prepares for this week's political transition, it is vital \nthat the United States send a clear signal that we continue to stand \nwith the people of Taiwan on a range of issues, from Taiwan's defense \nto its growing role on the global stage, to its commitment to freedom \nand democracy.\n  So I am happy to support this measure. We should continue to stand \nwith our partners in Taiwan, and I wish the people of Taiwan well as \nthey swear in a new President this week. I might add, it is the first \nwoman President of Taiwan.\n  I urge support for this resolution.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Chabot). He is chairman of the Small Business Committee, a senior \nmember of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the author of this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 88.\n  I was one of the original founders of the Congressional Taiwan \nCaucus. It was a bipartisan group of people who founded it. I have been \nthe chairman of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Asia and the \nPacific. I have been a longtime friend of Taiwan. I have been there \nprobably a dozen times over the years.\n  This important legislation reaffirms the Taiwan Relations Act and the \nSix Assurances as cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations.\n  As a longtime supporter of Taiwan, as I mentioned, I believe that the \nU.S.-Taiwan relationship is absolutely vital to the security and \nsustainability not just of Taiwan, but of the whole region.\n  Taiwan is a close ally, one that truly believes and practices freedom \nand democracy. We witnessed this firsthand this past January, as some \nof my colleagues have mentioned, when the people of Taiwan held \ndemocratic national elections resulting in the election of Tsai Ing-\nwen. I want to congratulate her and wish her best wishes in her role as \nPresident of Taiwan.\n  Taiwan elects their people democratically, unlike the PRC right \nacross the Taiwan Strait. As we know, China has been bullying Taiwan \nfor many years now. It is unfortunate that the PRC, China, doesn't \nfollow, as an example, the people of Taiwan, who democratically elect \ntheir leaders.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Taiwan faces an unrelenting threat from China, which has nearly 1,600 \nballistic missiles aimed at this small island. I remember when I came \nto Congress about 20 years ago, we talked about how scary it was that \nthere were a couple hundred, 200 or 300 missiles aimed at Taiwan at \nthat time. That has increased over the years to 1,600 missiles aimed at \nTaiwan from China.\n  Although Taiwan enjoys de facto independence, China's ultimate goal \nis to take over Taiwan, to annex Taiwan, whatever the people of Taiwan \nbelieve. We absolutely cannot let that happen. China's ultimate goal, \nas I say, is the annexation of the island. We have all seen the growing \nhostilities in the East China Sea and South China Sea over the last \ncouple years.\n  I believe that this legislation underscores the point that the Taiwan \nStrait continues to be one of the potential flash points on the globe. \nWe have seen China literally building islands and then militarizing \nthose islands, much to the chagrin of all their neighbors in the \nregion, from Japan to Vietnam, to Taiwan, to the Philippines, and on \nand on. That is what the PRC, China, has been up to. Any sort of \nsolution between China and Taiwan should be reached in a peaceful and \nfair manner and only with the agreement of the people of Taiwan.\n  Mr. Speaker, April 10, 2016, marked the 37th anniversary of the \nenactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, the TRA. This act codifies into \nlaw an institutional framework and legal basis for continued \ninteraction between the U.S. and Taiwan, and it serves to maintain \npeace and stability in the western Pacific.\n  When President Ronald Reagan agreed to sign the U.S.-China third \ncommunique in 1982, he was aware of the communique's effect on Taiwan \nand fully recognized that Taiwan needed to be reassured that they would \nnot be abandoned--and they will not be abandoned--by the United States.\n  In order to reinforce American support for Taiwan, the United States \nissued the Six Assurances. The Six Assurances provided a framework for \nsustaining the unique relationship between the United States and our \nally, Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, they are as valid today as they were back in \n1982. They rightfully function along with the TRA, as cornerstones of \nU.S.-Taiwan relations.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to \nclose.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important that the democracies of the world stand \ntogether to help strengthen freedom, justice, and opportunity. That is \nwhy the United States and Taiwan have been such natural partners over \nthe decades. Even as we deal with the People's Republic of China, we \nmust continue to stand with our friends in Taiwan.\n  Again, I am delighted that Dr. Tsai Ing-wen is the first female \nPresident of Taiwan. Perhaps we will follow suit in November with the \nfirst woman President. This resolution reaffirms just how important \nthat relationship is; and as Taiwan moves forward with this week's \npolitical transition, that country's people should know that they have \nan enduring friend in the United States.\n\n[[Page H2397]]\n\n  Again, I commend Mr. Chabot for his insight in putting forward this \nresolution. I thank our chairman. I support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of the Committee on \nForeign Affairs.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their wonderful leadership for many years on the issue of \nstrengthening U.S.-Taiwan relations. I also want to thank the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my dear friend, for authoring this important \nresolution of which I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  H. Con. Res. 88 reaffirms the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six \nAssurances as the cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations, guidelines to \nwhich there should be no doubt about the commitment of the United \nStates to our neighbor.\n  In January, Taiwan once again demonstrated that it is one of the \nworld's strongest and most vibrant democracies, a great partner, and I \ncongratulate President-elect Tsai on her tremendous election and all of \nthe people of Taiwan on their continued democratic success.\n  Taiwan is truly a beacon of freedom in the Pacific, serving as an \ninspiration for those still suffering under repressive regimes, and is \nliving proof of what can be achieved with liberty and self-government, \nprinciples that undergird both of our nations and form the foundation \nfor our mutual stability, for our security, for our prosperity.\n  As Taiwan's neighbor China continues raising tensions in the region, \nit is crucial that the United States provide Taiwan with the capability \nto defend herself against Chinese aggression, whether that aggression \nis political in nature, economic, or military. Both China and Taiwan \nmust know that our commitment to Taiwan has not wavered one bit.\n  Taiwan is an essential U.S. ally. It is our friend. It is our \npartner. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my friend, for \nauthoring this resolution, for reaffirming our commitment to the Taiwan \nRelations Act, to the Six Assurances, and to the Taiwanese people here \ntoday.\n  The United States will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with \nTaiwan. I look forward, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, and ranking member, \nto even greater cooperation and friendship with Taiwan in the years \nahead.\n  I thank the gentleman for the time, and I thank the ranking member \nfor his leadership and Mr. Chabot for authoring this important \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Con. \nRes. 88 and its effects on U.S. foreign relations.\n  Since 1979, the United States has enjoyed a friendly and productive \nrelationship that has been supported by the passage of the Taiwan \nRelations Act and Six Assurances. The Taiwan Relations Act was a \nmonumental piece of legislation that is directly responsible for \nfostering the longstanding friendship between the United States and \nTaiwan. The Six Assurances also played a significant role, setting the \nprinciples by which the United States would mediate its relationship \nwith Taiwan and China.\n  As security concerns have increased in the South Pacific, our allies \nin the region have contributed significantly to the safety and economic \ngrowth of the region. As a member of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I \nam continually supportive of efforts to strengthen the friendship \nbetween our two countries.\n  I would like to commend Congressman Chabot, Chairman Royce, and the \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs for their leadership on this issue and \ntheir continued efforts in championing the close ties we have with \nTaiwan. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this measure so we \ncan continue to ensure a bright future for both Taiwan and for the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As one of the coauthors of this legislation, I really want to thank \nRepresentative Chabot for introducing this measure and for being a \nlongtime champion on Taiwan, especially as he was chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Asia and the Pacific last Congress. I want to thank Mr. \nEngel as well for his efforts on this legislation.\n  We have a commitment to democracy, and we share that with Taiwan. We \nshare this commitment to the rule of law, to human rights. Frankly, \nTaiwan serves as an example of what can be built based upon these \nshared principles, and so do we.\n  I think the Six Assurances are a critical element of U.S.-Taiwan \npolicy, but obviously they are not consistently referenced or referred \nto as a cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan policy alongside the Taiwan \nRelations Act, which is considered that cornerstone. Passage of H. Con. \nRes. 88 will put that longstanding verbal agreement onto paper, and, in \nturn, it will call on the administration and future administrations in \nunambiguous terms to publicly abide by the assurances offered by \nPresident Reagan.\n  Taiwan is one of America's closest friends, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 88.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. \n88, reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as the \ncornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations.\n  As a co-Chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I want to thank my \ncolleague and founding co-Chair of the Taiwan Caucus, Steve Chabot, for \nintroducing this measure.\n  When discussing the origins, stakeholders, and impact of the Taiwan \nRelations Act (TRA), it is important to note the significant role \nCongress played in amending the draft legislation the Executive Branch \nproposed for the maintenance of unofficial relations with Taiwan.\n  I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee for working with me on an amendment to H. Con. Res. \n88 that credits Congress with significantly strengthening the TRA and \nthe codified U.S. commitment to Taiwan.\n  The draft legislative text proposed by the Executive Branch published \nin the March 1979 Department of State Bulletin included three simple \ntitles to provide the legal authority for the maintenance of \ncommercial, cultural, and other relations with Taiwan.\n  However, the Taiwan Relations Act enacted into law bears little \nresemblance to the text published in the March 1979 Bulletin.\n  Through the legislative process in both the House of Representatives \nand Senate, Congress left its mark on our enduring commitment to Taiwan \nin several ways, most notably by adding the security commitments made \nin Section 2(b)(5) and Section 3 of the TRA.\n  The U.S. and Taiwan have since developed a dynamic relationship based \non our shared values, deep economic ties, security relationship, and a \nhistory of bilateral collaboration.\n  It is in the tradition of Congressional stewardship of the U.S.-\nTaiwan relationship that I urge my colleagues to support H.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and to extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material in the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2143, the Starr-Camargo Bridge \nact, introduced by Senator Cornyn and by Representative Cuellar of \nTexas. With today's passage, this bill goes to the President's desk for \nsignature.\n  The Starr-Camargo Bridge act grants permanent authority to continue \noperating and maintaining the international bridge that connects Rio \nGrande City, Texas, with Mexican cities such as Monterrey and Mexico \nCity. This bridge is one of 28 vehicle border crossings on the Texas-\nMexico border and one of two privately owned crossing facilities. The \nStarr-Camargo Bridge has had continued growth in commercial traffic \nsince 2009, and it plays an important role in facilitating legitimate \ntrade and travel in the region.\n  This bill, S. 2143, would permanently extend the authority for the \nStarr-Camargo Bridge Company to operate the bridge. It would grant the \nbridge company the same rights and privileges already granted to this \nbody to the B and P Bridge Company in Progreso, Texas. By granting this \nauthority, we would be incentivizing the Starr-Camargo Bridge Company \nto continue maintaining and expanding the bridge's capacity to keep up \nwith growing trade and commerce along the Texas border with Mexico.\n  This legislation received the full support of the Committee on \nForeign Affairs when it was marked up last month.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and \nI yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me once again thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for \nbringing forward this bipartisan measure and for his continued good \nleadership on the committee. I also want to thank the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Cuellar), my good friend, who introduced the House version \nof this legislation which has already passed the Senate.\n  When it comes to our southern neighbor, Mexico, lately we have been \nhearing far too much about building walls. Mexico is a critically \nimportant partner to the United States. Our people share long, close \nties, so we should be talking about building bridges, Mr. Speaker, not \nbuilding walls.\n  A few weeks ago, the Senate helped build a bridge by confirming a new \nAmbassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson. This was long overdue. She is \nexcellent, and we are glad to have her on her way to Mexico City now.\n  Today, with this bill, we are talking about, quite literally, \nstrengthening a bridge between the United States and Mexico in the \nyears ahead. The Starr-Camargo Bridge connects Rio Grande, Texas, with \nMonterrey and Ciudad Camargo in Mexico. The legal authority to operate \nthis bridge will expire in 16 years. That may seem like a long way off, \nbut as a result of that end date, we have already started to see a \nconstraint in long-term investments. This bill would eliminate that \nexpiration date.\n  We have done the same thing before. The Weslaco-Progreso \nInternational Bridge once had a sunsetting authorization, and Congress \nacted to lift that deadline.\n  This bill doesn't cost the U.S. taxpayers a penny, but it does clear \nthe way for this bridge to remain an important conduit between our \ncountries for years to come. It also sends an important message from \nthose of us actually responsible for making laws and advancing American \nforeign policy.\n  Mexico is an extremely important partner to the United States, and \nbridges--not barriers--will help that friendship to thrive. I support \nthis measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. CUELLAR. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Chairman Ed Royce for his \nleadership and for the help of his staff on this particular bill.\n  Also, I thank my friend, the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel, and his \nstaff also for supporting and helping us on this particular bill.\n  As the lead sponsor of this bill, I rise in support of this \nlegislation. Mr. Speaker, this bill will provide equity in the law and \nremoves a level of uncertainty.\n  In 1962, Congress authorized the Starr-Camargo International Bridge \nCompany to construct, operate, and maintain the private toll bridge \nbetween the United States and Mexico near Rio Grande City, which is a \ncity in my district.\n  Congress, in drafting this original authorization, included a sunset \nclause of 66 years. In doing so, Congress left a level of uncertainty \nin the law, as it did not state what should happen to the bridge once \nthe 66 years went by.\n  Congress has authorized private toll bridges or other bridges along \nthe U.S.-Mexico border before, yet previously had not included this \nsunset on the authorization. This sunset clause, while still a number \nof years away, has already begun to create issues for the owner and \noperator of the Starr-Camargo Bridge bill.\n  Due to this uncertainty around what should happen to this bridge \nshould the authorization lapse, they are unable to get much-needed \nlong-term financing to make improvements and finance the long-term \nmaintenance and operations of the bridge. This bill will give the \nStarr-Camargo Bridge permanent status.\n  The Starr-Camargo Bridge plays an important role in our Nation's \ncommerce and the economy of south Texas. The bridge supports 200 to 300 \ncommercial trucks per day, consisting of construction materials as well \nas fresh fruits and vegetables coming north and machinery, oil, and \nrecyclable products going south. The bridge further supports the \ncrossing of around 4,000 cars a day.\n  Today the United States trades an estimated $531 billion in goods and \nservices with Mexico, our Nation's third largest trading partner, and \nthis trade is only expected to grow in the future. In order for our \nNation to take\n\n[[Page H2399]]\n\nfull advantage of this trade, we must be clear in these sorts of \nuncertainties in the law.\n  This bill, by ending the authorization's sunset, will afford the \nbridge greater opportunities to pursue and finance projects that will \nenhance and expand the capacity of the bridge and supporting facilities \nand further improve trade between the United States and Mexico.\n  I would like to thank Senator Cornyn for working with me on this \nlegislation and for taking that lead and, as I said a few minutes ago, \nChairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their support as well as \ntheir staffs.\n  I also would like to thank local leaders, Starr County Judge Eloy \nVera and State Representative Ryan Guillen, for their support of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, again I want to emphasize that \nMexico is a vital partner to the United States in terms of trade, \nsecurity, and a wide range of regional concerns. We need to keep all \nthe channels between our countries flowing, and that includes the \nphysical connections between the U.S. and Mexico.\n  This bill would help strengthen an important bridge between our \ncountries and, at the same time, signal just how important we consider \nthis friendship. I support this measure. I thank the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to thank Representative Cuellar for his steadfast leadership \nto ensure the House's consideration of this legislation and that we \nmove forward on this.\n  I thought I would also point out that this bill comes at no cost to \nthe taxpayer. What it does instead is incentivizes the private sector \nto invest and maintain this important commercial border crossing. That \nis the point here.\n  While the actual end date for the bridge's authority is still some \nyears away, the lack of that permanent authority has already begun to \nconstrain the financing of long-term improvements that will help make \nthe crossing more efficient and secure.\n  So I thank Mr. Cuellar again and, also, Mr. Castro and Mr. Poe, both \nmembers of the committee who have also been strong supporters.\n  I thank Mr. Engel for helping to ensure that our border \ninfrastructure is maintained and modernized to keep pace with the \ngrowing legitimate commercial activity across our southern border.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2143.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2399-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2399-H2406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FRANK R.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, 18 years after enactment of the International \nReligious Freedom Act of 1998, the right to believe and practice one's \nfaith remains under threat around the world.\n  The threats come not just from authoritarian regimes obsessed with \ncontrol, such as North Korea, Iran, or Vietnam, which were the focus of \nthat law, but also from lethal terrorist groups.\n  Two months ago this Chamber made history by declaring that the so-\ncalled Islamic State, or ISIS, is committing genocide against religious \nand ethnic minorities. It has committed mass murder, beheadings, rape, \ntorture, slavery, and the kidnapping of children, among many other \natrocities. ISIS dynamites churches and flattens ancient monasteries, \nhoping to erase the very existence of religious groups that disagree \nwith their brutal world view.\n  Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Shabaab in East Africa are also \nresponsible for their own deadly persecutions, both also linked to ISIS \nin their support for that terrorist movement.\n  These groups have turned religious intolerance into a murderous force \nof global instability. The right to believe and practice according to \nthe dictates of conscience is a direct challenge to their ideologies. \nThus, religious freedom is not just a human rights issue; frankly, \ntoday, it is a global security issue. However, current law related to \nreligious freedom, which focuses solely on governments of sovereign \nstates, does not address this reality.\n  Based on years of oversight and multiple hearings, H.R. 1150, the \nFrank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, updates the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to improve the coordination \nand effectiveness of U.S. efforts to promote religious liberty around \nthe world and also expressly addresses the role of these non-state \nactors like ISIS.\n  Introduced by Subcommittee Chairman Smith and Congresswoman Anna \nEshoo, the bill was amended and agreed to by the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee and has more than 115 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  It is fitting that this bill is named in honor of our former \ncolleague from Virginia, Frank Wolf, a tireless advocate for human \nrights and the author of the original International Religious Freedom \nAct of 1998, which we are amending.\n  By enhancing coordination, confronting non-state actors, and \nimproving reporting and training, H.R. 1150 is a helpful refinement of \nour statutory commitment to combat religious persecution around the \nglobe. It deserves our unanimous support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committee on Financial Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2016.\n     Hon.

I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring \n     this legislation before the House of Representatives in an \n     expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform will forego action on the \n     bill.\n       The Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1150 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation.

Wolf \n     International Religious Freedom Act, and for agreeing to be \n     discharged from further consideration of that bill.\n       I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure \n     does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, or prejudice \n     its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar \n     legislation in the future.

Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me again thank \nChairman Ed Royce for bringing this bill forward. I also want to thank \nmy friend, Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, for his leadership \nand for authorizing this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, freedom of religion has been a bedrock principle of open \nand democratic societies for centuries. Some of the first immigrants to \nsettle on American shores sailed here because they were fleeing \nreligious persecution at home. This liberty is enshrined in our own \nfounding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and \nin the charters of democracies all over the world.\n  The freedom to worship as a person chooses or not to worship at all \nshould be settled business and nobody's business but the person \nthemselves. Yet, around the world religious communities endure \ndiscrimination, persecution, and violence.\n  It is amazing to me that, when we look at the history of strife and \nwar that has swirled around religious persecution, governments continue \nto deny this freedom to their own people. This assault on religious \nliberty holds societies back and undercuts progress. It obviously has \nno place in the 21st century.\n  So for the United States and other countries that cherish freedom, it \nis not enough just to guarantee religious liberty to our own people. We \nneed to speak out and act when we see this right under attack around \nthe world. For that matter, we have a responsibility to speak out when \nwe see any liberty under attack, whether freedom of the press, the \nright to organize, or the equality of LGBT persons.\n  Mr. Smith's legislation would help ensure that promoting and \nsupporting religious liberty are a component of American foreign \npolicy. It would help ensure that our diplomats around the world \nunderstand the importance of this issue and are working to advance this \nfreedom on the front lines.\n  It is worth noting that we should also continue to fully fund the \nState Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund, which helps address \na range of human rights abuses around the world, including threats to \nour religious freedom. Together with this legislation, it sends a clear \nmessage to the world that protecting human rights is a priority for the \nUnited States.\n  So I support this measure. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I \nagain want to congratulate my friend Mr. Smith, who is so strong on \nissues like this and so forceful in pushing forward all the way until \nwe finally got this on the floor of the House.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \nOrganizations, and the author of the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, \nChairman Royce, for his leadership on this bill, the markup, and for \nthe very timely recommendations he and staff made to improve it.\n  I would like to thank Eliot Engel again for working hand in glove in \na good, bipartisan effort to protect international religious freedom.\n  As my good friend, Chairman Royce, noted a moment ago, 18 years ago \nCongress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom \nAct of 1998. That landmark bill, authored by Congressman Frank Wolf of \nVirginia, made advancing the right to religious freedom a significant \nand profoundly serious U.S. foreign policy priority.\n  Passage of the International Religious Freedom Act was not easy. \nThere were determined opponents in Congress and in the Clinton \nadministration. I know. I chaired the congressional hearings and the \nsubcommittee markup. It was no cakewalk.\n  But our opposition was overcome by the courage, tenacity, and vision \nof Frank Wolf, bolstered by a diverse, bipartisan, and ecumenical \ncoalition of Members of Congress, ethnic minority and religions groups, \nand human rights organizations. That coalition has reassembled to \nsupport this bill today, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious \nFreedom Act.\n  I want to especially thank Anna Eshoo, who is the principal \nDemocratic sponsor of this legislation, for her leadership and for \nworking particularly in the Middle East to combat the savagery that is \nbeing imposed upon people of minority faiths, including Christians.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  I thank her for her leadership and, again, for being the principal \nDemocrat on this bill.\n  Let me just note that naming this bill after Frank Wolf, who I \nconsider to be, and many of us consider to be the William Wilberforce \nof modern times, is an attempt to recognize his extraordinary life's \nwork promoting human rights, 34 years as a Member of Congress, \nincluding, and especially, religious freedom.\n  He now serves as the Wilson Chair at Baylor, again, continuing his \nlifesaving work for religious believers all over the world.\n  He just returned from Nigeria and testified at our hearing last week. \nHe was in the embattled states in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram \nruns free, massacring people. He was there on a fact-finding mission to \npromote religious freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act \nthat is before us is a series of upgrades to meet the challenges of the \n21st century.\n  We know that the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of \ninternational religious freedom; a crisis that continues to create \nmillions--no, tens of millions of victims; a crisis that undermines \nliberty, prosperity, and peace; a crisis that poses a direct challenge \nto the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China, Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and elsewhere in the world.\n  The Pew Research Center notes that over 75 percent of the world's \npopulation today lives in countries where severe religious freedom \nabuses occur annually. According to Pew, instances of anti-Semitism are \nat a 7-year high. It is getting worse everywhere, particularly in the \nMiddle East, but also in Europe and in the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on \nthe verge of extinction, and other religious minorities in the Middle \nEast face a\n\n[[Page H2405]]\n\nconstant assault from the Islamic State.\n  Several weeks ago, this Congress passed a resolution, sponsored by \nJeff Fortenberry, that was followed by a declaration by Secretary of \nState John Kerry, that said that ISIS has committed, and continues to \ncommit genocide, mass atrocities and war crimes against Christians, \nYazidis, and other minority faiths.\n  We are on record. We know it is happening. We are speaking out.\n  In a couple of weeks, I am chairing a hearing on what is next; what \nshould we be doing next to combat this terrible, terrible crisis.\n  In Nigeria, the Islamist terror group, Boko Haram, is believed to \nhave killed over 6,600 people last year alone, mostly Christian, but \nthere are Muslims as well who are being targeted. According to the \ntestimony we received last week, since 2009, the number is about 15,000 \nyear to date since 2009.\n  Mr. Speaker, at one of those hearings a few years ago, I had a man \nnamed Habila. Habila, I met him at an IDP camp in Jos, Nigeria, where a \nlot of churches have been firebombed. He told me this story. He was \ncredible, and it checked out. And he came to Congress and testified.\n  Boko Haram put an AK-47--a terrorist--to his jaw and said: Renounce \nChrist or I will kill you. You must become a Muslim on the spot.\n  Habila said: I am ready to meet my Lord.\n  And this terrorist pulled the trigger and blew most of his face away.\n  What courage, what faith for a man. And when he told the story, you \ncould have heard a pin drop.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International \nReligious Freedom just released its 2016 annual report. And let me \nnote, parenthetically, USCIRF, or that Commission, was also created by \nChairman Wolf as part of IRFA, the original bill.\n  They have found that the abuses committed by governments and non-\nstate actors has ``deteriorated.'' ``The incarceration of prisoners of \nconscience''--they point out--``remains astonishingly widespread . . \n.''\n  They point out that ``Over the past year, the Chinese government''--\nas just one of many examples--``has stepped up its persecution of \nreligious groups''--across the board: Tibetans, Uighurs, Muslim \nUighurs, Christians, and, of course, the Falun Gong.\n  I spoke in mid-February at NYU, I gave a keynote there in Shanghai, \nand talked about how Xi Jinping, the President of China, is in a race \nto the bottom with North Korea to make religion absolutely subservient \nto the Communist Party. He calls it the sinification of religion; and \nwhat was already a bad situation has now become demonstrably worse.\n  The Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade \nthe tools so that this administration, and subsequent ones, can do an \neven better job to try to mitigate and, hopefully, end religious \npersecution. It does this by, one, requiring that international \nreligious freedom policies be integrated into national security, \nimmigration, rule of law, and other relevant U.S. foreign policies.\n  It creates a Designated Persons List of individuals sanctioned for \nparticipating in or directing religious freedom abuses.\n  It expands diplomatic training on international religious freedoms \nfor all State Department diplomats; creates a tier system for IRFA, for \nthe reports, not just countries of particular concern, of which there \nare currently 10, but also those that are on a watch list, those that \nare bad and, perhaps, getting worse.\n  It gives the President authority to designate non-state actors in \naddition to countries; and it also requires the Ambassador at Large to \nreport directly to the Secretary of State.\n  It also is increasingly clear that religious freedom diplomacy is \nreally needed to advance U.S. interests around the world. This will do \nit.\n  The legislation is backed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \nand the International Religious Freedom Roundtable, a diverse and \necumenical group of individuals from the faith community.\n  Finally, just let me thank Scott Flipse, who worked for Frank Wolf \npreviously, then he worked for the International Religious Freedom \nOffice at the State Department, and now is working at the China \nCommission; our General Counsel, Piero Tozzi; Janice Kaguyutan, I thank \nher for her work on this; and Sajit Gandhi. This is a true, bipartisan \npiece of legislation and, hopefully, the Senate will favorably receive \nit.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, in closing, we focus on human rights as part of \nour foreign policy because it is the right thing to do. The United \nStates is founded on the idea that an individual should be able to live \naccording to his or her own beliefs. That is a value we want to see \nthriving around the world.\n  Advancing human rights is also the smart thing to do. Countries with \na strong respect for human rights are countries that prosper and play a \nconstructive role on the global stage.\n  I want to again say to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nSmith), when he comes for advancing human rights, he takes a second \nseat to nobody. He is indefatigable when it comes to these things. In \nall the years I have known him, he has always been fair and honest. I \nreally sincerely commend him, and know how heartfelt it is and how much \nwe appreciate his hard work.\n  When we see governments stifling religious freedom, or any freedom, \nwe have a responsibility to speak out and make it clear that the United \nStates remains a champion for these basic liberties. This bill helps us \nto live up to that responsibility, and I am proud to support it.\n  I thank Chairman Royce and Mr. Smith.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nVirginia (Mrs. Comstock), our esteemed colleague, who ably represents \nthe district formerly served by Frank Wolf, who is honored in the title \nof this bill. Representative Barbara Comstock is a coauthor of this \nbill with Mr. Smith, and I thank them both.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, ask human rights and religious freedom advocates to name \ntheir most steadfast friend who has served on Capitol Hill over the \nyears, and Representative Frank Wolf, my predecessor, is always on the \nshort list, as are my colleagues here today.\n  So I am honored today to stand in support of a bill I proudly \ncosponsored, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, \nnamed after the distinguished gentleman who served in this seat for the \n10th District of Virginia, and as the co-chair of the Congressional \nHuman Rights Caucus, and a man whose deep faith and commitment to human \nrights and religion freedom were a large part of why he was known for \nyears here and around the country, and even around the world, as the \nconscience of the Congress.\n  He wrote a book, a powerful book, titled a ``Prisoner of \nConscience,'' about his many trips over the years and how he fought for \nreligious freedom; and I hope he doesn't mind if I recommend that book \nto our listeners here.\n  We continue to be blessed with Congressman Wolf's passionate \nleadership as he leads the 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative to \ncreate a world where religious freedom is recognized by nations across \nthe globe as a fundamental human right.\n  Since leaving Congress, Mr. Wolf has continued to travel to the front \nlines to see, firsthand, the plight of ethnic minorities in Iraq and \nSyria, including Christians, Yazidis, Kurds, and other minority \nreligious groups.\n  As previously mentioned, he has just returned from Nigeria. He \ncontinues to shine a light every day on the dark places where men and \nwomen and children, even, of faith are victimized, tortured and, \ntragically, even killed for their faith. He will not let the world look \naway, and we thank him for his continued work and his strong and much-\nneeded voice.\n  Now this legislation amends his own legislation to continue that \nmission that Mr. Wolf so valiantly fought for for 3 decades here in \nCongress. It will improve the ability of the United States to advance \nreligious freedom globally, with stronger and more flexible political \nresponses to a disturbing and growing denial of basic religious \nfreedoms around the world.\n\n[[Page H2406]]\n\n  As has been said by many, Frank Wolf is the William Wilberforce of \nour day. He is, and has always been, a voice for the voiceless. He once \nsaid: ``Most would agree that conscience rights figure prominently in \nthe narrative of America's founding. Historically, Americans and our \ncorresponding institutions have recognized that conscience is not \nultimately allegiant to the state, but to something, and for many \npeople, Someone, higher.''\n  I appreciate the opportunity today to continue that legacy with the \npassing of this important legislation which will continue his important \nand vital mission and legacy; and that is needed now, more than ever, \nfor so many of the reasons that my colleagues here have highlighted.\n  I thank the gentleman so much for the privilege of addressing and \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to \nthis bill and to today's debate, especially Mr. Smith, Congresswoman \nBarbara Comstock and Mr. Engel.\n  The right to believe and practice one's religion according to the \ndictates of conscience is often called the first freedom. It is one of \nthe founding ideas of our Nation, but we do not believe that it is only \nan American value. Rather, this is what we believe here. We believe it \nflows from the inherent dignity of every human person, and it deserves \nprotection everywhere.\n  In today's world, those who are most violently opposed to religious \nfreedom also pose the biggest threat to our Nation. They also pose the \nbiggest threat to civilization worldwide.\n  Thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not some isolated human \nrights concern. No. It is a key component of our national security. And \nthis bill, now authored by Mr. Smith, H.R. 1150, contains important \nupdates to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 that will \nenhance the effectiveness of the United States' efforts to promote that \nliberty around the world, so it deserves our unanimous support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1150, \namending the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act.\n  I support this measure because the right to freedom of religion has \nbeen a cornerstone of the American conscience.\n  Many of our country's first leaders fled religious persecution abroad \nand went on to establish laws protecting religious freedom.\n  This core belief of our great nation does not stop at our national \nborders; we offer refuge to those suffering from religious persecution \nthroughout the world.\n  A testament to this commitment was the International Religious \nFreedom Act of 1998 which was a landmark piece of legislation seeking \nto make religious freedom a higher priority in U.S. Foreign policy.\n  The Act was approved by Congress unanimously in 1998 and signed into \nlaw by President Clinton.\n  The Act condemns violations of religious freedom and promotes and \nassists other governments in the promotion of the fundamental right to \nfreedom of religion.\n  While strides have been made in establishing worldwide practice of \nfreedom of religion, it is currently under attack.\n  Let me also note that people are being prosecuted under blasphemy \nlaws for freedom of expression, which is why I introduced the \nbipartisan measure H. Res. 290, calling for the global repeal of \nblasphemy laws.\n  I support H.R. 1150 because we must continue to work to preserve \nreligious freedoms as well as making sure that religion is not a \npretext for prosecution or persecution in the world.\n  Indeed, one of the key amendments to IRFA would be to relocate the \nOffice of International Religious Freedom within the Office of the \nSecretary of State.\n  This action would allow for greater coordination of strategic focus \nand the minimization of duplicated efforts, streamline mandates, and \ncentralize efforts to engage religious communities and promote human \nrights more generally in regards to religious freedom.\n  Currently, the office is headed by the Ambassador at-Large for \nInternational Religious Freedom which monitors religious persecution \nand discrimination worldwide to develop policy recommendations, \nprograms, and awareness.\n  Besides being placed in the Secretary of State's office, the \nAmbassador at large would be able to make every effort to collaborate \nand coordinate across all U.S. agencies and departments to formulate \nstrategic religious freedom policies, programs, and activities.\n  These two changes will provide a greater ability for us to advance \nreligious freedom throughout the world.\n  H.R. 1150 will also allow us to assist emerging democracies to \nimplement freedom of religion while also helping older partners \nmaintain their freedom of religion practices and conscience.\n  H.R. 1150 calls to ensure that our diplomats and foreign policy \nexperts are well versed in the importance of religious freedom and how \nto address atrocities related to religion.\n  H.R. 1150 also addresses how to improve our ability to promote \nfreedom of religion by enhancing the capabilities and knowledge of our \ndiplomats.\n  Our Foreign Service Officers (FSO) are on the front lines everyday \ncarrying out American foreign policy while also shaping it, which makes \nsure that they are adequately trained on religious freedom.\n  H.R. 1150 directs the Secretary to develop mandatory religious \nfreedom training for all Foreign Service Officers.\n  This major change will enhance FSO capabilities to identify severe \npersecutors to help assemble the Ambassador's Annual Report on \nInternational Religious Freedom.\n  In addition to the Annual Report, H.R. 1150 calls for an updated \nlists of persons that are currently being persecuted and forced to \nrenounce their faith.\n  This is essential in bringing awareness to countries that need to be \nmonitored or that have non-state actors that have high levels of \ndetainment, disappearance, torture, or murder based on someone's \nreligion.\n  Another key aspect of H.R. 1150 is to enhance engagement and \ncoordination with the executive branch on issues pertaining to \ninternational religious freedom policies and global religion engagement \nstrategies.\n  This would be achieved through amendment of The National Security Act \nof 1947, calling for the appointment of a Special Adviser for Global \nReligious Engagement and establishing the Interagency Policy Committee \non Religious Freedom and Engagement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support adequate funding in order \nto enable rapid and decisive efforts of supporting democracy and \npreservation of human rights.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The question is on \nthe motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that \nthe House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1150, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2406-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2406-H2409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1715\nREQUIRING COMPTROLLER GENERAL TO ASSESS OPTIONS FOR DISPOSITION OF PLUM \n         ISLAND ANIMAL DISEASE CENTER IN PLUM ISLAND, NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 1887) to amend certain appropriation Acts to repeal the \nrequirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell \nFederal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum \nIsland Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York, and for other \npurposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government has owned Plum Island, New York, \n     since 1899.\n       (2) Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center has \n     conducted unrivaled scientific research on a variety of \n     infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth \n     disease, resulting, most recently, in the development of a \n     new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly \n     debilitating disease of livestock.\n       (3) Over 62 years, the Center has had a strong, proven \n     record of safety.\n       (4) $23,200,000 in Federal dollars have been spent on \n     upgrades to, and the maintenance of, the Center since January \n     2012.\n       (5) In addition to the Center, Plum Island contains \n     cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of \n     regional and national significance.\n       (6) Plum Island is situated where the Long Island Sound and \n     Peconic Bay meet, both of which are estuaries that are part \n     of the National Estuary Program and are environmentally and \n     economically significant to the region.\n       (7) The Federal Government has invested hundreds of \n     millions of Federal dollars over the last two decades to make \n     long-term improvements with respect to the conservation and \n     management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay.\n\n[[Page H2407]]\n\n       (8) The Department of Homeland Security has undertaken a \n     study to consider alternatives for the final disposition of \n     Plum Island, including an analysis of--\n       (A) conservation of the island's resources;\n       (B) any remediation responsibilities;\n       (C) the need for any legislative changes;\n       (D) cost; and\n       (E) any revenues from the alternatives.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPORT REQUIRED ON STUDY BY DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND \n                   SECURITY ON CLEAN UP AND ALTERNATIVE USES OF \n                   PLUM ISLAND.\n\n       (a) Assessment by Comptroller General.--\n       (1) Assessment required.--The Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall conduct an assessment of the study by the \n     Department of Homeland Security on the options for the \n     disposition of Plum Island referred to in section 1(8). Such \n     assessment shall include a determination of whether the \n     methodologies used by the Department in conducting such study \n     adequately support the Department's findings with respect to \n     the following:\n       (A) The possible alternative uses for Plum Island, \n     including the transfer of ownership to another Federal \n     agency, a State or local government, a nonprofit \n     organization, or a combination thereof for the purpose of \n     education, research, or conservation.\n       (B) The possible issues and implications, if any, of \n     pursuing such alternative uses for Plum Island.\n       (C) The potential cost to be incurred for expenses related \n     to the transition, cleanup, and hazard mitigation of Plum \n     Island by a recipient of such property.\n       (2) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date on which the Department of Homeland Security completes \n     the study referred to in section 1(8), the Comptroller \n     General of the United States shall submit to Congress a \n     report containing the following:\n       (A) The results of the assessment described under paragraph \n     (1).\n       (B) A description of the Secretary of Homeland Security's \n     coordination with the Administrator of General Services, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency in conducting the Department \n     of Homeland Security study referred to in section 1(8).\n       (b) Study by Comptroller General.--\n       (1) Study required.--If the Comptroller General of the \n     United States determines that the methodologies referred to \n     in subsection (a)(1) do not adequately support the Department \n     of Homeland Security's findings related to an issue described \n     in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of such subsection, the \n     Comptroller General shall conduct a study on any such issue.\n       (2) Report required.--If the Comptroller General of the \n     United States conducts a study under paragraph (1), not later \n     than one year after the date on which the Department of \n     Homeland Security completes the study referred to in section \n     1(8), the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a \n     report containing the results of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF ACTION.\n\n       No action may be taken to carry out section 538 of title V \n     of division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 \n     (Public Law 112-74; 125 Stat. 976) until at least 180 days \n     after the reports required by subsection (a)(2) of section 2 \n     and, if applicable, subsection (b)(2) of such section have \n     been submitted to Congress.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, after my remarks, I will include an exchange of letters \nbetween the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the \nCommittee on Homeland Security regarding H.R. 1887.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1887, which suspends an \nappropriations provision in order to ensure that all necessary \ninformation is accessible before deciding how to move forward with Plum \nIsland Animal Disease Center.\n  Since 1954, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and \nTechnology Directorate's Plum Island Animal Disease Center has served \nthe Nation in defending against accidental or intentional introduction \nof foreign animal diseases. In 2005, DHS announced that Plum Island \nwould be moved to a new Federal facility in Kansas. While DHS will \neventually move the research conducted, Plum Island will continue to \noperate until the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility is fully \noperational and a complete transition has been made in 2022 or 2023.\n  The gentleman from New York, Representative Zeldin, my friend, \nintroduced H.R. 1887 with strong bipartisan support from the entire \nLong Island and Connecticut delegations in both the House and the \nSenate to stop the sale of Plum Island.\n  DHS recently undertook a study on alternatives for the disposition of \nPlum Island. As amended, H.R. 1887 suspends the sale of Plum Island \nuntil a thorough review of the analysis of alternatives is conducted by \nDHS and GAO. The bill before us today requires GAO to review the DHS \nstudy and report to Congress on whether the methodologies DHS uses \nadequately support the Department's findings. If those methodologies \nare found lacking, GAO must study possible alternative uses for Plum \nIsland and possible costs associated for the transition and cleanup of \nthe island.\n  H.R. 1887 delays the sale of Plum Island until GAO reports its \nfindings to Congress, allowing for a complete understanding of possible \noptions for Plum Island once the Animal Disease Center functions are \ntransitioned. This bill ensures consideration of all options for the \ndisposition of the island.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                    Washington, DC, May, 12, 2016.\n     Hon. Michael McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1887, a bill \n     to amend certain appropriation Acts to repeal the requirement \n     directing the Administrator of General Services to sell \n     federal property and assets that support the operations of \n     the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New \n     York.'' This legislation includes matters that fall within \n     the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure.\n       In order to expedite Floor consideration of H.R. 1887, the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo \n     action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our \n     mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill \n     does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the \n     appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional \n     claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or \n     similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X \n     jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members \n     of the Committee to any conference committee named to \n     consider such provisions.\n       Please place a copy of this letter and your response \n     acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the \n     Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the \n     bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on \n     Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative \n     process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2016.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 1887. I appreciate your support in bringing this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives, and \n     accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the \n     bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this \n     bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation \n     in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill \n     be necessary, I would support your request to have the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on \n     the conference committee.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. \n     I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n                         Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n1887 and yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New \nYork's Long Island Sound has served as the primary laboratory in the \nUnited States responsible for research on foreign animal diseases of \nlivestock, such\n\n[[Page H2408]]\n\nas foot-and-mouth disease and other animal diseases that could be \naccidentally or deliberately introduced into the United States.\n  At Plum Island, the Department of Homeland Security works with the \nAgricultural Research Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService within the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research and \ndevelop new vaccines and diagnostic tests to respond to animal disease \noutbreaks.\n  On September 11, 2005, DHS announced plans to develop the National \nBio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF, as a state-of-the-art \nbiocontainment laboratory to replace the Plum Island facility, an aging \nfacility nearing the end of its lifecycle. After undertaking a \nmultiyear site selection process, DHS selected a site in Manhattan, \nKansas, for the NBAF. It is slated to begin operations in 2022.\n  This brings us to H.R. 1887. The focus of this bill is to deal with \nthe question of what to do with Plum Island once DHS no longer needs \nit. DHS is currently studying the range of options for disposition of \nthe property, including transferring it to another Federal agency, a \nState or local government, or a nonprofit organization for the purposes \nof education, research, or conservation. In doing so, DHS is expected \nto assess the full implications of each option, including cost, \ncleanup, and hazard mitigation.\n  H.R. 1887 requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to \nassess whether DHS' forthcoming study is adequate to support its \nfindings. In the event that the study is lacking in a key area, GAO \nwould be required to conduct its own study on that issue or issues. \nImportantly, H.R. 1887 prohibits the sale of Plum Island operations \nuntil at least 180 days after the required reports in the bill have \nbeen submitted to Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Zeldin), my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nRatcliffe) and Mr. Thompson as well for both speaking in favor of this \nlegislation, H.R. 1887.\n  Plum Island is not for sale. The whole purpose of this legislation is \nto prevent the sale of Plum Island by the Federal Government to the \nhighest bidder.\n  Situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound, Plum Island is \ntreasured by my local community. As a critical resource for research, \napproximately 90 percent of the land on Plum Island has been sheltered \nfrom development, offering Long Island a diverse wildlife and ecosystem \nand a critical habitat for migratory birds, marine mammals, and rare \nplants.\n  With recorded history dating back to the 1700s, Plum Island is also \nan essential cultural and historical resource as well. Since World War \nII, Plum Island has been utilized as a research laboratory. The \nfacility, which has been under Federal jurisdiction since 1899, has \nsince grown to become what is known today as the Plum Island Animal \nDisease Center.\n  In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security, which currently has \njurisdiction over the island, announced that the Animal Disease Center \nresearch would be moved to a new Federal facility: the National Bio and \nAgro-Defense Facility in Kansas.\n  To offset the cost of the relocation, a law was enacted that called \nfor the private sale of Plum Island to the highest bidder. However, due \nto costs associated with the cleanup and closure of Plum Island and \nbecause of local zoning restrictions, the Federal Government would \nreceive little compensation for the sale of Plum Island. Allowing for \ncontinued research, public access, and permanent preservation of the \nisland, H.R. 1887 will reverse a 2008 law that mandated the sale of \nPlum Island.\n  The bill, as amended, will commission the Government Accountability \nOffice, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which \ncurrently owns the island, to formulate a comprehensive plan for the \nfuture of the island. This plan will include possible alternative uses, \nwhich can include transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, the \nState or local government, nonprofit, or combination thereof, for the \npurpose of education, research, and conservation.\n  Just less than 3 weeks ago, on April 28, 2016, H.R. 1887 was marked \nup with an amendment and passed out of the House Homeland Security \nCommittee with unanimous bipartisan support. Currently, 24 Republicans \nand Democrats in this Chamber have signed on as cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  I see the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) is here. He has \nlong been championing this issue since before I got here.\n  I would especially like to thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy \nand House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul for both \ntaking such a direct, personal interest in helping with this effort in \nthe House. Their leadership is very much appreciated.\n  I would also like to thank all the locally elected officials, groups, \nand concerned residents on Long Island and elsewhere who have moved \nheaven and Earth to raise awareness of this cause and help recruit \ncosponsors.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of this critical \nbill. Hopefully, the Senate also passes this long-awaited legislation \nin earnest so that the President can sign this proposal into law this \nyear.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit Plum Island. It is a place where \nyou feel as if you are thousands of miles away from Long Island. You \nhave the history of Fort Terry, the coastline, the dunes, the \nwaterways, the water hitting the rocks, and the seals. You literally \nfeel as if you are nowhere near the Northeastern United States. It is a \ntreasure, and it is one that should be protected.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for this Chamber's considering this \nlegislation and hopefully passing it unanimously.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, thank Mr. \nThompson of Mississippi for his interest and support in this measure, \neven though he hails from a part of the country which is far away from \nthe Long Island Sound. But, again, going back to his days on the \nAgriculture Committee, he clearly knows the forensics of this \nlegislation, and, again, his interest and support is much appreciated.\n  I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for bringing this \nbill up today.\n  Again, Long Island Sound, maybe, is not right on your radar screen, \nbut as Congressman Zeldin said, it is an incredibly special place, a \ntidal estuary which separates Connecticut from New York, and it is \nwithin the New York territory. Frankly, it is a very small, densely \npopulated area, and the interest level on both sides of the Long Island \nSound in terms of passage of this legislation is off the charts.\n  I again want to thank Mr. Zeldin for his efforts.\n  Again, this measure started in 2013 in response to the GAO report \nthat basically signaled that the sale of this island was on the fast \ntrack, and it really took persistence up until today's vote on the \nfloor to make sure that we stop that process, as Mr. Zeldin indicated, \nand send the message that Plum Island is not for sale.\n  Again, because of its unique history, the activity that took place \nthere with the Animal Disease Center made it unsuitable for residential \ndevelopment and commercial development, but sort of the outcome of that \nis that this incredibly rich diversity of biology has sprung up there.\n  Like the gentleman from Long Island, I have had the opportunity to \nvisit there, and it is as if you were in a different world. That is \nsomething that we can never take for granted, particularly in a part of \nthe country where, again, there are tremendous amounts of sea traffic, \nmaritime activity, and economic activity. To try and, again, basically \npreserve this 840-acre parcel with its incredible richness is something \nthat really will live on for generations and, really, I think, will \nmake the 114th Congress memorable, certainly in terms of that region, \nfor many years to come.\n  Again, like the gentleman from New York, I want to say that the \nexternal pressure which was brought to bear by municipal officials and \nby folks from\n\n[[Page H2409]]\n\nSave the Sound--that is an umbrella group on both sides of the Long \nIsland Sound--and the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, again, is \nwhat really kept the interest level and the pressure on both \ndelegations to make sure that this didn't get lost in the process and \nallow that mandated sale to move forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this bill, and, again, with \nthe gentleman from New York, am determined to make sure that this moves \nas quickly as possible through the Upper Chamber and is signed into law \nby President Obama, sending a message to all the individuals and groups \nthat are so interested in preserving Plum Island that, in fact, we, \nagain, have taken it off this sort of conveyor belt and we are going to \nmake sure that it gets the careful treatment that it deserves. At the \nend of the day, it is going to basically preserve this for generations \nto come.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1887 has broad bipartisan support. It will ensure \nthat, before DHS disposes of Plum Island, there is a thorough vetting \nof all the options.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to \nsupport Mr. Zeldin's bill, H.R. 1887.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1887, repeals \nthe requirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell \nFederal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum \nIsland Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York, and for other \npurposes.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security I support \nthis bill because the safety record of the Plum Island Animal Disease \nCenter is unparalleled.\n  The Plum Island Animal Disease Center is a United States federal \nresearch facility dedicated to the study of animal diseases. It is part \nof the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology.\n  Since 1954, the center has had the goal of protecting America's \nlivestock from animal diseases\n  Throughout the history of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, \nthere have been no accidental releases of infected animals to the \nmainland.\n  The Animal Disease Center on Plum Island has conducted first rate \nscientific research on a variety of infectious animal-borne diseases, \nincluding foot-and-mouth disease, resulting most recently, in the \ndevelopment of a new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this \nhighly debilitating disease of livestock\n  Mr. Speaker, in addition to the Animal Disease Center Plum Island \ncontains cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of \nregional and national significance.\n  Importantly, the Federal Government has invested hundreds of millions \nof tax payer dollars over the last two decades to make long-term \nimprovements with respect to the conservation and management needs of \nLong Island Sound and Peconic Bay.\n  Mr. Speaker, preserving historical and geographical entities play a \npivotal role in maintaining homeland security and the sustainability of \nour ecosystem and health of our community.\n  I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 1887.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1887, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to \nauthorize the Comptroller General of the United States to assess a \nstudy on the alternatives for the disposition of Plum Island Animal \nDisease Center, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2409-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2409-H2411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS CONSORTIUM ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 4743) to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nestablish a National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, and for \nother purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to\n\n[[Page H2410]]\n\nrevise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on \nthe bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4743. The National \nCybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016 allows the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security to work with a consortium, including \nthe National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, to support efforts \nto address cybersecurity risks and incidents.\n  This bill allows DHS to engage with a consortium to assist the \nNational Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, or NCCIC, \nin providing training to State and local first responders in preparing \nfor and responding to cybersecurity risks and incidents. An example of \na consortium DHS may work with under this bill is the National \nCybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, or NCPC.\n  The NCPC provides State and local communities with the tools they \nneed to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. \nThe consortium also evaluates communities' cybersecurity posture and \nprovides them with a roadmap to correct deficiencies in the security of \ntheir information systems.\n  Based out of the University of Texas at San Antonio's Center for \nInfrastructure Assurance and Security, the NCPC membership includes the \nUniversity of Arkansas, the University of Memphis, Norwich University, \nand Texas A Engineering Extension Service.\n  DHS is responsible for carrying out significant aspects of the \nFederal Government's cybersecurity mission. The Cybersecurity Act, \nwhich was recently signed into law, allows DHS to actively share cyber \nthreat indicators and defensive measures with the private sector by \naffording liability protections.\n  DHS's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center is \nresponsible for facilitating cross-sector coordination to address \ncybersecurity risks and incidents.\n  H.R. 4743 allows DHS to work with any consortium, including the NCPC, \nin a number of activities, including providing technical assistance, \nconducting cross-sector cybersecurity training and simulation \nexercises, and helping States and local communities to develop \ncybersecurity information sharing programs. Allowing DHS to work with \norganizations already supporting State and local cyber preparedness and \nresponse will provide additional support to State and local entities.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity \nPreparedness Consortium Act of 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4743 allows the Department of Homeland Security to \nutilize university-based consortia to help provide cybersecurity \ntraining and support to State, local, and tribal leaders, including \nfirst responders.\n  There is strong bipartisan support for this legislation, as \nintroduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).\n  H.R. 4743 authorizes DHS to use consortia to provide State and local \ngovernments with university-developed cyber training and technical \nassistance, including for the development of cyber information sharing \nthat jurisdictions in need can use.\n  Recent studies reveal that organizations at the State and local level \ndescribe their cybersecurity programs as being in the early and middle \nstages of maturity, and 86 percent of State and local respondents \nidentified managing cybersecurity risk as one of their most stressful \njobs.\n  By partnering with consortia, DHS can make a meaningful impact on \nraising the levels of cybersecurity on the State, local, and tribal \nlevels.\n  Importantly, H.R. 4743 requires DHS, when selecting a consortium for \nparticipation in its cyber efforts, to not only take into account the \nprior experience of the institutions that would be conducting \ncybersecurity training exercises, but also the geographic diversity of \nthe institutions participating in the consortium. The inclusion of \ngeographic diversity should help reach more States and localities.\n  Moreover, I am pleased that the bill requires DHS to do outreach to \ncolleges and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minority-serving \ninstitutions about opportunities to provide research-based \ncybersecurity-related training exercises and technical assistance.\n  Mr. Speaker, States and localities need the ability to prevent, \ndetect, respond to, and recover from cyber events as they would have \nany other disaster or emergency situation. For this reason, I support \nH.R. 4743 and urge passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hurd), my distinguished friend and colleague.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership on this issue and for yielding me some time.\n  I would like to also thank the ranking member and my colleague from \nSan Antonio on this piece of legislation that is so important to our \nhometown.\n  It is no secret that cyber attacks are on the rise, and the \nunfortunate reality is that everyone is vulnerable. The costs of \nprotecting your network and properly training communities on best \npractices in a digital world can be burdensome.\n\n  As we all know, State and local communities, in many instances, do \nnot possess the same digital resources as the Federal Government. \nStates and communities need the ability to detect, respond to, and \nrecover from cyber events just as they would any other disaster or \nemergency situation.\n  That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4743, \nwhich will allow DHS to coordinate with a handful of universities that \nhave been leading the way in cyber preparedness.\n  One of these universities, the University of Texas at San Antonio, is \nlocated in my hometown and serves many of my constituents. Another \nleader in this field is none other than my alma mater, Texas A \nUniversity.\n  Building upon their great work and the breakthroughs of others across \nthe country will be crucial to protecting our digital infrastructure at \nall levels. This will help us ensure that our first responders and \ngovernment entities are adequately prepared for a significant cyber \nevent.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas for his attention to this issue. I \nfully support H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness \nConsortium Act of 2016. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), the author of this bill.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thompson for \nyielding me this time and for his support of this legislation. He and \nhis staff have been terrific partners in moving this bill forward.\n  I would also like to thank my fellow Texans, Chairman McCaul, \nCongressman Hurd, Congressman Ratcliffe, and also Congressman Richmond, \nwho is not a Texan, but is a wonderful person here in our body, for all \nof their work on this issue.\n  Every day our Nation faces a growing number of potentially \ndebilitating cyber threats. Our retailers, our banks, government \nagencies, military operations, and everyday private American citizens \nall face these threats. We must ensure that our defenses are as strong \nas possible because of that.\n  I represent San Antonio, a national leader in the cybersecurity \nfield. Institutions in San Antonio do cutting-edge cyber work that \nkeeps our Nation safe.\n  For example, the University of Texas at San Antonio leads the \nNational Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, which helps communities \nacross the Nation improve their cyber defenses.\n  It is critical that localities understand the impact cyber attacks \ncould have on their ability to function and are prepared to prevent, \ndetect, respond to, and recover from harmful cyber incidents.\n  UTSA and its cybersecurity consortium are educating communities about \nthese cyber threats and helping them develop the defenses they need to \nsuccessfully withstand a cyber emergency.\n\n[[Page H2411]]\n\n  This legislation allows consortiums like UTSAs to work more closely \nwith DHS to address cybersecurity risks and incidents at the State and \nlocal level. This collaboration will bolster our cyber preparedness and \nkeep us one step ahead of cyber attackers.\n  Mr. Speaker, again I would like to thank the Homeland Security \nCommittee's leadership for their partnership on this legislation and \nalso all of the staff, both Republican and Democratic, who helped bring \nthis to the floor.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the inspiration for this bill was important work being \ndone by the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, a group of \nfive universities led by the University of Texas at San Antonio that \nhas helped to raise cyber preparedness at the State and local level by \nevaluating communities, cybersecurity postures, and providing them with \na roadmap to correct deficiencies.\n  While this consortium is making an important contribution to \ncybersecurity, there is an enormous need for training and technical \nassistance around the Nation. With the enactment of H.R. 4743, more \ninstitutions will be able to partner with DHS to provide such critical \nassistance.\n  As such, I urge passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 4743.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4743, the National \nCybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016.\n  This bill allows the Department of Homeland Security to work with a \ncybersecurity consortium to carry out training, technical assistance \nand simulation exercises for State and local officials, critical \ninfrastructure owners and operators and private industry.\n  The National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, based at the \nUniversity of Texas San Antonio's Center for Infrastructure Assurance \nand Security, provides research-based cybersecurity-related training \nand exercises to increase cybersecurity preparedness across the nation.\n  Other members of the Consortium include the Texas Engineering \nExtension Service in the Texas A University system, the University of \nMemphis, the University of Arkansas System, and Norwich University.\n  Last December, I helped usher through the landmark Cybersecurity Act \nof 2015. That legislation helps protect our nation's private sector and \nfederal networks which are under continuous threat from foreign hackers \nand cyber terrorists. H.R. 4743 will be a value add in better securing \nthe Nation's overall cybersecurity preparedness.\n  Locally, first responders and government officials as well as \ncritical infrastructure owners and operators and private industry are \nbombarded with cybersecurity threats in the same way as at the federal \nlevel.\n  Helping organizations working to incorporate cybersecurity risk and \nincident prevention and response into State and local emergency plans \nis just one of the elements this bill encourages.\n  Allowing DHS to work with organizations like the Consortium, will \nensure more tools are available back at home for those working to \nprepare for and combat cyber attacks on a regular basis.\n  I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4743, \nthe National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016, because \nit will establish an important resource to ensure that private sector \nentities are better prepared to protect against cyber threats.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am \nwell aware of the threats posed by cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and \nthis bill takes an essential step to strengthen domestic cybersecurity.\n  H.R. 4743 establishes a National Cybersecurity Preparedness \nConsortium to engage academic, nonprofit, private industry, and \nfederal, state, and local government partners to address cybersecurity \nrisks and incidents, including threats or acts of terrorism.\n  The Consortium may provide training to State and local first \nresponders and officials to equip them with the tools and skills needed \nto prepare for and respond to cybersecurity risks and incidents, \nincluding threats and acts of terrorism, in accordance with current \nlaw.\n  I thank both Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for the \nbipartisan work done to bring the bill before the House for \nConsideration.\n  I am pleased that during the Committee markup of H.R. 4743, two \nimportant Jackson Lee Amendments were adopted.\n  The first Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. 4743 establishes metrics as a \nmeasure of the effectiveness of the National Cybersecurity Preparedness \nConsortium program.\n  Having the information provided by my amendment to H.R. 4743, will \nallow the Congressional oversight committees to better plan future \nprograms around cybersecurity collaborations that are intended to share \nknowledge on best practices in securing computer networks from attack.\n  The second Jackson Lee Amendment added an additional objective of the \nbill, a directive that should help participants prepare to address \ncontinuity of operations.\n  This amendment provides a focus for the Consortium's work on the \nissue of continuity of operation, which addresses whether an entity can \nsurvive a cyber-attack, continue to provide information or services \nduring an attack; or the likelihood that the time to recovery from a \nsuccessful cyberattack or threat is predictable and reasonable.\n  Just as the attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001 came without \nnotice so may a major cyber-attack.\n  In March, of this year, U.S. Attorney General Lynch announced \n``wanted'' notices for a group of Iranian hackers the United States \nbelieves are behind a 2013 computer intrusion of a small New York dam \nand a series of cyberattacks on dozens of U.S. banks.\n  There are many companies offering continuity of operations services \nto companies large and small with the intent that they will be there to \nsupport their clients in the event of a cyber incident.\n  The work of the Consortium should go beyond planning to the answering \nquestions regarding the operationalization of plans in the event of an \nattack or cyber incident.\n  We know that planning is crucial, but we must encourage cybersecurity \nplanning to go beyond the planning process to understand the capacity \nof an entity's continuity of operations plans by looking at continuity \nof operations of service providers should an incident impact an area or \nindustry.\n  I support H.R. 4743, because it provides this assurance by providing \ncritical cybersecurity collaboration among experts and industries that \nare essential to critical infrastructure operations or have a \nsignificant economic presence in our nation's economy that a cyber-\nattack would have broad repercussions.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4743.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4743, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2411-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2411-H2413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY STRATEGY FOR INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS ACT\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4780, the Department of \nHomeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act, offered by \nthe ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from Mississippi \n(Mr. Thompson).\n  This bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit \na report to Congress on the Department of Homeland Security's \ninternational programs, including the vetting and screening of persons \nseeking to enter the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  The legislation builds off of recommendations made by the Committee \non Homeland Security's bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and \nForeign Fighter Travel that identified security gaps which allow \njihadists to get to and from Iraq and Syria undetected. Specifically, \nthe task force recommended that U.S. authorities continue to push the \nborder outward by deploying homeland security initiatives overseas.\n  The DHS has established several international programs that are \ndesigned to thoroughly vet and screen such individuals before their \ntravel to the United States. Through its many international programs, \nthe DHS personnel overseas effectively extends our Nation's borders to \nincrease the security of the United States. Expanding initiatives like \nthe U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Preclearance program or \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement's Visa Security Program could help \ndetect and interdict threats before they are bound for the homeland. \nFor example, the Preclearance program allows overseas-based CBP \nofficers to screen all passengers and luggage before a flight takes off \nfor the United States.\n  The CBP currently has 15 preclearance locations in six countries, \nincluding Ireland, Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, and the United \nArab Emirates. However, the foreign fighter threat and travel patterns \ncontinue to concern immigration and national security officials. As a \nresult, DHS has announced plans to expand preclearance operations.\n  Other programs, like ICE's Visa Security Program deploy specially \ntrained agents to diplomatic posts worldwide to conduct additional visa \nsecurity screening and quickly identify potential terrorists or \ncriminal threats before they reach the United States. Agents provide an \nadditional level of review for persons of special interest or concern, \nreview visa applications, liaise with host country immigration and \nborder security officials, and conduct investigations with a nexus to \nU.S. travel and security. The program has agents posted at consulates \nand embassies in more than 25 countries, with additional plans to \nexpand to additional high-risk locations.\n  As the Department of Homeland Security continues to build its \ninternational footprint for these and other border security programs, \nthe DHS must ensure that the expansion of international programs is \nconsidered with risk, cost, and benefit in mind. This bill would \nrequire the DHS to report on the specific risk-based goals for these \ninternational programs to ensure that they align with Department-wide \nand government-wide strategic priorities.\n  This additional transparency, including the costs related to \ninternational programs, will improve Congress' oversight of these \nactivities. Additionally, the Department will be required to consider \nhow the deployment of personnel abroad may impact its domestic \ncapabilities as well as to identify barriers for the expansion of \ninternational programs.\n  While international programs provide tangible national security and \ntravel facilitation benefits, the growing DHS presence overseas should \nbe built upon the foundation of a long-term strategy that guides the \nDepartment in the deployment of officers and agents in a risk-based \nmanner.\n  I am confident that the comprehensive strategy that is required by \nthis bill will help ensure that the Department is managing these \nprograms effectively and that Congress has the appropriate insight that \nis necessary to protect the American taxpayers' investment in our \nsecurity.\n  I, therefore, urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4780, the Department of Homeland Security \nStrategy for International Programs Act.\n  I introduced H.R. 4780 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security \nto develop a comprehensive strategy for the Department's international \nprograms where personnel and resources are deployed abroad for vetting \nand screening persons who are seeking to enter the U.S.\n  In recent years, the Department has expanded its international \nfootprint through programs such as the Immigration Advisory Program, \nthe Joint Security Program, and the Visa Security Program. In fact, \npresently, the Customs and Border Protection has, approximately, 800 \nemployees who are posted in 43 countries, and the Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement has almost 400 employees in 45 countries. DHS \npersonnel who are at overseas locations perform vital vetting and \npassenger prescreening activities to ensure individuals who are \ntraveling to the U.S. do not pose a threat to our Nation's security.\n  Looking ahead, the DHS has announced plans to expand the Preclearance \nprogram to 10 new locations in the coming years, and ICE continues to \nexpand its Visa Security Program to additional visa-issuing posts \nabroad.\n  I strongly support these efforts to push out our borders through the \nexpansion of these important homeland\n\n[[Page H2413]]\n\nsecurity programs. That said, to do it right, DHS needs a comprehensive \nstrategy to bolster its presence and partnerships around the world. My \nbill requires just that. Specifically, it requires the DHS to have a 3-\nyear strategy that includes risk-based goals, which is a process to \nensure resource allocations align with overall Departmental strategic \npriorities, and a common reporting framework for personnel who are \ndeployed abroad.\n  My bill requires the DHS to not only take into account where it \ncurrently deploys resources for these overseas screening and vetting \nprograms and the number of DHS personnel at each location, but also any \nimpacts of these overseas activities on domestic operations, including \nwith respect to staffing at U.S. ports of entry.\n  After 9/11, the attempted Christmas Day attack in 2009, as well as \nother more recent cases, it is imperative for the DHS and its Federal \npartners to bolster the screening and vetting of travelers before they \narrive at our borders. My bill will help ensure that the DHS has a \nsound strategy for its efforts to do so.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we face evolving terrorist threats, which include \nindividuals who are attempting to use legitimate forms of travel to the \nU.S. to inflict harm. The DHS personnel who are posted abroad perform \ncritical preemptive operations to make sure that travelers who are \ncoming to our country are thoroughly screened and vetted. H.R. 4780 \nwill help ensure that these important international DHS programs are \nutilized in a strategic and effective manner to further enhance the \nsecurity of the U.S.\n  Before I yield back, I would note that H.R. 4780 is a part of a \nlarger legislative package that I am introducing today. Among other \nthings, my package would authorize significant expansions of critical \nCBP and ICE overseas screening and vetting programs and significant new \nCBP staffing resources to support overseas program expansion and \naddress domestic staffing shortages at U.S. international airports.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4780.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 4780.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4780, the \n``Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs \nAct.''\n  This legislation directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to \nsubmit a comprehensive three-year strategy for international programs \nin which DHS personnel and resources are deployed abroad for vetting \nand screening persons seeking to enter the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security I support \nthis bill because the issue of proper vetting and screening processes' \nupon the entry into the country is paramount.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4780 directs the Security Committee of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to use the following strategies to \nimplement this legislation:\n  1. A risk-based method for determining whether to establish new \ninternational programs in new locations, given resource constraints, or \nexpand existing international programs;\n  2. Alignment with the highest DHS-wide and government-wide strategic \npriorities of resource allocations on such programs; and\n  3. A common reporting framework for the submission of reliable, \ncomparable cost data by DHS components on overseas expenditures \nattributable to such programs.\n  In developing this strategy the Department for health and human \nservices shall secure:\n  1. Information on existing operations of DHS programs that includes \ncorresponding information for each location in which each such program \noperates,\n  2. Analysis of the impact of each such international program on \ndomestic activities of DHS components,\n  3. The number of DHS personnel deployed to each location at which \nsuch an international program is in operation during the current and \npreceding fiscal year, and\n  4. Analysis of barriers to the expansion of such an international \nprogram.\n  There should be a proper vetting and screening process for \nindividuals entering the country from locations abroad.\n  Border security is an evolving process, and our legislative process \nmust evolve with it.\n  Avoiding recurrences of attacks on the homeland such as the 911 \nattack is a major reason entry into the country should be heavily \nmonitored.\n  I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4780.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4780, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2413-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2413-H2415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISORY BOARD ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from\n\n[[Page H2414]]\n\nNew York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Since the tragic events of 9/11, this body has endeavored to better \nintegrate intelligence and law enforcement agencies to react to new and \nevolving threats and to reduce duplicative efforts and waste. To a \nlarge extent, we have succeeded in producing a more integrated security \napparatus that properly reflects the terrorist threats of the 21st \ncentury. However, we must continue to make improvements to counter \nfast-changing threats like those posed by ISIS.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are seeing the greatest convergence of radical \nIslamic threats in history, with more than 40,000 jihadist fighters \ntraveling to the battlefield in Syria and Iraq.\n  Furthermore, the United States faces the highest threat level since \n9/11--with open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 States in \nthis great country of ours and with more than 80 ISIS-related arrests \nin the past 2 years, including one just up the road from my district on \nNew Year's Eve.\n  With the current threat environment in mind, I offer H.R. 4407, the \nCounterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016.\n  Initially established at the end of 2010, this panel brings together \nthe Department of Homeland Security's top counterterrorism \ndecisionmakers to respond to threats. However, I led a bipartisan task \nforce, which found that the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, \nhad neither been codified nor had its charter kept pace with today's \nevolving terrorist threats. That is why we need to pass this bill--to \nensure that the DHS is effectively integrating intelligence, \noperations, and policy to fight terrorism and that it is quickly \nexchanging threat information.\n  This legislation formally establishes the CTAB in law, and it makes \nit the Department's central coordination body for counterterrorism \nactivities. The bill also updates the Board's charter to better enable \nit to confront tomorrow's challenges today, and it requires the \nSecretary to appoint a Coordinator for Counterterrorism to oversee the \nBoard's activities. It is an important change to the current structure.\n  Additionally, the legislation requires the CTAB to advise the \nSecretary on the issuance of terrorism alerts, ensuring that top \ncounterterrorism and intelligence officials play a key role in \ndeveloping these critical notices to the public.\n  Finally, H.R. 4407 ensures continued congressional oversight by \nrequiring the DHS to report on the status and activities of the CTAB so \nthat we can be certain it is meeting its mandate.\n  I thank Chairman McCaul for appointing me to lead the bipartisan Task \nForce on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, which \nformulated, roughly, 50 recommendations for making our country safer, \none of which serves as the basis for this legislation.\n  I also thank Ranking Member Thompson and his great staff for all of \nthe work we have been doing to get a lot of these bills passed into \nlaw, and I very much appreciate our bipartisan work together.\n  I am proud to say we have now acted legislatively on more than half \nof the task force's findings, largely thanks to the hard work of the \nother members of the task force and their willingness to reach across \nthe aisle and do what is right for our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4407, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board \nAct of 2016.\n  H.R. 4407 authorizes, within the Department of Homeland Security, the \nCounterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, to coordinate and integrate \nDepartmental intelligence, activities, and policy related to \ncounterterrorism.\n  Since 2010, the internal body, which is comprised of top DHS \nofficials, has helped to harmonize counterterrorism programs and \nactivities across the DHS. H.R. 4407 directs the CTAB to meet on a \nregular basis to coordinate and integrate the Department's \ncounterterrorism efforts, and it sets forth the leadership and \ncomposition of the Board. H.R. 4407 also requires the DHS to report to \nCongress on the Board's status and activities.\n  This legislation is a product of the House Committee on Homeland \nSecurity's bipartisan Task Force on Terrorist and Foreign Fighter \nTravel, which learned that the CTAB, which has operated for 6 years, \nwas never authorized in law.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  To ensure that the board remains an integral part of counterterrorism \npolicy recommendations and responses across the Department, the task \nforce recommended that the board be codified in law. Codification of \nthe board is consistent with the task force's finding that information \nsharing is critical to preventing foreign fighter travel.\n  I believe that the CTAB should be a permanent fixture in the \nDepartment to help inform the counterterrorism decisionmaking of future \nDepartment Secretaries. As such, I support this legislation, which \ntackles an important task force recommendation and finding, and commend \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) for introducing it as well as \nmaking it here for the hearing of this bill today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance \nof my time.\n  Again, H.R. 4407 will authorize within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity the counterterrorism advisory board to coordinate and \nintegrate departmental intelligence activities and policies related to \ncounterterrorism. The board already plays a central and necessary role \nwithin DHS.\n  Enactment of H.R. 4407 will ensure that, no matter what happens in \nthe upcoming election or who is the head of the Department, the \ncounterterrorism advisory board will remain intact.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 4407.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I once again urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan \npiece of legislation. It is commonsense legislation, but it is very \nimportant to institutionalize things that are working to some extent \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security and the counterterrorism \nadvisory board. The tweaks that we have in this legislation are going \nto make it a good, firm setting for fighting the counterterrorism \nactivity going forward.\n  I do want to note for a moment as well that there have been an awful \nlot of bills that came out of Homeland Security this term, and the vast \nmajority of those bills have had bipartisan support. I am proud of the \nwork we are doing together with our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, and we are going to continue to do that moving forward to keep \nthis country safe.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4407, \nCounterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016, because it will establish \na board to coordinate and integrate DHS's intelligence, activities, and \nclarify policy related to its counterterrorism mission and functions.\n  As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security since its \nestablishment, and current Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee \non Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security this bill is of importance to \nme.\n  It was said of the George W. Bush Administration by the 9-11 \nCommission that it did not connect the dots that would have allowed the \nintelligence and law enforcement communities to detect and possibly \ndeter the September 11, 2001 attack against our nation.\n  We have learned a great deal over the nearly 15 years since Al Qaeda \nattacked our nation.\n  One of the more important lessons is the need to have coordination \nand unity of effort among and within intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies in our battle to defeat terrorists.\n\n[[Page H2415]]\n\n  H.R. 4407 establishes a board that will:\n  (1) advise the Secretary of DHS on the issuance of terrorism alerts, \nand meet on a regular basis to discuss intelligence; and\n  (2) coordinate ongoing threat mitigation efforts and departmental \nactivities.\n  The terrorism alert system initiated following September 2001, caused \nconfusion and uncertainty.\n  In November 2002, I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to \ncreate the Department of Homeland Security.\n  H.R. 4407 will develop a process for determining when alerts should \nbe issued, which will make it easier for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to develop messages that will guide public and interagency \nactions.\n  My work on the Homeland Security Committee has allowed me the \nprivilege of serving as Chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation \nSecurity, and the Ranking Member of the Border and Maritime Security \nSubcommittee.\n  The Homeland Security Committee has worked over the years since its \nfounding to ensure that this agency is prepared and staffed to meet the \nchallenges and demands of its mandate.\n  As we have worked to define and support the mission of the Department \nof Homeland Security we have worked to keep the efforts of the agency \nfocused not only on the threats we have faced, but also the new ones \nthat may come.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress not only to provide DHS with new \nguidelines, but also to provide the agency with the funding it needs to \ndo the work of protecting this great nation.\n  For several Congresses DHS has faced a government shutdown and \nsequestration that has depleted its resources and stranded its efforts \nto do all of the work members of this body demands.\n  Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in \n2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning \nfunding support from Congress.\n  As I urge my colleagues to support this bill, I also remind them that \nthe passage of new laws that require more of the agency should also \nmean that we should require more of ourselves as members of Congress.\n  We should support the work of the men and women of DHS as they stand \non the front line of our nation's domestic security by making sure that \nthey have the tools and the skills needed to do the job we require.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4407.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4407, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2415-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity is currently in Cuba participating in bilateral meetings on \nlaw enforcement cooperation with the Castro regime. This will serve as \nanother propaganda coup for the Castro brothers.\n  In the past, the Obama administration and Cuba have held technical \nexchanges on counternarcotics. Yet, last month, Panamanian authorities \nintercepted over 400 kilos of cocaine in a shipment from--guess where--\nCuba en route to Belgium.\n  This is not the first time that the Castro brothers tried to ship \nillicit materials. In 2013, Mr. Speaker, approximately 240 tons of \nillegal weapons were intercepted by Panamanians on a ship going from \nCuba to North Korea. In fact, this shipment was the largest weapons \ncache ever intercepted going to North Korea in violation of several \nU.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  So how does this happen, Mr. Speaker? Let's not forget that Cuba's \nmilitary owns and operates Cuba's port facilities.\n\n[[Page H2417]]\n\n  So how does cocaine, how do shipments, and how do guns get onto these \nships? I doubt that our deputy secretary will inquire about the \ncomplicity of the Castro regime in these illicit shipments when he \nmeets with his Cuban counterparts. So shame on us, Mr. Speaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2417-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING THE CARDENAS' 24TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, today is a day that is a very emotional \nday for my family and me.\n  Many years ago, there was a beautiful young woman who grew up in \nPacoima. She was the daughter of immigrants, and I was lucky enough to \nmeet her and lucky enough for her to accept a date. Some years later, \nwe got married, 24 years ago today, and I just wanted to take an \nopportunity to thank her for having a moment of lapse and accepting \nthat date and eventually for us getting married. We have four beautiful \nchildren that we have raised.\n  I don't take it for granted, ladies and gentlemen, that as her \nparents are from Mexico and my parents are from Mexico, from another \ncountry, we now have been able to provide a better life for our \nchildren that previous generations could not.\n  So I stand before you as a proud American and a very happy man to \nknow that I am married to a wonderful woman, born Norma Sanchez and now \nis Norma Cardenas. She is the mother of our children and someone that I \nmiss very much.\n  So to you, Norma, I am sorry I couldn't be home. I am thousands of \nmiles away. But thank you for understanding.

Mr. Speaker, it is National Law Enforcement Week and a \ntime to honor the men and women in blue that risk their health and \nsafety daily to keep our communities safe.\n  The shooting of two officers just this last week in New Hampshire \nshows us that the danger that law enforcement faces is all too real. \nWhenever I participate in a police ride-along, I am constantly \nimpressed by the professionalism and the commitment to duty from our \npolice officers.\n  It is important that we recognize their efforts and make sure they \nhave the resources to do their jobs effectively. I was pleased that \nlast week we reauthorized the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram to help local law enforcement agencies obtain potentially \nlifesaving equipment for their officers.\n  In addition, we passed my bill to provide law enforcement with more \ntools to find abducted and missing children.\n  Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Thin Blue Line and the \nmen and women of law enforcement for all that they do to keep us safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2417-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST HOMOPHOBIA AND TRANSPHOBIA\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the International Day \nAgainst Homophobia and Transphobia. Every year on May 17, LGBT \nindividuals and their allies use this day to bring awareness to LGBT \ndiscrimination.\n  Since 2004, this day has expanded to every corner of the world. It is \ncelebrated in more than 130 countries, including 37 countries where \nhomosexuality is illegal, where courageous individuals and \norganizations are standing up for basic human rights.\n  Sadly, homophobia, transphobia, and LGBT discrimination still exist \naround the world. Despite last year's victory for marriage equality, \nmany still want to turn the clock back on equality. North Carolina, \nMississippi, and Tennessee's recent anti-LGBT laws cast light on this \ndiscrimination. Sadly, these hateful bills are nothing more than State-\nsanctioned hate.\n  I am proud to have introduced H. Res. 263, supporting the goals and \nideals of the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. I \nwould like to thank the 70 cosponsors and encourage all of my \ncolleagues to sign on as cosponsors.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me tomorrow and every day \nin speaking out against LGBT hatred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2417-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING MARYANN VOLDERS ON BEING NAMED ADMINISTRATOR OF THE YEAR\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as co-chairman of the \nCongressional Career and Technical Education Caucus, it is my pleasure \nto recognize the efforts of MaryAnn Volders, who was recently named \nAdministrator of the Year by the Pennsylvania Association of Career and \nTechnical Education.\n  MaryAnn is the vice president of secondary education at the Central \nPennsylvania Institute of Science and Technology, or CPI, located in \nCentre County, in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District. She has \nbeen with CPI for the past 9 years, having previously worked with the \nTyrone Area School District.\n  This award is a true sign of Volders' work in helping prepare \nstudents for careers in growing technical fields not only across \nPennsylvania, but also across the United States. On a day-to-day basis, \nMaryAnn's work can include everything from working on a grant to \nassisting students and teachers--working to create the best possible \neducational environment at CPI.\n  Her nomination included five letters of support, including one from a \nstudent. MaryAnn says a student greeted her with congratulatory roses \nafter she received word that she had won this award and recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2417-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the brave men and women \nwho protect New Hampshire.\n  Last week in Manchester, our State's largest city, a robbery suspect \nshot and wounded two police officers. Thankfully, Manchester Police \nDepartment caught the suspect. Officers Ryan Hardy and Matthew O'Connor \nare healing.\n  Other police officers who risk their lives every day haven't been as \nlucky. Merrimack native, Ashley Guindon, an officer in Virginia, died \nin the line of duty earlier this year, a day after being sworn in. \nAshley's name will join those on the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial in Washington, D.C.\n  During National Police Week, officers from around the country are \nhere to pay their respects. Today, I had the pleasure of meeting \nHooksett Police Chief Peter Bartlett and Jordan Wells of the Portsmouth \nPD.\n  My friends are on the front lines of New Hampshire's heroin epidemic. \nMy bill to increase their access to lifesaving antioverdose medication \npassed the House, and I am a proud partner in a number of efforts to \nmake their jobs easier and safer.\n  A police officer's job will always be dangerous.

It is important to \nmake sure that equipment works, and it is more important to make sure \nthat we have the right kind of staffing. We are almost 3,000 to 4,000 \nshort of the number of TSOs that we need.\n  It is also important that we recognize that a professional Federal \nstaff is very important, similar to the many other law enforcement \nagencies that we have. Privatization is not the answer, but efficiency, \nexpediency, good equipment, and training is. I believe we are moving \nforward to make sure that we have that kind of trained force to secure \nthe American people and secure the Nation's airports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2418-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMEMORATING SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month we \ncelebrated Small Business Week, a time when we especially recognize the \nunique contributions small businesses make providing opportunities for \ncitizens.\n  South Carolina feels the positive impact of small-business owners. \nThese individuals represent 97 percent of all employers in our State. I \nam grateful to represent these entrepreneurs who are dedicated to \ncreating jobs that will help citizens around them have meaningful and \nfulfilling lives.\n  I appreciate visiting with members of the South Carolina small-\nbusiness community. I was grateful to tour Dayton Rogers, a plant in \nColumbia, South Carolina, led by President Ron Lowry, where I was \ninspired by the enthusiastic personnel.\n  I participated in a roundtable discussion with the National \nFederation of Independent Business, NFIB, led by Ben Homeyer about the \noverreach of government. These meetings made it clear that small \nbusinesses are not being supported by this administration because of \nthe burdensome tax regulations.\n  I look forward to working with my fellow House Republicans as we \nsupport reforms to reduce regulations and create jobs and \nopportunities.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2418-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING REBUILDING TOGETHER WAYCROSS\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nRebuilding Together Waycross and all the hard work of its volunteers.\n  The Rebuilding Together organization rebuilds family homes for \nveterans, people with disability, and low-income families, with the \ngoal of a safe and healthy home for each person in the community.\n  The nonprofit organization was founded in 1973 in Midland, Texas, by \na small group of people who noticed the need to refurbish homes in \ntheir community. In the beginning, the group worked on those homes once \na year each April, but by 1988, Rebuilding Together gained national \nrecognition.\n  Rebuilding Together now has over 100,000 volunteers who complete \n10,000 projects each year and has spread to rebuilding homes in \nWaycross, Georgia.

Mr. Speaker, Americans are skeptical about the \nnews they receive on climate change.

Americans are split as to the cause of \nany climate change. However, the liberal national media only portrays \none side of the story.\n  Over the last month, every New York Times and Washington Post article \non this topic attributed warmer temperatures solely to human activity. \nNot one mentioned that natural changes could partially be the cause.\n  What is amazing is that, with all the media bias blaming humans for \nclimate change, half of all Americans still remain skeptical. Americans \ndeserve all the facts about climate change, not just the one side the \nliberal national media are trying to promote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2418-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                    CELEBRATING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX.

In 2016, 252 fallen law enforcement heroes were \nadded to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.

Mr. Speaker, tonight I introduced H. Res. 731 expressing \nCongress' opposition to laws requiring that microstamping technology be \nincluded in handguns.\n  Time and time again, studies have shown that microstamping technology \nhas failed to achieve any reliable effectiveness.\n  A study by the University of California, Davis--certainly no hotbed \nof support for the Second Amendment--recommended against imposing \nmicrostamping requirements, and the creator of the technology \nparticipated in a study which determined it did not work reliably.\n  Mr. Speaker, the only real impact of microstamping is to increase \ncosts and make it more difficult for Americans to exercise their Second \nAmendment rights. Unfortunately, that is the true intent of these laws, \nnot to increase safety, but to simply make it more difficult for law-\nabiding citizens to own firearms.\n  Even the Ninth Circuit Court agreed--the most overturned court in the \ncountry--just today that laws intended solely to prevent Americans from \nexercising their rights are unconstitutional.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to reject these laws and join me in \nstanding up for the Second Amendment and join on to H.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members\n\n[[Page H2419]]\n\nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add \nany extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of my Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening as co-anchor along with \nmy classmate and scholar, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, from the Eighth \nDistrict of New York, for tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special \nOrder hour, Equal Justice Under the Law: Criminal Justice Reform and \nChallenging the School-to-Prison Pipeline.\n  Congressman Jeffries leads by example. He is a member of the Criminal \nJustice Task Force, and he has a long personal and professional history \nof being a Brother's Keeper.\n  This evening the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor \nto discuss the current state of America's criminal justice system and \nthe necessary reform, reform that will allow us to invest in our \ncommunities and expand opportunities for all Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is an epidemic that is \nplaguing schools across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, the need and appetite \nto reform our Federal criminal justice system has been building for \nyears, and now it is clear that there is consensus that the time is now \nto take meaningful action.\n  The school-to-prison pipeline refers to the policies and practices \nthat pushes our Nation's children, especially our most at-risk \nchildren, out of the classroom and into the juvenile and criminal \njustice system. Far too often, students are expended, expelled, or even \narrested for minor offenses that lead to visits to the principal's \noffice a thing of the past.\n  Statistics reflect that these policies disproportionately target \nstudents of color and those with a history of abuse, neglect, poverty, \nor learning disabilities. Those who are unnecessarily forced out of \nschool become stigmatized and fall behind in their studies, Mr. \nSpeaker. Many eventually decide to drop out of school altogether, and \nmany others commit crimes in their community.\n\n  Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder discussed the issue in a \nspeech to the American Bar Association in 2013, stating that rigid \ndiscipline policies transformed too many educational institutions from \nthe doorway of opportunity into the gateway to the criminal justice \nsystem and that a minor school disciplinary offense should put a \nstudent in the principal's office, not in the police precinct.\n  According to recent data by the Department of Education, African \nAmerican students are arrested far more than their White classmates. \nBlack and Hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those \ninvolved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. \nCurrently, African Americans make up two-fifths of combined youth \ntoday, Mr. Speaker.\n  In my home State of Ohio, the impact of suspensions and expulsions on \ncommunities is striking. In Ohio, a history of prior suspensions from \nschool is the number one factor that leads children to dropping out of \nschool. Children who do not finish high school, as we all are aware, \nare more likely to end up incarcerated or in our juvenile or criminal \njustice system and are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested.\n  Approximately 82 percent of the adult population is composed of high \nschool dropouts. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is a pipeline that \nreflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. But, Mr. \nSpeaker, I come today as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus \nbecause I believe we can disrupt the pipeline.\n  To do this, we need to be honest about the opportunity gaps that \nexist across our country and in our schools because you cannot talk \nabout the school-to-prison pipeline without discussing what needs to be \nprovided as economic opportunities.\n  We need better educational chances for our young people. We need more \nsupport to our families so that they can do the best job that they can \nor that they are capable of doing to help support their own children. \nWe must confront prejudices in our Nation head-on.\n  That is why initiatives like the White House's My Brother's Keeper is \nso important. My Brother's Keeper Task Force is a coordinated Federal \neffort to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young \nmen of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full \npotential.\n  Mr. Speaker, lastly, this past weekend I met with the dynamic men of \nthe Columbus chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, in my \ndistrict and saw My Brother's Keeper work firsthand.\n  I learned of their many forms of being role models, as being \ncommunity mentors for at-risk students, particularly young males, who \nare in need of inspiration and counsel regarding their choice of a \nlife's career.\n  The mentoring men of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, are \nmen who are doctors, lawyers, government officials, teachers, and \nentrepreneurs, just to name a few.\n  Mr. Speaker, these men are role models for the community. They bought \na house in my district, and they use that home as an anchor to provide \nopportunities and leadership development, professional networking, and \npositive reinforcement.\n  Tonight it is important for me to put a face on what we need to do as \none small example to stop the school-to-prison pipeline. I salute \nPhilip Shotwell, Polemarch; Richard Crockett, 1st Vice Polemarch; \nAttorney Byron Potts; Dr. Gus Parker; and Board of Directors Nathaniel \nJordan for being men who understand, if we are going to stop the \nschool-to-prison pipeline, we need to look at our own districts.\n  A young man asked them why he should stay in school, and they \nreplied: Young man, you are your own future. We are relying on you to \nbe a law-abiding citizen, educated, self-sufficient, and a good citizen \nbecause we don't want you to be a statistic in the school-to-prison \npipeline.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight you will hear many stories, you will hear facts, \nand you will hear about legislation.\n  Let me end by saying that I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Safe, \nAccountable, Fair, Effective (SAFE) Justice Reinvestment Act of 2015, \nH.R. 2944, a bill that recognizes the importance of mentoring and \nreducing recidivism and helps offenders think through the decisions \nthat confront them when they leave prison.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nButterfield), our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a person \nwho has a long background in being an advocate and a fighter for those \nwho are in our communities and faced with many of the things that you \nare going to hear tonight.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Beatty for \nyielding, thank her for her friendship, and thank her for all that she \ndoes not just for the Congressional Black Caucus, but for all that she \ndoes for the constituents that she represents back in Ohio and for what \nshe does for all people in America.\n\n  Let me also thank Congressman Jeffries for his great work and his \nwillingness to participate in these Special Order hours. I know that \nthe evening is late sometimes, but the two of them come to the floor \nand work very hard.\n  I want to spend my few minutes, if I may, Mr. Speaker, talking about \njust an overview of the criminal justice system. There is no question \nthat the criminal justice system is broken. All of us I think can agree \non that. Those on the left and those on the right, all of us even, for \ndifferent reasons, perhaps, come to one conclusion, that the criminal \njustice system is in need of serious, serious reform.\n  I know that we are debating legislation here in the House regarding \nreforming the criminal justice system. Our colleagues over in the \nSenate are doing the same. But it is time for action. It is time for \naction on criminal justice reform in the 114th Congress.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I spent 30 years, 30 long years, in a \ncourtroom, half of those as a lawyer, the other half as a judge. Most \nof the 15 years as a judge I was a trial judge, which meant that I was \non the front line in our criminal justice system and I saw it \nfirsthand. I can tell you without question that the criminal justice \nsystem in America is in need of serious reform from the top to the \nbottom.\n\n[[Page H2420]]\n\n  We have all heard the statistics, and I am going to repeat them again \ntonight: 2.2 million Americans are in prison. Of that number, that \nnumber is disproportionately African American. That is 25 percent of \nthe world's prison population right here in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Just think about that, Mr. Speaker. We are 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, but 25 percent of those who are incarcerated are \nincarcerated in the United States of America. We have a serious problem \nof mass incarceration that must be reduced.\n  But the point that I want to put in the Record tonight is that, of \nthose who are incarcerated in this country, 90 percent of those are \nincarcerated at the State level and 10 percent incarcerated at the \nFederal level--90 percent incarcerated at the State level.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  When we discuss criminal justice reform--and Congressman Bobby Scott \nis going to be speaking in a few minutes, and he talks about this all \nof the time, as well as Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee--we must not \nonly talk about reform at the Federal level, but we must find ways to \nrequire States to reform their criminal justice systems at the local \nlevel. We should encourage States to take a serious look at their \nsystems and to seek ways to reduce mass incarceration at the State \nlevel without posing any harm to the communities. Too many of those who \nare incarcerated at the State level are in prison for drug-related \noffenses and crimes that don't endanger the community whatsoever.\n  We should encourage States to enact expungement laws. We get \ntelephone calls all the time--and I am sure my colleagues get the same \ncalls as well--from those who are seeking ways to expunge their records \nso that young men and women who have served in the criminal justice \nsystem can get some of those offenses removed from their records, \nparticularly those offenses that deal with petty crimes and \nmisdemeanors and drug-related offenses, because when you have these \noffenses on your criminal record, it prevents young people from getting \nthe gainful employment that they so richly deserve.\n  We also need to encourage States to look at ways to remove criminal \ncharges from criminal records that did not result in convictions. I \nthink most of my colleagues can relate to that. We know that, so often, \npolice officers at the local level will charge a young offender with \nmultiple offenses at the time of arrest, and some of the offenses are \nnot even deserving of a charge. Sometimes police have a tendency to \novercharge at the time of arrest. Then when the case finally goes to \ncourt, those 10 or 12 charges are reduced down to one charge or two \ncharges; the defendant pleads guilty; and the case is disposed of while \nthe other 8 or 10 charges that are dismissed continue to be on the \nyoung person's criminal record for a lifetime. So often, just the fact \nthat the individual has been charged with a crime prevents that young \nperson from getting a job. So often, it makes a difference.\n  Finally, I thank Mrs. Beatty for talking about using the court system \nto punish students. That happens. It happens in every State in America. \nOur public school systems cannot, and should not, use the court system \nas a means of punishment for students who have behavioral problems in \nschool.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for all of their work. I thank them for \ntheir efforts. I thank them for their tremendous interest in this \nsubject because it is real. We know it. We need criminal justice \nreform, and we need it now.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Butterfield.\n  We certainly agree with you that the criminal justice system is \nbroken. That is why the Congressional Black Caucus is here tonight--to \nmake sure that we are prepared to outline the steps and the legislation \nthat is going to be in the forefront. I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership in making this a top priority for the Congressional Black \nCaucus.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the \ngentleman from the Third Congressional District of Virginia. He is a \ntrue scholar, an attorney, and someone who is a leader on tonight's \ntopic. He is someone who has worked tirelessly to make sure that we do \nmore than just come and stand and talk about this issue tonight. He \ncomes to talk about real reform, to talk about making a difference in \nour broken criminal justice system. He is my friend, Congressman Bobby \nScott.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from New York and certainly the \ngentlewoman from Ohio for organizing this Special Order to discuss the \nneed for criminal justice reform.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have serious, fundamental problems with our criminal \njustice system today. For too long, policymakers have chosen to play \npolitics with crime policy by enacting so-called tough on crime slogans \nand sound bites, such as three strikes and you are out, mandatory \nminimum sentences, and--if you get it to rhyme, apparently, it is \nbetter--if you do the adult crime, you do the adult time. As appealing \nas these policies sound, their impacts range from a negligible \nreduction in crime to actually increasing the crime rate.\n  As a result of these policies, the United States, despite \nrepresenting only 5 percent of the world's population, has 25 percent \nof the world's prisoners and now has the highest incarceration rate of \nany nation's, by far, in the world. There are 2.2 million people behind \nbars in this country. That is triple the number of prisoners we had \njust three decades ago. At over 700 persons incarcerated for every \n100,000 in the population, the United States far exceeds the world's \naverage incarceration rate of about 100 per 100,000.\n  Recent studies have questioned the sanity of this mass incarceration. \nFor example, the Pew Research Center on States estimates that after \nabout 350 per 100,000, any crime reduction value begins to diminish, \nand at over 500 per 100,000, incarceration becomes, actually, \ncounterproductive. As I said, our rate is now at 700 per 100,000.\n  These counterproductive effects are created because today there are \ntoo many children who are being raised by a parent who is in prison and \nby too many people with felony records who are unable to find jobs. The \nimpact of our tax dollars is also distressing. The Bureau of Prisons is \nconsuming too much of the Department of Justice's budget, meaning that \nthe Department has fewer and fewer resources for other programs that \ncan actually reduce crime and enhance public safety. The tough on crime \napproach falls the hardest on minorities. While the incarceration rate \noverall in the United States is approximately 700 per 100,000, for \nBlacks, the incarceration rate is over 2,200 per 100,000; and in some \njurisdictions, they lock up Blacks at the rate of 4,000 per 100,000--a \nrate 40 times the international average.\n  The war on drugs has exacerbated this problem. Over 2,000 Federal \nprisoners are now serving life without parole for nonviolent drug \ncrimes, and many more are serving unduly harsh sentences for nonviolent \noffenses. The racial disparities are staggering. Despite the fact that \nWhites engage in drug offenses at a rate equal to or often higher than \nthat of African Americans, African Americans are incarcerated on drug \ncharges at a rate 10 times greater than that of Whites.\n\n  We all agree that there is a problem with mass incarceration. So what \nis the best way to solve it?\n  When reviewing any legislative package called criminal justice \nreform, I think there are some key principles that we have to address.\n  First, reform must meaningfully address the problem of mass \nincarceration by significantly reducing admissions to prison and \nshortening a prisoner's length of stay.\n  Second, any reform must address the primary driver of the ballooning \nFederal prison populations, and that is mandatory minimum penalties, \nespecially those for drug and firearm offenses.\n  Third, we must address the disparate impact on race in the Federal \ncriminal justice system that has resulted from the application of many \nneutrally worded policies and laws.\n  Fourth, reform must address mental health and addiction issues as a \npublic health issue and require intervention and treatment plans to \nresolve underlying issues that led those to be involved in the criminal \njustice system rather than implement so-called tough on crime, lock 'em \nup approaches. Everybody knows that the war on drugs\n\n[[Page H2421]]\n\nhas failed. We need to address drug abuse more as a public health issue \nand less as a criminal justice issue.\n  Fifth, we must provide comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation \nservices and incentives for completing those programs that are found to \nactually work, with a particular focus on those with the greatest need.\n  Finally, any legislation must be based on research and evidence, not \non poll-tested slogans and sound bites or political negotiations, which \nare unrelated to research and evidence.\n  How do the current proposals stack up?\n  First, we look at the current bills that have been reported out of \nthe House and Senate Judiciary Committees and notice that they fail to \nembody any of the principles. In fact, they often take the opposite \napproach.\n  While these bills reduce the number of admissions and/or length of \nstay in some limited cases, they also create new mandatory minimums, \neven new mandatory minimums or mandatory consecutive enhancements. They \nenhance existing mandatory minimums to apply to people who would not \nget them under the present law, and they irrationally limit who can \nbenefit from prospective and retroactive relief provisions. It is \nunknown whether there will be an overall increase or decrease in prison \nimpact at the 10-year point after implementation, if these bills pass, \ncompared to doing nothing. The United States Sentencing Commission has \nbeen unable to quantify the impact of the expansions or the limitations \non relief. So the fact that we do not have the numbers means that we \ncannot determine whether these bills will have any meaningful effect on \nmass incarceration.\n  Though the bills do shorten two supersized mandatory minimums, they \ndo not eliminate any mandatory minimum. The Senate bill actually \ncreates two new ones, and both bills create new mandatory consecutive \nsentencing enhancements, which must be served after any other sentence. \nBoth bills expand mandatory minimums for drug and gun offenses by \napplying them to people who would not be eligible to receive them \ntoday.\n  If the problem we are trying to address is mass incarceration, why \nare those in the bill to begin with?\n  Neither of the bills will do anything to address the disparate racial \nimpact that pervades our criminal justice system. Federal mandatory \nminimums, in particular those for drug and firearm offenses, have been \nstudied and have been found to have a racially disparate impact. These \nbills do nothing to eliminate mandatory minimums. Even though they \nreduce some, they create new ones, expand others, and create new \nsentencing enhancements. So the bills may actually make racial \ndisparities in sentencing even worse than they are under present law.\n  Finally, both bills put limits on who can receive prospective and \nretroactive relief. If you look at the limitations, you will find that \nthey have a racially disparate impact on minorities.\n  On the issue of the war on drugs, both bills also fail to treat drug \nabuse and addiction as a public health problem. In fact, the strategy \nused in the bills to address heroin addiction is not a public health \napproach, for the bills impose mandatory additional prison time. This \nis not a public health, research-based approach.\n  On the comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services to reduce \nrecidivism, these bills have turned science and empirical evidence \nupside down. They give the greatest incentives for completing the \nprograms to those with the lowest need while categorically barring \noffenders with the highest risk from benefiting from the rehabilitation \nprograms. This approach not only violates research, but it will \nexacerbate the current racial disparities in the criminal justice \nsystem.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, there is ample research available to show what credible \ncriminal justice reform ought to look like. For example, Texas--one of \nthe Nation's most conservative States--recently passed criminal justice \nreform legislation that was based on research and evidence, and the \nresult was a significant reduction in crime, a significant reduction in \nincarceration, and a savings of billions of dollars.\n  The SAFE Justice Act--the Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective \nJustice Act--which I cosponsored with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nSensenbrenner), which the gentlewoman from Ohio pointed out that she is \nsupporting, was based on the Texas model and includes evidence-based \nprevention and early intervention programs; reducing incarceration even \nat the State level as well as at the Federal level; comprehensive \npolice training and funding for body cameras, drug and veterans' \ncourts; a significant reduction in the use of mandatory minimum \nsentences; and rehabilitation for all of those in prison and second-\nchance programs for those who have been released. It has broad, \nbipartisan support. All of the provisions in the bill are fully paid \nfor by reallocating the reduction in mandatory minimums, and it shows \nthat we do not have to accept a bill that fails to conform to evidence \nand research.\n  Mr. Speaker, criminal justice reform legislation ought to be \nconsistent with the research and evidence that is readily available. \nFrom what I can tell, the bills reported out of the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees have nothing based in research and evidence and, \nsadly, seem more concerned about the politics of criminal justice \nreform, with little regard to actually wanting to end our Nation's \naddiction to mass incarceration.\n  The SAFE Justice Act is a better evidence-based approach, which will, \nif enacted, reduce crime, save money, and reduce racial disparities \nthat pervade our criminal justice system.\n  I appreciate the gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentleman from New \nYork for hosting tonight's Special Order.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for clearly \narticulating to us why we cannot let our criminal justice system remain \non this trajectory.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the Congresswoman from the 13th District \nof California. My colleague and my friend is someone who travels the \nworld advocating for those who live in poverty, advocating for those \nwho are incarcerated in this broken criminal justice system that we are \nfocusing on tonight.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I first thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for \nthose very kind and humbling remarks. I want to thank her for her \ntremendous leadership and for continuing to come down here each and \nevery week to ensure that her voice, the Congressional Black Caucus' \nvoice, and Congressman Jeffries' voice are really put forth so that the \npeople of our country will understand the critical issues before us and \nthe fact that the Congressional Black Caucus is really leading on each \nand every issue. Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries really \nhave done a phenomenal job. They both have gone way beyond the call of \nduty, and so we thank them so much for their efforts.\n  Make no mistake--and I think we are hearing this over and over again \ntonight--mass incarceration is a crisis in our country. The United \nStates of America imprisons far more people than any other nation in \nthe world.\n  When African Americans are incarcerated at six times the rate of \nWhites, it is no surprise to me. It is no surprise that African \nAmericans constitute nearly half of the total 2.3 million incarcerated \nAmericans in 2008. Together, African Americans and Latinos comprise 58 \npercent of all prisoners in 2008, even though African Americans and \nLatinos make up approximately one-quarter of the United States \npopulation.\n  While our prison population grows unchecked and is growing unchecked, \nwe continue to criminalize our students rather than invest in their \neducation. Right now we spend $10,500 a year to educate a child, but we \nspend $88,000 a year to keep a child locked up. That is unacceptable. \nLet me repeat that. It costs eight times more money to keep a child in \njail than to educate them and prepare them for a good future.\n  We are not just talking about a few children here. Our country \nincarcerates five times more children than any other nation in the \nworld. Sadly, two-thirds of these kids will never return to school. \nWhen we lock up these children, we are essentially throwing away\n\n[[Page H2422]]\n\nthe key. Instead of preparing them for a future, we are just getting \nthem ready for a life in a cell.\n  Now, let me be clear, from the moment many of these children are \nborn, they are funneled into the prison pipeline. Simply put, the \nsystem is really stacked against them. For instance, one in three \nAfrican American children lives in poverty today, while one in four \nHispanic children lives in poverty.\n  Mr. Speaker, while Black children represent just 18 percent of \npreschool enrollment, they account for nearly half of all preschool \nsuspensions. Now, Congresswoman Beatty, we are talking toddlers ages 2 \nto 5. These kids don't even get a start, let alone a head start. They \nare being suspended from school.\n  How do you suspend toddlers and babies from school?\n  Something is wrong with this. So we, I must say, in the \nAppropriations Committee are trying to address this with the Department \nof Education. This is immoral.\n  When they get older, African American students are four times more \nlikely to be expelled from school than their White peers for the same \noffense. More than half of all students who are involved in school-\nrelated arrests or referred to law enforcement are Black or Latino. \nThis has a lasting effect and impact on young students. Studies show \nthat students who are disciplined by schools are more likely to end up \nin the juvenile justice system where their chances of returning to \nschool are slim to none. This is unacceptable. These young people are \nhaving their futures ripped away before they even have a chance.\n  We need to change the system and end the school-to-prison pipeline. \nFirst, we must start by making serious investments in our young people. \nWe should ensure that all students have equal access to high-quality \npublic school education. We must also expand summer youth job \nopportunities and summer training programs so that our teens have the \nopportunity to learn workforce skills, contribute to their communities, \nand start a path to economic opportunity. As a member of the \nSubcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, \nwe are working to try to make sure that these resources become a \npriority of our subcommittee, which they, unfortunately, aren't at this \npoint.\n  We also need to tear down the institutional racism, quite frankly, \nthat is holding students of color back and trapping our young people in \na broken criminal justice system.\n  I am reminded of when I was in the California legislature. I was on \nthe public safety committee, and proposals were brought to us, plans \nfor building prisons 10 to 12 years out for kids who are just starting \nkindergarten. That is what we had to deal with. Now we see what has \nhappened to the prison industrial complex in California. That is why we \nmust work together and pass legislation to end mass incarceration and \nfix our broken criminal justice system. We need to get rid of these \noutdated minimum sentencing standards. These are relics from the failed \nwar on drugs and disproportionately target people of color.\n  In California, once again, the three strikes law passed. Of course, I \nopposed that while in the California legislature. This law has \nincarcerated young African American men for nonviolent drug offenses 25 \nyears to life. That is 25 years to life for nonviolent drug offenses. \nWe need to repeal that law.\n  We also need to make sure that law enforcement officers reflect the \ndiversity of communities that they police. So we have introduced H. \nRes. 262, which supports effective community-oriented policing and \nencourages greater diversity in law enforcement.\n\n  During the last appropriation season, the Congressional Black Caucus \nworked with Congressman Lacy Clay to direct the Department of Justice \nto begin collecting training data. Our legislation tracks when officers \nreceive training for use of force, racial and ethnic bias, de-\nescalation of conflict, and constructive engagement with the public. \nThis was just a small step, and we need to do more.\n  With regard to reentry, banning the box is essential. We have worked \nwith the White House to try to make sure that Federal contractors ban \nthe box. We haven't accomplished that, but Federal agencies cannot now \nask for one's criminal history records. In my district, we do \nexpungement, we do record remedies. We have remedied thousands and \nthousands of young people who now can go on and move forward with their \nlives. I want to thank the Family Law Center in Oakland, California, \nfor doing that.\n  We need to go back to the drawing board and repeal the welfare reform \nprovisions that are denied for life. There is a Federal ban for food \nstamps, eligibility for public housing, and Pell grants for those who \nhave been incarcerated for drug felonies. Now, you know who that \ntargets; primarily African American and Latino men. They don't even \nhave a second chance when they get out of jail as a result of these \nlifetime bans.\n  Finally, let me just say it is time to really look at this problem in \na big way and to understand that we have to dismantle, not reform--but \nwe have to dismantle this prison industrial complex and start investing \nin our communities, especially our young children. And we must \nunderstand that, in doing this, we have to look at institutional and \nsystemic racism, which is at the core of many of our policies.\n  So this is a fight that we are going to win, but it is going to be \nbecause all of us here in the Congressional Black Caucus--Congresswoman \nBeatty, Congressman Jeffries, Congressman Scott, and Congresswoman \nJackson Lee, and the entire membership--continue to fight the good \nfight to make sure that finally we will begin to see a real criminal \njustice system, which it is not right now.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee. When people ask \nus why are we doing this today, I thank the gentlewoman for reminding \nus that the system is stacked against us and that we have had the \nfuture of so many of our young folks ripped away from them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio \n(Ms. Fudge). She is from the 11th Congressional District. She is an \nattorney. She has served as a former mayor. She is the immediate past \nchair of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  She is someone who gives us advice. I remember her saying to us: Push \nthe envelope because you are the voice for the voiceless. Look at the \nlegislative issues that will make a difference in the lives of others.\n  So tonight we come to talk about equal justice under the law. Mr. \nSpeaker, we come to challenge this House.\n  It is my great honor to yield to Congresswoman Marcia Fudge.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. It is a \npleasure to watch my fellow Ohioan and friend and the gentleman from \nNew York on this House floor every Monday night bringing the message of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus because indeed they are the people who \ncarry our message to the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is robbing far too many \nchildren of productive futures. Instead of learning in classrooms, a \nlarge percentage of our Nation's at-risk students sit in jail cells.\n  The numbers don't lie. Black students are suspended and expelled at a \nrate three times greater than White students. More than one in four \nboys of color with disabilities and nearly one in five girls of color \nwith disabilities receives an out-of-school suspension. And studies \nshow that students who are suspended or expelled in school are more \nlikely to end up in prison.\n  Our Nation's children deserve better. It is time we prioritize \neducation and not incarceration. Comprehensive criminal justice reform \nmust include policies which dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. We \nmust reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, a \nbill that funds delinquency prevention and improvements in State and \nlocal juvenile justice programs, supports restorative initiatives, and \npromotes early intervention. Disrupting the pipeline will provide a \npathway for a successful future and lessen the burden on our current \njudicial system.\n  The number of people incarcerated in America quadrupled between 1980 \nand 2008. Of the more than 2.3 million Americans incarcerated today, \nmore than 1 million of them are Black.\n  In my home State of Ohio, more than 50,000 people are incarcerated in \na system that was designed to only hold\n\n[[Page H2423]]\n\n39,000. And on average, States across this Nation spend $30,000 per \nyear to house one inmate. That is at least $19,000 more per year than \nwe spend to educate one child. It is time we get our priorities \nstraight.\n\n  As ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on \nEarly Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, promoting \npolicies that keep our children in school is one of my top priorities.\n  I ask my colleagues: What are yours?\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for reminding \nus again of the value and the importance of our work.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield time to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is coanchor of tonight's \nCongressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.\n  As I said earlier, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries is not only a scholar, \nhe, too, is an attorney. He is someone who walks the talk. He is \nsomeone who has a long history of being a Brother's Keeper.\n  Mr. Speaker, so tonight, when we discuss this topic, when we talked \nabout the challenge, when we talked about all of the plethora of things \nthat are incorporated in why we must come forward tonight to challenge \nthe criminal justice system which is stacked against us and broken, \ncertainly we have heard the disparities as it relates to African \nAmericans.\n  So it is indeed my honor to ask my coanchor, Congressman Hakeem \nJeffries, to share with us our challenge.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from \nOhio, my good friend, the distinguished and dynamic anchor for \ntonight's Special Order, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, for yielding and \nfor her continued leadership and for leading the discussion on the \nHouse floor today as it relates the urgency of this Congress and \nAmerica dealing with the school-to-prison pipeline mass incarceration \nand the prison industrial complex that so many of my colleagues have \nexplained and exposed here on the House floor today.\n  A few years ago I had a conversation that has always stuck with me in \nthe area of criminal justice when I was speaking to a formally \nincarcerated individual who spent several years behind bars \nincarcerated in a New York State penitentiary. He has turned his life \naround and he is now an advocate for criminal justice reform. He said \nto me on his final day, after being imprisoned for years in upstate New \nYork, that he had a conversation with a high-ranking corrections \nofficer, a supervisor who he had gotten to know and thought he had \nbefriended to some degree during his time of incarceration.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  On that last day, he said to this young African American incarcerated \nindividual who was on his way out, he said: I just want to thank you.\n  This gentleman was a little perplexed. He wasn't sure what he was \ntalking about. He said: I just want to thank you for helping me to get \nmy boat; and beyond that, I want to thank your son, who is going to \nhelp my son get his boat as well.\n  That conversation has really haunted me because, in such a powerful \nand profound way, what it captures is the essence of what the prison \nindustrial complex represents, which is this decision that was made in \nso many parts of the United States of America, certainly in New York, \nby Democrats and Republicans.\n  When the automobile factories and the steel mills, the manufacturing \nplants began to close in the 1970s and in the 1980s, devastating parts \nof the upstate economy, a decision was made in place of those factory \njobs to build prisons in their place as a means of economic development \nfor depressed upstate communities. But here is the problem. If you \nbuild it, someone has got to fill those prisons. In order to fill those \nprisons, several things have developed which we are in the process of \ntrying to dismantle right now: the school-to-prison pipeline and the \ncriminalization of young people, particularly in communities of color, \nwhere they basically are not given a chance from the very beginning. As \na result of being channeled unjustly, often, into the criminal justice \nsystem at an early age, they essentially become economic commodities \nfor those who have come to rely on prisons to replace the factory and \nmanufacturing jobs that have left the United States of America.\n  That has been a big problem in New York. It is a problem in other \nparts of the country. It is a shame here in the United States of \nAmerica that we have gone from a place where, when the war on drugs \nbegan in 1971--President Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number \none--there were less than 350,000 people incarcerated in America. Even \nwhen the crime bill that is being heavily debated in the public domain \nright now was passed in 1994, at the height of the concern about crime \nhere in the United States of America, the incarcerated population was \nstill under 900,000 people. But we have gone from less than 350,000 in \n1971 to under 900,000 in 1994 to more than 2.2 million in 2016.\n  The United States has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 \npercent of the world's incarcerated individuals. We incarcerate more \npeople than any other country in the world, and it is shameful. The \nschool-to-prison pipeline is a large part of that dynamic, along with \nthe failed war on drugs. So we are going to have to deal with this \nsituation in a meaningful way.\n  The statistics clearly show that, if you suspend a young person, that \nindividual--often a Black or Latino boy--is less likely to graduate and \ncomplete school and more likely to become entangled in the criminal \njustice system because we have applied an overly punitive approach to \ndiscipline, particularly in the inner city.\n  Now, in this Chamber, I have seen surprising levels of compassion as \nit relates to dealing with the heroin and opioid crisis that is \nsweeping across America right now, and I am glad that folks have \ndecided to take a different approach than the approach that was taken \nin the 1980s with the crack cocaine epidemic that was sweeping across \ncommunities that those of us in the Congressional Black Caucus \nrepresent.\n  I welcome this newfound compassion. I just hope that you would extend \nit now not just to the manner in which we deal with the heroin crisis--\nthat is important--but let's extend it to the overcriminalization that \nis taking place as relates to young people across America, particularly \nin Black and Brown communities.\n  I am glad that we have become enlightened as it relates to moving \naway from punishment and toward prevention and intervention related to \nthe heroin and opioid crisis. Let's also become enlightened in terms of \ndealing with breaking the school-to-prison pipeline.\n  We will have more to say as we move forward with this discussion, but \nI know there are other Members who would like to contribute to this \nhour of power that Representative Joyce Beatty has brought to the House \nfloor in connection with the CBC Special Order.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries for reminding \nus that the United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, yet incarcerates nearly a quarter of the global prison \npopulation.\n  Thank you for also being on point and reminding us, Mr. Speaker, if \nwe are to reform America's criminal justice system and advance efforts \nto break the cycles of incarceration in African American communities, \nin low-income communities, then we must unite and make sure that we \npass real legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, can you advise me how much time we have left, please.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 12 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield to the \ngentlewoman who hails from the 18th Congressional District of Texas \n(Ms. Jackson Lee). Of the many things that this Congresswoman does, she \nserves on the Committee on the Judiciary, she has been a longtime \nadvocate for reforming the criminal justice system. I refer to her as a \nstrong voice, a strong advocate, and, truly, a scholar.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my appreciation to the \ngentlewoman from Ohio; the gentleman from New York; and the Members who\n\n[[Page H2424]]\n\nhave spoken, including the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, \nMr. Butterfield; the former chair, Ms. Fudge; and the ranking member on \nthe Committee on Education and the Workforce, Mr. Scott.\n  There could not be a more important topic than the topic that we are \nspeaking about tonight. There are moments in history that I think come \nat times when urgency is the call of the day. It is often said that Dr. \nKing emphasized in his tenure the urgency of moving forward on civil \nrights and spoke eloquently about the fact of why we cannot wait. If I \nmight, I want to capture his theme of why we cannot wait to end the \nschool-to-prison pipeline. End it now and begin the whole comprehensive \napproach of criminal justice reform.\n\n  Let me take Texas as an example and cite some very important \nstatistics from the Appleseed Report and as well a comment on the work \nthat we are doing in the Committee on the Judiciary. I am so glad at \nthis moment in history to be the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and working \nwith the members of my subcommittee, including Mr. Jeffries, who is a \nmember, Ms. Bass, who is a member, and a number of other members as \nwell, on this very difficult hurdle that we have.\n  Let it be very clear that this hurdle of criminal justice reform is, \nas I heard Mr. Jeffries make mention of, that we have taken hold of \nthis issue of opioids and heroin in a way that not one single bill was \npassed last week that had a criminal focus, particularly out of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary. Not one bill had mandatory minimums.\n  In the debate last week, on Friday, I reiterated over and over again \nno mandatory minimums in this legislation. That should be the perfect \nthat we try to achieve going forward on criminal justice reform.\n  But let me give the beginnings of that very tragic outcome in \nAmerica, filling up the Nation's prisons, not having criminal justice \nbut criminal unfairness. It starts with a path to incarceration, which \nincludes in the schools, stops, failing public schools, zero tolerance \nand other school discipline, police in school hallways, disciplinary \nalternative schools, and court involvement in juvenile detention. All \nof these are a path for students to incarceration, and it is without \nunderstanding what a class C misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for \nthousands of Texas students and their families means.\n  Texas students as young as 6 have been ticketed at school in past \nyears, and it is not uncommon for elementary school students to be \nticketed by school-based law enforcement. School-based arrest of \nstudents often occurs without prior notice to parents. Police officers \nin some Texas schools are resorting to use of force, measures more \ncommonly associated with fighting street crime: pepper spray, tasers, \nand trained canines when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students \nare misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event.\n  This should not be the picture for a 6-year-old or a 4-year-old or an \n8-year-old or an 11-year-old or a 13-year-old. This should not be \nequated with school.\n  Let me read to you part of the Appleseed Report and a quote by Ryan \nKellus Turner and Mark Goodner: ``In a little over two decades, a \nparadigm shift has occurred in the Lone Star State. The misdeeds of \nchildren--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the \nprincipal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the \nsupervision of a middle school or high school coach . . . '' Now, of \ncourse, corporal punishment will be eliminated from that. What is \nworse, `` . . . now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, \nand untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs \nbeing imposed against children ages 10 through 16.''\n  ``It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic \ntickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year . . . '' And based \non the information from the Texas Office of Court Administration, the \nnumber of non-traffic tickets issued to students may well grossly \nexceed that number because it was very difficult to get it. ``Texas can \ninterrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young \npeople to the `school-to-prison pipeline' through early interventions \nfocused less on punishment and more on creating positive school \nenvironments that address students' academic and behavioral needs.''\n  Let me just say that ``police officers in some Texas schools are \nresorting to `use of force.' '' Now, they are supposed to be there as \nSROs. SROs are supposed to have educational training. SROs are supposed \nto be able to have the understanding of how to deal with counseling \nissues and teaching that is evidence based, but here is the problem. \nThe problem is that they are focused more on law enforcement.\n  I am glad to be part of this Special Order tonight that deals with \nthe pipeline that has started working our children toward \nincarceration: overcrowded schools, lack of qualified teachers, \ninadequate resources, and then the zero tolerance for school discipline \nof children and the rate of suspension having increased dramatically in \nrecent years from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000; and it \nhas gone beyond that, and the greatest emphasis has been on children of \ncolor.\n  So here is my call to the United States Congress. We have to begin \nthe process of dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. We have to \nunderstand that children can learn. No child is a throwaway. I offer \nthat often in my remarks in my district.\n  The detention system is an unfair system. I don't know how many of \nyou realize that when a child is sent to juvie, that child can remain \nthere until they reach the age of 21. How does that happen? Even if \ntheir sentence is not as egregious as one might think--a simple \nmisbehavior in school. The way that happens is because in juvenile, you \ncan assess more time on a child without telling that child's parent \nbecause that child did not follow orders or, in essence, that child did \nnot behave or that child chewed gum when you told them not to.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  We in the Judiciary Committee are working on juvenile justice reform. \nOne of them that I am most concerned about and want to move is ending \nsolitary confinement for juveniles, recognizing Kalief's Law, involving \nthe death of one inside the New York prison at Rikers Island. The \nindividual in solitary confinement had not been rendered guilty yet.\n  And so we want to eliminate putting juveniles in solitary \nconfinement. Because the tragedy, Mr. Speaker, was that that youngster \nwas released, ultimately, but after he was released, he, in essence, \ncommitted suicide.\n  So I want to close my remarks by indicating that I want to turn this \nsystem upside down. I want to make sure that we deal with juvenile \njustice reform. I want to ban the box. We have done that in legislation \nthat has not yet passed. I want to make sure that we have alternative \nsentencing.\n  At the same time, the Judiciary Committee has moved two bills out of \ncommittee. I want to see these bills have a vigorous discussion and \ndebate on the floor of the House so that we can move to conference.\n  Time is going by. Let us not let the perfect be, in essence, the \ndownfall of change. H.R. 3713 provides for the reduction of sentencing \nfor many who are languishing, by law, in prison today in the Federal \nsystem.\n  As I have spoken to people across the country, they have indicated \nthat, even though some States like my State of Texas have made \nenormous, enormous strides--I am proud of that--it has not happened \naround the country.\n  The bully pulpit of the Federal Government can be the most effective \ntool to moving toward criminal justice reform and sentencing reduction \ndealing with felony drug offenses. We are moving toward that point.\n  A vote on the floor of the House and moving toward conference can \nmove our efforts toward legislation that can truly be responsive to \nboth concerns and as well positives that are in that bill.\n  So as we deal with this prison pipeline, we have to not only talk, we \nhave to do. And when we do, we have to make sure that we respond to the \nconcerns, but we also have to make sure that we move legislation that \ncan ultimately come out of the Senate and go to conference and make a \ndifference in the lives of so many.\n  I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. I also want to say how\n\n[[Page H2425]]\n\ntimely the Congressional Black Caucus is. All that have been crying \nout, from Black Lives Matter to the Mother of the Movement, say that we \nneed changes dealing with the whole vastness of criminal justice \nreform: police-community relations, police actions, actions dealing \nwith guns, actions dealing with the loss of life of our young people.\n  Let's get a framework that can allow us to debate, to fix, to amend, \nand to get a product that will ultimately be signed by the President of \nthe United States on behalf of the people of the United States who are \ncrying out for relief.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman \nJoyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending the \nSchool-to-Prison Pipeline.\n  The over-criminalization of school children in America can no longer \nbe swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified.\n  We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act.\n  Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: \nto protect and defend the American people.\n  This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to \nhonor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem the \nSchool-to-Prison Pipeline in our nation.\n  The three most important concerns for Members of Congress today are \nNo. 1 Children, No. 2 Children, and No. 3 Children.\n  House Republicans are still unwilling to act to stop the \ncriminalization of our children in schools and instead work towards \nproviding children the opportunity to thrive in American communities.\n  This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the \nepidemic of losing our children to the correctional system.\n  Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the \nlives of America's youth by taking common sense steps in redirecting \nthose who go astray.\n  Over the past year, several proposals have been introduced to address \nthe need for overarching reform of our nation's criminal justice \nsystem.\n  Americans must consider the educational environment in which we place \nour students, from preschool to high school, subjecting them to \ndisciplinary policies that more closely resemble policing than \nteaching.\n  Around the country, advocates are collecting data illustrating the \ndevastating effects of what they call the ``school-to-prison \npipeline,'' where student behavior is criminalized, children are \ntreated like prisoners and, all too often, actually end up behind bars.\n  The school-to-prison pipeline refers to interlocking sets of \nrelationships at the institutional/structural and the individual \nlevels.\n  All of these policies and practices work together to push our \nnation's schoolchildren--youth of color, especially, our most at-risk \nchildren--out of schools and into unemployment and into the juvenile \nand criminal justice legal systems.\n  This pipeline reflects the prioritization of incarceration over \neducation.\n  For a growing number of students, the path to incarceration includes \nthe ``stops'' deterring matriculation such as:\n  1) Failing Public Schools;\n  2) Zero-Tolerance and Other School Discipline;\n  3) Policing School Hallways;\n  4) Disciplinary Alternative Schools; and\n  5) Court Involvement and Juvenile Detention.\n  In a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the \nLone Star State.\n  The misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted \nin trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps \nunder the supervision of a middle school or high school coach, now \nresult in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions \nof dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed \nagainst children in elementary and high schools.\n  Disrupting class, using profanity, misbehaving on a school bus, \nstudent fights, and truancy once meant a trip to the principal's \noffice.\n  Today, such misbehavior results in a Class C misdemeanor ticket and a \ntrip to court for thousands of Texas students and their families each \nyear.\n  It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic \ntickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year.\n  While it is impossible to pinpoint how many of these tickets are \nissued by campus police, the vast majority of these tickets are issued \nfor offenses most commonly linked to school-related misbehavior--\ndisruption of class, disorderly conduct, disruption of transportation, \ntruancy, and simple assaults related to student fights.\n  ``Criminalization'' of student misbehavior extends to even the \nyoungest students.\n  In Texas, students as young as six have been ticketed at school in \nthe past five years, and it is not uncommon for elementary-school \nstudents to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement.\n  School-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to \nparents or a lawyer being present during initial questioning of the \nstudent.\n  The increase in ticketing and arrest of students, in Texas and \nnationwide, has coincided with the growth in school-based policing.\n  Campus policing is the largest and fastest growing area of law \nenforcement in Texas, according to its own professional association.\n   With counselors stretched to handle class scheduling and test \nadministration duties, school administrators and teachers are \nincreasingly turning to campus police officers to handle student \nbehavior problems.\n  Today in Texas, most public schools have a police officer assigned to \npatrol hallways, lunchrooms, school grounds, and after-school events.\n  Police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to ``use of \nforce'' measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime--\npepper spray, Tasers and trained canines--when a schoolyard fight \nbreaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a \nschool event.\n  The intent is to keep schools and students safe, but there can be \nunintended consequences to disciplining public school students in a way \nthat introduces them to the justice system or exposes them to policing \ntechniques more commonly used with adults.\n  Texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of \nmore young people to the ``school-to-prison pipeline'' through early \ninterventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive \nschool environments that address students' academic and behavioral \nneeds.\n  We must seek appropriate recommendations for reform.\n  For most students, the pipeline begins with inadequate resources in \npublic schools.\n  Overcrowded classrooms, a lack of qualified teachers, and \ninsufficient funding for ``extras'' such as counselors, special \neducation services, and even textbooks, lock students into second-rate \neducational environments.\n  This failure to meet educational needs increases disengagement and \ndropouts, increasing the risk of later court involvement.\n  Even worse, schools may actually encourage dropouts in response to \npressures from test-based accountability regimes such as the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, which create incentives to push out low-performing \nstudents to boost overall test scores.\n  Lacking resources, facing incentives to push out low-performing \nstudents, and responding to a handful of highly-publicized school \nshootings, schools have embraced zero-tolerance policies that \nautomatically impose severe punishment regardless of circumstances.\n  Under these policies, students have been expelled for bringing nail \nclippers or scissors to school.\n  Rates of suspension have increased dramatically in recent years--from \n1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000--and have been most dramatic \nfor children of color.\n  Overly harsh disciplinary policies push students down the pipeline \nand into the juvenile justice system.\n  Suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and \nwithout constructive activities.\n  They also can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a \ngreater likelihood of disengagement and drop-outs.\n  All of these factors increase the likelihood of court involvement.\n  As harsh penalties for minor misbehavior become more pervasive, \nschools increasingly ignore or bypass due process protections for \nsuspensions and expulsions.\n  The lack of due process is particularly acute for students with \nspecial needs, who are disproportionately represented in the pipeline \ndespite the heightened protections afforded to them under law.\n  Many under-resourced schools become ``pipeline gateways'' by placing \nincreased reliance on police rather than teachers and administrators to \nmaintain discipline.\n  Growing numbers of districts employ school resource officers to \npatrol school hallways, often with little or no training in working \nwith youth.\n  As a result, children are far more likely to be subject to school-\nbased arrests--the majority of which are for non-violent offenses, such \nas disruptive behavior--than they were a generation ago.\n  The rise in school-based arrests, the quickest route from the \nclassroom to the jailhouse, most directly exemplifies the \ncriminalization of school children.\n  In some jurisdictions, students who have been suspended or expelled \nhave been completely denied their right to an education.\n  In others, they are sent to disciplinary alternative schools.\n\n[[Page H2426]]\n\n  Growing in number across the country, these shadow systems--sometimes \nrun by private, for-profit companies--are immune from educational \naccountability standards (such as minimum classroom hours and \ncurriculum requirements) and may fail to provide meaningful educational \nservices to the students who need them the most.\n  As a result, struggling students return to their regular schools \nunprepared, are permanently locked into inferior educational settings, \nor are funneled through alternative schools into the juvenile justice \nsystem.\n  Youth who become involved in the juvenile justice system are often \ndenied procedural protections in the courts.\n  Studies demonstrate that as many as 80 percent of court-involved \nchildren do not have lawyers.\n  Students who commit minor offenses may end up in secured detention if \nthey violate boilerplate probation conditions prohibiting them from \nactivities like missing school or disobeying teachers.\n  Students pushed along the pipeline find themselves in juvenile \ndetention facilities, many of which provide few, if any, educational \nservices.\n  Students of color, who are far more likely than their white peers to \nbe suspended, expelled, or arrested for the same kind of conduct at \nschool, and those with disabilities are particularly likely to travel \ndown this pipeline.\n  Though many students are propelled down the pipeline from school to \njail, it is difficult for them to make the journey in reverse.\n  Students who enter the juvenile justice system face many barriers to \ntheir re-entry into traditional schools.\n  The vast majority of these students never graduate from high school.\n  Numerous studies have also shown that as many as 70-80 percent of \nyouth involved in the justice system meet the criteria for a \ndisability.\n  We must move away from the engrained culture of criminalization as \nthe answer to our problems.\n  It is no secret that 1 in every 3 black males born today can expect \nto go to prison at some point in their life, compared with 1 in every 6 \nLatino males, and 1 in every 17 white males.\n  It is a statistic we know well because it is one that has been \nreported since 2001 and has remained unchanged for nearly 15 years.\n  It is time we stop repeating and start understanding and unraveling \nthe fateful 1 in 3 trend that continues to sweep entire generations of \nyoung men of color into a lifetime of systematic and barriers.\n  The United States currently has the largest number of prisoners in \nthe world due to its skyrocketing national imprisonment rate.\n  Rather than investing in premier educational responses, the United \nStates pays the highest cost globally for incarceration.\n  Federal, state, and local leaders are looking for innovative ways to \nimprove public health and public safety outcomes, while reducing the \ncosts of criminal justice and corrections.\n  A number of innovative strategies can save public funds and improve \npublic health by keeping low-risk, non-violent, drug-involved offenders \nout of prison or jail, while still holding them accountable and \nensuring the safety of our communities.\n  The Obama Administration is committed to funding and evaluating the \nlong-term effects of these innovative criminal justice and corrections \ninterventions.\n  I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation \nthat will help stop the derailment of children's lives.\n  Meanwhile, Federal agencies will continue to seek opportunities to \nexpand smart probation and problem-solving court initiatives around the \ncountry in collaboration with state, local, and tribal agencies.\n  In recognition of the considerable potential in cost savings, \nimproved outcomes for offenders, and improved public safety, a growing \nnumber of state and local officials around the country are starting \ntheir own promising initiatives to break the cycle of drug use, crime, \nand incarceration.\n  Nearly every state is struggling with significant shortfalls in \nrevenue and making significant cuts to spending in order to close \nbudget gaps.\n  In making these cuts, many states are focusing attention on \ncorrections spending, one of the fastest growing lines in state budgets \nover the past two decades.\n  Many states are pursuing a justice reinvestment approach, using data \nto determine what has been driving the growth in the prison population \nand how that growth might be stopped.\n  In addition, small investments have been made in programs designed to \nreduce recidivism.\n  New policies have been enacted, slowing the growth of prison \npopulations or even downsizing corrections systems, saving states \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  A portion of those savings are being reinvested in community-based \nservices and supports, including substance abuse treatment.\n  However, to have meaningful impact on behaviors that contribute to \ncrime, recidivism, and substance abuse, states must focus on a handful \nof proven strategies that will maximize the impact of limited \ninvestments being made in the treatment of substance use disorders and \ncommunity supervision.\n  I am a strong supporter of education and I am particularly sensitive \nand protective of measures to keep students safe in school.\n  In this same spirit, we must invest in a multi-step, collaborative \nprocess that involves the combined efforts of law enforcement, \nprosecutors, influential community members, social services, reentry \nservices, community corrections, faith-based organizations, and city \nmanagement.\n  We have seen too often the horrific abuses of school officers \ndragging, punching, slapping, and more to students.\n  First and foremost school-based law enforcement personnel need to be \nremoved from the educational setting.\n  And if law enforcement are not removed, they should be required to \nreceive post-certification training in issues specific to youth, \nincluding:\n  1) de-escalation and mediation techniques;\n  2) restraint techniques to be used when force cannot be avoided;\n  3) signs and symptoms of trauma, abuse and neglect in children and \nyouth, as well as appropriate responses;\n  4) signs and symptoms of mental illness in children and youth, and \nappropriate responses; and\n  5) manifestations of other disabilities, such as autism, and \nappropriate responses, adolescent development, Juvenile law, and \nSpecial education and applicable general education law.\n  Prohibit school districts from receiving any revenue from Class C \nticketing for truancy or any other offense.\n  Eliminate Disruption of Class and Disruption of Transportation as \npenal code offenses.\n  Prohibit ticketing of students under the age of 14.\n  Young children are simply not equipped to understand a Class C \nmisdemeanor ticket as a meaningful consequence of misbehavior, and the \nconsequences of court involvement on academic success are too great to \nallow this practice to continue.\n  Ticketing of older students should be a last resort.\n  Ticketing, arrest and use of force in schools is preposterously \nreshaping today's school disciplinary policies disproportionately to \nactual need.\n  We must acknowledge this epidemic and move to correct the inevitable \ninjustice that follows when our children are derailed from their \nfutures.\n  I thank my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman \nHakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) for \nhosting this Special Order on Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline.\n  It is an invaluable and much needed effort.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, let me just end by saying that the urgency \nis now. In the words of Nelson Mandela, ``It always seems impossible \nuntil it's done.'' Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus says: Let's \nget it done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our children \nrepresent the future of our nation. Our future is more promising when \nour children have a clear path to succeed and have the opportunities to \nbecome active members of the community. Over time, a culture of \nfavoring incarceration over education has become more prominent \nthroughout our society--particularly as it relates to minority and low-\nincome populations. Financial shortfalls at all levels of government \nare also placing downward pressure on states and municipalities to cut \nback on public services and educational or community-based programs in \nfavor of harsh criminalization or incarceration.\n  The result is the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' which poses a very \nreal threat to our children and our society. This pipeline refers to \nharsh policies and practices that cultivate a culture where young \nindividuals are pushed into the juvenile and criminal justice systems \nthrough harsh punishments in schools. Inadequate resources in public \nschools, economic instability, zero-tolerance policies, and harsh \npunishments for non-violent offenses are all contributing to the \nschool-to-prison pipeline. As a result, the United States suffers from \nthe largest number of prisoners in the world and the economic and \nsocial burden of the high costs of incarceration.\n  Zero tolerance policies are dangerous to have in our schools. These \npolicies impose extremely severe punishments on students, regardless of \nthe circumstances, which can result in suspension or even expulsion \nfrom school. Children of color and students with special needs have \nexperienced a dramatic increase in these suspensions and expulsions, \nwhich greatly increase their probability of entering into the juvenile \njustice system. Schools\n\n[[Page H2427]]\n\nare also beginning to display an overreliance on law enforcement to \nmaintain discipline through the use of school resource officers.\n  Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is the result of a \ndangerous precedent being set in our schools. Zero tolerance policies \nand the overreliance on law enforcement to keep order in our schools \nnot only detracts from the culture of learning we expect in our \nschools, but also condemns countless children to a life of suffering \nfor making simple mistakes during their youth. Our society will suffer \nif we continue on this path of forcing children into the criminal \njustice system and it is time that we considered serious reforms to \nkeep children in our communities and outside the juvenile justice \nsystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/house-section/article/H2427-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
