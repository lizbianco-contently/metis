The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, over the holidays, the Obama \nadministration sent a very special Christmas greeting to immigrant \nfamilies. They launched a series of home raids targeting Central \nAmerican asylum seekers and immigrant families with children.\n  As its New Year's resolution, it is clear the Obama administration is \nembarking on a new enforcement initiative to deport Central Americans \nwho entered the U.S. in 2014.\n  Last weekend, 121 children and adults were taken into custody, and \nmost were sent to private family detention centers--a kind of privately \nrun, for-profit family jail. They will probably be deported, just like \nthe 2 million before them deported by President Obama.\n  How they are treated and whether they get meaningful due process \nremains a question mark. What is undeniable is that such raids strike \nmaximum fear in immigrant communities. The government is saying they \ncould be coming to your house, and they could be coming at any time.\n  Already, we are seeing signs of panic. We hear that children aren't \ngoing to school and parents aren't going to work out of fear. Not even \na week into the new year, and 2016 has turned into one of fear and \nhiding.\n  But let us be clear: Deporting families will not solve the violence \nand corruption that push people from El Salvador, Guatemala, and \nHonduras to risk assault, rape, and murder to seek refuge in the United \nStates. Deporting families will not weaken the gangs who terrorize and \nextort their own people in Central America. Deporting families will not \nsolve America's immigration problem. Deporting families will not \nstrengthen border security. Deporting families will not create legal \nchannels that allow immigrants to come with visas instead of smugglers. \nDeporting families will not reduce the insatiable demand in the United \nStates for the very drugs that fuel the gangs, the guns, the smuggling \noperations, and the ruthless violence in Central America.\n  The raids by the Obama administration on families from Central \nAmerica must stop. They are a cruel reminder of a discredited policy.\n  We do not want to repeat the scenes from April 2000 when armed agents \nforcibly took Elian Gonzalez from his house in Miami. That vision of \nterror is seared into America's memory and should not be repeated.\n  But even the raid on the home of Elian Gonzalez was carried out after \nall peaceful means of negotiation were exhausted. Surely there is a \nbetter way to take action when people have exhausted all of their legal \nremedies than to send armed agents into neighborhoods, apartment \ncomplexes, and family homes.\n  Those who are being deported are the ones most likely to have no \nattorney, no understanding of the laws and the practices of immigration \ncourts, and now could be vulnerable to attack and murder back in \nCentral America.\n  The fact is that some of the people the U.S. Government has deported \nin the past years have ended up dead in days or weeks after their \nreturn. We have to make sure that same tragic\n\n[[Page H18]]\n\nfate does not wait for the individuals and families the government is \ncurrently rounding up.\n  Along with other Members of Congress, I am seeking answers from \nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson as to why this policy is \nneeded, why it was launched to instill fear in immigrant households \nover the Christmas holidays, and why family detention centers I have \nbeen trying to close are now filling up with new families awaiting \ndeportation.\n  This is not the Democratic Party's solution to immigration questions, \nnor should it be America's. We expect heated calls for raids and \ndeportation from the other side. We hear their calls for walls, bigger \njails, and further restrictions on legal immigration. We will fight \ntheir efforts to erect religious or economic barriers to who can \nqualify for a chance to come to America.\n  Our party has rejected those calls with good reason. Americans want \norder and legality in immigration, not deportations and families \nforcefully split apart or exiled. We do not need to repeat that scene \nmultiplied by hundreds or thousands of times across our Nation.\n  What we need to do is not easy, but it is the right thing to do. We \nneed to take steps to solve the problems of gangs, weak and corrupt \ngovernments in Central America, and people who have no hope for a \nbrighter future right here on our continent.\n  Serious aid is more than giving more money to the police departments \nof those countries. It is more than putting U.S. personnel in those \ncountries to tell moms and dads, no, you can't seek refuge in the U.S. \nIt is more than working with Mexico at its southern border. We need to \ngive mothers and fathers and children a way to live in their own \ncountries.\n  I have gone to the detention centers in Texas and met with the moms \nand the kids who were detained there when they came to the United \nStates. One woman summed up their plight concisely by saying: Luis, in \nHonduras, my family and I could live in poverty, but we could not live \nin peace.\n  Raids will not bring her peace. Raids will not bring us order. Raids \nwill only bring misery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H18-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TEACH ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about \na growing problem in the United States: Employers across our country \nhave millions of job openings but are unable to find workers with the \nskills needed to fill those jobs.\n  According to a recent study by CareerBuilder, nearly 50 percent of \nemployers nationwide cannot find skilled workers to fill open \npositions. Many of these jobs are located in lucrative career fields \nlike welding, emergency medical response, electrical engineering, \nrobotics, and carpentry.\n  This gap between employers and our workers is holding our economy \nback; it is exacerbating our unemployment problem; it is hurting our \ncommunities; and it is placing unneeded pressure on our families.\n  The American economy needs qualified workers with the skills and \ndrive necessary to fill these open jobs. I believe part of the answer \nto how we address this problem is career and technical education. \nCareer and technical education, or CTE, is simply education that \nspecializes in the skilled trades, applied sciences, information \ntechnology, and similar disciplines.\n  Career and technical education occurs in schools across America. In \nmy home State of West Virginia, about 65,000 students each year \nparticipate in CTE courses. Those who do are much more likely to \nsucceed. Over 80 percent of West Virginia participants meet industry-\ndriven performance requirements for the technical skills they receive, \nand 95 percent go on to additional postsecondary education, the \nworkforce, or the military.\n  I hear about CTE all the time as I travel across my district in West \nVirginia and visit schools and community colleges. I have seen the \nclassrooms and the students whose eyes light up when they show off \ntheir work. I have spoken to the faculty and administrators who have \ncommitted their careers to training up a next generation workforce, and \nI know that just a little more support will make a huge difference.\n  While there is no silver bullet to our Nation's unemployment problem, \nadditional investment in CTE is one way to help put people back to work \nand grow our economy.\n  The skills provided by CTE are some of the most highly sought-after \nskills in our economy today. But ironically enough, these are the \nhardest jobs to fill in the United States because of the lack of \nadequately trained individuals. According to a recent study by the \nManufacturing Institute, over 2 million manufacturing jobs will go \nunfilled in the next decade because of the skills gap.\n  I believe we can help. That is why I joined with seven of my \ncolleagues to introduce H.R. 4263, the TEACH Act, also known as the \nTechnical Education and Career Help Act.\n  My bipartisan bill will invest in our CTE programs by providing new \nresources for the technical education teachers without authorizing any \nnew spending. My bill will authorize the Higher Education Act's teacher \nresidency grant program to be used to help schools recruit and train \nhigh-quality CTE teachers. This is currently not allowed.\n  My bill will increase the quality of training that students receive \nby recruiting midcareer professionals in relevant technical fields. \nHaving teachers with real work experience in the fields that they teach \nwill ensure students receive the best training.\n  I would like to thank Congresswoman Katherine Clark for cosponsoring \nthis bipartisan bill with me, along with Representatives Rod Blum, \nBruce Poliquin, Tom MacArthur, Jim Langevin, Pete Aguilar, and Ami \nBera.\n  Our bill has been endorsed by a broad group of experts, including the \nAlliance for Excellent Education, the American Federation of Teachers, \nthe Association for Career and Technical Education, and the Future \nFarmers of America.\n  My bill is an example that Republicans and Democrats can work \ntogether. My bill will help provide new hope to our communities by \nequipping hardworking West Virginians and all Americans with skills \nthey can actually use.\n  We need to invest in career and technical education now or we will \nmiss out on this important opportunity. I encourage my colleagues in \nthe House to support the TEACH Act and consider the important \ndifference it would make across our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H18-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H18-H19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GUN VIOLENCE AND THE PATH FORWARD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, traditionally we start the new year on a \nnote of hope. Notwithstanding troubled headlines and difficulties home \nand abroad, the new year is an opportunity to consider the future \nafresh, to reflect on opportunities, past accomplishments, and new \nopportunities.\n  I appreciate President Obama beginning the new year with a continued \nfocus on gun safety. His modest proposal was greeted with predictable \nopposition and scorn as some Republican politicians attempted to \ndistort it all out of proportion and to change the subject to a \nnonissue: confiscation of the guns of law-abiding Americans when, in \nfact, virtually all responsible American gun owners support reasonable \nbackground checks to make it more difficult for people we all agree \nshould not be armed to get guns.\n  It is interesting to speculate on what would have been the response \nin today's superheated, contentious political climate with the efforts \nof a generation ago to reduce the carnage on our highways from \nunnecessary auto deaths or the hundreds of thousands of people who \nbecame addicted to cigarettes and died of cancer and heart disease. \nThere would have been screams of outrage about the nanny state and \npolitical correctness, that the government was going to take cigarettes \naway from people because it knew what was best for them. It was going \nto force people to pay unconscionable levels of tax that would fall on \nthe poor, that a\n\n[[Page H19]]\n\nmore aggressive auto engineering program was the government telling the \nprivate sector and the consumer what was best for them, that it would \ndrive up the cost of automobiles, and that it would have law \nenforcement interfere with people having an innocent drink on a night \non the town.\n  Most telling would have been the argument that this really wouldn't \nmake any difference, that none of these steps would stop people from \nsmoking or reckless driving on the roadways. People would still die.\n  Those excuses for inaction are demonstrably false a generation later. \nWe have cut the rates of adult smoking in half and saved millions of \nlives. The carnage on our highways has been dramatically reduced and \nAmerican families are safer.\n  It is important to have perspective going forward. Yes, there is no \nsingle solution to gun violence. But the fact remains that the United \nStates is unique among developed countries, being unable to protect our \nfamilies from unacceptable levels of death at the hands of the deranged \nor the careless.\n  There are things we can do to make a difference, and the public is \nwilling to accept them. I begin this new year hopeful that we don't \nhave to accept Capitol Hill as an island of denial, whether it is the \nthreat from climate change or the potential to do something about gun \nviolence to make our families safer.\n  Last year, there were times when we in Congress came together and \nproduced some constructive results. At the State and local level, \npeople are not waiting for our Republican colleagues to come to their \nsenses to deal with carbon pollution or gun violence. They are taking \naction.\n  I am hopeful that we will be able to broaden the conversation about \nwhat, in fact, we can do: tone down the rhetoric and find steps on \nissues that are both contentious and even those where there is \nbasically no disagreement but we simply haven't gotten around to taking \naction.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  There are clear opportunities for us to broaden that agenda. We can \navert a crisis in Gaza from a lack of water and adequate sanitation. We \ncould pass Representative Murphy's bipartisan mental health bill. We \ncould link food and farm policy with new awareness and research.\n  Let's not in 2016 have the opportunities for cooperation and progress \ndrowned with political vitriol. Let's cooperate where we can, focus on \nsolutions even where we can't, and set the stage for giving Americans \nwhat they deserve: a government not in denial, a Congress willing to \ncooperate and to face problems, large and small, so as to make progress \nrather than to revel in discord and hyperbole in order to win votes in \ncontentious primaries. Let's focus on what we can get done and do it. \nWe will feel better, and the American public will be better served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H19-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING HUMAN AND SEX TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize January as Human and \nSex Trafficking Awareness Month.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's call sex trafficking what it is. It is modern-day \nslavery that exploits our society's most vulnerable. Unfortunately, sex \ntrafficking is the fastest growing business of any organized crime in \nthe world. This isn't a faraway problem. In the United States, it is an \nestimated $9.8 billion industry and, sadly, children aged 12 to 14 are \nthe largest at risk for sex trafficking. This is absolutely disgusting.\n  Last year we passed important legislation aimed at stopping sex \ntrafficking, but the fight is far from over. It is our collective \nobligation to do everything that we can to put a definitive end to this \nmodern-day slavery, which is why we must come together as a country, we \nmust come together as a Congress, to do everything we can to stop this \ndisgusting crime.\n\n\n                         Mental Wellness Month\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mental Wellness \nMonth.\n  To this point, our government's approach to mental health has \nconsisted of ineffective and disjointed policies. Too often, those in \nneed of care end up either in jail or on the streets because adequate \nservices are simply not available.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Helping Families in Mental Health \nCrisis Act, which would help the Nation's broken mental health system \nand care for those who are most in need.\n  This bipartisan bill would improve effectiveness and efficiency in \nFederal programs that help people, with a focus on early intervention \nand prevention programs in addition to suicide prevention. I want to \nthank my friend Tim Murphy for his leadership on this bill.\n  I am glad that the administration this week recognized the importance \nof mental health programs in reducing gun violence, but we need a long-\nterm legislative fix if we are really going to make progress on solving \nthe mental health crisis in our Nation.\n  That is why, in recognition of Mental Wellness Month, I call on my \ncolleagues to pass this bipartisan bill and to stop playing partisan \ngames with people's lives.\n\n\n       Waukegan High School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Waukegan High \nSchool Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, which is celebrating its \n100th anniversary this week.\n  Waukegan's program is the oldest JROTC program in the Nation. It was \ncreated before the national JROTC program was instated in late 1916. \nIts initial purpose was to prepare high school young men for military \nservice during World War I. This organization has come a long way over \nthe past century, as half of the cadets of this 777-member corps are \nyoung women.\n  The Waukegan High School JROTC offers a curriculum not only of \nmilitary training, but also of good leadership and citizenship skills. \nStudents receive an education of flag and military structure, self-\ndiscipline and guidance on personal, financial, college, and career \nplanning. Of the 777 cadets, 75 percent go on to postsecondary \neducation and 10 percent serve in our military.\n  Congratulations to the Waukegan High School JROTC for this program \nand for leading and being a strong and positive representative for our \nWaukegan community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H19-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H19-H20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GUN VIOLENCE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Kelly) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud President \nObama's executive actions taken this week to reduce gun violence in \nAmerica. These policies will help keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and dangerous individuals and will prevent gun trafficking, \nwhile also protecting the Second Amendment rights of responsible, law-\nabiding citizens.\n  With over 30 Americans killed by guns every single day, inaction is \nnot an option. In my nearly 3 years in Congress, House Republican \nleadership has refused to do anything on gun violence, not one hearing, \nnot a single vote.\n  In facing Congress' inertia, President Obama did what was necessary \nto address a threat to our long-term national security and economic \nstability. While we can't stop every criminal from committing every \ncrime, we can take actions that will save lives, and President Obama's \nexecutive actions will do just that.\n  Under these commonsense changes, everyone who profits from the sale \nof firearms will be required to obtain a license. It shouldn't matter \nif you sell a gun in a store, online, or at a gun show. It is the sale \nof a dangerous weapon, and the seller should make sure the buyer is \nsafe, responsible, and law-abiding.\n  It is a sobering fact that the majority of gun deaths in the United \nStates is from suicide. Expanding Federal funding for mental health \nservices and streamlining States' abilities to report data to the \nbackground check system are essential to keeping guns out of the hands \nof the dangerously mentally ill.\n  President Obama's executive actions make essential strides in \nadvancing smart gun technology. If you can use a thumbprint to get into \nyour iPhone, there is no reason that the same technology can't be \ninvented so that guns won't fire without the right fingerprint. If a \ngun would only fire when it\n\n[[Page H20]]\n\nis held by the right owner, stolen guns would be inoperable, \ndrastically decreasing firearm deaths.\n  Similarly, just like there are childproof caps on aspirin, there \nshould be childproof guns. This will help protect children from \naccidentally discharging firearms. Smart gun technology is centuries \nold. Smith & Wesson invented the first childproof trigger over 150 \nyears ago.\n  While President Obama's executive actions are crucial steps to \nreducing the senseless gun violence that is plaguing our Nation, they \ndon't absolve Congress of its moral responsibility to act. There are \ngaps in existing gun laws that leave us all vulnerable to gun violence. \nThese holes are ones that only Congress can plug.\n  I have two commonsense bills which will complement President Obama's \nexecutive actions and help bring a reduction in firearm mortality.\n  The first bill, H.R. 224, the Recognizing Gun Violence as a Public \nHealth Emergency Act, would require the Surgeon General to submit an \nannual report to Congress on the public health impact of gun violence. \nThe bill currently has 135 cosponsors, and I hope that this commonsense \nproposal can get an up-or-down vote this year.\n  For the past 20 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nand the National Institutes of Health have been prevented from \nconducting research on firearms. This lack of data has limited academic \nresearch on guns, and it has prevented Congress from obtaining the data \nit needs to craft impactful legislation.\n  The second bill, H.R. 225, the Firearm Safety Act, would close the \nloophole which prevents the Consumer Product Safety Commission from \ncreating rules regarding the safety of firearms.\n  Quite simply, if the Consumer Product Safety Commission can regulate \nteddy bears, bicycle helmets, and car seats, it should be able to \nregulate firearms. Simply improving safety lock quality and improving \nstorage safety will reduce accidents, misfires, and will prevent theft, \nsaving thousands of lives.\n  These bills would give Congress the data it needs to pass meaningful \nand impactful gun violence prevention legislation, and they would \nensure firearms are as safe and consumer friendly as possible, all \nwithout obstructing the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun \nowners.\n  Senseless gun violence has been plaguing our Nation for too long. It \nis simply unacceptable in the United States of America that gun \nviolence is the leading cause of death for people under 24. It is time \nfor us to come together to end the gun violence that is taking a \ngeneration of young Americans.\n  I applaud President Obama's leadership and his important actions to \ncurb the violence that is plaguing our communities, actions he took \nbecause Congress has done nothing, not even calling up bipartisan bills \nwith many cosponsors. Congress must now carry the torch and pass \nmeaningful gun violence prevention legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H20-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I have voted over 60 times to repeal or to \nreplace all or portions of ObamaCare. I have voted numerous times to \ndefund Planned Parenthood.\n  These issues have always been held up by the parliamentary rules in \nthe Senate, which is the ability of a minority number of Senators to \nblock bills from coming to the floor. But not now, not today. Under \nreconciliation procedures, a simple majority vote can move a bill out \nof the Senate Chamber.\n  So today we will vote to repeal and replace major pieces of ObamaCare \nthat distort the market, raise prices, and deprive our citizens of \nchoice. The bill today will eliminate the individual mandate and the \nemployer mandate. The government's forcing of our citizens to buy a \nproduct that they do not want is un-American and costly. I say good \nriddance.\n  We were all aghast over the recordings that were released that \nhighlighted Planned Parenthood's selling of baby body parts. As a \nMember who believes that individual, distinct life begins at \nconception, Planned Parenthood's lack of remorse or even of concern \nhighlights its dark business. Today we send a bill to the President's \ndesk to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  Many of my constituents have told me: We gave you the House majority \nin 2010. What have you done? We gave you the Senate majority in 2014. \nWhat have you done? Why can't you get something to the President's \ndesk?\n  Today we do.

Mr. Speaker, what the new year gives us is an \nopportunity to refresh, to regroup, to look forward to opportunities in \nthis instance and in this august body to protect the American people.\n  So today I rise with a great deal of applause and enthusiasm, words \nthat I think do not connote the presentation made by President Obama \nyesterday, for it is not often the American people can see the deepness \nof our hearts, the affection we have for them, and the concern that we \nhave over loss of life.\n  The President did all of that. In his teary expressions, he pierced \nthe hearts of Americans, and he should have pierced the hearts of the \nMembers of Congress, Republicans and Democrats. There is no doubt that \nthousands are dying from gun violence. There is no doubt that people \nwith guns kill. There is no doubt that more people get guns who should \nnot have guns.\n  I am particularly excited by the President's thoughtful and \ncollaborative work, along with that of Attorney General Lynch and a \nnumber of my colleagues, and of, certainly, the House Judiciary \nCommittee, in particular our ranking member, John Conyers, those of us \nDemocrats on the committee, and particularly those on the Crime \nSubcommittee, on which I have the privilege of serving as the ranking \nmember.\n  We have worked together to have an agenda on criminal justice. The \nissues dealing with guns deal with criminal justice. Why should we run \naway from the wide and well-known proposition that there are people who \nare getting guns without their having had background checks?\n  Tragically, in my own community, an off-duty officer was attempting \nto sell guns in an open parking lot or in an open area in which he \nthought he would be protected. What ensued? A gun battle.\n  I don't know how those individuals purchasing those guns could have \nhad background checks, but I would say that that is certainly not \nrepresentative of the many in law enforcement with whom I have engaged \nwho have already said that guns kill and that so many guns in America--\nmore guns, we understand, than there are people--provide for a deadly \nmixture.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  So I think it is important for the American people to know that the \nFederal Government has been working, unlike some have said. In 2015, \nNCIS received more than 22.2 million background checks, an average of \nmore than 63,000 per day. By law, a gun dealer can complete a sale to a \ncustomer if the background check comes back clean or has taken more \nthan 3 days.\n  I think, in this instance, we need to look at the legislation of Mr. \nClyburn, who indicates you must have a background check. I also think \nwe should look and work legislatively with the President. Why would we \nbe against hiring 200-plus more ATF officers? Why would we be against \nputting more resources in mental health?\n  I am very proud that I have introduced H.R. 4316--this bill is the \nGun Violence Reduction Resources Act--just last evening to add those \n200-plus ATF officers. I ask my colleagues to join me. I introduced \nthat with Congresswoman Robin Kelly.\n  I introduced, with Representative Karen Bass and Congresswoman \nNapolitano, H.R. 4315, the Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Act of \n2016, to increase the resources necessary, yesterday.\n  Mr. Speaker, how many more need to die? Do we still need to have an \namnesia check on Connecticut, San\n\n[[Page H21]]\n\nBernardino, Columbine, or Oregon, and many places beyond? Guns must be \nrestrained. The President's mission is correct--more data for secure \ntechnology, more NCIS data in order to run through those background \nchecks appropriately.\n  Remember Charleston, South Carolina? Remember the message? He got the \nguns because 3 days had passed. And he killed nine people worshipping \nin a church.\n  So it is important, Mr. Speaker, that Congress owns up to its own \nresponsibility, not one that says the Second Amendment is being \nundermined. It is not. You can never undermine our Constitution. It is \na procedural structure that we are not engaged in. We are only trying \nto provide a guidepost to save lives of children and families. I am \nlooking forward to working with the Judiciary Committee in the House \nand the Senate to look at constructive legislation.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that I am saddened that again we \ncome on the floor with Planned Parenthood legislation that talks to the \nvery heart of America, quality of health care, protecting women in \nterms of cervical cancer. This is a nonstarter. Vote against it. \nProtect American women. Protect families and children against gun \nviolence.\n  Mr. Speaker, upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a \nsolemn pledge: to protect and defend the American people. This is the \nmost important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this \npromise, we must do everything in our power to stem gun violence in our \nnation.\n  Yet, after another mass shooting and countless acts of gun violence \nin communities across our country every day, House Republicans are \nstill unwilling to act to stop gun violence and save lives in American \ncommunities.\n  The Democrats have been calling for an immediate vote on the \nbipartisan King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights \nProtection Act to strengthen the lifesaving background checks that keep \nguns out of the wrong hands.\n  This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the gun \nviolence epidemic. Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in \nprotecting the lives of Americans by taking common sense steps to save \nlives.\n  The Administration is announcing two new executive actions that will \nhelp strengthen the federal background check system and keep guns out \nof the wrong hands. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is proposing a \nregulation to clarify who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under \nfederal law for reasons related to mental health, and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a proposed regulation to \naddress barriers preventing states from submitting limited information \non those persons to the federal background check system.\n  Too many Americans have been severely injured or lost their lives as \na result of gun violence. While the vast majority of Americans who \nexperience a mental illness are not violent, in some cases when persons \nwith a mental illness do not receive the treatment they need, the \nresult can be tragedies such as homicide or suicide.\n  The Administration takes a comprehensive approach to mental health \nissues by expanding coverage of mental health services so care is \naffordable, launching a national conversation on mental health to \nreduce stigma associated with having a mental illness and getting help, \ndirecting funds we have now to improve mental health facilities, and \nproposing more funds be used for efforts such as training additional \nmental health professionals.\n  At the same time, the Administration is committed to making sure that \nanyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others does not have \naccess to a gun. The federal background check system is the most \neffective way to assure that such individuals are not able to purchase \na firearm from a licensed gun dealer. To date, background checks have \nprevented over two million guns from falling into the wrong hands.\n  The Administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that \nbetter and more reliable information makes its way into the background \ncheck system. The Administration also continues to call on Congress to \npass common-sense gun safety legislation and to expand funding to \nincrease access to mental health services.\n\n\n       PROGRESS TO STRENGTHEN THE FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM\n\n  Over the past year, the Administration has taken several steps to \nstrengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \n(NICS), which is used to run background checks on those who buy guns \nfrom federally licensed gun dealers to make sure they are not \nprohibited by law from owning a firearm. For example:\n  The President directed federal agencies to make all relevant records, \nincluding criminal history records and information related to persons \nprohibited from having guns for mental health reasons, available to the \nfederal background check system. This effort is beginning to bear \nfruit. In the first nine months after the President's directive, \nfederal agencies have made available to the NICS over 1.2 million \nadditional records identifying persons prohibited from possessing \nfirearms, nearly a 23 percent increase from the number of records \nfederal agencies had made available by the end of January.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H21-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H21]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNIVERSARY OF THE TIONESTA DAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of the 75th anniversary of the Tionesta Dam, located in \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, in Forest County.\n  This vital flood control project is estimated to have prevented more \nthan $570 million in flood damage over the past seven decades. The \nTionesta Dam, located in Forest County, was officially dedicated on \nJanuary 9, 1941, as a result of the Flood Control Act of 1936 and 1938. \nThe dam itself is located on the Tionesta Creek just over one mile from \nthe Allegheny River. It is key to flood protection along the Allegheny \nand upper Ohio Rivers.\n  Mr. Speaker, this dam is so important that during the 1972 Tropical \nStorm Agnes, which caused damage all across the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, it is estimated to have prevented more than $60 million \nin additional damages.\n  Today, the dam and the lake it created serves purposes beyond flood \nprotection. Tionesta Lake and the area around it amount to more than \n3,000 acres available for camping, hiking, fishing, and hunting. The \nlake itself is a hotspot for boating, water skiing, and other \nactivities for families each summer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the Army Corps of Engineers for their \nyears of work at the Tionesta Dam, and I wish the Park Rangers and \nstaff the best for the future.\n\n\n             Saving Trees in the Allegheny National Forest\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of efforts by the Allegheny National Forest, located in \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, in addressing invasive \ninsects which are threatening the forest's ash, beech, and hemlock \ntrees.\n  Invasive species are a major concern for national forests across the \nUnited States, with the emerald ash borer decimating white ash, the \nwooly adelgid affecting Pennsylvania's State tree, which is the eastern \nhemlock, and the beech bark beetle killing American beech trees.\n  In some areas in the Allegheny National Forest, steps are being taken \nto proactively manage and treat trees. Over the summer, I met with the \nlocal forest service and helped apply a wooly adelgid treatment to \neastern hemlock trees. In other areas of the forest, the best approach \nis to harvest these trees while they still have value.\n  That is what is proposed across 4,000 acres in the forest, which \nincludes high percentages of these tree species. The harvesting project \nitself will spread across the forest's four counties, adding up to a \ntotal scope of more than 100,000 acres.\n  I appreciate the approach of the Allegheny National Forest's \npersonnel, their hard work, their dedication, and their continuation to \nadvocate for such proactive management practices.\n  Now, I will continue to do what I can in the House and as chairman of \nthe House Agriculture Subcommittee for Conservation and Forestry to \nhelp our national forests address these invasive species, which \nthreaten both the health of the forest and the timber resources which \nhelped build this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H21-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H21-H22]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REVEREND CHRIS HADGIGEORGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Ms. Kaptur) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional\n\n[[Page H22]]\n\nAmerican and extraordinary human being who led with quiet strength, the \nReverend Chris Hadgigeorge of Toledo, Ohio, who was laid to rest this \nweek.\n  Father Hadgigeorge served the Toledo community so wisely and so \ngenerously for over a half a century, anchoring his service at Holy \nTrinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral, which he helped to elevate from a \nchurch to a cathedral during his service. He was 91. What an incredible \nlife.\n  Surviving are his beautiful wife, Presvytera Ann Hadgigeorge, who he \nmarried in 1948; daughters Pattie Senerius and Angie Bohland; son, \nWilliam; sister, Presvytera Zafera Bartz; six grandchildren, and two \ngreat-granddaughters. He worshipped them all.\n  He was born in Youngstown, Ohio, to immigrants from the Greek island \nof Samos. When he was growing up, he served as an altar boy. When the \nfamily went visiting with friends, children asked what he would like to \nplay and he said: ``I would like to play church.'' So Father Chris \nwould be the priest. As he said in a Blade interview back in 1998, he \nwould marry his brother to one of the girls, and he would have a bag of \nmarbles that he would use as his censer.\n  Father Hadgigeorge attended Holy Cross, a school of Greek orthodox \ntheology in New England, and was ordained in 1948. He served as pastor \nin a broad range of communities, including Indianapolis and Detroit, \nbefore arriving in Toledo. How lucky we have been.\n  He served as pastor starting in 1960 and pastor emeritus after 1991, \nand he has been a leader for more than half of the North Toledo \nlandmark church's existence. As I mentioned, it is now a cathedral due \nto his efforts.\n  He had such an influence beyond the congregation he so dutifully \nserved. The pastor recognized the changing needs, not only of the \ncongregation, but of the community, as he saw his own congregation \ntransition from U.S.-born members whose forebears arrived decades ago \nto more recent Greek and Cypriot immigrants. As his son said: ``I \nalways called him a peacemaker.''\n  He served as a board member of the Toledo Council of Churches and was \nactive in the International Institute, building goodwill with every \nstep and every word he uttered. He raised his article of faith far \nbeyond the congregants of his own cathedral.\n  He planted his congregations's commitment in the heart of Toledo and \nmaintained it there at a time when it was really needed, before the \ncommunity had transitioned to the new century when it was struggling. \nHe led his community to oversee renovations to the church building as \nit was elevated to a cathedral, including the construction of a \nbeautiful educational center and the purchase of surrounding property, \nwhile supporting the parish leaders' decisions to stay put and not \nmove, not suburbanize. He felt that that congregation should control \nits own destiny and to grow where it was planted.\n  Father Chris was enthusiastic when the parishioners decided to throw \na festival in 1971. The Holy Trinity's Greek festival has become an \nannual affair in our region, bringing people back to the city and being \nso much a part of the revitalization of Toledo long before it was \npopular. He was a true leader. He was such a leader for us.\n  ``There are many generations who knew Father Chris,'' said the \nReverend Larry Legakis, who became Holy Trinity's pastor in July 2014. \nReverend Legakis said: ``For some of the people in their eighties, they \nremember working side by side'' with Father Hadgigeorge. ``Some see him \nas a father and a grandfather. And he was with us for so long, others \nsee him as a great-grandfather.'' Personally, this Congresswoman sees \nhim as a friend.\n  Our community is forever indebted to him, and the Greek American \ncommunity he shepherded is an essential building block of the city of \nToledo. We would be so much less without having their faith-filled \ncommitment.\n  May his family draw strength from his beautiful life and from the \nlessons that he taught us and from the city that he loved and the \ncathedral to which he gave his life. May his family be blessed and may \nhe rest in peace.\n  I would like to place in the Record as well the obituary that was \nprinted in the Toledo Blade this week.\n\n                     [From The Blade, Jan. 3, 2016]\n\n The Rev. Chris Hadgigeorge (1924-2015): Orthodox Priest Unified Greek \n                           Community, Parish\n\n                 (By Mark Zaborney, Blade Staff Writer)\n\n       The Rev. Chris Hadgigeorge, a leader of what is now Holy \n     Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral, as pastor and pastor \n     emeritus, for more than half the North Toledo landmark's \n     existence, died Thursday in his Sylvania Township home. He \n     was 91.\n       He died in his sleep, his son William said. The cause was \n     not immediately known. He had surgery recently to replace a \n     heart valve and put in a pacemaker, but he did not appear ill \n     and took part in liturgies at Holy Trinity for much of \n     December.\n       The Holy Trinity community was organized in June, 1915, and \n     has worshiped at its distinctive home on Superior Street \n     north of downtown since 1919. Father Chris arrived as pastor \n     in 1960.\n       ``There are many generations who knew Father Chris,'' said \n     the Rev. Larry Legakis, who became Holy Trinity pastor in \n     July, 2014. ``For some of the people in their 80s, they \n     remember working side by side. Some see him as a father and a \n     grandfather, and he was with us for so long, others see him \n     as a great-grandfather.''\n       Holy Trinity was consecrated as a cathedral in 1966, \n     ``because of his leadership,'' said George Sarantou, a former \n     parish council president.\n       Father Chris oversaw renovations to the building and the \n     educational center and the purchase of surrounding property \n     while supporting parish leaders' decision to stay put.\n       ``He felt we should control our own destiny,'' said Mr. \n     Sarantou, Toledo finance director and a former member of the \n     city council. ``He was a good solid leader who understood \n     what our needs should be. He got the job done with his quiet \n     but effective leadership. He knew how to motivate people.''\n       Father Chris was enthusiastic when the parish threw a \n     festival in 1971, and Holy Trinity's Greek festival has \n     become an annual affair.\n       ``He loved the city and the community. It was home,'' his \n     son said.\n       The pastor recognized the changing needs of the \n     congregation, from the U.S.-born members whose forebears \n     arrived decades ago to more recent Greek and Cypriot \n     immigrants.\n       ``He was a great unifier in the Greek community. He could \n     work with all groups, young and old,'' Mr. Sarantou said.\n       His son said: ``I always called him a peacemaker.''\n       ``I'm speaking as a son now,'' William Hadgigeorge said. \n     ``He would never lecture me about God's way. It was always \n     the right way; do the right thing, even when others aren't \n     looking.''\n       Father Chris retired as Holy Trinity pastor in 1991. \n     Afterward, he was interim pastor of a Springfield, Ohio, \n     church for several months but stayed in Toledo.\n       He was named a protopresbyter in the church by Archbishop \n     Iakovos in 1973, and received the patriarchal cross from \n     Patriarch Bartholomew in 2006.\n       Father Chris was born Aug. 3, 1924, in Youngstown, to \n     Paraskevi and William Hadgigeorge, immigrants from the Greek \n     island of Samos. He was an altar boy growing up and sang in \n     the choir. When the family went visiting and friends' \n     children asked what he'd like to play, ``I'd say, `Let's play \n     church,' '' Father Chris told The Blade in 1998. ``And I \n     would be the priest. I would marry my brother to one of the \n     girls. I would have a bag of marbles that I used as my \n     censer.''\n       He was a 1942 graduate of Youngstown's East High School. He \n     went to Holy Cross, a school of Greek Orthodox theology in \n     New England and was ordained in 1948. He was a pastor in \n     Indianapolis and Detroit before arriving in Toledo.\n       He'd been a board member of the Toledo Council of Churches \n     and was active in the International Institute.\n       Surviving are his wife, Presvytera Ann Hadgigeorge, whom he \n     married March 7, 1948; daughters, Pattie Senerius and Angie \n     Bohland; son, William; sister, Presvytera Zafera Bartz; six \n     grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.\n       Visitation will be from 1-9 p.m. Monday in Holy Trinity \n     Greek Orthodox Cathedral, with Trisagion prayers at 7 p.m. A \n     vesperal liturgy at 9 a.m. Tuesday will be followed by \n     funeral services at 11 a.m. in the cathedral.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, with the recent \nannouncement of new policies to restrict firearms, President Obama has \nyet again used executive overreach to force his agenda on the American \npeople. Congress has already rejected these policies in a bipartisan \nfashion, and this action is another example of the President \noverstepping his constitutional authority to circumvent the people's \nvoices in Congress. The administration's assault on Americans' \nconstitutional rights must stop.\n  Time and time again, our courts have defended the Second Amendment, \nand\n\n[[Page H23]]\n\nCongress has voted repeatedly to reject new restrictions on our \nconstitutional rights. For more than 200 years, the Second Amendment \nhas been protected and championed by Americans, the courts, and \nCongress. We must stand together to defend and protect our \nconstitutional rights. As a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment, \nI am outraged by President Obama's actions and will fight to stop this \nexecutive order.\n  In my home State of West Virginia, using guns for sport and hunting \nis a way of life. We respect firearms and are taught at an early age \nhow to use them. In many families, fathers and mothers teach their \nchildren how to hunt and, when they are old enough, they receive their \nown gun as an important coming-of-age tradition. West Virginians are \nnot alone. Families across this country have these same traditions and \nsports.\n  As West Virginians, we know that law-abiding citizens are not the \nproblem and our country was not founded on the principles of taking \naway rights from the people. Our rights cannot and should not be taken \naway. This administration is determined to attack our way of life, our \ntraditions, and our constitutional rights. I wish I could say this is a \nsurprise, but time and time again, this President has used executive \nactions and regulations to eliminate policies and rights he disagrees \nwith.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Sadly, we have seen this far too often with the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the EPA, which has aggressively--aggressively--used \nregulations and rules to destroy our coal-mining communities, in \nparticular, in my State of West Virginia.\n  I have fought to stop the EPA and will fight to stop President \nObama's executive actions on gun control. As a member of the House \nCommittee on Appropriations, I will use the power of the purse to \neliminate funding for these new actions. As a Member of Congress, I am \ndedicated to working for our State and doing what is right for the \npeople of West Virginia. I will continue to support our constitutional \nrights, including the Second Amendment, and push back on the \nadministration's overreach into our lives, businesses, and communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H23-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING OUR FRIEND RICHARD SMITH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Farr) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a good friend, Richard Smith.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FARR. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DENHAM. I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr), my good \nfriend, as we both recognize an amazing life of a good friend and \nacknowledge and honor the life of this personal friend and beloved \ncommunity leader, Rich Smith.\n  He was a loving husband, father, and grandfather, who passed away \npeacefully in the comforts of his home, surrounded by his family, on \nDecember 27, 2015.\n  Born on December 19, 1946, Rich was raised in Walnut Creek, \nCalifornia. Growing up, Rich's family was involved in 4-H, and \nagriculture had always played a major role in his life. Rich continued \ndown this path by obtaining a bachelor of science degree in ag science \nand management from the University of California, Davis in 1968.\n  Originally, Rich was interested in the technical aspects of \nagriculture. He worked in a lab performing analysis on soil, water, and \nplant nutrition. Never did Rich believe he would be the owner of a \nsuccessful wine company, but in 1987, this became a reality when he and \nhis new bride, Claudia, purchased the vineyard known as Paraiso \nVineyards.\n  Today Paraiso Vineyards is owned and operated by the Smith family and \nis located in the Santa Lucia Highlands in Monterey County. The family \nbusiness consists of almost 3,000 acres of vineyards and continues to \nevolve in all aspects. Rich leaves behind a tremendous legacy that can \nbe celebrated and appreciated by everyone who visits this magnificent \nvineyard.\n  Rich had a generous spirit and provided lasting contributions to the \ncommunity. He was a local hero to the Salinas Valley, and he \ndemonstrated time and again a desire to share his resources and talents \nwith others.\n  I was one of those whom he shared his talents with as he encouraged, \nsupported, and advised me to run for political office. Rich's motto \nalways was: Treat people the way that you want to be treated. All that \nwere lucky enough to spend time with him found that he truly lived by \nthese words. Rich will forever be remembered for his kindness, \ngenerosity, leadership, and love.\n  On kindness and generosity, he and Claudia were kind enough and \ngenerous enough to host, 23 years ago, then my fiance, now my wife, \nSonia, and our wedding at the beautiful Paraiso Springs.\n  On leadership and love, as I was in the State senate, Rich provided \nleadership for not only the State of California, but the Salinas \nValley, the wine industry, creating a wine mecca, pioneering Monterey \nCounty to be a leader in wine production as well as a new tourism \ncorridor.\n  His love for family and his community was unmatched. He is a friend \nthat is going to be forever missed. Not only was he a leader, a very \nkind man, a very generous man, but he had a tremendous sense of humor. \nI will never forget soon after our marriage, his daughter, Sonia's best \nfriend, was being married at Paraiso Springs as well, and a funny \nepisode happened where Sonia passed out in the middle of the wedding. \nRich seized the moment to rib me a little bit and my new mother-in-law. \nHe made it clear that he thought that Sonia may be pregnant on that \nday. It was a funny gesture that, as a young man, made me a little \nnervous at the time, but he will always be a friend and sorely missed.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, we both got to know Rich through politics. It \nis amazing that he was a person who supported us both: Jeff being a \nRepublican, myself being a Democrat; Jeff being in the State \nlegislature, I being in the State legislature.\n  I got to know him when I was a county supervisor in Monterey County. \nRich was always the go-to guy to really do sort of the technical issues \nthat you drill down deep on a lot of controversial agricultural issues. \nHis ideas were always based on good science, good farming practices, \nalways sort of the idea of conservation in the best sense of the word.\n  He also was participatory in my daughter's wedding because the wines \nwe served at that wedding were from Rich's vineyards. In fact, I \nbrought a bottle of his wine today here on the floor to show the world \nthat this man did some great things. His wines were served also at \nmany, many charitable events that they did at their vineyards.\n  He and Claudia were kind of leaders. Claudia was very interested in \ngetting the whole ecotourism, agritourism involved to get people out \ninto seeing how agriculture is really produced, and wine visits are \nobviously a good way of attracting people, but the knowledge of it.\n  We are going to really miss him. He was a great person, and I am glad \nthat we are able to create a national park right across from his \nvineyard so he can always stare at it.\n  Got bless Richard Smith and the great wines he made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H23-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H23-H24]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Wagner) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of life and in firm \nopposition to Planned Parenthood's unconscionable activities.\n  But as I begin my remarks, I want to be very clear about one thing. \nThe vote that the House will take today is a victory for women's health \nwhile also serving as a cry to end the monstrous actions of an \norganization that continually attacks our most vulnerable unborn \nchildren.\n  There are more than 13,500 publicly supported alternatives for \nwomen's health care in the country and 588 in Missouri--alternatives \nthat treat women without performing abortions, alternatives that will \nhave more access to Federal money for women's health care. This means \nthat in Missouri alone, there are 45 health clinics for every Planned \nParenthood clinic in the\n\n[[Page H24]]\n\nState. So, please, please don't be distracted by political rhetoric.\n  We are strengthening our support for women's health, and we are \nstripping Federal taxpayer dollars from an organization that performs \nmore than 327,000 abortions a year.\n  While I have long fought to stop this atrocious practice, I was \nespecially shocked this summer by videos of Planned Parenthood's cold \nindifference and barbaric murder of the society's most vulnerable \nmembers.\n  It is our duty as lawmakers, as citizens of a great nation, as \nfriends, as neighbors, as family members to protect those who cannot \nprotect themselves. It is a tragic shame to watch employees of Planned \nParenthood so willing to sell the body parts of unborn babies.\n  These are truly some of the most horrifying and heartbreaking videos \nI have ever seen, even throughout all my work in combating sex \ntrafficking, sexual assault, and abuse.\n  The United States is a nation that seeks to protect the least among \nus in numerous ways, from medical research assistance for the needy to \nelderly care. It is time that we do the same for our precious unborn \nchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, today is an historic day when we will finally stop \ntaxpayer dollars from funding Planned Parenthood's abortions. Surely, \nno Member of Congress can, in good conscience, claim that we should \nfund these heinous activities with your hard-earned dollars.\n  After seeing these horrible videos, I was compelled to take action. I \njoined Congressman Sean Duffy and Congressman Chris Smith in sending a \nletter to Chairmen Upton and Goodlatte, requesting an immediate \ninvestigation into Planned Parenthood's actions. I would like to thank \nHouse leadership and the committee chairmen for granting our request \nand for the work that they have done on their committees already.\n  Planned Parenthood has shamelessly tried to defend the indefensible \nbefore these committees. They have shown no remorse for the actions \ndescribed in these videos, apologizing only for the tone of them. In \nresponse, they have effectively dared Congress to act. And today we do.\n  Today Congress says enough is enough. Today we pass legislation that \nwill give the President a very stark choice: continue paying for acts \nthat are so disturbing, so horrifying, and so disgusting that they \nrequire congressional investigation, or simply respect life and respect \nthe taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, the heart of my team's mission statement, which \ncurrently hangs in my office, reads: To confront injustice and serve as \na voice for the most vulnerable in our society.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood is the right thing to do. Today I will \ngive voice to the voiceless. I will proudly cast my vote for life, for \nthese innocent angels. I will continue to fight for the day when \nabortion is not only illegal, but is unthinkable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H24-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H24]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President of the United \nStates announced another series of actions that his administration is \ntaking to curb our Nation's gun violence epidemic, for they are \nimportant steps, and I commend the President and Vice President for \ntheir continued focus on this ongoing crisis. As the President said \nyesterday, Congress still needs to act.\n  In my 15 years as a Member of the House, Congress time and again has\n\n[[Page H25]]\n\nfailed to answer the cries of Americans who have lost their loved ones, \nparticularly our children, to the scourge of gun violence.\n  Congress has failed to respond to the pleas of Americans who have \nbeen disabled by stray bullets. Congress has failed to acknowledge the \nvast majority of Americans--Republicans and Democrats, gun owners and \nnon gun owners--who believe that every gun purchased should be \naccompanied by a background check. With each failure, we are closer to \na day when tragedies like those of San Bernardino and Sandy Hook will \nbecome what they never should be: commonplace.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to find the courage to take action. \nIt is long past overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H25-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS RESTRICT SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, as citizens of the United States, we are \nafforded basic rights and privileges under the Constitution. One of \nthese fundamental rights is the Second Amendment, and its guarantee to \nkeep and bear arms is clear.\n  Yesterday, in yet another attempt to erode our basic liberties, \nPresident Obama announced plans to undermine the will of Congress and \nchallenge the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.\n  Just like his unilateral actions on immigration, this proposal is an \noverreach of the President's constitutionally granted executive \nauthority. Congressional refusal to pass bad policy does not transfer \nlegislative authority to the President, and I will fight against this \nattempt to diminish our constitutional rights.\n  Guns are one of many tools that people use to commit horrific crimes, \nbut the problem of evil cannot be legislated away. It is important that \nany legislative response, whether it is at the Federal, State, or local \nlevel, ensures that the constitutional rights of all citizens are \nprotected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H25-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  GUNS\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, last year more than 13,000 Americans lost \ntheir lives because of a gun. More than 3,300 children were killed or \ninjured. As the President said yesterday, the question of whether we \naddress gun violence is really a question about who we are and what \nkind of country we want to live in.\n  Do we want to be a country in which we have a mass shooting nearly \nevery single day of the year? Do we want to be a country in which \nchildren in a school have to practice hiding silently under their desks \nor in a closet in order to avoid an active shooter? Do we want to be a \ncountry in which the National Rifle Association buys influence and \ndrowns out the voices of concerned citizens? Do we want to be a country \nin which all Congress does after a mass shooting is hold another moment \nof silence instead of addressing the problem?\n  That is the country we live in today, a country in which gun violence \nthreatens lives every day, a country in which we are growing accustomed \nto atrocities that just don't happen as often in other developed \ncountries.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can do better. The President has done his job. Now it \nis time for Congress to do its job.\n  Let's pass universal background checks. Let's do more to keep guns \nfrom criminals and from those with serious mental illness, such that \npossessing a gun would pose a threat to themselves or others. Let's get \nmilitary-style assault weapons out of our communities.

The Royer-\nGreaves School for Blind has been a staple in the Paoli community since \n1941, and for nearly a century it has provided quality care and \nassistance to individuals who are visually impaired.\n  Viola coined her work as an ``experience of a lifetime,'' \nparticularly the privilege of having worked directly with Dr. Royer-\nGreaves.\n  For 70 years, Viola ensured that the school operated smoothly, \nenabling it to work toward its mission of ``providing a supportive \neducation and training environment for students with multiple \ndisabilities to help them reach their full potential and enjoy an \nenhanced quality of life.''\n  In 2009, her service to the school and community was honored with \naccolades, including the Jessie Royer-Greaves award.\n  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate and thank Viola for her dedicated service \nto the Royer-Greaves School for Blind.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a survivor, a \nleader, and a compassionate woman who dedicated her life to making the \nPinellas County community and the State of Florida safer. Mr. Speaker, \nI rise today to honor the life of Linda Osmundson, who passed away this \nMonday at the age of 66.\n  A longtime activist against domestic violence and a survivor herself, \nLinda was best known as the director of Community Action Stops Abuse, \nor CASA, in St. Petersburg, Florida. Linda served as head of CASA for \n26 years before retiring this past summer. Before that, she guided \nprograms in both Gainesville and West Palm Beach. Under Linda's \nleadership, CASA grew from a staff of 7 working out of a small home to \nover 80 employees with a 100-bed facility.\n  Linda started a first-of-its-kind substance abuse program for \nvictims. In addition, she worked with law enforcement, who are now \nproperly trained on dealing with domestic violence. She cofounded a \nprogram to secure pardons for victims of domestic violence convicted \nfor defending themselves.

Mr. Speaker, well, it may be a new year, but the \nRepublicans are celebrating with the same old extreme attacks on \nwomen's health care and trying to take away health insurance from \nhardworking American families.\n  It is a shame that the House Republican leadership has chosen to \nspend the first week of 2016 attacking Planned Parenthood and \ndismantling those important benefits to 22 million Americans.\n  The bill that we will vote on today will defund Planned Parenthood \nand the important family planning services that they provide, including \nlifesaving cancer screenings for millions of women across this country. \nThis bill would dismantle affordable health care for millions of more \nworkers, for families, for students.\n  Instead of wasting time on a radical bill which, quite frankly, some \non the other side have acknowledged will not become law, we ought to be \nfocusing on the questions that the American people sent us here to work \non--on getting our economy moving, putting Americans back to work, and \nrebuilding our infrastructure. That is the challenge that we face, and \nwe ought not politicize women's health care in order to pander to the \nextreme voices on the right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H26-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAILED POLICIES, EMPTY RHETORIC\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.

Mr. Speaker, this past week in Harris County, Texas, \nwe lost a giant of a man in the name of Commissioner El Franco Lee, who \nserved the Harris County Commissioners Court and the people he loved \nfor 30 years.\n  One could never describe Commissioner Lee as a typical politician. As \nhe walked through his district, I truly believe his giant footsteps \ntouched everyone and everyone's heart. He was a lover of seniors and \ncreated opportunities for them to enjoy their life and swim in a \nfantastic pool at the Hester House. More importantly, he coddled and \nnurtured and created the Lyndon Baines Johnson Hospital that has served \nso many from all over the county and State. The Baylor Teen Clinic \ncalled him a guardian angel, providing healthcare services for \nvulnerable teens.\n  And, yes, he believed in something called the Olympics, not around \nthe world, but right in Harris County; 10,000 children during the \nsummer would have the opportunity to test their athletic prowess. And \nhe was an athlete as well.\n  He was a friend of Mickey Leland and Craig Washington. More \nimportantly, his beautiful family, wife, and children lived in his \nbeloved community, Fifth Ward. He was a friend of the community.\n  He did so much as a county commissioner. He left behind wonderful \nparks and the opportunity for trails. He was a man in our community who \nknew about flooding. He was a strong, strong proponent of making sure \nthat the infrastructure in Precinct 1 was the kind that would give a \nbetter quality of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I close on this wonderful public servant, let me say \nmay he rest in peace, working until his tragic death, and offering to \nthe people who were left behind our praise for him. May he rest in \npeace.\n  Thank you, Commissioner El Franco Lee, for being the giant of a man \nwho reached low and touched all, loved us all, and brought us to a day \nin Harris County where we can be so proud of all that you have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H27-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IF TODAY WERE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LAST NATIONAL SECURITY BRIEFING\n\n  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. TROTT.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong \nopposition to the Senate amended Budget Reconciliation Act, a bill with \nseveral extreme provisions, including the repeal of the core of the \nAffordable Care Act for the 62nd time and the revoking of Federal \nfunding for Planned Parenthood for the 11th time in this Congress.\n  It is a new year, but instead of bringing legislation to the floor \nthat helps and makes Americans healthier, safer, and more secure, we \nare repeating the same old partisan fights.\n  Last year, many of my colleagues took advantage of a political stunt \nby an antichoice group that released falsified videos to damage the \ncredibility of Planned Parenthood. There were congressional hearings, \nState-level investigations, and even a select committee formed to \ninvestigate the organization. The inquiries have resulted in no \nevidence of wrongdoing and have been a waste of taxpayers' money.\n  There are 2.7 million women in America who rely on Planned Parenthood \nfor their basic healthcare services that they otherwise cannot afford \nand cannot access. There is no replacement for Planned Parenthood in \nmany parts of the country, so taking away its Federal funds needlessly \nrisks the health of millions of American women.\n  The CBO estimates that dismantling the Affordable Care Act will cause \n22 million Americans to lose their health care. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3762.\n  Thank you, Peggy Sampson, for your dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H27-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROMOTING CHARITABLE GIVING\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, one of our country's most treasured values \nis helping others who are less fortunate. We see it all the time in \ncommunities around the Nation, with Americans raising money for a \nworthy cause, donating food, or volunteering their time to help their \nneighbors.\n  It is important that our Tax Code reflect these exact same values. It \nwas gratifying last month to see Congress come together passing a new \nlaw that will promote charitable giving. One of the charitable \nprovisions in the new law was a bill that I authored. It makes \npermanent a provision to allow a rollover donation from an individual's \nIRA to go to an approved charitable foundation.\n  In addition, the new law will encourage the donation of food to food \nbanks from local businesses as well as promote environmental \nconservation through the granting of land easements.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are many Americans who want to give back and help \nothers, and it is important that our Tax Code reflect these same values \nand doesn't punish them for wanting to do so.

One individual wrote to me and summed it up \nthis way: ``Mr. Bishop, the Affordable Care Act is anything but.'' He \nexplained that his family of four went from an overall $5,000 \ndeductible to having the same deductible per family member in addition \nto having his premium doubled. ``Where is the affordability?'' he \nasked.\n  Another small-business owner from the small town of Fowlerville in my \ndistrict called the other month to say that her rates for her family \nhad more than doubled in just the past 2 years.\n  I could go on, but we know the story all too well.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 3762, \nthe Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. \nIt really does just the opposite.\n  Not only does this bill represent Republicans' 62nd attempt to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act, but it is yet another ideological attack on \nwomen's health care. It would defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year, \npreventing millions of women from accessing critical healthcare \nservices, such as cancer and STI screenings and contraceptive care.\n  In 2013 alone, Planned Parenthood provided healthcare services to \nmore than 800,000 Californians and provided more than 93,000 pap tests \nand 97,000 breast screening exams.\n  Although Planned Parenthood centers make up only 10 percent of all \npublicly funded family planning centers, they serve, mind you, 36 \npercent of clients who obtain care from the family planning center \nnetwork.\n  Denying access to healthcare providers such as Planned Parenthood \nwill harm the communities that need these services the most, including \nlow-income women and women of color.\n  Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon will mark the 11th vote \nto attack women's health care this Congress. It is past time for \nRepublicans to end their attacks on Planned Parenthood and recognize \nthat they are really harming women by denying them these badly needed \nhealthcare services.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote ``no'' on H.R. 3762 and really begin \nto look at what they are doing in terms of the freedom of women to make \ntheir own decisions and to really access the vital healthcare services \nthat they need.\n  Again, this reconciliation act does nothing to reconcile healthcare \nservices, which women desperately need in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H28-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOUSING UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN\n\n  (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. CRAMER.

Six bases are under consideration to house up to 5,000 of these \nundocumented children. One of the bases under consideration is Grand \nForks Air Force Base in North Dakota.\n  Mr. Speaker, I cannot stress strongly enough my opposition to this \nplan. The reasons are numerous, but let me emphasize two of the most \nobvious: military bases are not appropriate for housing unaccompanied \nchildren, and unaccompanied children are not appropriate residents of a \nmilitary base.\n  The last Congress clearly expressed our opposition to housing \nunoccupied minors at military installations through the passage of H.R. \n5230. Additionally, funding sufficient to meet the needs at the \nsouthern border was provided just a few weeks ago in the passage of the \nfiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is neither compassionate to the children, nor in the \ncountry's best interests for national defense, to house these children \nat Grand Forks or any other military installation.

Mr. Speaker, time and again this President has noted \nthat we can't change the law without action from Congress. Despite his \nclaimed familiarity with the separation of powers, this week we see the \nPresident again trying to go around Congress to enact already-known \nantigun policies that have already been considered and rejected in the \nSenate.\n  The President's plan ignores what any honest observer already knows: \nlimiting the rights of law-abiding Americans doesn't deter criminals \nand terrorists from breaking our laws.\n  Forcing Americans to jump through more hoops and spend more money to \nexercise their Second Amendment rights will, at best, have zero effect \non public safety and, at worst, embolden those who already disregard \nour laws.\n  Finally, let's look at what the President's proposal boils down to. \nMore Americans would have to pay more to the Federal Government in fees \nto exercise their constitutional rights. Enforcement of current laws \ncould have a much better effect on that, yet we see very few red flags \nthat are put up by people trying to legally purchase guns that are \nalready felons. More investigations would be held and more people \nprosecuted if those laws were enforced, yet our attorneys general at \nthe State level and Federal level don't follow up on those red flags.\n  We have plenty of laws on the books that are not enforced. We don't \nneed more. We certainly don't need executive orders that the President \nis illegally putting across behind closed doors, which has been \nemblematic of what the entire Obama administration has been doing for \nthe last several years to our constitutional rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H29-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H29]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REHASHING OLD, TOXIC ATTACKS\n\n  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, here we are, the very first day back for the \nHouse of Representatives in 2016, and already the House Republicans are \nrehashing old, toxic attacks on women's access to health care and on \nworking families.\n  Here in 2016 we were hoping to see a House of Representatives that \nwould look forward, forward to reducing the cost of health care for all \nAmericans and to helping pass the bill that would require pay equity \nfor women. Instead, under the guise of this reconciliation bill, a \ntechnical term that is coming before the body this week, this \nRepublican bill would defund Planned Parenthood, strip away affordable \nfamily planning and lifesaving cancer screenings for millions of \nAmerican women across the country. It would dismantle the Affordable \nCare Act. In fact, it is the 62nd vote from this body to repeal that \nact.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the \nRepublican bill before this body this week would take healthcare \ncoverage away from 22 million Americans next year alone. That is not \nright for the country, it is not right for women, and it is not right \nfor this body. Let's move forward with a pro-woman agenda, a pro-\nhealthcare agenda, rather than the same toxic bills that they have \ntried and failed to pass over 62 times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H29-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H29]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IT IS TIME TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE\n\n  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, in 2010, Congress silenced the voices of a \nmajority of hardworking Americans and ran roughshod over the House \nminority and jammed a bill through Congress that would put a wet \nblanket of mandates, regulations, taxes, and penalties on patients, \ndoctors, hospitals, and small businesses, driving up the cost of \ninsurance and health care for most Americans. Longer lines, less \naccess, less innovation, and higher costs have been the hallmark of \nthis bloated bureaucratic nightmare.\n  Today the House will give voice to those who had this law and its \nexpense thrust upon them. It is time to repeal and replace ObamaCare \nand move forward in a bipartisan fashion, passing legislation that will \nput patients back in control of their healthcare decisions, focus on \ncompetition and quality of care, reform our tort litigation system, and \ninvest in innovation and research at the NIH, curing diseases, and \nreducing healthcare costs.\n  The House will also defund organizations that engage in the horrific \nand sad process of dissecting and harvesting aborted baby organs and \nreinvest that money in organizations that are truly focused on women's \nhealth care.\n  Mr. Speaker, by placing this bill on the President's desk, we have \ngiven voice to the defenseless, and we have focused on a better future \nof health care for every American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H29-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H29-H37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 712, SUNSHINE FOR REGULATORY \nDECREES AND SETTLEMENTS ACT OF 2015, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF \nH.R. 1155, SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY \n                         BURDENSOME ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

The gentleman from \nGeorgia is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nPolis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on House Resolution 580, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this \nstructured rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee.\n  This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1155, the Searching for \nand Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2016, \nor the SCRUB Act. This is a bipartisan measure that provides a fair and \nreasonable way to find and repeal outdated and inefficient regulations \nthat are still on the books.\n  It doesn't target any particular type of regulation or industry, but \nit prioritizes older, expensive rules that are ripe for improvement or \nmay no longer be necessary.\n  The needs of our economy, small businesses, and American families \naren't the same today as they were 15 or 20 years ago. Thus, we should \nensure that the rules governing the way we live and work reflect what \nis best for our country today, not what agencies thought best decades \nago.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri for introducing this bipartisan \nsolution and his staff for their hard work on this measure.\n  If you put a piece of paper in the hand of every single person who \nlives in my hometown of Gainesville, Georgia, it still wouldn't equal \nthe number of pages in the 2015 Federal Register. In fact, it comes in \nat a record-setting 82,036 pages. That means there were over 82,000 \npages of new rules and regulations proposed just last year.\n  The Code of Federal Regulations is 235 volumes long, containing \n175,000 pages of Federal regulations. Knowing this, it should come as \nno surprise that Federal regulations impose an estimated burden of \n$1.86 trillion. That is roughly $15,000 per U.S. household and is \nhigher than combined individual and corporate Federal income taxes.\n  It is difficult to imagine a scenario where there is nothing in those \nthousands upon thousands of pages that can't be improved, streamlined, \nor retired. Unfortunately, American businesses and families bear the \nburden of compliance, even when a regulation is outdated, ineffective, \nor just plain unnecessary. The SCRUB Act is a commonsense step toward \nreducing unnecessary costs for families and businesses, leading to more \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  If you walked into a grocery store and found hundreds of expired and \nmoldy food on the shelves, you would be shocked. You would be even more \nhorrified if you were forced to purchase and eat them.\n  In the same way, my constituents in northeast Georgia and men and \nwomen all across this Nation are appalled that we don't have an \nexisting process in place to clear duplicative, unnecessary, or \nineffective regulations off the pages of the Code of Federal \nRegulations.\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 712, \nthe Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015. This \nlegislative package contains the text of H.R. 712 in title 1; H.R. \n1759, the ALERT Act, in title II; and H.R. 690, Providing \nAccountability Through Transparency Act of 2015, in title III. Each of \nthese measures were considered and marked up by the Judiciary Committee \nand are brought to the floor as reported by the committee.\n  America's small businesses and job creators need relief from the \nflood of new regulations and red tape from Washington. Small business \nowners often cite government regulations as the single most important \nproblem they face today.\n  A heavy contributor to the burden of new regulation is the use of \nconsent decrees and settlement agreements to bind Federal agencies to \nissue new rules. Regulators often cooperate with pro-regulatory \norganizations to advance their mutual agendas in this way.\n  The device agencies use is simple. An organization that wants new \nregulations alleges that an agency has violated a duty to declare new \nrules. The agency and the plaintiff work out a deal under the cover of \nlitigation. The deal puts the agency under judicially backed deadlines \nto issue the rules.\n  These deadlines often give the public little opportunity to comment \non proposed rules and the White House limited ability to review them. \nDeals can even require agencies to propose specific regulatory language \nnegotiated by the agency and its regulation-friendly plaintiff.\n  Those who will be regulated by the new deal typically do not know \nabout these deals until the plaintiffs' complaints and the proposed \ndecrees or settlements are filed in court. By then, it is too late. \nFrankly, it is just also unfair.\n  Regulated businesses and individuals are unlikely to be able to \nintervene in the litigation. The court usually approves the deals \nbefore regulated parties have an opportunity to affect whether new \nregulatory costs will be imposed upon them. These regulated parties \ncould be families, small businesses, farmers, ranchers, or even local \ngovernments.\n  I introduced H.R. 712 to restore transparency, public participation, \nand judicial review protections to shine a light on one of the worst \nregulatory abuses in our system today: these ``sue and settle'' \nagreements.\n  The Sunshine for Regulatory Consent Decrees and Settlements Act of \n2015 puts an end to the abuse of this practice and ensures that those \nto be regulated have a fair opportunity to participate in the \nresolution of litigation that affects them.\n  The bill respects the basic rights of plaintiffs and defendants to \nmanage litigation between them. As a result, the bill offers an \neffective and balanced remedy.\n  We must ensure more transparency and scrutiny of consent decrees and \nsettlement agreements that require new regulations. These commonsense \nreforms are needed to help control the tide of excessive and costly \nrules.\n  It is time we get rid of the welcome mat outside the door of \nregulatory agencies for these suits, under which they can more easily \nissue expensive and controversial new regulations--policies that \noftentimes could never pass Congress--claiming that ``The court made me \ndo it,'' again bypassing our constitutional system. It is not a good \nidea.\n  H.R. 712 addresses the weaknesses in the current system while \npreserving consent decrees as an important mechanism for settling legal \ndisputes. It accomplishes this by increasing participation of affected \nregulated entities and coregulators in the negotiation in \nthe consideration of decrees and settlements.\n\n  The ability of citizens to hold government accountable is an \nimportant part of administrative law, but it must be appropriately \ncarried out with transparency and full public participation.\n  Importantly, H.R. 712 puts an end to a practice that uses taxpayer \ndollars to\n\n[[Page H31]]\n\nallow special interests to abuse the system and force regulators to put \nout even more regulations.\n  Title II of H.R. 712, the ALERT Act, continues our work to relieve \nthe regulatory burden on American families by requiring agencies to \npublicly provide information on planned regulations, estimated \ncompliance costs, and other updates so that those impacted by the new \nregulations have the information they need to make financial decisions \nand plan for the future.\n  Title III of H.R. 712, the Providing Accountability Through \nTransparency Act, is another good governing measure that demonstrates \nthis body's commitment to making life better for all Americans. It \nrequires agencies to publish a brief summary of each proposed \nregulation online and in plain language.\n  Agencies do not have the right to conduct their business behind \nclosed doors and hide behind an overly complex regulatory system.\n  Every regulation impacts every American directly or indirectly, and \nagencies should be held accountable for the regulations they produce \nand how they communicate the new requirements to those who will be \nforced to abide by them.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met yesterday evening on these \nmeasures and heard testimony from the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, the chairman of \nOversight and Government Reform, and the Government Operations \nSubcommittee ranking member.\n  This combined rule makes every amendment submitted to the Rules \nCommittee in order. Seven amendments to H.R. 712 will be debated on the \nHouse floor, and 11 amendments to H.R. 1155 will be considered.\n  For H.R. 712, the rule provides 1 hour of general debate with 40 \nminutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on the Judiciary and 20 minutes \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n  For H.R. 1155, this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate \nequally divided among and controlled by the chairs and ranking minority \nmembers of the Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Oversight \nand Government Reform.\n  This rule and the underlying legislation represents regular order at \nits finest. I am proud to see the leadership of Chairman Sessions and \nSpeaker Ryan are reflected in this robust and open process.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \nthank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes.\n  Over the holidays, like all Members of this body, I was back home and \nexcited about coming back in January to legislate and move the country \nforward. I was hoping we could tackle some of the big issues of the \nday: balance a Federal budget; pass immigration reform and secure our \nborders; and, finally, deal with the contentious issue of what kind of \nauthorization of military force we want to give to the Commander in \nChief.\n  These are all important issues I was thinking about and reading about \nand hoping we would deal with when we got back here. Instead, here we \nare, our first day back in session. And I point out that most \nAmericans, of course, had to go back to work a couple of days ago. We \nhad a few days more to presumably think about what we wanted to do.\n  And here it is, another attempt to strip health care from over 22 \nmillion American families that rely on the healthcare insurance they \nhave today that this reconciliation bill would take away and another \nattempt to defund Planned Parenthood and strip family planning and \ncancer screenings away from millions of women across the country, \nsomething that ultimately would add to healthcare costs, not to mention \nthe human toll of not diagnosing cancers early, adding to the \nhealthcare costs of this country by having to deal with far too many \ncatastrophic events for what would have been preventable conditions, \nhad they only been identified earlier through access to cancer \nscreenings and family planning services at Planned Parenthood and other \nlocations.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  This bill that will be brought under one of the rules that is coming \nforward today would repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act for the \n62nd time.\n  Again, I was hoping 2016 we would start something new. Instead, I am \nseeing the same kind of bill that Republicans have brought forward in \n2011; they brought it forward in 2012; they brought it forward in 2013; \nthey brought it forward in 2014; they brought it forward in 2015; and \nhere we are, not only bringing it forward in 2016, but doing it as one \nof the very first bills in the very first week that this Congress is \nback.\n  Look, I rise in opposition to the rule and both of those underlying \nbills, H.R. 1155, which is called the Searching for and Cutting \nRegulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome, or SCRUB Act, and H.R. \n712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. These \nbills will make the American people less safe, potentially removing \nimportant safety and health regulations that are already in place for a \nreason.\n  The gentleman from Georgia says, and I agree, there certainly could \nbe unnecessary regulations on the books. Let's tackle those in a laser-\nlike fashion.\n  And if the Chief Executive won't do it, then let's do it through a \nlegislative approach that targets the authority for a specific set of \nrules that this body agrees are not necessary or are counterproductive, \nas we have done in a number of instances, and go after it, rather than \nsomehow saying that, for every rule that is added arbitrarily, another \nrule needs to be eliminated, there is some presumed magic to the amount \nof words in rules.\n  The gentleman cited, I think it was 86,000 pages. There is no ideal \namount of rules. The least amount of rules and regs that can get the \njob of keeping the American people safe done is the best, but you never \nknow what that is going to be, and maybe we should strip away 10,000 \npages of that, and maybe we need another thousand pages for some new \ntechnology and new device that could hurt people if there is not the \nright safety regulations.\n  We need an adaptive administrative structure to allow our health and \nsafety agencies to do their job so that when people buy a consumer \nproduct at the store, they have confidence it is not going to kill \nthem.\n  As a father of a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old, when I buy a toy and \nget holiday presents for our kids, I want to make sure that those \nproducts don't have lead or contaminants in them, make sure that my \nchild won't be severely damaged or hurt by the failure of our health \nand safety agencies to make sure that those products are safe.\n  That is common sense. I think that is what the American people want \nout of our health and safety regulators, and these bills would impede \ntheir ability to do that.\n  Thirteen of the 16 Democrats who sat on the Judiciary Committee \noffered dissenting views on H.R. 712, which read, in part: ``This ill-\nconceived bill imposes numerous new procedural burdens on agencies and \ncourts, intended to dissuade them from using consent decrees and \nsettlement agreements to resolve enforcement actions filed to address \nagency noncompliance with the law.''\n  Effectively, what that means is this bill would reduce the cost of \nnoncompliance with our regulations and laws. These burdens include the \nunworkable requirements that agencies solicit public comments on all \nproposed consent decrees and settlement agreements, and they respond to \nevery single public comment before submitting them to the court.\n  Now, again, that is an administrative burden that makes it impossible \nfor our eight health and safety agencies to do their job. You might get \n100,000 comments on a particular consent decree or settlement \nagreement, if somebody is ramping up what we call kind of the astroturf \nside of trying to get people to write in about a particular topic. And \nto say, somehow, that every single one of those comments has to be \nresponded to before submitting to the court is basically, not just a \npolicy that would slow down this process, but\n\n[[Page H32]]\n\nwould deter agencies from ever engaging in settlement agreements and \nconsent decrees because it would be so prohibitive, from a staff \nperspective, they would effectively be unable to do their job.\n  Like all antiregulatory proposals that have been brought forth in \nthis Congress, H.R. 712 is another solution in search of a problem. \nThose in favor of the bill have failed to provide evidence to support \ntheir claim that agencies are somehow conspiring with plaintiffs to \nenter into consent decrees and settlement agreements.\n  But even if you agree with that claim, this bill wouldn't solve it. \nAll it would do is impose burdensome procedural requirements on \nagencies and courts that hamstring and prevent the use of consent \ndecrees and settlements which, oftentimes, are a more efficient way for \nboth plaintiffs and defendants to get to a reasonable outcome than \ninterminable processes and legal bills that go on for years and years.\n  The other bill to be considered under this rule is another example of \na bill that would make the American people less safe. It is called the \nSCRUB Act, which is also a dangerous solution in search of a problem.\n  Now, every branch of the government already conducts effective \noversight through retrospective review of agency rules. And again, if \nthere are rules that this body disagrees with, we should go after them, \ngo after the authority that this body has chosen to give the agency to \nmake health and safety regulations that keep the American people safe.\n  Each branch of government already conducts oversight and overlooking \nthis array of options that would provide the necessary scalpel for \nsmart regulatory cuts. This is, instead, a meat-cleaver approach that \ncan eliminate health and safety regulations, both good and ill-\ninformed.\n  Rather than creating jobs, growing the economy or making Americans \nsafer, this procedure would burden agencies with additional red tape \nand waste valuable agency resources and taxpayer dollars at the expense \nof the health and safety of the American people.\n  As my colleagues have alluded to, H.R. 1155's sole purpose is to \nactually obstruct the safety and regulatory process by burying agencies \nin endless red tape and extra costs. It would create legal ambiguity \nthat could lead to increased cost for businesses, for local communities \nthat rely on certainty to plan for the future, as well as uncertainty \nfor consumers and American families who don't know that the products or \nservices that they are buying are safe for them or their children.\n  Now, in principle, it is hard to argue against the notion that \nagencies should periodically assess whether rules they have implemented \nshould be improved or repealed, and I agree with that concept. That is \nnot in dispute. That is not what this bill is about.\n  Rather than streamlining rulemaking, or eliminating unnecessary \nrules, which we all want to do, through a thoughtful, retrospective \nreview process, even if it is required periodically, this bill, \ninstead, would result in years of delays for new and necessary health \nand safety rules by requiring a new rulemaking process for any rule \nthat is eliminated.\n  The SCRUB Act would also establish a regulatory review commission to \nidentify duplicative, redundant, or potentially obsolete regulations. \nNow, not only would the very creation of this commission be at the cost \nof taxpayers, as would its limitless resources, hours of staff work \nthat the bill mandates, but the authorizing language of the commission \nbinds it to consider only the costs to affected industries, while \nignoring the cost to the general public.\n\n  So, if an industry, if this commission existed, and they were looking \nat a regulation around dumping of toxic materials or toys that could \nhurt kids, the only charge under this statute of that commission would \nbe what are the costs of compliance of this to industry, not what are \nthe savings to American families who won't have to worry about their \nkid being hospitalized because of a choking hazard for a 3-year-old, or \nincreased cancer rate for a product that contains lead or a \ncarcinogenic agent. They can't look at that side of the equation.\n  Rather than to do a thorough cost-benefit analysis, this kangaroo \ncommission would rather superficially look at the cost to companies of \nmaking sure that their products are not dangerous to the American \npeople. That is the wrong way to go about this.\n  Simply put, the SCRUB Act is a solution in search of a problem. There \nare many tools available to each branch of government to conduct \neffective oversight and make smart regulatory cuts. I think it is a \nfine criticism of any administration that they haven't done enough in \nthat regard, and they should. And this body should encourage any \nPresident to move forward with cutting unnecessary regulations that \ncost businesses money and don't threaten the public health and safety.\n  But agencies must adhere to the robust requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act already, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, \nthe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nand the Congressional Review Act, and if some of those can be \nconsolidated, along with new ideas to cut red tape and regulation, you \nwill find strong bipartisan support for that concept.\n  But that is not what this bill does. This bill ties up the ability of \nour agencies that this Congress has authorized to help keep the \nAmerican people and American families safe with additional red tape and \nregulations. It creates a biased commission that, rather than looking \nat the costs and benefits of health and safety requirements, only looks \nat the costs.\n  Moreover, final regulations are subject to review by Federal courts \nalready, who are a final backstop to ensure that agencies have not \nviolated the authority that this body has given them, and that they \nhave satisfied all the applicable statutes, and whether agencies have \ncontinued input from relevant stakeholders. We have set that process \nup.\n  Now, if we have a thoughtful way to improve that process, around \nencouraging more stakeholder involvement, looking at the authority that \nwe have given each agency in certain areas, by all means, let's discuss \nthose kinds of bills, rather than short-circuiting the very process \nthat Congress has put in place to help reduce unnecessary regulations.\n  In many cases, Congress not only mandates that agencies issue a rule, \nthey are doing the work that we have required them to do, but we also \nprescribe the process already by which they must do so.\n  This bill, if it passes, will continue to waste the government's \ntime, and we are wasting more by even considering this today, as well \nas this reconciliation bill that would take healthcare coverage away \nfrom 22 million Americans.\n  You would think, Mr. Speaker, that if Republicans were bringing \nforward a bill to remove healthcare insurance from 22 million \nAmericans, you would think that they would have a plan for those 22 \nmillion Americans, but they do not. They simply strip them of their \nexisting health care.\n  Twenty-two millions Americans will not be able to see their doctor \nthat they have been seeing for years, know that they can go to the \nhospital if they need it, or have any adequate health insurance under \nthis reconciliation bill.\n  It defunds Planned Parenthood. It strips affordable planning and \nlifesaving cancer screenings away from millions of women across the \ncountry, precisely at the time that those cancer screenings would be \nmore necessary than ever, if the SCRUB Act passed, which would \nhamstring our own Federal agencies in their ability to prevent \ncarcinogenic agents from being in consumer products and food products \nthat American people consume.\n  So, again, through these set of bills, the Republicans are saying: We \nare going to not do the job that we have told our agencies to do in \nkeeping the American people safe; and, at the same time, the results of \nthat lack of safety--more hospital visits, more disease, more sickness, \nmore children choking, more sick kids--we are going to make sure that a \nlot more of them don't have health care when they need it because of \nthe health and safety regulations that we have removed through tying \nthem up in red tape for years after years.\n  That is not what the American people want. That is not what my \nconstituents want.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose the rule and the bill, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H33]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as has already been said just a \nlittle bit earlier on this floor, here we go again. I guess the straw \nharvest was good this fall because, like my colleague, I was hoping \nthat there would be some stuff changed. Undoubtedly, it is not, because \nthe straw harvest was good, and it is now time to put up straw men when \nwe talk about regulatory reform, and we are back at it again.\n  I want to comment in just a moment on regular order and the fact that \nstuff has been talked about.\n  We have two separate rules today. This is a rule that deals with the \nregulatory issues and regulatory reforms, two bills, and we have a rule \nthat is going to come up here in just a little bit that deals with \nrepealing ObamaCare and dealing with the heinous issues of Planned \nParenthood. That is a separate bill.\n  I would want to talk about something else too, instead of the \nregulatory issues that are here, because they do matter, they do create \njobs.\n  As we look at this, the one thing that always comes across, Mr. \nSpeaker, as we think about this, is a very clear choice, especially \nfrom constituents all over the country, in my district, in particular, \nwhen I think about this.\n  One of the main arguments against this is that it will burden the \ngovernment, so it is bad? The problem is, the government right now, \nthrough regulatory process, is burdening small business, is burdening \nfamilies who simply want to be able to get up, go to work, do their \njob, and be free of unnecessary burdensome regulations.\n  Again, we want to talk about throwing up the straw man that the \nRepublicans are out here poisoning the air, bad paint, terrible ideas, \nkilling kids. That is not what we are talking about.\n  Again, the harvest is ripe; the straw is being developed. And instead \nof talking about getting rid of regulatory process, we are going to \ntalk about, oh, we are taking away safety.\n  There is no Republican on this side of the aisle that I have ever \nheard stand from this place, or from anywhere else, and say: I want \ndirty water. Give me choking air. Give me paint that is bad. Give me \nproducts that are terrible. That is not what is ever said. And when \nthat argument is brought up, it simply cheapens and demeans the \nprocess.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the things that was just said was that we don't \nwant to have public comments, that you have to answer to public \ncomments, that a government agency would have to answer to public \ncomment. In fact, one of the issues is H.R. 712 actually addresses this \nbecause these sue and settlement agreements can take place without the \naffected party even being in the room or even know it is happening.\n  Tell me where that is fair. Show me where two people can go in a room \nand decide what is best for me in a business environment. Show where \nthat is fair. It is not fair and you can't argue that it is.\n  Public comment to the government is expected, and public comment \nshould be respected before these regulations or these consent decrees \nare put out.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  We all have various roles. The executive branch has their role, and \nthere are places where they meet. And we are appreciative of the work \nthat is done. What is being talked about in these bills is, let's make \nit more efficient and let's make it better because what we have in \nWashington is, I would rather see this body take up the policy \nargument, this body discuss the billions of dollars in costs that are \nbeing implemented on businesses, and not the agencies who have no \nanswerability to the public. So when we look at this, these are just \nthe small things. We want to talk about what is actually coming to the \nfloor.\n  I have the privilege of sharing the Rules Committee with my friend \nfrom Washington State, who is going to speak. I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. Newhouse).\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia, a \nfellow member of the Rules Committee, for yielding me time to speak on \nthis important topic. I am very pleased to be able to contribute to \nthis conversation.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, I am a farmer. I can tell you that \ngrowing crops, cultivating crops, can teach you a lot about a \nresponsible regulatory process. That may sound like a strange \nstatement, but let me just say I primarily grow hops and grapes, two \ncrops that require a trellis system. Neither of these crops would be \nsuccessfully grown without a good, strong trellis system that gives \nthem structure, direction, and support. However, on the flip side, if \nthe trellises aren't constructed properly, if they are not maintained \nand kept in good working order, the crop growth would be affected. It \nwould be stunted, and production in the end would suffer.\n  Our regulatory process is very similar, Mr. Speaker. Congress passes \nlaws intended to provide a progrowth structure for our economy. \nRegulatory agencies build out and fill in the details based on the \ndirections from us, from Congress. However, sometimes agencies provide \nregulations that can significantly harm people and harm businesses and \nthe jobs they are supposed to be supporting. Many times these \nregulations exceed or are in contravention to the discretion or \nauthority provided by Congress. Many times it seems as if the \nregulators write these regulations for the sake of regulations with \nlittle regard for the consequences to those that are forced to comply.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule and the \nunderlying legislation, as these bills will provide Congress and the \nAmerican public with new tools to ensure that regulations truly have \nthe public's best interest in mind and do not hinder economic expansion \nand growth.\n  For example, H.R. 712 will prevent what are called the sue and settle \ntactics that are used to circumvent the normal rulemaking process. It \nhas been well documented that, on numerous regulations, the \nadministration has intentionally dragged its feet and failed to propose \na regulation in a timely fashion. So what happens then, they can be \nsued and ultimately settle on the terms decided solely by the court, by \nthe administration, and by the plaintiff.\n  This tactic has removed the cost-benefit analysis required for many \neconomically significant regulations. But more importantly, it has \neliminated stakeholder engagement in the regulatory process as well as \nthe public's right to comment on dozens of regulations with compliance \ncosts totalling in the hundreds of millions to the billions of dollars.\n  This legislation also includes other commonsense measures, such as \nrequiring agencies to post on the Internet in plain language 100-word \nsummaries detailing what a regulation does. Few individuals or small \nbusinesses have either the time or the fleets of lawyers needed to pore \nover hundreds of pages of regulations and be expected to comment or \ncomply.\n  I was also proud to cosponsor H.R. 1155, which this rule also \nprovides for consideration. It is estimated that the current Federal \ncode spans more than 175,000 pages. This important legislation will \nenact a commission to review the regulatory code and make \nrecommendations on which regulations are necessary, which are \noverlapping, and which are duplicative or obsolete. Wouldn't it be a \nrefreshing change, Mr. Speaker, if, for once, Washington, D.C., could \nactually cut red tape instead of creating new barriers to economic \ngrowth?\n  Too often regulations have begun to have costs that far outweigh \ntheir benefits, seriously harming those they were intended to regulate, \nhelp, and protect. Regulations resulting from sue and settle are often \nimpossible to comply with, and the public is removed from the \nrulemaking process. We can and we must do better. These commonsense \nreforms in H.R. 712 and H.R. 1155 will help reverse the trend of \nregulations stunting growth and stalling production and restore the \nprogrowth-oriented structure and direction that Congress has intended.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman from Georgia mentioned that sometimes affected parties \naren't in the room during consent decree or settlement discussions. \nThat is a far cry from having to respond to potentially hundreds of \nthousands or millions of public comments one on one.\n\n[[Page H34]]\n\n  So, again, if there is a problem that they are trying to solve, let's \nlook at who is in the room and who the affected parties are in making \nsure they are part of the process, not preventing any meaningful effort \nfor consent decree or settlement from even going forward by putting a \ncompletely impossible requirement to fulfill, given the staff that they \nhave, of having to reply to every public comment when we all know that \npublic comments can be artificially ginned up through an Astroturf \nprocess to deliberately bog down a process that otherwise could more \nexpeditiously settle a dispute than years and years of legal fees on \nboth sides.\n  I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. \nWatson Coleman) to further discuss today's effort to strip away health \ncare from 22 million American families and to remove the ability of \nhundreds of thousands of American women to have access to cancer \nscreenings across our country.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a brand-new year, but you wouldn't know it if you \nlook at what we will be voting on this week.\n  Across the investigations of three separate committees in this body, \neight States, and four Federal court cases, not a single shred of \nevidence has been found indicating that Planned Parenthood has broken \nany laws. In fact, the Oversight and Government Reform chairman, Jason \nChaffetz, has admitted that he found no evidence that Planned \nParenthood did anything wrong.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to ignore the \nfacts here. Planned Parenthood is a healthcare organization serving 3 \nmillion Americans each year. In the course of their lifetime, one in \nfive Americans will receive care from Planned Parenthood. Despite \narguments to the contrary, there are simply not enough health centers \nto fill the gap.\n  If we defund Planned Parenthood, we will be denying care to millions \nof families. We will be taking away options from underserved \ncommunities across the country--rural, urban, and otherwise. We will be \nsaying to women, once again, that how and when they get health care is \nnot their choice; it is the choice of a body overwhelmingly run by men.\n  When I got to Congress last January, I thought I would be voting on \nlegislation that would improve the lives of my constituents, Mr. \nSpeaker, giving them better wages, jobs, stronger education, and an \neconomy that started at a level playing field. Instead, I have been on \nthe floor more times than I want to count urging my colleagues on the \nother side to give up the attacks on women's health.\n  It is a new year, Mr. Speaker. We have a new Speaker. Enough is \nenough. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  I thank the gentleman for giving me this opportunity.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), a member of the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee and my good friend.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule \nand the bills that this rule brings to the floor, and I thank the \ngentleman from Georgia for yielding me this time. I primarily want to \ntalk for a couple moments, though, about health care.\n  In the mid 1990s, I went to a reception, and the doctor who delivered \nme came and brought my records. I asked him how much he charged back \nthen. He said he charged $60 for 9 months of care and the delivery, if \nthey could afford it.\n  I recently read an article by a woman who wrote that you have to be \nover 50 now to remember a time when health care was affordable. And it \nused to be affordable, Mr. Speaker, for almost everybody. But then the \nFederal Government got into it.\n  Several years ago, I asked the administrator of a hospital in \nKnoxville how much medical costs would go down if you could get the \ngovernment out of health care. His estimate was that it would come down \n50 percent overnight and another 50 percent over the next 6 months so \nthat costs would then be only about 25 percent of what they are now.\n  When the Federal Government got so heavily into health care, costs \njust exploded. A few people in companies got filthy rich, but almost \neveryone else got screwed. Now only a few billionaires can afford the \ncosts of a major illness.\n  We need to make health care affordable again. We can't do that by \nmaking it even more bureaucratic than it already is.\n  The bill this rule brings to the floor is an attempt to give patients \nmore control over their healthcare dollars and give the Federal \nGovernment less control and to stop making a very few rich off of the \nsystem because they know how to work the system. It is an effort to \nhelp bring down some of these ridiculous and exorbitant costs.\n  We can't get the government out of health care entirely. But thank \ngoodness we don't pay for other necessities, like food, clothing, and \nhousing, like we do for medical care. Thank goodness there is still \nprimarily a free market for other necessities. If we paid for food the \nsame way we pay for medical care, we would see crazy prices for steaks \nand other types of food. Or if we paid for cars the same way we paid \nfor medical care, most people wouldn't have even been able to afford a \nYugo.\n  We need to move in a new direction, a less bureaucratic direction, \nand a more affordable direction. This bill is an important first step \nin that better direction.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Speier).\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, last year, newly elected Speaker Ryan made a \nNew Year's resolution that the House would once again consider serious \nlegislation for the benefit of the American people. Yesterday was the \nvery first day of our legislative session, and the bill we are \nconsidering is not a serious proposal. Yes, we are voting on repealing \nthe Affordable Care Act for the 62nd time this Congress and attacking \nwomen's health for the 11th time, and we are, in fact, going to have \nthe 5th vote on the defunding Planned Parenthood.\n  Now, we know that Speaker Ryan is a committed athlete. In fact, his \nfavorite workout is the P90X. It is based on repetition. An exercise \nrepeating the same action over and over again can lead to success. I am \nsure we all admire Speaker Ryan's commitment to a healthy lifestyle. \nNormally, doing additional reps builds muscle mass, but the one muscle \nRepublicans aren't exercising is their brain. Repeating the same, tired \nrepeal and defund bill does not lead to more healthy laws. It just \nmakes the American people tired and sore at the waste of taxpayer \nmoney.\n  American women are scratching their heads thinking: Why does the \nRepublican leadership hate us so much? Why is it they want to take away \nour rights? Why is it they want to take away the very services that \nactually protect life? Planned Parenthood protects life by providing \nmore than 900,000 cancer screenings a year, and millions more receive \nservices through Planned Parenthood. Why are Republicans trying to deny \nus from accessing this very vital health care?\n  It is time for the Republicans to stop shoving these unhealthy, \nwasteful bills down our throats. Put down the political equivalent of a \ngiant plate of nachos and exercise the hard job of governing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this flabby rule.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind those who \nare here that the rule's focus here is dealing with helping regulatory \nreform burden. I do appreciate the opportunity of Republicans too to \ntake the burden off of individuals.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nWashington (Ms. DelBene) to further discuss the Republican efforts in \nour very first week back to take health care away from 22 million \nAmericans and remove resources that women have in place to engage in \nlifesaving cancer screenings and other affordable family planning \nservices.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill.\n  I wish I could say I am surprised that House leaders are kicking off \n2016 the same way they spent 2015--attacking women's health--but I am \nnot. For\n\n[[Page H35]]\n\nanyone who has forgotten, let me refresh your memory.\n  Last year, the House voted 10 times to attack women's health. That \nincluded voting to restrict reproductive health care in private \ninsurance, enact a sweeping 20-week abortion ban, and allow employers \nto discriminate against workers for using birth control.\n  Now we are voting to defund Planned Parenthood for the fifth time, \neven though three House committees tried and failed to uncover any \nevidence of wrongdoing. What is worse, today's vote takes place before \nthe Republicans' taxpayer-funded select committee to investigate \nPlanned Parenthood has even held its first meeting. It is shameful. \nAmericans expect us to focus on facts, not ideology. So far, there are \nno facts to justify defunding a healthcare provider that 2.7 million \nAmericans rely on.\n  Here is what we do know: Planned Parenthood provides nearly 900,000 \ncancer screenings each year; 78 percent of Planned Parenthood patients \nare low-income; and the services provided by Planned Parenthood help \nprevent more than 500,000 unintended pregnancies every year.\n  With each passing week, it becomes clear this Chamber isn't \ninterested in the facts. It is only interested in pushing an extreme \nideological agenda designed to take away women's constitutional right \nto choose.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Here we are, week one of 2016 and we have a multifaceted Republican \nattack on women's health. On the one hand, we are removing the \nabilities of our safety agencies from making sure that products that \nare sold are safe. Whether that is shampoo or soap or makeup or a toy \nfor your child, we rely on our health and safety regulators to make \nsure that nothing that can hurt the American people is put forward. \nOftentimes, when there is some kind of litigation around that, we have \na process that allows that to be settled to keep dangerous products off \nthe marketplace.\n  In setting up this commission that would only be able to look at the \ncost of regulation rather than savings from a health and safety \nregulation, you are deliberately putting in place a process that will \nlead to additional costs going forward because it doesn't look at both \nsides of the equation.\n  I would be supportive, as would many Democrats, of a thoughtful \napproach to a red tape reduction commission, to a regulatory reform \ncommission. What should it look like? It needs to have both industry at \nthe table, as well as consumer health advocates, as well as thoughtful \nleaders to make up the balance of that committee to side with either \nside based on the merits. Importantly, their charge needs to be to look \nat the costs and benefits measured through economic measurements that \nthe staff will be charged with doing, the costs and benefits of \nreforms, to find out and eliminate regulations that cost more than they \nbenefit and to make sure that we improve and enhance regulations where \nwe can have more savings and more benefit to the American people at a \nlower cost.\n  It is all about health and protecting the American people and \neconomic efficiency, and the commission can accomplish that. But not \nthe dangerous attack on women's health through this commission in this \nbill, coupled the very same week with defunding Planned Parenthood, \ntaking low-cost cancer screenings away from hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans, telling 22 million American families you no longer have \nhealth insurance, sending a cancellation notice in the first week of \nthe year to 22 million American families that you can't go see the \ndoctor, you can't go to the hospital or you are going to be bankrupt. \nThat is not the kind of progress the American people want.\n  Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, guess what. Neither of these bills are going \nto become law. President Obama stated he will veto these bills. These \nbills that hamper the ability of our agencies to protect the health of \nthe American people, these bills that defund Planned Parenthood, this \nreconciliation, they will be vetoed.\n  Therefore, the first week back, while the Republicans are trying to \ncancel healthcare insurance for 22 million American families, while \nthey are trying to prevent low-income women from having access to \ncancer screenings, while they are trying to remove the ability of our \nhealth and safety agencies to keep our American people safe, they will \nnot succeed. They are wasting time. Therefore, these bills come at a \nserious opportunity cost to the American people.\n  The American people want us to use their time and their money to \naddress real problems: to fix our broken immigration system and restore \norder and security to our border, and to help the millions of Americans \nsuffering under an unlivable minimum wage by increasing it. They want \nus to tackle reforming our archaic Tax Code by getting rid of special \ninterest tax loopholes and giving the American people lower tax rates \nin return, rather than allowing Americans to avoid taxes by putting \nassets in overseas shell corporations.\n  When I was back in my district over the holidays, I didn't have a \nsingle constituent say that they wanted to remove or go after the \nprocess of creating health and safety regulations. They wanted to hear \nwhat we are going to do to create an environment that allows the \nprivate sector to create jobs. For that to occur, the American people \nneed to have confidence that the products and services they buy are not \ngoing to injure or kill them.\n  But instead, what is on the docket so far? Bills that would actually \nincrease red tape and disable agencies from generating meaningful \nrulemaking by burying them in having to do mandatory responses, not \njust to the affected parties, but to every member of the public that \nwants to comment on a particular settlement or consent decree; and it \nhands out special interest goodies through the regulatory review \nprocess by a commission that would fully be under control of those who \nhave a vested interest in preventing even the most commonsense health \nand safety regulations.\n  This may be a new year, but it looks like we are playing the same \npolitical games.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan legislation that would \nclose a glaring loophole in our gun laws allowing suspected terrorists \nto legally buy firearms.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). Is there \nobjection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, this bill that we would like to bring \nforward, if we can defeat the previous question, would help keep the \nAmerican people safe. The bill would bar the sale of firearms and \nexplosives to those on the FBI's terrorist watch list.\n  On this day, today, Mr. Speaker, there are Americans that can't \nlegally fly because we don't trust them to be in the cabin of an \naircraft and are on the no-fly list, but they can quietly assemble an \narsenal of deadly weapons fully legally. In what world does that make \nsense? With the increased risk of terrorist threats, with the \noccurrences in France, and with what happened in San Bernardino, how \ncan we possibly stand by and say we don't trust somebody because of \nwhat we know about them through law enforcement and through the \nauthorized practices that this body has set in place to investigate \nterrorism? We know enough about them to know that they shouldn't be on \nan airplane; but if they want to quietly assemble an arsenal of dozens \nof deadly weapons, that is fine, why not let them do it?\n  We can fix that. By simply defeating the previous question, we can \nbring forward that bill. I am confident it would have overwhelming \nsupport. We can pass it. It is a bipartisan bill. Rather than strip \nhealth care from 22 million Americans, rather than risk the health of \nAmerican families by removing the health and safety processes that we \nwant to put in place to make sure that products and services are safe, \nrather than defunding Planned Parenthood and preventing hundreds of \nthousands\n\n[[Page H36]]\n\nof American women from having low-cost access to cancer screenings and \nreproductive health services, instead, let's make sure that those who \nrepresent a terrorist threat to our Nation are not able to quietly \nassemble deadly arsenals to commit terrorist acts.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous question. \nVote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  As this debate has come forward, I want to just point out, as a \nmember of the Rules Committee talking about rules bringing forth the \nprocess for which debate will happen, I want to commend Chairman \nSessions and the Rules staff and also leadership--the chairman has done \na great job of leadership under Speaker Ryan and others--who have \nbrought forth two rules today. I know in the last, probably, about an \nhour, that has become a little conflated, but this rule deals with \nregulatory burden. This rule deals with the issue of jobs and job \ncreation.\n  I, like my friend from Colorado, have had many conversations with \nmany folks in my district, and, yes, it does come around to job \ncreation. One of the ways that you can do that, and one of the ways \nthat we are looking to be able to do this, is to free them up.\n  According to research that came out from the American Action Forum, \nthe savings from these bills that we are talking about under this rule \ncan save a total of $48 billion annually and save 1.5 billion paperwork \nhours. If you want to make--and I have run small businesses, just as \nothers in here have. If you want to make your employees more effective, \nhave better contact with customers, come up with new ideas, and do \ncreation, then let them do their jobs and not have to be burdened with \ngovernment intrusion. This is a savings here.\n  Now, again, it has been stated over and over again, and we are at the \npoint now we are not going to be able to overcome this, so here is the \nway. Mr. Speaker, just understand these are the parameters in which we \nspeak.\n  When Republicans want to stand up, this Republican majority wants to \nstand up for businessowners and families who get up every day taking \ncare of their families, who go to work, find jobs, get good employment. \nWhen we bring up ways that, unfortunately, as the other side \ncharacterized it, burdens government, then we are portrayed as wanting \nto ruin the environment, kill the babies, kill the toys, whatever it is \nthat they want to come up with. This is just a false narrative that \nneeds to cease.\n  The regulatory nation that we have become, apart from the \nconstitutional process that is set forth by Members elected from their \ndistricts to come forward and put forth ideas, give those to the \nexecutive branch to carry out, not make up new laws or to enter into \nconsent agreements without the litigant standing party available, is \nwrong. It is not about anything but fairness. It is about cleaning up \ngovernment. It is about limiting government. It is about keeping our \nairways safe. It is about having clean water. It is about having clean \nair. It is about doing the things that government should be doing in a \nlimited process, not simply a jobs program inside the beltway.\n  When you have regulators who regulate banks who have never worked in \na bank and never gave a loan, that is not right. When you have folks \nwho never get outside of a cubicle but yet are able to, without input \nmany times, decide how farmers who have worked their land for many \nyears are to react, that is not right. This rule today lets us go \ntoward a forward step of doing just that. You see, it is about real \npeople. It is not about bureaucracies.\n  It is about real people, like Mr. Puckett from Columbus, Mississippi. \nHe has been creating jobs for over 100 years in his family. He has a \nfamily-owned brick company. Mr. Puckett attributes the success of his \nbusiness to hardworking employees and loyal employees. Unfortunately, \nwhen I met Mr. Puckett, the conversation was not so optimistic. He \ntestified in the Judiciary Committee in 2014 because his company had \njust lost 50 jobs as a result of two regulations crafted behind closed \ndoors.\n  In a nation of over 300 million, 50 jobs may not seem like a lot, but \nin the town of Columbus, Mississippi, it is the difference between 50 \nfamilies having food on the table or going hungry. Every State, every \ncongressional district has their Mr. Pucketts. No business has been \nuntouched by the toll of costly and overly burdensome regulations.\n  This probably, Mr. Speaker, is one of the greatest times to be here \nand to speak about this because the choice is clear. And you can try to \nconflate it and talk about other things, but this rule deals with these \nbills that deal with real jobs, such as Mr. Puckett. It deals with the \nreal priorities of the Republican majority, saying we want to put \npeople back to work, we want to make business more efficient, and we \nwant to have rules and regulations that are smart, sensible, and safe. \nTo say otherwise is not fair for the American people. In fact, it is \njust a coverup for a society or a governing philosophy that says: \nBureaucracy knows best; government knows best; let us just continue to \ngrow.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  In fact, it was said earlier today that we have all of these \nexecutive orders and all of these other rules that are designed to help \nstreamline regulatory burdens. If that is what they are supposed to be \ndoing, then they are failing because all we do is keep growing and \nadding costs everywhere we go.\n  I can also understand my friend's concern about the government having \nto answer public comments because I guess the EPA didn't want to have \nto answer to itself when the EPA broke the law with the social media \npush for the water rules that the GAO just nailed them on.\n  You can't have it both ways, Mr. Speaker. You can't not want to \nanswer to the American public and then, when you want to influence your \nown regulatory agenda, send out false narratives and break the law. \nThis is not Doug Collins' opinion or anybody else's. As reported in The \nNew York Times, it is the GAO's.\n  I understand that is why the system is broken, and that is why the \nsystem needs to be fixed. That is why the vote is a ``yes'' on this \nrule, on bipartisan legislation, by the way, and on legislation that \nhas been bipartisan. This is what we are talking about in this rule.\n  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker. When Members come to the floor for this \nrule, they are voting for a government that becomes more efficient, \nthey are voting for a government that is responsive to those who are \nbeing affected, they are voting for those who are responsible for \nactually being able to do what they are being gifted to do in their \ncommunities. That is what this rule does, Mr. Speaker.\n  In just a few moments, my friend from Georgia will talk about getting \nthis country back in shape and will talk about some other bills we are \noffering today to free up the American people.\n  But in this rule, the question is: Are we standing for the Mr. \nPucketts of the world, the individuals and the businesses of the world, \nor, as has been said on the floor today, are we more concerned about \nburdening a government agency?\n  I think I know what the answer of the American people is: Government, \ndo what you are supposed to do. Do it within a limited form. Let us be \nthe generation of wealth and income in this country. Let us be the \ncapitalist system that we have brought this country into.\n  When we do that, then we are doing what we are supposed to be doing. \nThat is what this Republican majority is fighting for. That is what \nthis rule is. I would ask that everyone vote for this rule.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 580 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall\n\n[[Page H37]]\n\n     not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the \n     chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered \n     for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order \n     against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion \n     of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee \n     shall rise and report the bill to the House with such \n     amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments \n     thereto to final passage without intervening motion except \n     one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the \n     Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to \n     no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day \n     the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of \n     business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the \n     Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 579 provides for the \nconsideration of the Senate-amended version of H.R. 3762, Restoring \nAmericans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, you will recall that, on October 23 of last year, the \nHouse passed our reconciliation bill, which went through the process, \nwhich went through regular order. The Senate amended that bill in \nDecember. It is now back in the House for further consideration.\n  This rule today also provides an extension of deposition authority, \nMr. Speaker, for staff members who serve the Committees on Energy and \nCommerce; Financial Services; Science, Space, and Technology; and Ways \nand Means.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a great way to start 2016. There is a new \nsheriff in town, as you know, who has a commitment to regular order, \nand the process we have today is regular order at its finest.\n  We are here today on a reconciliation provision that came from the \nUnited States Senate. It came from the United States Senate because it \nwas first passed by the United States House. It was passed by the \nUnited States House because, for the first time in over a decade, we \nhad a conferenced budget agreement coming to balance, to govern these \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, for 5 years, I have been in this institution. For 5 \nyears, I have served on the Budget Committee. For 5 years, I have \nserved on the Rules Committee. Never before has this House considered a \nreconciliation measure that will, with its passage today, go to the \nPresident's desk tomorrow.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not care where you are on the policy. This is an \nissue of repealing the President's healthcare bill and the damaging \nimpact it has had on my constituents across the district. I doubt \nseriously there is a Member in this body who has not made up his or her \nmind on where he or she is on this issue.\n  I will try to persuade no one on the merits today. What I will do, \nMr. Speaker, is tell you that, when you get the process right, you have \nan opportunity to get the policy right, too.\n  This bill eliminates the penalty for noncompliance with the \nindividual mandate, that individual mandate that changed the nature of \nthe relationship between the governed and the governing. This bill \nwould eliminate the penalty for noncompliance with the employer \nmandate.\n\n[[Page H38]]\n\n  It would eliminate the controversial reinsurance program. It would \nrepeal the IRS' ability to provide insurance premium tax credits and \ncost-sharing subsidies. It would repeal the costly Medicare expansion. \nIt would increase our investment in community health centers. All told, \nthis bill would save the American people $500 billion.\n  I am not so naive as to believe that this bill is going to be the end \nof the story today, Mr. Speaker. But I celebrate the fact that, with \nthe passage of this rule, we will have an opportunity to vote and an \nopportunity to act in ways that we have not year, upon year, upon year. \nI do not believe our mandate in this House is to agree. I think our \nmandate in this House is to decide, and we cannot decide with a process \nthat is broken. We must have a process that is open, as this process \nhas been.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President raised the American consciousness as it \nrelates to the discussion of health care in this country. He persuaded \nthe American people that preexisting conditions have no place in the \nAmerican body politic. I believe he was right on that. I don't believe \nthat will ever change.\n  He persuaded the American people that insurance policies shouldn't \nhave lifetime caps, that when you are facing your deepest and your \nworst fears in your family--when those have come true--that you ought \nnot get bad news from your insurance company on that same day. I agree \nwith him on that. I don't think we will ever change that.\n  Yet, Mr. Speaker, there are folks in my district who had policies \nthat they counted on but that were canceled. There are businesses in my \ndistrict that had a commitment to take care of their employees, but \nthey have now been priced out of the market. There are folks who wanted \nto exercise their choices and not the President's choice.\n  If you go to the most recent Rasmussen polls, the American people \nprioritized lowering costs over universal coverage. I am committed to \nproviding health care to those who cannot afford it, but I am committed \nto lowering costs for those who can.\n  The free market is the mechanism that we will use to lower costs. \nWith this repeal today, we have an opportunity to begin that discussion \nin earnest for the first time in 5 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                               Committee on Rules,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2015.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, your committee's authority \n     to conduct staff depositions pursuant to section 3(b) of H. \n     Res. 5 (114th Congress) expires at the end of the legislative \n     session. I am currently considering whether to recommend to \n     the Committee on Rules an extension of that authority for the \n     remainder of the 114th Congress.\n       In order to ensure that the Rules Committee has all of the \n     information necessary to fully consider whether to grant an \n     extension of this authority, I would appreciate it if you \n     could provide responses to the following items no later than \n     5 p.m. on December 8, 2015:\n       1. How many depositions has your committee conducted \n     pursuant to the authority granted by section 3(b) of H. Res. \n     5 (114th Congress) during this legislative session?\n       2. Was having this authority helpful in obtaining voluntary \n     interviews of one or more individuals in the course of your \n     committee's oversight or in obtaining cooperation with \n     document requests? How many times would you estimate that \n     this authority resulted in voluntary interviews compliance \n     with investigative requests that might not have been possible \n     otherwise?\n       3. Please provide your rationale, including any relevant \n     examples, for why the Rules Committee should extend this \n     authority for your committee for the remainder of the \n     Congress.\n       Thank you for your assistance in providing this information \n     so the Committee on Rules can fully consider an extension of \n     this authority. Should you or your staff have any questions, \n     please feel free to contact either myself or the Rules \n     Committee's staff director, Hugh Halpern.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Sessions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Pete Sessions,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sessions: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     discuss our interest in the authority provided by Section \n     3(b) of H.Res. 5, providing staff deposition authority to the \n     Energy and Commerce Committee, among other committees of the \n     House.\n       We have appreciated your support of our efforts to conduct \n     thoughtful and effective oversight of the laws passed by \n     Congress. As you well know, such oversight activities are an \n     integral part of our Article 1 responsibilities. This is \n     especially true at a time when the policy objectives of the \n     Executive branch have regularly led it to exceed clear \n     statutory direction, and its representatives are regularly \n     recalcitrant in providing us with explanations for those \n     actions.\n       My goal has been, wherever possible, to work cooperatively \n     with the subjects of our oversight work to accomplish the \n     committee's objectives. The Congress's oversight tools are \n     overwhelmingly powerful, and in order to maintain public \n     trust in our stewardship of those tools, I have felt that it \n     is important for us to use the use of our authority in a way \n     that is prudent and proportional.\n       But there are clearly times when the legitimate \n     Congressional oversight prerogative requires the threat of \n     compulsion. This is why we believe the authority provided to \n     the committee in H.Res. 5 has been valuable to the \n     committee's oversight objectives. While the committee has not \n     yet been required to conduct depositions under this new \n     authority, we believe the availability of this authority has \n     facilitated our efforts to obtain significant voluntary \n     cooperation in several important investigations. For example, \n     in the matter related to videotapes showing procurement of \n     donated fetal tissue, Planned Parenthood Federation of \n     America and a number of its affiliates, as well as several \n     tissue procurement organizations, have voluntarily provided \n     thousands of pages of relevant documents. In a matter related \n     to allegations of contamination at a National Institutes of \n     Health drug manufacturing facility, the committee has \n     received detailed information concerning the impact of such \n     contamination on hundreds of patients in experimental drug \n     trials. And, in the recent matter related to ``defeat \n     devices'' installed by Volkswagen in thousands of its diesel-\n     engine cars, the committee has begun to receive detailed \n     information regarding internal corporate deliberations and \n     interactions with Federal and state regulators. In each of \n     these cases, we believe these significant voluntary \n     productions of documents and information are due in large \n     part to an understanding that the committee has the authority \n     to compel such information, including now through compulsory \n     depositions.\n       We also believe that the authority to compel staff \n     depositions will be an especially important tool in \n     investigations of the executive branch. In an ongoing matter \n     regarding the Administration's justification for subsidies \n     paid under a provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), \n     senior executive branch representatives have repeatedly \n     ignored requests by our committee and the Ways and Means \n     committee for relevant information. The committees recently \n     wrote to Secretaries Burwell and Lew requesting interviews \n     with specific senior executive branch officials. I expect \n     that these requests will almost certainly involve invocation \n     of authority provided by Section 3(b) of H.Res 5. Similarly, \n     as the committee continues its oversight of other aspects of \n     the ACA, including the failure of state exchanges and \n     cooperatives, it is becoming aware of serious issucs of waste \n     and negligent program administration. As the current \n     Administration enters its eighth and final year, and works \n     feverishly to implement its policy objectives, I expect there \n     will be other areas where we will need every oversight tool \n     available, including staff deposition authority, to ensure \n     that the Administration is faithfully executing the laws \n     enacted by Congress, and holding itself accountable for the \n     prudent and efficient expenditure of taxpayers' dollars.\n       Thank you again for your work to provide us with the tools \n     to do effective oversight and ensuring that these tools \n     continue to be available.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Committee on Rules,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chair, Committee on Financial Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, your committee's authority \n     to conduct staff depositions pursuant to section 3(b) of H. \n     Res. 5 (114th Congress) expires at the end of the legislative \n     session.

Pete Sessions,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Rules,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sessions: This is to request that the \n     Committee on Rules extend the authority of the Committee on \n     Financial Services (Committee) to conduct staff depositions \n     pursuant to section 3(b) of H. Res. 5 which expires at the \n     end of the present legislative session. Your letter of \n     December 2, 2015, asks the Committee to provide the Committee \n     on Rules with the following three categories of information \n     in support of the Committee's request to extend deposition \n     authority:\n       1. The number of depositions the Committee conducted \n     pursuant to the authority granted by section 3(b) of H. Res. \n     5 (114th Congress) during the present legislative session;\n       2. Whether having deposition authority was helpful in \n     obtaining voluntary interviews of individuals in the course \n     of the Committee's oversight or in obtaining cooperation with \n     document requests, and the estimated number of times that \n     this authority resulted in voluntary interview compliance \n     with investigative requests that might not have been possible \n     otherwise; and\n       3. A rationale, including any relevant examples, for why \n     the Committee on Rules should extend this authority to the \n     Committee for the remainder of the Congress.\n       The Committee has conducted no depositions pursuant to the \n     authority granted by section 3(b) of H. Res. 5. However, \n     having deposition authority was and continues to be an \n     invaluable tool in securing interviews and compliance with \n     document requests. In the course of a single investigation, \n     Committee staff conducted sixteen informal interviews of \n     officials at three different agencies. As part of the same \n     investigation, the Committee also sent interrogatories to a \n     former government official and received a sworn written \n     response in lieu of an interview. These interviews and \n     interrogatories elicited crucial information that will be \n     included in a Committee staff report that is expected to be \n     released in early 2016.\n       The Committee's deposition authority has been a useful tool \n     in securing agency compliance with the Committee's subpoenas \n     and information requests. During the First Session of the \n     114th Congress the Committee sent four subpoenas duces tecum \n     to four federal agencies. Three of these agencies ignored the \n     Committee's subpoena until the Committee threatened to \n     conduct transcribed interviews or depositions with agency \n     officials responsible for delaying the production of the \n     subpoenaed records, and the fourth will be sent a similar \n     request for depositions or transcribed interviews in the near \n     future.\n       Deposition authority continues to be critical to the \n     Committee's oversight of an Administration that has been \n     markedly indifferent to the Committee's subpoenas and \n     voluntary information requests. The Committee also \n     anticipates that it will be necessary to use its deposition \n     authority in the near future as part of its oversight of \n     independent federal agencies under its jurisdiction. The \n     Committee will likely continue to face obstruction from this \n     Administration concerning future information requests and, \n     accordingly, will need to utilize its deposition authority to \n     effectuate full and prompt compliance with respect to these \n     future requests.\n       Lastly, the Committee's deposition authority should be \n     modestly expanded to cover individuals who have recently left \n     the federal government in order to prevent agency officials \n     from sidestepping congressional investigations by resigning \n     from their government positions. Under the Committee's \n     current deposition authority, agency officials involved in \n     wrongdoing or otherwise under investigation can effectively \n     avoid the Committee's efforts to interview or depose them by \n     resigning from their government posts. If key officials \n     should leave their positions before being deposed or \n     interviewed, those officials involved in possible wrongdoing \n     in connection with their government employment could \n     strategically avoid being held accountable by Congress and, \n     as a result, several of the Committee's investigations may be \n     significantly hampered by such departures.\n       Several federal employees previously under investigation by \n     the Committee have already left government service and it is \n     likely that other officials will follow suit, particularly \n     because the Administration's last year will coincide with the \n     Second Session of this Congress. Accordingly, expanding the \n     Committee's deposition authority to include former agency \n     officials provided that (1) such officials served in the \n     federal government within two years of being served with a \n     deposition subpoena and (2) the purpose of the deposition \n     relates to their government employment, would greatly \n     strengthen the Committee's ability to conduct effective \n     oversight of the Administration's last year, as it would \n     allow the Committee to investigate and conduct effective \n     oversight of officials who have recently left or might \n     otherwise choose to leave their positions as the \n     Administration winds down.\n       Should you need additional information, please have your \n     staff contact the Committee's Chief Oversight Counsel, Uttam \n     Dhillon. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Committee on Rules,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2015.\n     Hon. Kevin Brady,\n     Chair, Committee on Ways and Means,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, your committee's authority \n     to conduct staff depositions pursuant to section 3(b) of H. \n     Res. 5 (114th Congress) expires at the end of the legislative \n     session. I am currently considering whether to recommend to \n     the Committee on Rules an extension of that authority for the \n     remainder of the 114th Congress.\n       In order to ensure that the Rules Committee has all of the \n     information necessary to fully consider whether to grant an \n     extension of this authority, I would appreciate it if you \n     could provide responses to the following items no later than \n     5 p.m. on December 8, 2015:\n       1.

Please provide your rationale, including any relevant \n     examples, for why the Rules Committee should extend this \n     authority for your committee for the remainder of the \n     Congress.\n       Thank you for your assistance in providing this information \n     so the Committee on Rules can fully consider an extension of \n     this authority. Should you or your staff have any questions, \n     please feel free to contact either myself or the Rules \n     Committee's staff director, Hugh Halpern.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Sessions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2015.\n     Hon. Pete Sessions,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Rules,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sessions: Thank you for your letter \n     concerning the Committee on Ways and Means' authority to \n     conduct staff depositions pursuant to section 3(b) of H. Res. \n     5. Staff deposition authority is a powerful tool that has \n     been extremely effective in gaining access to information \n     that the Administration has been reluctant to provide. \n     Reauthorization of this authority is essential for the \n     Committee to exercise its oversight responsibility and ensure \n     that the Administration is held accountable to the American \n     people. Over the past year, this authority has been a \n     valuable tool that has enhanced our oversight of the \n     Administration and regulated entities.\n       The Committee has not yet needed to exercise compulsory \n     process to depose individuals, as the deposition authority \n     has been a successful means of encouraging voluntary \n     compliance with the Committee's requests. It may become \n     necessary in the near future to exercise staff deposition \n     authority to obtain information from an Administration that \n     is increasingly obstructing the Committee's oversight work. I \n     appreciate your interest in how this authority has aided our \n     oversight work, and I have provided answers to your questions \n     below.\n       1. How many depositions has your committee conducted \n     pursuant to the authority granted by section 3(b) of H. Res. \n     5 (114th Congress) during this legislative session?\n       Response: The Ways and Means Committee has not needed to \n     compel depositions in 2015, largely because the threat of \n     using this authority has been successful in urging voluntary \n     cooperation with the Committee's oversight. However, the \n     Committee is in the process of requesting interviews with \n     eight Administration officials in the course of its \n     investigation of the Administration's decision to pay Cost \n     Sharing Reduction subsidies, despite the fact that Congress \n     did not appropriate funds for that purpose. The Committee has \n     notified the Administration that if these eight officials are \n     not produced for interviews willingly, the Committee will use \n     compulsory process. More information on this investigation is \n     provided in response to Question 3.\n       2. Was having this authority helpful in obtaining voluntary \n     interviews of one or more individuals in the course of your \n     committee's oversight in obtaining cooperation with document \n     requests? How many times would you estimate that this \n     authority resulted in voluntary interviews compliance with \n     investigative requests that might not have been possible \n     otherwise?\n       Response: Staff deposition authority was effective in \n     facilitating voluntary interviews in the course of the \n     Committee's oversight work. We estimate that the Committee \n     has\n\n[[Page H40]]\n\n     gained access to two Administration officials in the course \n     of two separate investigations into the Administration's \n     funding of the Cost Sharing Reduction program and the IRS's \n     obstruction of tax exempt applications by conservative \n     organizations. In the course of the Committee's Cost Sharing \n     Reduction investigation the Committee also sought and \n     obtained document productions from nine insurance companies \n     and a national insurance trade organization. Several of those \n     companies were reluctant to produce documents, and oral \n     reference to the Committee's authority to subpoena documents \n     and depose the companies' employees encouraged voluntary \n     compliance with our requests. More information about each of \n     these successes is provided below.\n       3. Please provide your rationale, including any relevant \n     examples, for why the Rules Committee should extend this \n     authority for your committee for the remainder of the \n     Congress.\n       Response: Staff deposition authority has been a key factor \n     in several investigations conducted by the Oversight \n     Subcommittee. Three examples illustrate this fact:\n       During the course of the Committee's investigation on the \n     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) unfairly targeting \n     conservative organizations applying for tax-exempt status, \n     the Administration was reluctant to cooperate with requests \n     to produce certain witnesses for interviews. One such witness \n     was Hannah Stott-Bumsted, who served as legal counsel to the \n     U.S. Department of the Treasury. During the course of the \n     investigation, staff discovered that the Administration knew \n     that some of Lois Lerner's e-mails were missing months before \n     the IRS informed the Committee. From our interviews, \n     Committee staff knew that an IRS employee, Catherine Duval, \n     likely told her friend, Stott-Bumsted, that the e-mails were \n     missing and that Stott-Bumsted then informed others in the \n     Administration. The Committee requested an interview with \n     Stott-Bumsted to confirm this information, but the Treasury \n     Department dragged out the request for months. When staff \n     suggested that the Committee would depose Stott-Bumsted if \n     Treasury would not produce her voluntarily for an interview, \n     Treasury agreed to produce her.\n       The Ways and Means Committee, along with the Energy and \n     Commerce Committee, is investigating the Administration's \n     decision to fund several programs established by the \n     President's health care law, including Cost Sharing Reduction \n     subsidies and the Basic Health Program, through an \n     appropriation reserved specifically for tax refunds. The \n     Committees believe that the method the Administration has \n     used to fund the Cost Sharing Reduction program and the Basic \n     Health Program may violate the Anti-Deficiency Act and \n     Article I, Sec. 9, Clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution \n     establishing Congress's appropriation authority. The Treasury \n     Department and the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) have refused to produce documents in response to the \n     Committees' inquiries. The Committees are in the process of \n     requesting interviews of Treasury and HHS employees. The \n     Committees already have interviewed a senior HHS official \n     regarding the Basic Health Program, and staff believes it was \n     unlikely that the Administration would have produced that \n     official for an informal interview if the Committees did not \n     have deposition authority. As the Administration continues to \n     ignore Congress's requests for information, deposition \n     authority will be a crucial tool in order to proceed with \n     these investigations.\n       While investigating the Administration's funding of the \n     Cost Sharing Reduction program, the Committee determined that \n     insurance companies might possess relevant information. The \n     Committee sought information and documents from nine \n     insurance companies and the trade organization America's \n     Health Insurance Plans. Although some companies complied \n     willingly with the request, others were reluctant to search \n     for or produce documents. During negotiations with those \n     companies, the Committee was able to persuade those companies \n     to produce documents by threatening to issue subpoenas and \n     depose employees. Fearing the reputational and financial \n     consequences of receiving a publicized subpoena or deposition \n     notification, the companies complied with the Committee's \n     requests.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and \n     for giving the Committee the opportunity to highlight the \n     value of deposition authority in its oversight work. If you \n     have any additional questions about the Committee's use of \n     staff deposition authority, please do not hesitate to contact \n     Tegan Gelfand with the Ways and Means Committee staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kevin Brady,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Committee on Rules,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2015.\n     Hon.

Should you or your staff have any questions, \n     please feel free to contact either myself or the Rules \n     Committee's staff director, Hugh Halpern.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Sessions.\n                                  ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, \n           and Technology,\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Pete Sessions,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sessions: On December 3, 2015, I received \n     your letter regarding the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology's authority to conduct staff depositions pursuant \n     to section 3(b) of H. Res. 5 (114th Congress). As you \n     indicated, the Committee's deposition authority expires at \n     the end of this session. I appreciate the opportunity to \n     highlight the many positive results the Committee has \n     obtained utilizing its deposition authority. I believe the \n     following responses to questions posed in your letter \n     reaffirms that deposition authority is a necessary tool for \n     conducting robust oversight of the executive branch and \n     limiting the overreaches of the Administration in its final \n     year.\n       1. How many depositions has your committee conducted \n     pursuant to the authority granted by section 3(b) of H. Res. \n     5 (114th Congress) during this legislative session?\n       On September 17, 2015, the Committee conducted a deposition \n     of National Weather Service (NWS) contract specialist Mark \n     Miller, who facilitated an inappropriate contract that cost \n     taxpayers nearly half a million dollars. In 2009, then-\n     National Weather Service Deputy Chief Financial Officer Peter \n     Jiron prepared to retire from the NWS. Mr. Jiron's \n     supervisor, then-Chief Financial Officer Robert Byrd, \n     suggested Mr. Jiron return to the NWS post-retirement as a \n     consultant. One month before officially retiring from the \n     NWS, Mr. Jiron negotiated the terms of his consultancy, \n     drafted and edited the associated Statement of Work, dratted \n     terms and conditions of his contract with NWS as a \n     consultant, and eventually signed the consulting agreement. \n     The contract Mr. Jiron drafted for himself increased his \n     salary and provided for housing at the expense of American \n     taxpayers. This contract is a violation of federal laws and \n     regulations because Mr. Jiron used his influential position \n     at NWS to obtain the consulting position.\n       According to a report by the Department of Commerce Office \n     of Inspector General, Mr. Miller had no concerns with Mr. \n     Jiron becoming a consultant immediately after his retirement \n     from the agency and had heard of other employees doing the \n     same thing. Mr. Miller's statement raises questions about \n     whether this type of contract misconduct occurs regularly. \n     Indeed, the OIG found the ``lack of understanding about \n     applicable laws and regulations on the part of multiple NOAA \n     officials'' so concerning that the OIG is ``taking steps to \n     ascertain whether this matter is indicative of more systemic \n     `revolving door' contracting problems within the agency. \n     Unfortunately, several former senior officials refused to \n     speak to the Committee voluntarily. After the Department of \n     Commerce failed to adequately respond to multiple letters \n     from the Committee requesting information, the Committee \n     determined the best course of action was to interview Mark \n     Miller because of his role facilitating Mr. Jiron's contract.\n       Because Mr. Miller is not a senior official at NWS and \n     there is no evidence indicating he intentionally committed \n     wrongdoing, the Committee requested to speak with him in a \n     private setting. Through his attorney, Mr. Miller refused to \n     voluntarily speak with Committee staff. Consequently, the \n     Committee issued a subpoena compelling Mr. Miller's testimony \n     in a deposition. During the deposition, Mr. Miller invoked \n     his 5th Amendment right. While Mr. Miller did not speak on \n     the record, the deposition made it possible for the Committee \n     to pursue immunity for Mr. Miller. Majority staff is \n     currently in discussions with Minority staff about moving \n     forward with immunity for Mr. Miller. This is significant \n     because the Committee not only has the opportunity to learn \n     what happened during the creation of Mr. Jiron's contract, \n     but also gives the Committee an opportunity to determine \n     whether it is a common occurrence for departing NWS officials \n     to draft their own consulting\n\n[[Page H41]]\n\n     contracts and whether legislation is necessary to remedy the \n     issue. Given Mr. Miller's knowledge of the agency's \n     contracting methods, he is in a unique position to provide \n     information regarding whether such incidents are a systemic \n     problem. The Committee is continuing to move forward with \n     this issue in large part because of deposition authority, \n     including the ability to recall Mr. Miller to continue his \n     deposition.\n       2. Was having this authority helpful in obtaining voluntary \n     interviews of one or more individuals in the course of your \n     committee's oversight or in obtaining cooperation with \n     document requests? How many times would you estimate that \n     this authority resulted in voluntary interviews compliance \n     with investigative requests that might not have been possible \n     otherwise?\n       Yes, during this session there are numerous instances of \n     the Committee obtaining documents and voluntary interviews \n     because of its deposition authority. In fact, as the \n     following examples show, many key interviews and documents \n     would likely not have been obtained without the Committee's \n     ability to compel on-the-record interviews in a private \n     setting.\n\n\n                     nws: contracting mismanagement\n\n       Earth Resources Technology (ERT), the consulting firm who \n     employed former National Weather Service (NWS) Deputy Chief \n     Financial Officer Peter Jiron after he drafted his own post-\n     retirement contract, was reluctant to speak with Committee \n     staff. The company is a women-owned small business that \n     apparently did not intentionally facilitate the inappropriate \n     contract. Appearing at a public hearing would likely have \n     been embarrassing for the company's CEO, Dr. Jingli Yang. As \n     a result, after reviewing the Committee's rules regarding \n     compulsory process for depositions, Dr. Yang's representative \n     agreed to make her available voluntarily.\n       During the Committee's questioning of Dr. Yang, she \n     acknowledged flaws in the contracting system that allowed Mr. \n     Jiron's contract to move forward. For instance, there was not \n     a safeguard in place to ensure that new ERT contractors were \n     not current government employees. ERT relied on each new \n     contractor to receive permission from ethics officials at \n     individual agencies, but did not keep track internally. As a \n     result of the Committee's questioning, ERT is implementing a \n     plan to include additional steps in its contracting process \n     when hiring new contractors, including paperwork to ensure \n     contractors are not currently government employees. \n     Additionally, ERT provided e-mails to the Committee regarding \n     the facilitation of Mr. Jiron's consulting contract.\n       Furthermore, during the Committee's investigation of \n     contracting misconduct at NWS, the agency initially refused \n     to provide documents or make agency officials available to \n     the Committee. After the Committee considered the use of \n     compulsory process for agency officials to appear for \n     interviews, the agency agreed to provide several key \n     officials voluntarily, including Laura Furgione, the Deputy \n     Assistant Administrator of NWS. Moreover, after the Committee \n     requested to speak with additional NWS employees, the agency \n     voluntarily began producing documents and information. Among \n     the documents produced were e-mails between Mr. Jiron and Mr. \n     Byrd, the former Chief Financial Officer at NWS, discussing \n     Mr. Jiron's improper consulting contract.\n\n\n                    noaa: questionable climate study\n\n       This past summer, National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA) released a study refuting the long-\n     established findings that warming of the earth experienced a \n     hiatus during much of that past two decades. This study has \n     large implications because it changes historical temperature \n     data to show increased warming and is therefore used to \n     justify costly regulations and further action on climate \n     change. Shortly after publication of the study, the Committee \n     began investigating the circumstances surrounding its \n     release, sending a letter to NOAA requesting documents and \n     information related to the publication of the study. After \n     NOAA's unwillingness to produce communications related to the \n     study, the Committee issued a subpoena in October 2013, The \n     Committee continues to investigate the publication of this \n     study, especially in light of whistleblower allegations that \n     divulged potential political interference with the scientific \n     process and that NOAA scientists were uncomfortable with the \n     study's methodology and conclusions. While NOAA has still not \n     produced all requested and subpoenaed communications, NOAA \n     agreed to make the authors of the study available voluntarily \n     for questioning by Committee staff.\n       Additionally, following the Committee's subpoena in October \n     2013 to NOAA for communications related to the study refuting \n     a hiatus in the rise of earth's temperature, NOAA officials \n     refused to comply with the subpoena. Shortly thereafter, the \n     Committee informed NOAA of its need to interview agency \n     officials who had a significant role in the agency's \n     publication and release of the study. Following conversations \n     with NOAA officials informing the agency of the Committee's \n     ability to compel testimony, NOAA has agreed to arrange for \n     the requested individuals to meet voluntarily with Committee \n     staff.\n\n\n                   nist: manufacturing illegal drugs\n\n       On July 18, 2015, National Institute of Standards (NIST) \n     Police Officer Christopher Bartley caused an explosion on the \n     NIST campus while attempting to manufacture the illegal drug \n     methamphetamine. The Committee sent a letter requesting \n     documents and information on July 22, 2015. NIST officials \n     initially insisted that the matter was being managed by the \n     Department of Commerce Officer of Inspector General and law \n     enforcement officials. After considering the use of \n     compulsory process to obtain interviews with agency staff \n     regarding NIST's unresponsiveness, NIST agreed to voluntarily \n     make Willie Mays, the Director of NIST, available to \n     Committee staff.\n       During questioning by Committee staff, Director May \n     acknowledged for the first time the existence of building \n     records revealing the names of each individual NIST employee \n     that entered the building where the explosion occurred. After \n     obtaining the building records, Committee staff was able to \n     track the movements of Mr. Bartley and who he interacted with \n     leading up to the explosion. Despite telling Committee staff \n     that four officers are on duty at all times at NIST, the \n     building records reveal that only two officers were on duty \n     during the explosion. The Committee continues to investigate \n     misconduct and mismanagement at NIST Police Services.\n\n\n                            EPA: Pebble Mine\n\n       During the course of the Committee's ongoing investigation \n     into EPA's actions to limit the Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay, \n     Alaska, the Committee learned information concerning an EPA \n     regional administrator's involvement in spearheading the \n     EPA's actions to stop construction of the mine. When the \n     Committee spoke with EPA officials, explaining the \n     Committee's need to interview the regional administrator and \n     explaining the Committee's ability to compel testimony, the \n     EPA responded that it would make the regional administrator \n     available to the Committee voluntarily to answer questions \n     from Committee staff and for testimony at a congressional \n     hearing.\n\n\n                       EPA: Regulatory Overreach\n\n       During the Committee's ongoing oversight of the EPA's \n     regulatory and policy agenda, the Committee sent letters on \n     three separate matters in May of this year, requesting \n     documents concerning the agency's coordination with outside \n     environmental groups, proposed Waters of the United States \n     rule, and the agency's efforts to solicit public comments on \n     EPA regulations during the notice and comment period for \n     proposed ru1emakings. In the face of the agency's continued \n     slow rolling of its response to each of the three letters, \n     Committee staff spoke with agency officials, explaining the \n     Committee's authority to compel testimony from agency \n     officials directly relevant to each of the three inquiries. \n     Following the Committee's conversations with the EPA \n     explaining its authority, the agency began producing \n     documents responsive to the Committee's requests. \n     Additionally, the EPA agreed to make an agency official \n     directly relevant to the Committee's inquiries available \n     voluntarily for a briefing.\n       In September 2015, the Committee wrote to the EPA \n     concerning its plans to issue a proposed rule for ozone \n     National Ambient Air Quality Standards and requesting \n     interviews with two agency officials relevant to the \n     Committee's inquiry. During follow-up conversations with the \n     EPA concerning the Committee's request for interviews and \n     following significant push back from the EPA to making the \n     individuals available, Committee staff explained the \n     Committee's authority to compel testimony. Following these \n     discussions, the Committee expects that the EPA will \n     voluntarily provide a briefing on the matter with individuals \n     relevant to the Committee's inquiry.\n       3. Please provide your rationale, including any relevant \n     examples, for why the Rules Committee should extend this \n     authority for your committee for the remainder of the \n     Congress.\n       As evidenced by the many examples discussed in this letter, \n     the Committee's deposition authority has been a critical tool \n     used to further the Committee's oversight. The Committee's \n     authority to compel testimony has proven to be a key resource \n     in obtaining compliance from Executive Branch departments and \n     agencies with outstanding document and information requests, \n     as well as with obtaining access to government officials \n     essential to the Committee's inquiries for questioning by \n     Committee staff.\n       As the Obama Administration comes to an end in the next \n     year, the administration is working vigorously to finalize \n     more expansive regulations than ever to fulfill its \n     environmental agenda. Because of the administration's \n     tireless efforts, it is even more imperative for the \n     Committee to conduct robust oversight of the administration's \n     environmental initiatives by exercising oversight of agencies \n     directly within the Committee's jurisdictional authority, \n     including NOAA, NIST, and the EPA.\n       Further, a recent article in the Washington Post outlining \n     a few of the Committee's oversight initiatives this year \n     acknowledged that the Committee has taken on an ``aggressive \n     role in oversight.'' The Committee's ability to compel \n     testimony has proven to be a central component of the \n     Committee's ability to advance its investigations, while also \n     enhancing Congress' role as an institution to serve as a \n     check on the administration's policies.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share the Committee's \n     experience utilizing deposition authority. If you have any \n     questions, please\n\n[[Page H42]]\n\n     do not hesitate to contact me or my staff about this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lamar Smith,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) for \nyielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we begin the second session of the 114th Congress, \nthere is a long list of important issues that we could be talking about \ntoday.\n  We could be talking about ways to support job creation, to grow the \neconomy, to improve gun safety, to strengthen national security, to \npass an immigration reform bill, and many other important priorities.\n  Instead, we are talking about H.R. 3762, the latest attempt by House \nRepublicans to defund Planned Parenthood and to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  As our economy continues to recover, we should be focused on \nexpanding opportunity and helping more Americans get ahead. Instead, we \nare starting the new year by debating a bill that, if it ever became \nlaw, would put the health care of 22 million Americans in jeopardy and \nwould further restrict women's access to vital healthcare services.\n  This is yet another blatant political move by Republicans to appeal \nto and to appease their right-wing base. Republican leaders have said \nit themselves. Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn called this a \n``political exercise.'' He said, ``I think we all recognize the \nPresident isn't likely to sign this bill so it's not going to become a \nlaw.'' Then, why on earth are we wasting the American people's time \nwith this terrible bill?\n  This month we have heard that Speaker Ryan ``will push to turn the \nHouse into a platform for ambitious Republican policy ideas.'' The 62nd \nvote to repeal or to undermine the Affordable Care Act. The 11th vote \nto attack women's health. Really? That is the platform for ambitious \nRepublican policy ideas? I think the American people should sue \nRepublicans for malpractice.\n  When Speaker Ryan took the gavel last fall, there was so much talk \nabout a new chapter and fresh ideas. Instead, we are starting 2016 with \nmore of the stale and politically motivated bills we have become \naccustomed to in this Republican-controlled Congress. We are constantly \nbeing told by Republicans that they have better ideas and that they \nhave a better approach to health care. Really? Where is it?\n  I would remind my Republican friends that, in 2011, you passed a bill \nthat actually tasked you to come up with an alternative to the \nAffordable Care Act. You came up with nothing. Just last year you \npassed another bill to come up with an alternative, and, once again, \nyou came up with nothing.\n  Now here we are again with a bill that repeals the Affordable Care \nAct and that tasks the Republicans to come up with an alternative. I am \ncurious. Where is your alternative? Maybe it is in your notes. Is it \nhidden in some secret room in the Capitol? Maybe Donald Trump has it. \nPerhaps we should alert the Capitol Police. Better yet, maybe we could \ncall the FBI to locate the Republican plan on health care.\n  I remind my friends that you are in charge. You run this place. You \ncan bring whatever you want to this House floor. Maybe you should bring \na bloodhound to the House floor to try to find your alternative \nhealthcare plan.\n  Governing is something that my friends on the Republican side are not \nvery good at. They are very good about saying no to everything, but \nthey can't say yes to anything. The Republican plan on health care is, \nessentially, a sound bite. Their prescription is ``take two tax breaks \nand call me in the morning.''\n  Not only have the Republicans done nothing to expand health care for \nthe American people--and, again, they are in charge--but they have \nactually consistently tried to undermine health access for millions of \nAmericans, to take health care away from people in this country.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  If the Republicans had it their way and actually repealed the \nAffordable Care Act, millions of young people under the age of 26 would \nbe thrown off their parents' health plans, being a woman would once \nagain be a preexisting condition, and much more of the progress made by \nthe ACA would be rolled back.\n  Mr. Speaker, contrary to what we often hear from Republicans, the \nAffordable Care Act is not killing the economy. I know facts get in the \nway of their arguments, but the fact is that America has seen a record \n69 straight months of job growth and all signs point to this historic \ngrowth continuing.\n  In September 2012, when unemployment was at 8.1 percent, the \nRepublican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, claimed that the \nunemployment rate would stay at 8 percent if President Obama were \nreelected President. Well, President Obama was reelected President, and \nMitt Romney was wrong. What actually happened? The unemployment rate \nhas steadily dropped each year and is now at a 7-year low of 5 percent, \nwith employers adding about 210,000 jobs a month through last November \nas more Americans get back to work.\n  One of the frequent Republican claims that we have heard is that \nbusinesses would shift to part-time workers to avoid the Affordable \nCare Act's requirement to provide healthcare coverage to full-time \nemployees. A new study released this week shows that the ACA resulted \nin little change in the number of hours worked, including the first 6 \nmonths of 2015 when the employer mandate first took effect for larger \ncompanies.\n  As Politico noted, this study ``pokes a major hole in a beloved \nconservative talking point--that ObamaCare will force employers to cut \nemployees' hours.'' The truth is that researchers found no major \nchanges in the probability of people working fewer hours in 2013, 2014, \nor 2015.\n  We have also heard Republicans' claim that the ACA's expansion of \nMedicaid would decrease employment among low-income workers, but \nanother study released this week showed no major changes in the way \nlow-income workers fit into the labor market during the first 15 months \nof Medicaid expansion under ACA. Contrary to conservative talking \npoints, the new coverage didn't push low-income adults to switch jobs, \nmove from full-time to part-time work, or rush to find new jobs.\n  In fact, the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has \nmade a tremendous difference in increasing access to health care for \nAmerica's most vulnerable families. Since October of 2013, more than \n12.3 million Americans have been able to get coverage thanks to the \nexpansion of Medicaid. As a result of marketplace coverage and Medicaid \nexpansion, hospital uncompensated care costs were reduced by an \nestimated $7.4 billion in 2014, resulting in huge savings for consumers \nacross this country.\n  That is the difference between us. Democrats believe health care is a \nright and my Republican friends believe it is a privilege.\n  To make matters worse, the bill before us today would also defund \nPlanned Parenthood, which would put millions of low-income women--and \nmen, I would add--at risk of losing access to critical health services. \nThe fact is that one in five women has relied on a Planned Parenthood \nhealth center for care in her lifetime, and Planned Parenthood serves \n2.7 million patients each year.\n  Additionally, Planned Parenthood clinics often serve as one of the \nfew affordable care options available for many women and men. Cutting \noff access to the critical health services Planned Parenthood provides \nto some of our most vulnerable citizens is simply wrong. It is \nunconscionable. Sixty-three percent of voters, including 72 percent of \nindependents, agree. This whole effort to defund Planned Parenthood \nfits the Republican pattern of targeting poor people, and, quite \nfrankly, Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous.\n  While our Nation's community health centers do incredible work, the \nRepublican claim that community health centers by themselves could \nsuddenly pick up all the slack if Planned Parenthood is defunded is \njust not true, and my Republican friends\n\n[[Page H43]]\n\nknow that. The idea that our community health centers could overnight \nsuddenly step up and step in and cover millions of new patients is \nabsurd. In fact, in 21 percent of the counties with a Planned \nParenthood health center, Planned Parenthood is the only safety net \nfamily planning provider.\n  Finally, let me just also voice my strong objection to the provision \nin this rule which extends for another year the unrestricted authority \nfor four House committees to conduct staff depositions at any time, on \nany subject, for any reason. Some committees have barely used this \nauthority in the past year, and, when they have, it has often been \nabused with the threat of subpoena held over people's heads.\n  The power to compel American citizens to provide testimony under oath \nshould be rarely used and specifically authorized. Quite frankly, Mr. \nSpeaker, I think the American people are tired of the partisan witch \nhunts that we have grown accustomed to under this Republican leadership \nin this House.\n  We are starting the new year, not by working in a bipartisan way to \ndo the people's business. Unfortunately, we are starting the new year \ndebating the same old same old, bills that put politics ahead of \npeople. Mr. Speaker, that is truly sad.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Ratcliffe).\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is intrusive, it is expensive, \nand it is full of broken promises. Its biggest failure is the simple \nfact that it makes life more difficult for hardworking Americans. In my \ndistrict, I have heard countless horror stories from parents, from \nseniors, from businessowners, all of which underscore that there is \nsimply nothing affordable about the perversely named Affordable Care \nAct.\n  There is the story of Morris from Rowlett, Texas, who is the sole \nbreadwinner for his family. Now, the least expensive plan that Morris \ncould find on healthcare.gov costs him $854 per month, plus a $12,700 \ndeductible. ObamaCare is preventing Morris from investing in things \nthat really matter, like his son's college education.\n  Take Heather from Pottsboro, who on a $700-per-month income simply \ncan't afford the $287 per month that ObamaCare costs her. With health \nproblems of her own, ObamaCare is preventing Heather from taking care \nof her 13-year-old daughter and a father with multiple sclerosis.\n  Then there is Bryan, a small-business owner in my district who has \nseen a 50 percent increase in his monthly healthcare payments and \ndeductible under ObamaCare. On top of that, Bryan can't grow his \nbusiness beyond 50 employees because he can't afford to comply with the \nemployer mandate or face its penalties.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are just a few of the stories that demonstrate the \nvery real problems that ObamaCare is creating for hardworking Americans \nand why a better name for this law would be the Unaffordable Care Act. \nIt is why I stand in support today of a reconciliation bill that will \ndismantle ObamaCare and defund Planned Parenthood for the next year.\n  I promised my constituents that I would do more than just vote to \nrepeal ObamaCare, that I would help send a bill to the Oval Office that \nactually will get rid of this terrible law. Today, I am keeping that \npromise.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and \nthe reconciliation bill, just another budget measure being used as a \nvehicle to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  This is the 11th Republican attack on women's health in this \nCongress, including four prior votes to defund Planned Parenthood. \nWhile House Republicans have already passed 10 antiwomen health \nmeasures and are now voting on their 11th, they have not passed a \nsingle measure that helps women get the reproductive health care that \nthey need.\n  So here we are--Happy New Year and with a new House Speaker--facing \nthe same old story: Republican attacks on women's access to health care \nin the very first week. The news this morning reported Republicans are \nsaying this bill will show the American people the difference between \nthe political parties in this election year. For me, that is a shameful \nadmission. The difference is clear: My Republican colleagues remain \nwilling to play partisan politics at the expense of women's health \ncare. The women of America are watching, and they don't like what they \nsee.\n  Last fall, House Republicans threatened to shut down the government \nif must-pass omnibus legislation did not defund Planned Parenthood. \nNow, that effort was stopped, but only by promises to include a \ndefunding provision in this budget reconciliation bill and by the \ncreation of a select panel to investigate Planned Parenthood.\n  Never mind the fact that three House committees have already \ninvestigated Planned Parenthood following the release of selectively \nedited videos manufactured by an antiabortion group and that none of \nthese committees found any evidence of wrongdoing.\n  Apparently, uninterested in the facts, Republicans have continued to \nmake inflammatory and baseless claims. They also push forward on their \nnew select investigative panel, meaning even more taxpayer dollars will \nbe spent targeting the Nation's reproductive healthcare providers \ninstead of improving America's access to critical healthcare services.\n  Having established this select panel, House Republicans have now \nrefused to wait for the panel to hold even its first meeting before \nvoting, once again, to defund Planned Parenthood. In this atmosphere, \nit is hard to imagine that any investigation will be fair and \nobjective. Members have already declared the organization guilty as \ncharged, and there is no reason to believe that they will be more \nopenminded with regard to others who provide safe and legal \nreproductive healthcare services in this Nation.\n  Facts matter. The truth matters. Despite our objection to the \ncreation of the select panel, as its ranking member, I will work to \nensure that the investigation is as fair and transparent and as \nobjective as possible.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from Illinois.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. The relentless attacks on Planned Parenthood and \nother healthcare providers must stop and they will stop. Planned \nParenthood serves almost 3 million American women, and there is no \nevidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood to possibly justify the \ndefunding of the Nation's leading provider of reproductive health care \nwhose work helps to avoid thousands and thousands of abortions because \nthey provide planned parenthood.\n  We should stop this latest effort to defund Planned Parenthood--and \nwe will because this bill is going nowhere--and instead take \naffirmative steps to improve women's access to health care in this \ngreat Nation. Enough is enough.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the vice chairwoman of the Rules Committee.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, this rule and the underlying motion to concur \nwith the Senate amendment to H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' \nHealthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, mark a significant achievement \nfor Americans who value life and economic liberty.\n  After years of work and dozens of votes in the face of acerbic \nrhetoric hurled at us from across the aisle, this House will send to \nthe President's desk legislation to remove the heavy hand of the \nFederal Government from Americans' health care and end the stream of \ntaxpayer dollars that flows to an organization that brutally kills \nprecious unborn lives.\n  When the so-called Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, \nRepublicans warned that the law would cause significant increases in \nthe cost of health care and health insurance, reduce full-time jobs and \nwork-hours available, and strain the safety net until it breaks.\n  The American people were sold a bill of goods that has proven to be \nonly a list of empty promises. Most of us recall clearly these \nassurances: that we could keep our insurance plans, that we could keep \nour doctors, and that our out-of-pocket costs would go down.\n  Mr. Speaker, the letters, emails, and telephone calls from my \nconstituents\n\n[[Page H44]]\n\ntell me clearly that the Affordable Care Act has proven to be anything \nbut affordable for North Carolinians, and the law has limited access to \ncare and wasted billions of taxpayer dollars. It is time to undo this \nharmful law.\n  Also included in the Senate amendment is a provision first passed by \nthis House to stop the flow of Federal mandatory funds to Planned \nParenthood. While Planned Parenthood does not receive direct Federal \nfunding for abortions, these actions are warranted, as a recent report \nfrom the Government Accountability Office shows that the organization \nreceives an average of 500 million taxpayer dollars each year for other \nlines of business.\n  Money is fungible and the Federal funds that Planned Parenthood \nreceives ultimately subsidize their abortion services. Fortunately, \nthere are many more options for women's health care than the \ndiscredited abortion provider, Planned Parenthood.\n  While Planned Parenthood has only approximately 665 clinics, \nfederally qualified health centers, FQHCs, and rural health centers, \nRHCs, have more than 13,000 publicly supported locations providing \nalternatives for women's health care. This means there are 20 federally \nfunded comprehensive care clinics for every one Planned Parenthood. \nThis bill does not change the availability of funds for women's health. \nIt simply establishes a safeguard so that the Nation's largest abortion \nchain is not the one providing such services.\n  When Federal taxpayers have legitimate concerns that their hard-\nearned dollars are flowing to organizations that sanction the \ndismemberment of unborn children and that our system of law has \nloopholes allowing these atrocities to continue, we, as their elected \nrepresentatives, are responsible for ensuring these concerns are heard \nand responded to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, our freedom rests on the cornerstone right we \nall have to life, and I fear we have lost sight of that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying motion to \nprotect innocent lives and restore our liberty.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and join in strong \nopposition to this rule that will bring forward dangerous legislation \nthat harms women, seniors, and families across America.\n  In our first week back in this session, it is appalling that the \nRepublicans believe defunding Planned Parenthood, rolling back women's \naccess to health screenings, or raising prescription drug prices for \nseniors is a top priority.\n  This latest attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the ACA \nis nothing short of an attack on women and low-income Americans. \nSeventy-five percent of Planned Parenthood patients are low-income and \noften have nowhere else to go. Eliminating funding will have \ndevastating consequences on the health of young women and men, Latinas, \nand LGBT Americans.\n  This isn't just dangerous public policy. It is completely out of \ntouch with the vast majority of Americans.\n  When I meet with my constituents across Phoenix, I hear families \nworried about affording college, students struggling to pay their \ntuition and the amount of debt they have, and hardworking Americans who \ncan't afford the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. But I also \nhear relief: relief that came from the ACA, relief from young women who \nno longer have to pay for copays for birth control when they go to the \npharmacy, relief that their annual exams no longer come with cost \nsharing, relief from seniors whose prescription drug costs are lower \nbecause we got rid of the Medicare doughnut hole, relief from parents \nthat their child with chronic disease can't be denied insurance \ncoverage--all thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n  Women and all Americans deserve better than playing the same politics \nover their bodies and their health care. I urge my colleagues to defeat \nthis dangerous rule and oppose the reconciliation package on behalf of \nmillions of families who can't afford to lose care once again.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield 3 minutes \nto the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a strong member of the \nCommittee on Rules.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my Committee on Rules colleague for \nyielding, and I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  This is a monumental vote. For the first time since Republicans took \ncontrol of this House in 2011, we are in a position to send a bill to \nthe President's desk that would dismantle ObamaCare and eliminate \nFederal funding for Planned Parenthood, who we know sold body parts \nfrom aborted babies. This piece of legislation is about listening to \nthe American people and working to advance their concerns right here in \nthe people's House.\n  ObamaCare is fundamentally broken. It is not making health care more \naffordable. In fact, it is doing just the opposite. As The New York \nTimes pointed out just the other day, many Americans find it cheaper to \npay the tax penalty and remain uninsured instead of signing up for a \nhealthcare plan they simply cannot afford. That is exactly the opposite \nof how this law was supposed to work.\n  My colleagues on the other side say that Republicans want to take \naway people's health care. Let me tell you what took away people's \nhealth care: this law did.\n  I hear stories every time I go to the grocery store or hold a \ntownhall meeting from people who had a healthcare plan that they liked, \na plan they could afford, a plan that worked for them. Now, the \nPresident said over and over again, ``If you like your healthcare plan, \nyou can keep it.'' That was not true.\n  The people of the United States suffer today because they lost their \nhealthcare plans or they simply can't afford the cost and the new \nhealthcare plan that has been forced on them. If you want to talk about \ntaking away people's health care from someone, that is what this law \ndid. That is what the President of the United States did and what he \ncontinues to do with this law.\n  We need to move past this government-mandated healthcare plan and \ninstead empower the American people and their doctors. The people don't \nwant the Federal Government to tell them what type of health insurance \nthey need or what doctors they should see. That is simply not the role \nof the Federal Government. We should get rid of this awful law and, \ninstead, move forward with healthcare reform that puts the interests of \nthe patient first, not the interests of the Federal Government.\n  Let's pass this bill and send it to the President's desk, and then he \ngets to make a choice. He can stand with the American people or he can \nstand against the American people. If he chooses to veto this bill, \nthen the American people will have seen a clear choice between two \ndifferent Americas: an America where the government knows best or an \nAmerica where the people, the hardworking people who have made our \ncountry great, where the people are empowered.\n  Let's make the President decide. Let's hold him accountable. Let's do \nthe work of our constituents, and let's pass this bill on behalf of \nevery American who lost their healthcare plan or saw their healthcare \ncosts increase. Let's do this for them.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Alabama says this is a \nmonumental vote. Let me get this straight. A bill that is going to the \nWhite House that will get the fastest veto that we have ever seen ever \nhappen in this country is somehow a monumental vote? I would suggest to \nmy Republican colleagues, if they think this is a monumental vote, they \nhave low standards.\n  This is a political sound bite. This is a waste of taxpayer money. \nThis is just a waste of everybody's time. We ought to be talking about \nhow to strengthen this economy, about how to get more people health \ncare, not these political sound bites that really waste precious \nresources here in the Congress and, by the way, cost taxpayers money. \nAll this wasted debate here, all this wasted time is costing taxpayers \nmoney.\n\n[[Page H45]]\n\n  Let's find ways to make the Affordable Care Act even better. Let's \nfind ways to make sure that 100 percent of the people in this country \nhave the health care that they need, not be debating a sound bite, by \nthe way, that, if it ever passed, would throw 22 million people off of \nhealth care. How can you go back to your districts and be proud of \nthat?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Loretta Sanchez).\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts for the time.\n  Here we go again. Congress reconvenes and the majority is starting \nout the new year doing the same old thing. We come back from the \nholidays, a time for family, for reflection, and we begin this new year \nwith a vote to cripple the health care of our families. The vote today \nwould defund Planned Parenthood, and it would repeal essential pieces \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I really don't know how else to put this except to say \nthat the Affordable Care Act works. It actually works for the people \nthat I represent, for Californians, and for Americans, especially those \nwho never had health care before.\n  Not only has this law been affirmed constitutionally by our Supreme \nCourt, it has survived countless votes to dismantle it in this Chamber \nand the other. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the folks in my \ndistrict have seen massive improvement in their community. From 2012 to \n2014, more than 60,000 people at home in my area now have health \ninsurance, and they never had it before.\n\n  This is just about partisan politics today. You are right, Mr. \nMcGovern, it is just about partisan politics. Instead of focusing on \nthe issues that are important to our families--immigration reform, \naddressing climate change, creating jobs--no, here we go back again.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's cut the partisan politics. Let's do what families \nneed. Let's vote against this.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield 2 minutes \nto a new Member from the great State of Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the \nrule and the underlying bill, and I commend the months of hard work \nfrom my colleagues to put together this historic piece of legislation. \nI likewise thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the other side of the aisle acts as though words are \nmeaningless. The truth is the President promised the American people \nthat, if they liked their insurance, they could keep it. He promised. \nHe promised also that this would be more affordable health care.\n  The reality, Mr. Speaker, is none of those promises were true. In \nfact, now we have millions of Americans who have lost their insurance \nbecause of this bill. We have millions of Americans now who are in a \nsituation having to decide between drastically increasing health \ninsurance costs that they have to pay or facing penalties and \nconsequences for not participating.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President also promised that this healthcare law, \nObamaCare, would boost the economy. In fact, it has discouraged \nbusinesses from hiring more than 50 people and from having more than 30 \nhours a week for their workers to work.\n  The President also told the American people that ObamaCare would not \nincrease the deficit. As has already been mentioned here today, that is \nabsolutely wrong. The CBO has clearly identified how the cost is going \nto increase tremendously.\n  This reconciliation package remedies the harm and the devastation of \nthe broken promises of this President. It repeals the very foundation \nof ObamaCare and places a 1-year moratorium on funding Planned \nParenthood.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, this is Alice in Wonderland. First the \nverdict, then the trial. The Republicans have declared the verdict \nagainst Planned Parenthood before ever holding the trial. With no shred \nof evidence aside from a series of blatantly manipulated videos, \nwithout a single House committee finding any wrongdoing, without the \nselect committee ostensibly set up to look at Planned Parenthood \nholding a single meeting, they have decided in this bill to cut off all \nFederal funding, including Medicaid reimbursement, for one \norganization.\n  The legislation we are voting on today targets one organization and \ncuts it off from all Federal funding, including reimbursement for \nMedicaid services provided, for no justifiable legislative reason \nbeyond punishment for offering a constitutionally protected medical \nprocedure.\n  This smacks of a clearly unconstitutional bill of attainder. The \nprohibition on bills of attainder exists to prevent just this kind of \ntargeted attack on a single group. You cannot use legislation to punish \na single organization without any evidence or fair legislative process \nsimply because you don't like it.\n  While the legislation never mentions the words ``Planned \nParenthood,'' we have heard and will hear here today Planned \nParenthood's name over and over again from my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle during this debate. No one can say this bill is not \naimed directly at one organization.\n  Of course, if the Republicans in Congress had any evidence that \nPlanned Parenthood broke the law, they would have taken it to the \nAttorney General or the FBI, but they didn't. If they had any faith in \nthe extremists who made these accusations against Planned Parenthood, \nthey would have brought them before Congress to testify, but they \ndidn't. The truth is this attack on Planned Parenthood is knowingly \nbased on a whole series of lies.\n  The longer the Republicans keep up this pretense in order to stoke \nthe flames with their inflammatory rhetoric, the longer they put \npatients and providers at risk of unstable people committing murder, as \nwe have seen at abortion clinics. Bulletproof glass and safe rooms \nshould not be necessary for women to access basic health care like \ncancer screenings or contraception, but if this farcical attack on \nPlanned Parenthood doesn't stop, that would be the norm for women \naround the country. You want a breast exam, you want contraception, you \nput your life at risk.\n  Do not be fooled by claims that this funding will go to other \nhealthcare providers and Planned Parenthood's patients will follow it. \nIt is simply not true. More than half of Planned Parenthood's patients \nrely on Medicaid. Most States do not have enough providers, \nparticularly specialists like OB/GYNs, taking Medicaid patients to \nabsorb Planned Parenthood's patients.\n  By voting to defund Planned Parenthood today, you are leaving 2.7 \nmillion women, men, and families with no access to health care. Enough \nis enough. It is time for my Republican colleagues to accept what they \nknow is true. Planned Parenthood has done nothing more than provide \ncompassionate, comprehensive care for millions of Americans in a safe, \nlegal manner.\n  Stop the rhetoric. Stop the lies. Don't deprive people of abortion \nservices, of healthcare services, of contraception services, of breast \nexams. Vote ``no'' on this rule, vote ``no'' on the underlying bill, \nand don't violate the Constitution with a bill of attainder.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support \nthis rule and final passage of H.R. 3762.\n  Since I was first sworn in to the House, my top priority has been to \nrepeal this disastrous healthcare law we call ObamaCare. Finally, today \nwe have an opportunity to send to the President's desk legislation that \nrepeals ObamaCare.\n  Today we are going to end the individual mandate, stop the employer \nmandate, and repeal dozens of taxes and provisions that prevent people \nfrom actually getting affordable health coverage. I have always said we \nshould incentivize health savings accounts, not tax them, and this bill \nrepeals the tax on HSAs.\n  It is obvious that ObamaCare has done nothing to reduce healthcare \ncosts. I hear from many of the local business owners and constituents \nin my district every day about their struggle to comply with the law, \nlet\n\n[[Page H46]]\n\nalone provide health coverage for their employees and their families.\n  Manufacturers, construction companies, and retail store owners are \nfacing dramatic increases to their administrative and healthcare costs. \nThis leaves them in the dangerous position of ObamaCare driving them \nout of business by making those decisions.\n  Since signing it into law, the President has delayed or repealed \nparts of ObamaCare for political reasons. This was a bad law to begin \nwith because it is fundamentally unworkable and unaffordable. It is \ntime to repeal it once and for all.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and support the passage of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just say that this debate is astonishing to me. What is so \ncontroversial on the Republican side is that millions and millions more \nAmericans have health care. I heard someone over there say that fewer \npeople have health care. They can't produce any validators to support \nthat statement. CBO and a whole bunch of other validators have actually \nsaid more people have health care.\n  If they get their way, 22 million people will lose their health care. \nThat is what this is about. This is about whether or not people in this \ncountry deserve health care or whether or not they don't, whether or \nnot you think health care is a right or whether, as my Republican \nfriends say, it is a privilege. We think it is a right.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nMassachusetts for his leadership, and I thank him for yielding.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, here we go again and again and again. Once more, \npoliticians are invading the bedrooms of the American women.\n  I stand with Planned Parenthood. We will not go back.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare \nFreedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. This bill guts ObamaCare, \neliminating many of the penalties and programs that have been \nimplemented over the last several years by this administration.\n  Americans have been saddled with the burden of a healthcare insurance \nsystem that restricts what doctor they can see, what services they can \nreceive, and has even limited them to who they can have as their \npharmacist.\n  If the President signs this bill into law, we can return the power of \nour healthcare system back to the American people. Americans should be \nin charge of their healthcare system, not Washington, D.C.\n  With this bill, Congress will eliminate the individual mandate, the \nemployer mandate, and repeal all future appropriated funds to the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund that has supported the failing \nObamaCare law for the last several years.\n  It repeals the medical device tax, the excise tax on high-cost health \ninsurance plans, and the $2,500 limit on flexible spending accounts. It \nalso repeals ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion eligibility pathway, which \nhas left many States suffering with budget problems, and it restricts \nFederal funding to Planned Parenthood and its affiliated clinics for a \nperiod of 1 year, with appropriate funds being redirected to Community \nHealth Centers to better serve women and their health.\n  This bill returns to the American people a system that is driven by \nthe market, not by artificial formulas and percentages created by \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  As a pharmacist and former owner of three independent pharmacies, I \ncan assure you the only way to lower costs and create an opportunity \nfor everyone to participate is by allowing the free market to work as \nit was meant to.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and this bill so that we \ncan eliminate this burdensome healthcare plan and bring greater \nopportunities for Americans to receive affordable health care.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have \nunveiled their new ideas for moving America forward, which include \ntrying to repeal or undermine for the 62nd time the Affordable Care Act \nand for the 11th time attacking women's health care, both of which are \nguaranteed to be vetoed by President Obama.\n  So one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over \nagain, expecting a different result. There will be no different result \ntoday.\n  The Affordable Care Act will remain the law of the land, and Planned \nParenthood will not be defunded. The Republicans know this. Because if \nthe Affordable Care Act were actually to be repealed, over 22 million \nAmericans would lose their health coverage, including 3.5 million \nCalifornians, and the Republicans have no plan for how they will fix \nthis immediate healthcare crisis. In addition, millions more will lose \nhealthcare access if Planned Parenthood were to be defunded.\n  If you want to look at hyperpartisan bills that waste time, squander \ntaxpayer resources, and are going nowhere, look at the GOP agenda. If \nyou want ideas that will move America forward, such as investing in \neducation, reducing carbon pollution, and creating jobs, look at the \nDemocratic agenda. At least we are not insane.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Huelskamp).\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding.\n  For months now, Americans have--in horror--watched gruesome \nundercover videos detailing Planned Parenthood's barbaric practice of \nharvesting little baby body parts for profit. In one heartbreaking \nstory, a whistleblower described how Planned Parenthood carved up the \nface of a baby boy whose heart was still beating and then harvested his \nintact brain.\n  As a father of four beautiful children by adoption, I listened to \nthis gut-wrenching recollection only to think about millions of \ndestroyed lives that won't be given the chance at life my kids \nreceived.\n\n  It is time to stop funneling millions of taxpayer funds to this \nabortion giant that prides itself in snuffing out the lives of innocent \nbabies and then profiting off their little victims.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 3762.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just respond to the gentleman that the overwhelming majority \nof the American people actually support Planned Parenthood. That is in \nspite of all the attacks and all the accusations that have no basis and \nthat have been hurled at them by my Republican friends.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues that Planned Parenthood provides \na number of services to patients, such as family planning counseling \nand contraception. They provide pregnancy tests and Pap tests. They \nprovide lifesaving breast exams.\n  This is an organization that provides for the health and well-being \nof millions of people in this country, mostly poor women. Maybe that \nmakes it easier for my friends on the other side to attack this program \nand this organization--because they primarily provide help to poor \nwomen--but that is what Planned Parenthood is about.\n  And so this is an important organization, a good organization. That \nis why a majority of Americans support it. My friends are on the wrong \nside of public opinion on this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, taxpayer money should not be used for abortions, period. \nTaxpayer money should not be used to support abortion providers, \nperiod.\n  As Americans, we are proud to support life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness. Yet, in the last fiscal year, $554 million of taxpayer \nmoney went to support Planned Parenthood. In the same year, it was \nresponsible for the death of 323,999 innocent babies, even dismembering \nand selling baby parts. These lost children are a deep scar on our \nNation.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have countered that \nPlanned Parenthood does more than provide\n\n[[Page H47]]\n\nabortions. Well, let's take a look at the facts. According to Planned \nParenthood's own 2014-2015 annual report, cancer screenings are down 27 \npercent, family planning and contraceptive services are down 18 \npercent, and STD prevention and treatments are down 6 percent. Planned \nParenthood's services declined in the same year that they received a \nnearly 5 percent increase in Federal funding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are accountable for American taxpayer dollars. H.R. \n3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, \ndefunds Planned Parenthood and shifts those same taxpayer dollars to \nthe much larger network of community health clinics that do not provide \nabortions. This legislation will increase access to healthcare services \nfor women while upholding and strengthening the value of life.\n  H.R. 3762 also defunds the unmitigated disaster known as ObamaCare. \nPresident Obama said you can keep your health plan. Well, we found out \nmillions can't. President Obama called this affordable. Well, it's not. \nPremiums have gone up.\n  Americans deserve the freedom to choose the health plan that is right \nfor them, not the one selected by President Obama.\n  Please join me in supporting H.R. 3762 to protect taxpayer dollars \nfrom being spent on abortions while increasing access to healthcare \nservices for women, as we also defund ObamaCare and its legislation.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just have to correct the record. The gentleman said that taxpayer \nmoney should not be spent on abortions. It can't be. That is the law. I \ndon't know what he is talking about.\n  I also should point out to the gentleman that more than 90 percent of \nwhat Planned Parenthood does is preventative care.\n  So I get it. It is the political rhetoric that people get carried \naway with. But let's at least try to stick to facts at least a little \nbit. Let's also understand--so my colleague has no confusion here--that \nthe law here is that no taxpayer money can be spent for abortions. So \nlet's clear that up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis).\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise, obviously, to support the rule, \nbut I also rise in strong support of the Restoring Americans' \nHealthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, a crucial piece of legislation \nwith bicameral support.\n  This bill continues our efforts to protect patients, families, \ntaxpayers, and communities across the Nation. It will lift the burdens \nof the President's healthcare law and give back the power over \nhealthcare decisions to individual patients and families.\n  This bill gives us the opportunity to take crucial steps toward a \nmore patient-centered healthcare system. It gives us the opportunity to \nreduce our Nation's deficit by repealing the majority of the burdensome \nhealthcare taxes and ending harsh penalties.\n  This legislation also gives us the opportunity to save lives. In \nlight of Planned Parenthood's unethical and potentially illegal \nactivity, I firmly believe our taxpayers should not be forced to pay \nfor such organizations. We must protect the rights of taxpayers and, \nmore importantly, the rights of the unborn.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  As I have said before, I remain dedicated to giving a voice to our \nmost fragile Americans who cannot speak for themselves. I am proud this \nlegislation helps us protect those who need protection most.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this good bill.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Other than a verbal \nassault against Planned Parenthood and a verbal assault against the \nAffordable Care Act, this bill will do nothing. It is going to be \nvetoed really quickly. Maybe it is red meat for the political base, but \nif that satisfies your political base, great. I would say they are a \ncheap date if this is what it takes to satisfy them.\n  But we ought to be dealing with some serious issues here, and I am \ngoing to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question. If we do, \nI will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan \nlegislation that would close a glaring loophole in our gun laws \nallowing suspected terrorists to legally buy firearms.\n  The bill would bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those on \nthe FBI's terrorist watch list. I don't know why that is so \ncontroversial, but some of my friends find that to be a controversial \nissue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure for many \ndifferent reasons, but let me just touch on three.\n  One, Gordon Sullivan was former Chief of Staff of the United States \nArmy, and he once observed that hope was not a method.\n  Irregardless of the good intentions behind the Affordable Care Act, I \nthink that, from an actuarial standpoint, if you really look at it, you \nwould have to say that hope was, indeed, part of the method.\n  I say that because if you look at the number of young people that \nwere anticipated to sign up, already 7.5 million folks have said: No, I \nam not signing up, I would rather take the penalty than sign up. And \nwhat that creates is a big liability for the taxpayer.\n  Two, I would make the point that there have been real implications \nfor the small-business person. We have a company back home in \nCharleston by the name of East Bay Deli. The owner came to me just a \nnumber of weeks ago and said: Look, I was going to open up a couple of \nmore shops but, given the cost that I have seen with the Affordable \nCare Act for my small business, I am not going to do that. Ninety \nemployees that won't have jobs as a consequence.\n  Finally, our healthcare system has been predicated on a doctor-\npatient relationship. That Hippocratic Oath, that direct tie between \ndoctor and patient, is part and parcel to the whole system. Yet the \nAffordable Care Act, again, in the whole, begins to undermine that.\n  So for many different reasons, those three among them, I rise in \nsupport of this measure.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Rangel).\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am almost embarrassed to get up here and \ndiscuss this legislation and believe that its sponsors really think \nthat it is going to become law. That is what the reputation of the \nCongress is supposed to be all about.\n  But even when it is such an important decision, we like to talk about \nthings that we are doing as a matter of life and death, but we don't \nreally mean it. It is just a political expression.\n  But when you are talking about health care and realize that this is \nthe only industrialized country left that has not seen fit to believe \nthat health care is a matter of right, it goes beyond politics when we \npass a bill so that people throughout the United States will be able to \nenjoy health care, that we don't find one Member of the opposition \nparty joining in that legislation.\n  It is beyond belief that people can complain that not enough young \npeople are signing up, or that employers are skeptical, or that there \nare people who lack confidence in this bill, when the majority party in \nthis Congress has condemned this bill with such utter contempt that, \nfor over 50 times, they would come and attempt to repeal it, and then \nexpect that everybody should have confidence in it.\n  Why are we doing this? How can any party dislike, hate, or disagree \nwith the President so much that they would spend millions of dollars of \nthe taxpayers' money to attack a national healthcare-providing bill and \nnot have the least idea as to whether or not,\n\n[[Page H48]]\n\nfirst of all, they know it is not going to become law, but not enough \ncommon sense and decency to provide an alternative.\n  We all know that 7 years ago, when President Obama was first elected, \nthat the leaders of the Republican Party said that their first job \nwould be to get rid of President Obama.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 20 seconds.\n  Mr. RANGEL. I thank the gentleman.\n  I close by saying, everybody here knows this will never become law. \nIt is a political statement. As a politician, there is nothing wrong \nwith political statements. But to have one that is so wrapped up with \nhypocrisy and hatred is very awkward for us to continue in this body \nand believe that anything we attempt to do to send to the President \nwould have anyone believing that we are doing it because it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Walorski).\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule for the Restoring \nAmericans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n  This important legislation would repeal the employer and individual \nmandates, the ObamaCare slush fund, and the numerous harmful taxes on \neverything from medical devices to health insurers to the insurance \nplans themselves.\n  Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is an unpopular, failed law. Polls have shown \nit, elections have demonstrated it, and rising premiums have proven it.\n  I wasn't in this body when this law passed. I was watching in horror \nwith the rest of the American people as the legislative process was \nrailroaded to push it through.\n  But let's consider the contrast today to what we have before us, a \nbill that both the House and the Senate came together to guide through \nthe normal legislative process.\n  Let's start 2016 the right way and make President Obama own this law \nin a way that he has not had to do yet. Let's continue to work here in \nCongress toward a commonsense plan to replace this damaging law.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, a picture is always worth a thousand \nwords, and this is a picture of words. It is very clear that the \nAffordable Care Act has been a lifesaver for many Americans. And this \nbudget reconciliation act is obviously misdirected, wrong directed, and \nthe 62nd time this body has tried to gut ObamaCare.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for vetoing it, no matter whether it came \nfrom the Senate or the House.\n  We worked, without ceasing, to get a bill that would cover millions \nof Americans. It was a deliberative process, and everyone had a right \nto vote.\n  The Republicans refused to vote for good health care, and here we \nare, 13 million Americans benefitted from $1.1 billion in rebates for \nhealth insurance; 105 million Americans, including 71 million Americans \nin private plans and 34 million in Medicare.\n  Last August, millions of women began receiving free coverage for \ncomprehensive women's care; 17 million children with preexisting \nconditions have insurance; 6.6 million young people have insurance; 6.3 \nmillion seniors.\n  And, of course, they want to attack Planned Parenthood, which \nprovides vulnerable women with health care.\n  I don't know what they view the budget reconciliation act, but I call \nit the Anti-New Year's Celebration. Now that we have a new year, we \nhave this horrible bill. Vote against it, and vote for a thousand words \nright here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule for H.R. 3762, the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n  I oppose the rule for H.R. 2762 for three reasons: 1. The rule only \nallows one hour of debate equally divided between the supporters and \nopponents of the rule; 2. This is not an open rule that would allow for \namendments that could have been offered improve the bill; and 3. The \nPresident has communicated to the House that he will veto this bill if \nit is not amended.\n  The House needs more time to debate this bill because it could mean a \nreturn to the days when nearly 20% of Americans had seriously deficient \nhealthcare coverage or none at all.\n  Unfortunately this rule for the underlying bill is the latest GOP \nattempt to end the Affordable Care Act guarantee of access to health \ninsurance for millions of Americans and not an attempt to improve the \nlives of working men and women or their families.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 3762, \nwould result in 22 million Americans losing their health coverage after \n2017.\n  The impact of the bill should it become law is significant and should \nhave more than an hour of debate prior to a vote.\n  The worse thing about this bill is that the authors are well aware of \nthe public reaction should it become law, and this is why it would not \ngo into effect during 2016, but 2017 after the general election and \nwould remove health coverage for those who are the most vulnerable such \nas those who have coverage under the Medicaid expansion.\n  I also object that this is a closed rule that does not allow \namendments that could provide support for bipartisan efforts to improve \nthe bill.\n  Instead of attempting to repeal and undermine this law, we should use \nour time to work together to make improvements where necessary such as \nending the so called ``Cadillac Tax'' and making sure that health \ninsurance is focused on providing the care prescribed by doctors and \nnot health insurance plans.\n  Finally, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill because the \nAdministration has made it clear that this bill will be vetoed if \npresented for signature by the President.\n  The House has important work it should be doing such as voting on \nlegislation to create new infrastructure to support the 21st century \nneed for universal high-speed broadband access and; closing the gap in \nSTEM employment opportunities and skills that has over 1 million \npositions that are going unfilled; and strengthening gun safety by \nincreasing the number of agents at the ATF to ensure that all gun \ndealers are following the law; and promoting greater access to mental \nhealth services.\n  Instead we continue to waste time on fighting the Affordable Care Law \nin ways that would hurt Americans who need affordable, assessable and \navailable healthcare we could be engaged in productive legislative \nwork.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues reject this bad rule and the \nflawed underlying legislation.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire of my friend from \nMassachusetts if he has any further speakers remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Right now, just me.\n  Mr. WOODALL. I am going to ask the good doctor to close us today. I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have great affection for my friends on the other side \nof the aisle, but I don't understand their obsession with trying to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act or their obsession with trying to defund \nPlanned Parenthood. I mean, if they get their way on the Affordable \nCare Act, they would throw 22 million people out of their health \ninsurance plans; 22 million people would lose their coverage.\n  Young people who are 26 years old and under would lose their \nhealthcare benefits. Right now they can stay on their family's \nhealthcare plans up to 26. They would lose that.\n  It used to be that if you are a woman it would be considered a \npreexisting condition and your insurance rates would be higher. The \nAffordable Care Act prevents that.\n  The doughnut hole in the prescription drug plan, the cost to senior \ncitizens, is closing. Ultimately, we will eliminate that doughnut hole \nbecause of the Affordable Care Act. That is all good.\n  Medicare's solvency has been expanded because of this. Millions more \npeople have health insurance as a result. That is a good thing. But \nthey want to take it away.\n  On Planned Parenthood, I mean, most of what they do is provide \npreventative care to women. They want to take that away. It is cruel. \nIt is a cruel thing to do.\n  I can't believe that there isn't bipartisan consensus in this place \nthat health care is something that people need and we ought to make \nsure they have access to it.\n  My friends have been in charge of this Congress for a long time. They \ncan't even offer an alternative. They can tell us what they are \nagainst, but they can't tell us what they are for. They have done \nnothing to help expand the ability of people to get health insurance in \nthis country. All they do is\n\n[[Page H49]]\n\ncome to the floor and talk about repealing bills that will make it more \ndifficult for people.\n  I can't understand how you get up every morning and go to work and \nthat is your mission, to make it more difficult for people in this \ncountry, to throw 22 million people off the health insurance rolls, to \nmake it more difficult for vulnerable women to get preventative care at \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  That is the mission. That is how we are beginning this new year. And \nit really is sad, and it is really disheartening, I think, for a lot of \nus who came here to try to make a difference in people's lives, to try \nto help improve the quality of life for people.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this terrible, terrible bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nLewisville, Texas (Mr. Burgess), a good doctor who doesn't just talk \nabout health care, but who does get up every morning to provide that \nhealth care to Americans.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, since this bill passed the House in March of 2010, \nprobably half of the Congress has changed. So for the benefit of people \nwho were not here in March of 2010, who did not see this debate in its \nfull-throated entirety in 2010, I want to just revisit a couple of the \nsalient pieces that led up to the passage of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act.\n  People may ask themselves, why doesn't this law enjoy more \npopularity? In fact, the night it was passed, as reported on CNN, the \nAmerican people were opposed to the passage of this law by about 52 \npercent. That number is essentially unchanged almost 6 years later.\n  And what was the promise of the Affordable Care Act? Well, let me \nremind people. And don't take my word for it. This is in the \ninestimable words of Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor from MIT \nwho published a graphic novel about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n       Yay. Hooray. Everyone will be able to afford insurance. You \n     won't have to worry about going broke if you get sick. We \n     will start to bring the cost of health care under control, \n     and we will do this all while reducing the Federal deficit.\n\n  Why wasn't it more popular when it was passed?\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, here we are, about 2 weeks after Christmas Eve, \nand it was Christmas Eve of 2009 when this bill passed the Senate.\n  And I would remind people in this body, it was not a House bill that \npassed the Senate. Well, I take that back. It was a House bill. It was \nH.R. 3590. That was a bill dealing with veterans' housing that had \npassed this House July of 2009 and had nothing to do with health care.\n  But because this bill, this law, was a massive piece of tax policy, \nit had to originate in the House. Except it didn't, but the bill number \noriginated in the House.\n  So the bill that was passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve in 2009, \nwith a big snowstorm bearing down on Washington, D.C., every Senator \nwanting to get out of town and get home to their district, the bill \nthat was passed read as follows: ``Strike all after the enacting clause \nand insert--''\n  That means it took out all the housing language and put in all the \nhealthcare language and, more importantly, all of the tax policy.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  That bill passed the Senate with 60 votes. Of course at that time, \nDemocrats held a 60-vote majority in the Senate, and it allegedly was \nto come back to a conference committee with the House except that the \nSenate lost a Democratic Senator in that timeframe. Harry Reid told the \nthen-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, that he no longer had 60 votes \nand there was simply nothing more he could do. It was up to the Speaker \nof the House to pass the Senate bill with no changes because he could \nnot bring it back before the Senate because he no longer had 60 votes.\n  So the next 3 months, literally, were consumed with arm-twisting, \nkneecapping, and trying to convince people to vote for something that \nwas against their fundamental best interest. So is it a surprise that \nit did not enjoy popular support on the day it was passed and it has \nnot achieved popular support even with all the giveaways and even with \nall the Federal money pumped into it since that time?\n  The reason, Mr. Speaker, is very simple. At the heart of this--at the \nheart of this--is a very coercive--really, it is unique in Federal \npolicy. The Federal Government tells you what you have to do. You have \nto buy a healthcare policy. Then they seek to regulate it under the \nCommerce Clause.\n  It was the most convoluted logic anyone had ever seen. But it was \ncoercive, and that coerciveness led to the corrosiveness that has \nunderlain the Affordable Care Act ever since.\n  No wonder people look at this. It was conceived--it was conceived--in \na falsehood and then delivered to the American people under a false \npromise. Indeed, it has harmed--as we have heard over and over again \nfrom people that it has harmed--individuals in individual districts \nacross this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of the rule and in support of \nthe reconciliation bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 579 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       Strike all after the resolved clause and insert:\n       That immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member\n\n[[Page H50]]\n\n     who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. \n     That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an \n     amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of \n     amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question on House \nResolution 579 will be followed by 5-minute votes on adoption of House \nResolution 579, if ordered; ordering the previous question on House \nResolution 580; and adoption of House Resolution 580, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 239,

The Clerk will designate the motion.\n  The text of the motion is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Price of Georgia moves that the House concur in the \n     Senate amendment to H.R. 3762.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 3762, the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  This is a big day. For the first time--for the first time--since the \nlaw was enacted, Congress is one vote away from sending a broad repeal \nof ObamaCare to the President's desk. This marks a significant step in \nthe fight for patient-centered health care for all Americans. It will \nlay the foundation for how Congress can begin to roll back the \ndisastrous policies that are destroying the sacred doctor-patient \nrelationship.\n  The legislation before us today is critical to our larger effort to \nrid America's healthcare system from undue Washington interference and \nbureaucratic dictates and pave the way for real, positive, patient-\ncentered\n\n[[Page H55]]\n\nhealth reform that puts patients and families and doctors in charge of \nhealthcare decisions.\n  This bill repeals the most corrosive components of ObamaCare. It \neliminates nearly a trillion dollars in onerous ObamaCare taxes and \neliminates the individual and employer mandate penalties, key pillars \nof the ObamaCare scheme.\n  Under ObamaCare, millions of Americans have been added to a Medicaid \nsystem that fails to provide its beneficiaries with adequate access to \nphysicians and other providers. We end that.\n  Expanding Medicaid is not the answer. Reforming Medicaid so that \nStates have greater flexibility to care for those in need is the \nanswer.\n  This legislation also repeals the premium subsidies and tax credits \nwhich have failed to control and, in fact, have increased health \ncoverage costs. The current law has made healthcare coverage less \naffordable and less accessible for millions of Americans.\n  All of this would be done on a timeline to allow for a new, positive \nsolution that will make the purchase of health insurance financially \nfeasible for all Americans and do so in a way that gives individuals, \nfamilies, and employers the power to choose the type of coverage that \nthey want for themselves, not that Washington forces them to buy.\n  H.R. 3762 also halts Federal funding for abortion providers that are \nprohibited under this legislation. It increases--increases, Mr. \nSpeaker--the funding for community healthcare centers to help direct \nmore resources to women's direct care. Taken together, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that this bill would reduce the \ndeficit by $516 billion over the next decade.\n  Seven separate committees and the full House and Senate have \ncontributed to this effort. The entire reconciliation would not have \nbeen possible had the House and Senate not first agreed to a budget \nresolution conference agreement. The budget gave Congress the authority \nto pursue the reconciliation process and, through that, the opportunity \nto put this repeal of ObamaCare on the President's desk.\n  Ultimately, however, the American people are less interested in \nprocess and procedure. They want results, and they want to know who is \nfighting to improve their way of life, who is working to provide relief \nto the biggest challenges facing individuals and families and job \ncreators today.\n  No matter how you slice it, ObamaCare is harming the American people. \nPremiums and deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are going up, \nnot down, as the President had promised. Millions of Americans have \nbeen kicked off the coverage that they had. That is less access and \nfewer choices at a higher cost. That is exactly the opposite direction \nwe need to be going, and the American people know it.\n  We all want a healthcare system that is affordable and accessible and \nresponsive to our individual needs, full of choices and innovative \ntreatment options and of the highest quality. That is not too much to \nask, Mr. Speaker. It is certainly achievable, but only if we pursue \npatient-centered solutions that are focused on embracing those \nprinciples in health care that we all hold dear.\n  I look forward to this debate and the opportunity to share with the \nAmerican people how we solve this challenge, the challenge in America's \nhealthcare system, by putting them in charge of their healthcare \ndecisions, not Washington.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution, this measure. \nLet's take this final step in reconciliation to send an ObamaCare \nrepeal bill to the President's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This is a sad and shameful way to begin the new year 2016 here in the \nUnited States Congress.\n  This bill is entitled Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act, the freedom of health insurance companies to once \nagain deny health care to people based on preexisting conditions.\n  It may be a new year, Mr. Speaker, but here we go again. We are in \nthis Congress, on the floor of this House for the 62nd time with this \neffort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and, to add insult to \ninjury, to deny millions of women access to healthcare choices by \ntargeting Planned Parenthood.\n  While the calendar has changed, the Tea Party Republican agenda \nremains the same. Despite all the pressing issues we face in this \ncountry at home and abroad, the only thing and the first thing our \nRepublican colleagues decide to bring to the floor of the House as the \nmost pressing business to start 2016 is to take away access to \naffordable care from 22 million Americans and deny access to affordable \ncare for millions of American women.\n  That 22 million figure, Mr. Speaker, that is not my figure. That is \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that has looked at this \nlegislation and concluded that, as a result of this bill, 22 million \nAmericans will lose access to their affordable health insurance. It \nwill be the freedom to be uninsured, the freedom to not have any \nopportunity to have coverage when your family has healthcare needs.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you look at this chart, you can see that the \nAffordable Care Act has already made a dramatic difference in bringing \ndown the number of uninsured in the United States of America, yet here \nwe are in a new year, and the first act of this Republican Congress \nwill be to turn back the clock and change that figure.\n  I really hope, Mr. Speaker, that our colleagues will begin to focus \non more important issues in the days ahead. Everybody knows that this \nwill take about a nanosecond for the President of the United States to \nveto because the President of the United States is not going to allow \n22 million Americans to lose their access to affordable health \ninsurance, and the President is not going to allow millions of \nAmericans and millions of American women to lose access to reproductive \nchoice and a range of healthcare options here in the United States.\n\n  It is disturbing, shameful, and sad that this is the way we are \nstarting the new year. I hope we get on to more important business, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Committee on Ways \nand Means, who was a leader of one of the multiple committees involved \nin this.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in \nsupport of the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation \nAct.\n  Under the leadership of Committee on the Budget chairman, Dr. Price, \nand our Speaker, Paul Ryan, we will soon deliver an ObamaCare dismantle \nbill to the President's desk.\n  By passing this legislation:\n  We will fulfill our promise to use every possible tool to stop the \nPresident's expensive healthcare law;\n  We will eliminate the unpopular mandates of the backbone of the \nAffordable Care Act;\n  We will protect Americans from tax penalties for failing to purchase \nan expensive Washington-approved product that just so many people at \nhome can't afford;\n  We will end the tax penalties facing America's job creators who don't \noffer health insurance that meets Washington bureaucrats' very \nexpensive tastes;\n  We will deliver real relief from a dozen Democrat tax increases that \ndrive American jobs overseas and punish American workers;\n  We will protect taxpayer dollars by repealing an ObamaCare slush fund \nand ensuring that your taxpayer subsidies don't go to people who aren't \neligible for them, and if they do, they are returned to the Treasury;\n  We will--and this is important to me--demonstrate our strong \ncommitment to women's health. Instead of funding Planned Parenthood and \nits gruesome practices, we will fund high-quality community health \ncenters, and we will help ensure more women have access to quality \nhealth care.\n  We are here today with a bill that cuts taxes, spending, and the \ndeficit because this Congress did its job.\n  In closing, while our Democrat friends often accuse us of \nrelentlessly and tirelessly pursuing the repeal of the President's \nhealthcare law, the reason is we are fighting for our families and our \npatients and our local businesses who have been harmed by it.\n\n[[Page H56]]\n\n  Yes, the President will surely veto the bill, even though this bill \nhas strong popular support. My belief is that exercising your \nconstitutional right and power to legislate is never wasted if you are \nfighting for principles your constituents believe in.\n  Give the American people a clear moral choice. Let the President \nexplain why his healthcare law is raising costs on so many American \nfamilies and businesses. Let him stand on the wrong side of history by \ndefending unethical medical practices that, frankly, many Americans \nfind abhorrent.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, it seems to me expanding access to \naffordable health care for 22 million Americans who didn't have it is \nbeing on the right side of history.\n  I am now pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Colorado \n(Ms. DeGette), a distinguished member of the panel which, I am sorry to \nsay, was set up as part of a witch hunt against Planned Parenthood, but \nI am glad she is there.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, the House Republican leadership has a funny \nway of wishing the working families of America Happy New Year. Under \nthis bill, the first substantive legislation of 2016, women and their \nfamilies will be hit with a one-two punch to their access to health \ncare.\n  First, with the latest attempt to repeal the ACA, House Republicans \nwould remove the tax credits that help millions of Americans afford \nquality health insurance. When families lose that insurance, women \nwould also lose their free annual wellness exams they get from their \nproviders under the ACA.\n  Just to pile on, at the same time millions of women would lose their \nfree wellness exams, this bill would inhibit their ability to get \naffordable well-woman and family-planning services from Planned \nParenthood. More than 3 million American women and men get essential \nhealth care from Planned Parenthood every year, and even more would \nneed to if the ACA were repealed.\n  In many parts of the country, Planned Parenthood is the only provider \nthat offers access to reproductive health services within hundreds of \nmiles. There are no health clinics that would take over that gap. \nEliminating Federal funding to the organization would limit women's \naccess to cancer screenings, breast exams, and so much more, and all \nbecause of an unfounded vendetta against Planned Parenthood.\n  Happy New Year, women and families of America.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 \nminutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), the chairman of \nthe Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Price for yielding.\n  I rise today in strong, strong support of the Restoring Americans' \nHealthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.\n  We have all heard the stories and the statistics, seen the charts. \nObamaCare is wreaking havoc on our country, on small-business owners, \non working families, and even on students. It is a flawed law that has \nled to higher costs for consumers, fewer full-time jobs for workers, \nand less access to trusted healthcare providers for patients.\n  That is why we in Congress have been relentless in our efforts to put \nan end to ObamaCare and its harmful consequences. It is why we have \nworked to protect hardworking Americans who are still paying the price \nfor the President's government takeover of health care, and it is why \nwe are here today.\n  The bill before us will eliminate key provisions in the President's \nhealthcare law that are hurting families, small businesses, and \nschools. Under this proposal, the tax penalty levied against \nindividuals who fail to purchase government-approved health insurance \nwill be gone. The tax penalty levied against small businesses and \nschools that fail to provide costly, government-approved health \ninsurance will be gone. The onerous and arbitrary limits on personal \nhealth savings accounts and flexible spending accounts will be gone. \nThe punitive tax on medical innovation will be gone.\n  These and other provisions in the bill will dismantle a fatally \nflawed law as well as reduce Federal spending and rein in our Nation's \ndeficits by roughly half a trillion dollars. These are priorities the \nAmerican people sent us to Washington to address, and we owe it to the \nmen and women we represent to do just that.\n  We have a responsibility to support this bill and to send it to the \nPresident's desk. I believe the President has a responsibility to sign \nit. If he does, it wouldn't be the first time the President has helped \nroll back his own healthcare law. In fact, on more than 15 separate \noccasions, the President has signed legislation repealing provisions in \nthe law, not to mention the dozens of changes to the law his \nadministration has carried out unilaterally.\n  The legislation is an opportunity for the President to work with us \nto move the country in a better direction and show the American people \nthat their priorities are our priorities.\n  It is also an opportunity to demonstrate once again we are serious \nabout reducing the size and cost of the Federal Government, serious \nabout dismantling a healthcare law that is doing more harm than good, \nand serious about paving the way to real reform that expands access to \naffordable coverage. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  In closing, I want to thank Chairman Tom Price and all of our \ncolleagues who serve on the House Committee on the Budget as well as \nthose who serve on the Committees on Ways and Means, Energy and \nCommerce, and Education and the Workforce. Their hard work has made it \npossible to send this important legislation to the President's desk. I \nam grateful for their efforts. Let's get on with it.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the ranking member on the Select \nInvestigative Panel on Planned Parenthood. She will be there looking \nafter the interests of American women, I am pleased to say.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is a committee where I serve as the \nranking Democratic member. We call it the Select Committee to Attack \nWomen's Health.\n  Now, that select committee was formed last fall after hearings were \nheld and at which the Republicans accused in inflammatory language that \nsomehow Planned Parenthood had violated the law.\n  So these three committees that have already investigated Planned \nParenthood have found absolutely nothing wrong with their activities. \nYet, a select committee was appointed.\n  The kind of language that was used is exactly the language that the \nmurderer at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado used. This kind of \ninflammatory language is used on one of the number one health providers \nfor poor women in this country, and it is being attacked unnecessarily.\n  Now, I serve as the ranking member on that select committee. We will \ndo everything we can to not only defend Planned Parenthood, but to stop \nthese relentless attacks on women's health care in this country. It is \nshameful. Enough is enough.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, we have a bill to restore America's \nhealthcare freedom--yes, we do--one that will finally get to the \nPresident's desk.\n  This legislation seeks to protect folks in Michigan and all across \nthe country from the rising costs, fewer choices, lost coverage, and \ncountless broken promises that have defined the President's healthcare \nlaw.\n  Importantly, it would also give Congress time to enact better \nsolutions focused on growing patient choice and improving patient care, \nlowering costs, providing States like Michigan greater flexibility, and \npromoting bottom-up 21st-century healthcare innovations.\n  The current healthcare law relies on outdated programs of the past \nand forces a one-size-fits-all approach on our States that is \nunresponsive to patient needs. Folks in Michigan deserve better. The \nAmerican people deserve better. And you know what? We can do better.\n  I helped coauthor one commonsense plan to replace the health law. It \nis the Patient CARE Act. It is a pragmatic\n\n[[Page H57]]\n\nsolution--in fact, the only bicameral proposal that has been offered--\nthat repeals the law and replaces it with patient-focused reforms that \nreduce healthcare costs and increase access to affordable, high-quality \ncare.\n  We empower the American people to make the best healthcare choices \nfor themselves and their families. It allows Governors the flexibility \nto best provide for their citizens, all while driving down costs and \nimproving quality.\n  Under the proposal, no one can be denied coverage based on a \npreexisting condition. This proposal has other consumer protections as \nwell. Insurance companies would be prohibited from imposing lifetime \nlimits on a consumer. Dependents up to age 26 would be able to stay on \ntheir parents' plan, and guaranteed renewability would ensure that sick \npatients would be able to renew their coverage.\n  We also provide a refundable tax credit for the most vulnerable \nconsumers to buy health coverage or healthcare services of their own \nchoosing, not expensive insurance that Washington would force them to \nbuy or face a penalty.\n  Michiganders covered under Medicaid today would also benefit. The \nreforms in the Patient CARE Act would make the Medicaid program more \nsustainable for taxpayers, and better management tools will make the \nprogram more efficient, fair, and accountable for everyone who depends \non it.\n  This plan and the countless solutions offered by my Republican \ncolleagues in Congress shines a spotlight on a better vision for health \ncare, one focused on patients, families, doctors, and insurance.\n  This health law may have been enacted only a few years ago, but its \ngovernment-centered premise is not a new one. These obsolete ideas have \nfailed people time and time again. The public deserves a fresh, \nforward-looking approach that embraces 21st-century innovation.\n  So we have got a solution to restore America's healthcare freedom, to \nput ObamaCare in the rearview mirror and replace it with better \nhealthcare solutions like the Patient CARE Act. It is time to put \npatients first. Let them make the choices, not the government.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  With all due respect to Mr. Upton and putting aside the merits of \nthis bill, this is the 62nd time we are voting to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  We have never seen a vote in this House on any kind of so-called \nsubstitute to the Affordable Care Act. Our Republican colleagues have \nbeen full of talk, and we haven't seen any action.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a \nmember of the Budget Committee.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I must tell you how disappointed I am that we \nare not starting the new year here with fresh, new, bipartisan \ninitiatives to create jobs and to move our economy forward.\n  I just feel like this is for auld lang syne. This is our 62nd vote to \nrepeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. And, Mr. Speaker, I expect \nyou to break out in a few verses of ``Auld Lang Syne'' anytime now.\n  Is it for auld lang syne that 22 million Americans might actually \nlose their health insurance if the President would somehow sign this \ninto law?\n  Is it for auld lang syne that the Republicans and you, Mr. Speaker, \nare proposing that we attack women's health once again and take away \nthe primary care physician for poor women, 4 out of 10 who say is their \nonly source of health care?\n  Is it for auld lang syne that Planned Parenthood visitors--men and \nwomen--who have incomes of 150 percent or below the Federal poverty \nlevel will lose their health insurance?\n  Is it for auld lang syne that the 62nd repeal vote is taking place so \nthat half of the health centers are in rural or medically underserved \nareas?\n  Let's get to work, Mr. Speaker, on fresh, new ideas and not auld lang \nsyne.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita), the vice chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Price for his leadership. I \nam very proud of the work that the committee has done to get us to this \npoint--one vote away from this bill getting to the President's desk--\nbecause then the President will finally have a chance to right one of \nthe wrongs which bears his name and to stop the horrific and unethical \nmedical practices occurring at Planned Parenthood.\n  This reconciliation bill repeals a number of onerous taxes created by \nthe Affordable Care Act. Taxes have slowed the economic recovery, which \nmeans ObamaCare literally keeps people in my district, whom I care \ndeeply about, from getting jobs.\n\n  This bill represents the economic development bill the last speaker \nspoke of. And ObamaCare increases health insurance costs for most \nAmericans. So instead of spending more on their families over \nChristmas, people in Indiana and all over this country paid more to \ninsurance companies instead, all because of ObamaCare.\n  This repeal bill will save Americans $516 billion over the next 10 \nyears, money they can spend as they see fit instead of how Washington \nDemocrats dictated at the end of 2009. These are important steps to \nreturning our healthcare system to us, where decisions are made by \nAmericans and their doctors, not the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, in districts such as mine, many of the plans sold on the \nObamaCare government exchange are classified as small or extra small, \nmeaning that, in many cases, less than 10 percent of the doctors in the \narea are accessible to these families. This means that many Indiana \nfamilies have had to give up their doctor and, in some cases, travel an \nhour or more just to get basic medical attention.\n  Timothy Gerking of Danville, Indiana, has seen his insurance costs \nfor a family of three increase from $400 a month in 2012 to over $1,200 \na month in 2016, along with higher deductibles and copays. How is he \nsupposed to save for college for his kids? How is he supposed to plan \nfor retirement if he is paying $14,000 a year in premiums?\n  This is all despite the President's promise that ``if you like your \nhealthcare plan, you can keep it.'' That was an outright lie to the \nAmerican people then, and ObamaCare is still one of the most insidious \nlaws ever produced today.\n  The President now has a chance to correct the wrong that he and the \nDemocrats have done to millions of Americans. I hope that opportunity \nis taken by him when it gets to his desk.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), a friend and colleague and the Democratic whip, \nwho understands that providing health care to 22 million Americans who \ndidn't have it is a good thing.\n  Mr. HOYER. The ranking member took the words right out of my mouth. \nThere are 22 million Americans covered now that weren't covered before.\n  Mr. Speaker, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, ``House \nSpeaker Paul Ryan, starting this month, will push to turn the Chamber \ninto a platform for ambitious Republican policy ideas.''\n  My friend, Mr. Upton, talked about policy ideas, but Mr. Van Hollen \ncorrectly observed they are not on this floor. You haven't brought them \nto this floor. All you have brought is a negative. Bring a positive. \nThat, presumably, is what your Speaker ought to be talking about.\n  Many have been wondering what new, ambitious ideas Republicans would \nput forward to kick off this new session of the 114th Congress. Well, \ntoday we have the answer, the 62nd effort to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct, which everybody knows is not going anywhere.\n  We have seen this fresh, new idea before. It is coupled with a vote \nto defund Planned Parenthood, which will deny millions of Americans \naccess to affordable health care.\n  So not only by repealing the Affordable Care Act will we deny health \ncare to people, but by doing what they are doing to Planned Parenthood, \nmillions of people will not have access to the health care they are \nrelying on.\n  What we have before us is not anything new. In fact, it is a repeal \nof health reform that goes even further than the Republicans brought to \nthe House floor in October, this time also ending tax credits and \nsubsidies that enable those with modest incomes to afford health \ninsurance and repealing the expansion of Medicaid.\n\n[[Page H58]]\n\n  The reason there is not another bill on the floor is because people \nwould then see how draconian the policies are. These are components of \nthe Affordable Care Act that have enabled millions of previously \nuninsured Americans to gain coverage since 2010.\n  Senate Republicans took a bad bill and made it worse. I am \ndisappointed that Speaker Ryan would bring it to the floor as his first \nmajor act of this new session of Congress.\n  This reconciliation bill would cause an estimated 22 million \nAmericans, as the ranking member has pointed out, to lose their health \ncare, would increase premiums by approximately 20 percent, would \nprovide employers with much uncertainty, and worsen the outlook for \ndeficits over the long term.\n  Only in the first 10-year window do you have a savings. The CBO says, \nif you go to the second 10 years, this bill is a loser and exacerbates \nthe deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this 62nd vote to repeal \nor undermine America's access to affordable, quality health care.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), a fellow physician who is the chair \nof the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee of the \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. I thank Dr. Price for the work his committee \nhas done.\n  I practiced medicine in rural Tennessee for 30 years. I didn't talk \nabout health care. I actually provided it for patients. It was a major \nreason that I ran for Congress.\n  The premise of the Affordable Care Act was to increase access and \ndecrease costs. Everybody in this building agrees on that. What we got \nwas a 2,500-page bill that few people read that defined what you bought \nand then fined you when you didn't buy it, even if you couldn't afford \nit. That is what has actually happened.\n  Healthcare decisions should be made between families, patients, and \ntheir doctors, not by big insurance companies and certainly not by \nFederal bureaucrats.\n  So what is happening to middle class working people in this country \ntoday? Their out-of-pockets and copays have skyrocketed. In the \nhospital that I worked in, 60 percent of the uncollectible debt is now \nowed by people with insurance. That is because they cannot afford the \nout-of-pockets and copays.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  We Republicans have had many ideas. Dr. Price has a bill. I \ncoauthored a bill with the Republican Study Committee to replace this, \nand I will suggest, Mr. Speaker, that you will see that on this floor \nto be debated if we are successful in doing this.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Pocan), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, we were told just a couple of months ago on \nthe floor of this Congress that there is a new day in Congress. Well, \nit doesn't feel like a new day. It feels a lot like Groundhog Day.\n  I feel like Bill Murray from that early 1990s movie. I wake up, I \nshower, I get on a plane, I come to Washington, I plan on voting how to \ncreate jobs or help lift people's wages. Instead, I am voting on taking \naway health care from 22 million people.\n  The next week, I wake up, I shower, I get on a plane, I fly to \nWashington. What do I do? I vote on taking away health insurance for 22 \nmillion people.\n  Sixty-two times this body has voted to repeal health care. But we \nhave also now made a new one of a dozen times we have now devoted to \ndefund Planned Parenthood which, with this body's Speaker, in my home \nState of Wisconsin, means 62,000 women last year would not have gotten \naccess to health insurance.\n  It is no wonder that with bad, recycled ideas like that, the public \nhas such disdain for Congress. It is not a new day in Congress. It is \njust Groundhog Day.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black), a fellow healthcare \nprofessional, who is a member of both the Budget Committee and the Ways \nand Means Committee.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand Planned Parenthood's \nannual report, and in these pages, you will find the true war on women.\n  By their own numbers, taxpayer funding for this organization is up, \nwhile preventative healthcare services are down and abortions continue \nto stand at over 320,000 a year.\n  I am proud to support today's reconciliation bill to defund Planned \nParenthood and to redirect those dollars to true preventative \nhealthcare services for women, because Americans, and women, in \nparticular, deserve better than this.\n  We may not be able to change the President's heart on this issue--\ngoodness knows we have tried--but we can put him on record. If this \nPresident truly thinks that my constituents' tax dollars should fund \nthis scandal-ridden abortion giant, that is on his conscience, but he \nshould at least be forced to put a pen on paper and explain the belief \nto the American people.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Levin), the ranking member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this bill is reckless and has zero chance of \nbecoming law. But most significantly, it is heartless. What it says \nfrom Republicans here to millions, an Unhappy New Year. You could take \nhealthcare insurance away from 22 million people. To them, these 22 \nmillion, from Republicans, an Unhappy New Year.\n  It will repeal funding for Medicaid expansion in 30 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, leaving 14 million low-income Americans without \nhealth care. To those 14 million Americans, from House Republicans, an \nUnhappy New Year.\n  It would eliminate the tax credits for low-income families and \nindividuals, a key part of what makes ACA affordable. It would \neliminate the individual and employer mandates, undermining the patient \nprotections and access measures that helped dramatically reduce the \nrate of uninsured in this country.\n  The Republicans are also using this bill to continue their \nideological obsession with depriving women access to affordable family \nplanning services and lifesaving cancer screenings by defunding Planned \nParenthood.\n  This bill deserves not only the veto that is coming, but a ``no'' \nvote on the floor of this House.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a fellow physician and member \nof the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank Chairman Price for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an important day in the House of Representatives \nbecause the House is preparing to send a package directly to the \nPresident. There will be no Senate filibuster. We have gotten around \nthat issue. This bill goes to the President directly, and he can either \nsign it or veto it. But this bill repeals the very foundation of \nObamaCare, and it stops Planned Parenthood funding. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  This package is also important to me because I have a provision in \nthere that I authored that repeals this employer mandate. This has been \na really bad piece of legislation that was in place, this employer \nmandate, because it has forced small businesses to limit hiring or to \nresort to part-time employees. This is just a terrible thing, at a time \nwhen unemployment has been high and people are looking for work.\n  This bill will help undermine and get rid of the foundation of \nObamaCare which, I know as a physician, has accelerated the negative \ntrends in health care, of which there are many. I can't get into all of \nthem now, but that is not the affordable, patient-centered health care \nthat the American people deserve.\n  We can do much better. We will do much better. This is the first \nstep.\n  Let's put this on the President's desk. Let's call his hand, and \nlet's either force him to veto this, which we will try to override it, \nor sign it.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I don't think that the President is \ngoing to mull over this decision for very long. He is going to veto \nthis because the President doesn't want to deny 22\n\n[[Page H59]]\n\nmillion Americans access to affordable care, which is exactly what the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office tells us is what this will do, \nand he doesn't want to deny access to health care to millions of women \nand families.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone), the distinguished ranking member on the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, here we are again. It is a new year and a \nnew session of Congress, but House Republicans are yet again up to \ntheir old partisan tricks.\n  Today, House Republicans have chosen to spend the first week of 2016 \nattacking women's health with a radical GOP reconciliation bill which \nwould defund Planned Parenthood and strip away affordable family \nplanning services and lifesaving care for millions of women across the \ncountry.\n  Overall, this is the 11th time the House majority has voted to attack \nwomen's health in this Congress, including 4 prior votes to defund \nPlanned Parenthood. Meanwhile, it is also the 62nd repeal vote of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this reconciliation bill is futile. It is political. It \nis unfortunate. We have a lot of work to do to help working families in \nthis country, and today's bill reverses great progress in healthcare \ncoverage and access and increases the deficit.\n  In fact, CBO estimates that this extreme legislation would increase \nthe uninsured by about 22 million Americans after 2017. We also know \nthat, if defunded, Planned Parenthood's 2.7 million patients would be \nleft without care, resulting in dangerous consequences.\n  Just look at what is happening in States that have already \nimplemented this radical agenda. In Indiana, such policies led to an \nHIV epidemic, and in Texas, it left tens of thousands of women without \naccess to contraceptive care and increased incidences of life-\nthreatening at-home abortions.\n  We can't allow the rest of the country to go down this dangerous \npath, all because of the ideological and political whims of \npoliticians.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can go on and on about the consequences of this bill, \nbut driven by an extreme agenda, Republican policies are harmful, and \nthey have to be rejected. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time \nremaining on each side, please?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 13 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Maryland has 16\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), who has been a champion \nfor patient-centered health care and is the vice chairman of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the lie of the year for 2013 was that \ndubious phrase, ``If you like your health care, you can keep it.'' We \nknow that the deception has become obvious. And what we do know is that \n7 million Americans lost their employer-sponsored health insurance \nbecause of the ObamaCare bill.\n  We also know how harmful this has been to seniors; $700 billion was \nraided, raided from Medicare, the Medicare trust fund, by the way.\n  What we know from our constituents is that when they go to the \nexchanges and shop, they end up with a product that--we are even \nhearing from the insurance companies. There is one of them that says \nthey never should have been there and they are probably going to pull \nout next year and the product is too expensive to afford and too \nexpensive to use. Premiums are up by double digits in a single year. \nOut-of-pocket costs are soaring.\n  This is why having an ObamaCare insurance card does not give you \naccess to affordable health care. It does not give you access to \naffordable health care. It is, indeed, unaffordable.\n  We know the injury will continue to hardworking Americans. That is \nwhy we stand united today in supporting the reconciliation bill and the \nrepeal of ObamaCare.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. McDermott), a member of the Budget Committee and the \nWays and Means Committee.\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, here we are again, the same fraudulent \nbill being brought out here again.\n  The gentleman from Michigan says that they have a plan. They have a \nplan. We have been waiting 5 years for you to bring that plan to the \nfloor and let us have a vote on it.\n  There is no plan that you are willing to bring to the floor because \nyou do not care about the American people and their health security. \nTaking it away from 22 million people and assaulting women with this \nbill is simply clear evidence that you do not care what happens.\n  Now, you may think this is good election year politics. But back in \nthe States, the Republicans--even the Governor of Kentucky, a \nRepublican, has decided, you know, I don't want to take it away from \npeople who are on Medicaid.\n  We tried this in Washington. We already know that if you leave in \nplace the requirement that insurance companies give insurance to \npeople, no matter what their healthcare state is, you are going to sink \nthe individual market. We lost it in the State of Washington, and you \nare sentencing the whole country to that. Besides, you have said you \nwant the repeal vote to be on the 22nd. You know it is going nowhere.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for the good, hard work that his committee did for bringing \nthis bill to the floor.\n  Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, this is something that we have been talking \nabout doing for a long time, but now we have the opportunity to have a \nvote on the House floor that will send a bill to President Obama's desk \nthat actually guts ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood.\n  This is something very important to people all across the country. \nBut this is something that allows us through the reconciliation \nprocess, which is a rare opportunity.\n  There have been a lot of really good bills that this House has passed \nto address problems, whether it is getting the economy back on track, \nwhether it is pushing back on so many of the radical agenda items, \nthrough regulatory actions, through executive actions that this \nPresident has done to try to circumvent the Constitution and Congress, \nand they go over to the Senate, and Senate Democrats filibuster the \nbill. And because of their archaic rules that require 60 votes just to \nbring a bill up, so many of those bills don't even come up for debate, \nMr. Speaker.\n  So the budget process of reconciliation gives us one opportunity a \nyear, if we are able to come together and agree on a budget, which this \nHouse and Senate did. We came to agreement, in fact, on a budget that \ngets to balance in the 10-year window for the first time since 2002. \nAnd it also gives us that one opportunity to move a bill through, not \njust the House, but through the Senate with a majority vote, rather \nthan 60 votes.\n  Why that is so important, Mr. Speaker, is it allows us to finally put \non President Obama's desk this important question. This President needs \nto be confronted with this, and he will now be confronted with the \nquestion about addressing his failed healthcare law that has denied \nhealth care to millions of people, that has resulted in double-digit \nincreases for so many others. In my home State of Louisiana, we are \nseeing over 20 percent increases because of this failed law.\n  And then also, to defund Planned Parenthood. That bill will now go to \nhis desk with this important vote.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  It is a historic vote. I would encourage the President to sign this \nbill. It would be an important landmark moment in his Presidency. If he \nvetoes it, it shows the country just what is at stake if you have a \nPresident that is willing to do this for the American people.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I look forward to this vote.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, yes, that would be important to show \nthat we have a President that doesn't want\n\n[[Page H60]]\n\nto eliminate affordable health care for 22 million Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nCastor), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Democrats in Congress begin the \nnew year with a renewed commitment to working families across this \ngreat country and a commitment to standing up to the special interests \nthat hold so much sway here in Washington, D.C. In contrast, House \nRepublicans begin the new year with the first vote that is a vote \nagainst women, a vote against women's health, and a vote to target \nPlanned Parenthood all rolled into one.\n  Now, women across this country will not forget the coordinated smear \ncampaign against Planned Parenthood last year that was based upon \nfalse, manufactured videos full of distortions and misinformation.\n  We will not forget how Republicans in Congress acted in concert with \nthe shady group and used the controversy to eliminate family planning \nsupport and vital cancer screenings for women across the country. It is \nespecially troubling that my GOP colleagues begin the year targeting \nfolks who really need the help the most: working families, young women, \nand women of color.\n  While Republicans choose to start the year this way, what I hear from \nwomen, parents, moms, and dads at home is that they want greater \neconomic security and greater personal security. That is what Congress \nshould be focused on in 2016, not an attack on women's health.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), a \nproductive member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, today we will vote to repeal the \nPresident's healthcare law. It is a law that the American people have \nopposed from the very beginning when it was passed without bipartisan \nsupport. The American people opposed it even when the President \npromised that they could keep their coverage and their doctor. They \nalso opposed it when that promise was broken. They opposed it when the \nlaw taxed their health insurance and the medical devices that help them \nlive longer, healthier lives.\n  Today the American people still oppose the President's healthcare law \nbecause it makes them pay higher premiums for policies with deductibles \nthat are too expensive. That is why today, 6 years after it was passed, \nwe are voting to send a repeal of this law to the President's desk. \nThis repeal will save the government $500 billion over the next 10 \nyears and empower people to make their own healthcare choices.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone listens carefully when \nour colleagues say that it will save money over the next 10 years, \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office says this will actually lose \nthe taxpayer money over the longer term. We all hope to live and have \nour children live in the longer term.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPascrell), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Ranking Member, through the Chair, this is \nnonreconciliation if I have ever seen it.\n  The Affordable Care Act pulling back from Medicaid expansion, do you \nknow what that means? Have you examined what that will do? It will take \naway essential tax credits that the law provides to help the middle \nclass and middle class families purchase health insurance.\n  Here we are repealing the ACA for the umpteenth time. In addition to \ncutting off funding for Planned Parenthood, the new version of the bill \nwhich came back from the Senate would also prohibit Medicaid from \npaying for services at Planned Parenthood. Because Federal law strictly \nprohibits Federal Medicaid dollars from being used to pay for \nabortions, regardless of how you try to get that message out and convey \nthis nonfact, that is not the fact. This addition would specifically \nprohibit payments to Planned Parenthood for healthcare services like \npreventive health exams.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I contend that that is un-American. Read \nmy lips. Cancer screenings. I contend that that is un-American. And you \nhave nothing in your budget, and you have nothing in your so-called \nplan--which dematerialized before it materialized--that would take care \nof these folks.\n  And the subject of birth control, since you like to talk about it all \nthe time, that, to me, is un-American. That, to me, reduces freedom in \nthe greatest country on the planet.\n  So what will we come up with? In a bill that came before us without \nregular order--you tout all the time that we need regular order, we \nhave got to go through the process and get the bill in front of us--\nthis did not go through the process. This committee that you had was a \njoke. You know it and I know it.\n  So what a spirit of reconciliation, what a horror--what a horror--\nbeing projected on the American people. It is too bad. It is not a good \nway to start the new year, and I am not hopeful for the future.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their \nremarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a productive member of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. LANCE. Thank you, Chairman Price, for your tremendous leadership \non this and many other issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Restoring Americans' \nHealthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, the first ObamaCare repeal bill \nthat Congress sends to the President's desk since the law's enactment \nin 2010.\n  This bill effectively repeals mandates and taxes at the very heart of \nthe law and saves taxpayers nearly half a trillion dollars over the \nnext decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  Our action here in the House today is an important step toward \nreplacing ObamaCare with patient-centric solutions that lower \nhealthcare costs, protect jobs, and allow Americans to keep their \ndoctors and their health care if they like them.\n  To be clear, there is more work that needs to be done to make full \nrepeal and replacement a reality, but our congressional efforts today \nprovide important momentum to help make that a reality in 2017 with a \nnew President.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3762.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the Education \nand the Workforce Committee.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  The House is yet to take another vote in 60 seconds to demonstrate \nits relentless fixation on systematically destroying the Affordable \nCare Act. More specifically, we must vote on a budget reconciliation \npackage that, if enacted, will take away healthcare access for millions \nof Americans.\n  This isn't a new exercise. In addition to the 61 unproductive votes, \nfutile lawsuits have been brought in courts, and meritless attacks have \nbeen mounted with the goal of destroying the progress we have made. And \nwe have made progress improving a system that didn't work for American \nfamilies before the Affordable Care Act.\n  Since the enactment of the law: over 17 million uninsured Americans \nhave gained insurance; young people can stay on their parents' policies \nuntil age 26; healthcare costs are growing more slowly today than in \npast decades; annual checkups are not subject to deductibles; an \ninsurance company can't charge you more for just being a woman; we are \nin the process of closing the prescription drug doughnut hole; and if \nyou want to change jobs or start a business or start a family, you have \nhealthcare options even if you have a preexisting condition.\n  That is the progress we have made. Despite that progress, the \nlegislation before us turns the clock back on all of that progress. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the bill.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority \nleader of the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page H61]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I appreciate the work that the chairman has done. I know he is \nchairman of the Budget Committee, but before he stood on this floor, he \nwas a doctor. He is still a doctor today, and I know the passion that \nhe brings to bring the right type of reform for a medical system that \nactually works in this country. That is why today is so important not \njust to him, but to all of us.\n  We have worked hard--I would say relentlessly--to make that day \nhappen. Yes, we fought to delay, defund, and actually repeal ObamaCare. \nThis law is a failure. We know it, and I know all of you on the other \nside of the aisle know it as well. Twelve co-ops have failed. State \nexchanges are failing. No matter where you stood on this issue, you \nwent home and you heard from your constituents.\n  Now, if you voted for it, you are going to have to answer to the \nPresident's promises, because he just didn't promise a few in this \nroom. He promised all Americans. Do you remember what he said? He said: \n``If you like your healthcare plan, you'll be able to keep your health \ncare plan, period.'' He also said, Mr. Speaker: ``If you like your \ndoctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period.'' Mr. Speaker, he \nalso said ObamaCare would ``lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a \ntypical family per year.''\n  Those are direct quotes--it is just that not one of them came to \nfruition.\n  Now, I know what I will hear on the other side of the aisle, and they \nprobably won't mention this, but on this floor, Republicans and \nDemocrats joined together to dismantle the employer and individual \nmandates. In a bipartisan fashion, we delayed the medical device tax. \nIn a bipartisan fashion--a lot delivered from the other side--we \ndelayed the Cadillac tax, cut funding to the healthcare rationing \nboard, and stopped the taxpayer bailout of insurance companies.\n  Many of our attempts have been successful in undoing key parts of \nthis law. But today, for the very first time, we send a bill repealing \nObamaCare to the President's desk.\n  Also, after watching the horrific videos of Planned Parenthood \nemployees casually discussing the sale of infants' organs, we knew \nsomething had to be done. Something had to be done to make sure \ntaxpayers were not forced to support organizations that engage in such \ninhumane practices. Today we send a bill to the President's desk that \nends taxpayer funding for abortion coverage and abortion providers like \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  No matter where you go in this country, no matter whom you talk to, \nno matter what party they belong to, they know things are wrong in this \ncountry. People are hurting under ObamaCare, human life is being \ndisregarded, and now Congress will put it to the President and hold him \naccountable for the terrible policies this administration has pursued.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't have any delusions. For the sake of the American \npeople and too many unborn children, I hope the President signs this \nbill. But the President has made his position very clear. No matter how \nwrong he is, he will veto any bill that repeals ObamaCare or defunds \nPlanned Parenthood. If he does, we will vote to override.\n  I, and I know many of my colleagues, have worked with colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle trying to persuade them to join with us. We \nasked them to join us and stand with the American people against \nObamaCare and against taxpayer funding of the abortion industry. But no \nmatter how the override vote ends up, what we are doing today is still \nimportant. When a Republican President takes office next year, Mr. \nSpeaker, we can use reconciliation again. We won't have to worry about \na veto from the White House, and we can overcome any attempts by the \nDemocrats to filibuster and obstruct.\n  You see, from the foundation of this bill and from the work of many \ncolleagues in the medical community and doctors that serve as Members \nof Congress, we will create a patient-centered healthcare system that \ngives power to the people, not to bureaucrats in Washington.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, that is why today is important, because with this \nbill we can do it--this year or the next, but we will.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the Republican \nleader, Mr. McCarthy, who said that they have worked hard and \nrelentlessly to make this day happen--a day that would eliminate \naffordable health care to 22 million Americans.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  I want to make sure all of our colleagues understand that this is not \na fact coming from the Democrats. There is the saying that you are \nentitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own \nfacts.\n  That is a fact that came from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice. In fact, they were responding to a letter from Mr. Price, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. The letter reads:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, At your request, CBO and the staff of \n     the joint committee have estimated the budgetary effects of \n     this bill.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       And analyze the bill.\n\n  It is their conclusion on page 9 of the letter to the chairman:\n\n       Enacting H.R. 3762 would increase the number of people \n     without health insurance coverage. Relative to current law \n     projections--\n\n  That means relevant to the current law with the Affordable Care Act \nin place.\n\n     would reduce by about 22 million people in most years after \n     2017.\n\n  That is a fact. That is signed by the director of CBO, Keith Hall, \nwho, as everybody in this body knows, was selected on a bipartisan \nbasis by the chairman of the House Budget Committee and the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, both Republicans. That is a fact.\n  It is a sad state of affairs when we are ``celebrating'' the fact \nthat they ``worked relentlessly'' to get to the point to eliminate \naffordable care to 22 million Americans.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), \nsomebody who understands the importance of affordable health care and \nis also a distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for his statement \nin pointing out that this is not really a legislative issue. This is a \nRepublican partisan issue where people have waited for years for this \nmoment to destroy a bill to put 22 million people out of reach of \nmedical care.\n  They are striking over $1 trillion from the bill. They are being \ncritical of the bill. They didn't say their moment in the Sun was to \nprovide a better bill. No. They say, if you go back home, you are going \nto hear complaints.\n  Well, President Obama went back home to the American people and was \ncampaigning for ObamaCare and they reelected him. Now we are saying \nthat these 22 million people--do you think they are not going to get \nhealth care?\n  You bet your sweet life on this country they are going to get care, \nnot the quality care that ObamaCare would provide for them, but they \nwill be going to emergency rooms. They will get more sick. They will \nend up in the hospitals. It will cost us much more than the so-called \ntrillion dollars we have.\n  Well, thank God we do have a government where the President can say \nno. Thank God we also have a Constitution that says you don't have \nenough votes to override what is constitutionally and morally the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire once again the \ntime remaining on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 7 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Maryland has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Stutzman), a wonderful member of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman just mentioned that this is \na partisan issue. This was a partisan issue back in 2009 when it was \npassed. This was forced through against the will of the American \npeople. That is why you have seen over the past several elections that \nthe American people want a repeal of ObamaCare and that we start over \nwith patient-centered free-market health care.\n  The fact is that I was at a Cracker Barrel a couple of weeks ago. I \nwas talking to the waitress. The waitress\n\n[[Page H62]]\n\napproached me and she said: You know, ObamaCare was supposed to help \nme. She said: My premiums have gone up. They have doubled. My out-of-\npocket expenses have gone from $500 to $5,000. She said: ObamaCare is \nnot helping me.\n  This is a story that we have heard time and time again. ObamaCare \nhasn't helped the American people. It has put a greater burden on the \nAmerican people. Doctors are supposed to provide health care, not \nObamaCare, not the Federal Government. This should be a relationship \nbetween the American people and the doctor that they choose, the doctor \nthat they were promised that they could keep.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that this reconciliation package is the right \nthing at the right time for our country. We need to start over. We need \nto fix our healthcare system rather than prolonging and continuing to \nenforce a Big Government agenda on the American people.\n  I ask the Members of this House to support this legislation.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nOregon (Ms. Bonamici), a distinguished member of the Education and the \nWorkforce Committee.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation \nwhich would push health coverage beyond the reach of millions of \nAmericans.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that enacting this \nlegislation could result in roughly 22 million more people living \nwithout health insurance. These people are single parents struggling to \ncover basic necessities, young adults trying to launch their careers \nand start families, and hardworking couples for whom the cost of \ninsurance won't fit in the monthly budget.\n  Without affordable health coverage, these Americans will be living \nwith perpetual fear, fear that they will need to choose between paying \nfor housing or food and getting treatment, and fear that any medical \nemergency could lead them into bankruptcy.\n  To make things worse, this bill defunds Planned Parenthood, which \nwould undermine access to reproductive health services and preventive \ncare for women. That is not only wrong, it is counterproductive.\n  It is unfortunate that, at the start of a new year, we are debating a \nregressive proposal that would make the lives of some of our most \nvulnerable friends and neighbors even less secure.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will acknowledge that \nthis bill is irresponsible and join me in voting ``no.''\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), a fellow Georgian and a freshman \nMember of the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his great work on \nthis important legislation.\n  Today I rise in support of H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' \nHealthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. This legislation will \ndismantle ObamaCare and defund Planned Parenthood.\n  This bill guts ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates and \nrepeals the costly Cadillac and medical device taxes. It protects \nsociety's most innocent--the unborn--and also provides additional \nfunding for community health centers so that women can continue to have \naccess to the quality care they deserve.\n\n  We need to expand patient choice. We need to give the American people \nchoice. We need to make health care more affordable by offering \npatient-centered and cost-effective reforms. Most of all, we need to \ngive a voice to the voiceless.\n  This is a historic moment. After passing the House today, the bill \nwill go straight to the President's desk and President Obama will be \nforced to vote on repealing ObamaCare and defunding Planned Parenthood \nfor the first time. He will have to choose between dismantling a costly \nand disastrous law and preventing disregard for human life or \nprotecting his own political legacy.\n  Colleagues in the House, please join me and vote in favor of the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Schrader), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, after drafting and passing a trillion-\ndollar deficit-busting tax and budget bill last month, my Republican \ncolleagues now want to get some of that money back on the backs of \nmiddle- and low-income Americans.\n  These are the very people that have been struggling to recover from \nthe Great Recession. These families and small businesses that are \nhaving trouble staying afloat would now lose access to affordable \nhealth care. It is irresponsible.\n  I don't get it. The Affordable Care Act gives millions a hand up, not \na handout, in order to afford affordable health care. Families are put \nin the driver's seat in the health insurance market and are seeing good \nresults.\n  This is something we have been doing in Oregon for some time. Market-\nbased principles and personal responsibility is actually the heart of \nthe ACA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't understand why we would want to create greater \nuncertainty for small businesses, trying to do the right thing by their \nemployees, by eliminating the small business tax credit, like my \nRepublican colleagues want to do today.\n  Rather than waste time on distractions like this, we should be coming \ntogether to build certainty around the basic American right of a \nshared-responsibility healthcare system.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), a diligent and productive \nmember of the Budget Committee.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is hurting people by reducing \nchoices, increasing costs, and making it harder for people to access \nquality, affordable healthcare. That is why I am proud to stand here \ntoday to support a bill that dismantles key provisions of ObamaCare and \npaves the way for better healthcare solutions.\n  The Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act stops \nthe government from forcing its citizens to buy expensive healthcare \nplans they don't want or need. It saves Americans money by eliminating \nmany of the ObamaCare taxes.\n  Additionally, this bill stops taxpayer funding for abortion providers \nsuch as Planned Parenthood. This one abortion provider receives over \nhalf a billion taxpayer dollars a year even though it has been involved \nin the harvesting and selling of baby body parts.\n  It is time to stop all tax dollars flowing to abortionists and \nredirect it to healthcare providers who care for women without taking \ninnocent life.\n  Congress is listening to the people's calls. Now it will be up to the \nPresident to decide, does he support the people and women's health or \ndoes he support Washington mandates and tax dollars going to Planned \nParenthood.\n  I urge the President to do the right thing and sign this into law.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary and Homeland \nSecurity Committees.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager, the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Van Hollen), for his leadership. I also thank my good \nfriends on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now understand what the issue is. We are talking \napples and oranges. My friends on the other side of the aisle don't \ncare about the fact that, in 2013, 18 percent of Americans were \nuninsured; in the State of Texas, 28 percent; California, 23 percent; \nand Georgia, 22 percent.\n  Now we have found that we are at a point where we have lowered that \namount and we have lowered the uninsured rate in this country to 11.9 \npercent. Those are vulnerable Americans and women and families.\n  We also don't seem to understand that, when our constituents come to \nus and talk about premiums, all we need to do is do the constituency \nservice and kind of assure them and show them the direction into the \nmarketplace because, in shopping around, you can lower your premium.\n  But the real issue is whether or not we care about making sure that \nthose with preexisting conditions can actually get health insurance, \nthat those in Medicare can actually protect the Medicare system and \nmake it insolvent in 2030 instead of 2017.\n  The other question is: Does this bill even have a plan? Is there an \nalternative healthcare plan that the Republicans have put in the budget \nreconciliation? No, they have not.\n\n[[Page H63]]\n\n  Then they want to take away Planned Parenthood. This is not about \ndisliking Planned Parenthood. It is telling women that they do not have \na choice to choose their own doctors. That is what they are doing when \nthey defund Planned Parenthood.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is apples and oranges. They are talking one thing. I \nam talking about saving lives and helping Americans keep their health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3762, the Restoring \nAmericans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n  In 1949, Harry Truman became the first sitting President to propose \nuniversal healthcare for all Americans as part of the ``Fair Deal.''\n  On March 23, 2010, President Obama aided by a Democratic Congress \ndelivered on this promise.\n  Before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 50 million people in \nthe United States had no health insurance coverage, with many losing \ninsurance as a result of the recent recession.\n  This is the 62nd vote by the GOP since its enactment to end the \nAffordable Care Act law.\n  In 2013, key provisions of the Affordable Care Act began to take \neffect and have significantly improved the lives of millions of \nAmericans.\n  In 2013, the states with the highest percentage of uninsured were: \nTexas with 28.8 percent; Louisiana with 24 percent; Nevada with 23.3 \npercent; California with 23.2 percent; Florida with 22.8 percent; \nGeorgia with 22.5 percent; Arkansas with 21.9 percent; Mississippi with \n21.7 percent; and Oklahoma with 21.4 percent.\n  In 2013, when Gallup first began tracking health insurance coverage \njust before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the number of \npersons not insured has declined by 5.2 points.\n  Gallup reported that the percentage of uninsured Americans increased \nfrom nearly 14 percent in 2008 to over 17 percent in 2011, and peaked \nat 18.0 percent in 2013.\n  According to Gallup the uninsured rate among U.S. adults declined to \n11.9 percent for the first quarter of 2015, but this fact has not \ndeterred efforts by the GOP of the House to end this important \nlifesaving law.\n  Mr. Speaker, this steady decline in the number of Americans without \nhealth insurance means that today only about 10 percent of our citizens \ndo not have coverage.\n  Many of those most in need of the healthcare coverage provided by the \nAffordable Care Act live in the Districts of many members on both sides \nof this argument. Texas, my own state, leads the list of states with \nthe highest percentages of uninsured residents.\n  The highest concentrations of the uninsured are the poor and \nunemployed.\n  The uninsured rate among Americans has dropped sharply since the \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act, which provides: access to \nhealthcare to the poor through expansion of Medicaid; prevents health \ninsurance companies from denying healthcare coverage based on pre-\nexisting conditions; stops health insurance companies from \ndiscriminating against women by charging them higher rates for \ncoverage, and extends the time children can remain on their parents' \nhealth insurance to age 26.\n  The Affordable Care Act provides to states at no cost options for \nresidents to enroll in healthcare programs through Medicaid.\n  Unfortunately, some states like my state of Texas have rejected this \nimportant component of the Affordable Care Act for those in the state \nin most need of healthcare.\n  Instead of focusing on protecting and caring for the health of our \nconstituents, we are allowing partisan games to interfere with serving \nthe best interest of our Districts.\n  At the end of healthcare insurance enrollment for 2015, more than 8.5 \nmillion consumers signed-up for health coverage through the \nHealthCare.gov platform or had their coverage automatically renewed.\n  Of the about 6 million Marketplace consumers whose coverage was \nrenewed, about 3.6 million actively renewed and 2.4 million consumers \nautomatically renewed their health insurance coverage.\n  The 2015 health insurance enrollment period had 29 percent new \nparticipants and 71 percent return participants.\n  In my state of Texas 1,096,868 individual plans were selected by \nvisitors to the HealthCare.gov platform.\n  In 2015, unfortunately Texas remains the state with the highest \nhealth uninsured rate among the 50 states, with 25.7 percent or over \n4.2 million residents without health insurance.\n  Instead of focusing on the issues that the American people want \naddressed, we are having the same discussion to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act in the efforts of my colleagues to repeal, obstruct and \nundermine this law.\n  What is even more frustrating is that while there is so much energy \nin trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, there has been no plan or \nsuggestions posed on how to replace it.\n  I want to once again highlight the benefits of the Affordable Care \nAct so we can once and for all end the attempts to try and repeal this \nlaw that benefits so many Americans.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans are seeing lower costs, \nbetter coverage, and patient protections that Republicans want to \nrepeal:\n  The average premium for employer-provided family health coverage went \nup 3 percent in 2014, continuing the trend of lower annual increase, \nwhich means that over the 5 years the healthcare law has been in place \nit has saved employers over $1,800 dollars in premiums for employee \nfamily health insurance coverage.\n  Medicare spending growth per beneficiary was approximately flat in \nfiscal year 2014, a significant contributor to extending the solvency \nof the program.\n  The Medicare Trustee now projects because of the Affordable Care Act \nthat the Medicare Trust Fund will be solvent until 2030 instead of \n2017.\n  Health insurance consumers have saved 9 billion since 2011 because \nObamacare requires insurance companies to spend 80 cents on every \npremium dollar on consumer healthcare and empowers States to review and \nnegotiate premium increases.\n  129 million Americans, including 17 million children, are no longer \nat risk of losing health insurance coverage because of their health.\n  76 million Americans with private coverage are eligible for expanded \npreventative services coverage, which includes 30 million women and 18 \nmillion children.\n  Since the Affordable Care Act went into effect insurers have paid \ncustomers over $1.9 billion in rebates because they did not spend 80 \ncents on each dollar of premium on healthcare.\n  Nationwide, nearly 11.7 million consumers selected a plan or were \nautomatically enrolled in Marketplace coverage.\n  In 2014, of the 5 million uninsured Texans: 874,000 are eligible for \nMedicaid/CHIP; 1,046,000 are in the coverage gap; 1,756,000 are \neligible for tax credits; 1,264,000 are ineligible because of their \nincome or access to employer benefits.\n  In 2014, access to affordable healthcare for the self-employed or \nthose who decide to purchase their own coverage became easier because \nof Affordable Insurance Exchanges.\n  In Texas, 1,205,174 consumers selected or were automatically re-\nenrolled in quality, affordable health insurance coverage through the \nMarketplace as of February 2015.\n  The Federal Marketplace Signups and Tax Credits in Texas meant that: \n85 percent of Texas consumers who were signed up qualified for an \naverage tax credit of $239 per month through the Marketplace. 68 \npercent of Texas Marketplace enrollees obtained coverage for $100 or \nless after any applicable tax credits in 2015, and 92 percent had the \noption of doing so.\n  In Texas, consumers could choose from 15 issuers in the Marketplace \nin 2015--up from 12 in 2014.\n  Texas consumers could choose from an average of 31 health plans in \ntheir county for 2015 coverage--up from 25 in 2014.\n  468,797 consumers in Texas under the age of 35 are signed up for \nMarketplace coverage (39 percent of plan selections in the state); and\n  348,593 consumers 18 to 34 years of age (29 percent of all plan \nselections) are signed up for Marketplace coverage.\n  Texas has received $1,000,000 in grants for research, planning, \ninformation technology development, and implementation of its \nMarketplace.\n  Open enrollment for 2016 coverage runs from November 1, 2015 to \nJanuary 31, 2016.\n  There are now one stop marketplaces where consumers can do what \nFederal employees have done for decades--purchase insurance at \nreasonable rates from an insurer of their choice.\n  There are also opportunities for small employers to form pools to use \ntheir collective bargaining potential to find the best deals for \nemployee health plans.\n  This Congress has work that needs to be done, and it has work that \nshould be taken up to increase financial security for workers, their \nfamilies and communities as the economy continues to recover, and not \nplay partisan political games.\n  I urge my Colleagues to put partisan politics aside and join me in \nvoting no on the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a champion of the pro-life \ncommunity.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his \ngreat work on this bill.\n  Subsidized by over $500 million taxpayer dollars each year, Planned \nParenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to death every 2 \nminutes, killing over 7 million innocent children since 1973.\n\n[[Page H64]]\n\n  Planned Parenthood is Child Abuse, Incorporated. Now undercover \nvideos have exposed in numbing candor several high-level Planned \nParenthood leaders gleefully talking about procuring children's \ninternal organs for a price, all while altering gruesome dismemberment \nprocedures to preserve intact livers, hearts, and lungs from freshly \nkilled babies.\n  Far too many politicians, Mr. Speaker, including our Nobel Peace \nPrize-winning President and much of the media, continue to ignore, \ntrivialize, and even defend these gross human rights abuses.\n  So know this: We will not be deterred in exposing this Planned \nParenthood scandal no matter how aggressive and misleading the cover-\nup.\n  End taxpayer funding to those who commit these cruel and inhumane \nacts in this subsidy for Planned Parenthood.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Restoring \nAmericans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act and urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote to dismantle Obamacare by repealing the most \ndamaging aspects of this egregiously flawed law.\n  The legislation before us today will send a strong message on behalf \nof the millions of Americans who lost or were forced to switch their \nhealthcare coverage and/or doctors, as well as those facing additional \ncharges, higher copayments, and larger annual fees as a result of \nObamacare.\n  I have supported, and the House has passed, legislation to repeal \nObamacare in its entirety many times but today's vote is different. \nThrough the reconciliation process, which allows for expedited \nconsideration and a simple majority vote in the Senate, today's bill \nwill be placed on the President's desk. The President will have to \ndecide if he stands on the side of the American people or continues the \nmisguided policies squeezing middle class families.\n  In particular, the bill repeals the individual mandate--where \nAmerican are coerced into purchasing expensive insurance packages many \ndo not want or need, and many cannot afford.\n  Unfortunately for the millions who cannot afford to purchase \nObamacare insurance, the penalties are expensive too.\n  According to a Kaiser Family Foundation report issued last month, \nthis year the penalty for noncompliance will spike 47%, up from $661 in \n2015 to a whopping $969.\n  The report also states that for 7.1 million uninsured Americans, the \npenalty is still cheaper than the least expensive insurance option \navailable to them through Obamacare. Since the law did little to \naddress affordability and the increasing cost of obtaining coverage, \nthe federal government--the IRS, no less--will now take money out of \nthe pockets and pocketbooks of Americans, further penalizing the \nuninsured.\n  The President and Obamacare supporters promised otherwise, but health \ninsurance still remains out of reach for many Americas. Additionally, \nthose who had quality affordable coverage that they were comfortable \nwith have seen unwelcome changes that they likely would not have had to \nface--but for Obamacare.\n  The Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act will \nalso--fully and permanently--repeal two misguided tax increases harming \nbusinesses, innovation and middle-class Americans: the excise tax on \nemployer-sponsored health insurance, aka ``the Cadillac tax,'' and the \nmedical device tax.\n  This legislation moves us a step forward in the process of repealing \nObamacare's mandates, tax hikes and slush funds and begins undoing the \ndamage inflicted on individuals, businesses, our economy and our \nnational debt. But we can do more to address these inadequacies of our \nhealthcare system and provide alternative reforms and solutions.\n  We have the ability to ensure that all Americans have access to \naffordable, high-quality health care. I am a longtime supporter of a \nnumber of positive reforms that can replace Obamacare including: \nreforming the private health insurance market so patients and their \ndoctors are in charge of medical decisions; encouraging healthy \nbehaviors; incentivizing innovation; ensuring insurance portability and \nthe availability of high-risk pools; reforming Medicare to be a model \nof efficiency; modernizing the tax code to make health insurance more \naffordable; and strengthening the health care safety net so no one is \nleft out.\n  Finally, the bill before the House today defunds Planned Parenthood. \nSubsidized by over $500 million taxpayers' dollars each year, Planned \nParenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to death every two \nminutes--killing over 7 million innocent children since 1973.\n  Planned Parenthood is ``Child Abuse Inc.''\n  Now, undercover videos have exposed in numbing candor, several high \nlevel Planned Parenthood leaders gleefully talking about procuring \nchildren's internal organs for a price all while altering gruesome \ndismemberment procedures to preserve ``intact'' livers, hearts and \nlungs from freshly killed babies.\n  Far too many politicians including our Nobel Peace Prize winning \nPresident and much of the media continue to ignore, trivialize--even \ndefend--these gross human rights abuses.\n  So know this: we will not be deterred in exposing this Planned \nParenthood scandal, no matter how aggressive and misleading the cover-\nup.\n  End taxpayer funding to those who commit these cruel and inhumane \nacts.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, we ended the 2015 Congress working together \nwith a tax extender package that I voted for that gave relief to the \nmedical device folks in an omnibus bill.\n  But we are back, and there you go again trying to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, taking health care away from people and taking \nPlanned Parenthood, which gives people who are poor and live in areas \nwhere there is not other healthcare opportunities--taking away from \nthem the opportunity for preventive health care.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  The last time this was tried in Tennessee, there was a 1,400 percent \ncut in women getting preventative care. That is just not right. We just \ncame through Hanukkah and Christmas, and we ought to think a little bit \nabout what Hanukkah and Christmas were about and what Moses and Jesus \nwould be about. I think they would be about saving lives and about \ngiving everybody an opportunity to live, not patient-centric health \ncare, but people living and getting health care like every other \ncivilized, industrialized country in the world provides for its people.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), a conscientious U.S. Member of \nthe Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, today is a good day for America because we will finally \nsend this bill to the President's desk.\n  The ``Unaffordable Care Act'' is bad for the American people because \nit is contributing to the bankruptcy of our country while doing little \nto provide Americans with better health care.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have constituents who used to have health insurance \nbut who no longer do because their premiums are too high. Now they have \nno insurance, and the only thing to show for it is a fine from the IRS. \nMedicaid expansion is a blueprint for single-payer, government-run \nhealth care. As an engineer, I can assure you that, if you start with a \nbad blueprint, you will get bad results.\n  Instead of expanding Medicaid for able-bodied, working-age adults, \nthe administration should work with us to fix the broken traditional \nMedicaid program, which is intended for those who most need it: the \nelderly, the disabled, and children. In 2014, there were 38.2 million \nnondisabled Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 who were not \nworking at all. More than they need Medicaid expansion, they need \nprogrowth economic policies that will foster good jobs so they can \nsimply work and provide for themselves and their families.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Neal) of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, 62 times we have now voted to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act. Let me contrast what we are about to do in the \nnext few minutes with the manner in which Democrats handled the \nMedicare part D prescription drug benefit. We voted against it. We \nopposed it. We became the majority, and we improved it. That is the \nreality of legislating. We closed the doughnut hole. We took a very \ndifficult piece of legislation--largely resisted on their side as \nwell--and became the majority and asked: How can we singularly improve \nthis legislation so that it has broad appeal for the American people? \nToday, people take it for granted. They just accept the idea that the \nprescription drug bill works for all members of the American family. \nInstead, this is the 62nd time of repealing this for the purpose of \npolitical\n\n[[Page H65]]\n\nmessaging, with no alternative ever provided--not once.\n  I hope the media members will use the contrast that I have just \noutlined about the prescription drug legislation in Medicare part D \nwith what the Republicans are doing, once again today, with no hope \nother than that of trying to win political points in messaging.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time \nremaining on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 2 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Maryland has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the gentleman from Georgia \nif he has any further speakers.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  We finished the debate, really, where we began, which is, on this \nfirst day back of 2016, we are really revisiting the battles of the \npast, as the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) and others have \nsaid.\n  We heard from the Republican leader, Mr. McCarthy, that they had \nworked hard for this day. We know from the nonpartisan Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office that, apparently, what our Republican \ncolleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away \nfrom 22 million Americans. At the same time, we have heard all sorts of \nmisinformation and distortions on this floor about Planned Parenthood, \nwhich is an organization that provides women and their families with \nhealth care, that provides cancer screenings, and that provides family \nplanning.\n  On national television, when asked whether there was any evidence \nthat Planned Parenthood had broken any law, even Republican Chairman \nChaffetz of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who \ninvestigated Planned Parenthood, said: ``No, I'm not suggesting that \nthey broke the law.'' In fact, that was the finding of other committees \nhere. Yet, our Republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt, \nspecial committee to go after Planned Parenthood. Ironically, they \nclaim to be doing an investigation, but here on the floor, they have, \nobviously, already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an \norganization that helps provide health care to American women and \nfamilies.\n  So, rolled into one bill, you have something that would deny access \nto health care to 22 million Americans and, at the same time, deny \nimportant health services to millions of American women and their \nfamilies.\n  When our Republican colleagues pose this question and say that the \nPresident is going to be faced with a tough choice, I can assure them \nit is not a tough choice for the President, because it is not a tough \nchoice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care \naway from 22 million Americans. That should be an easy choice for all \nof us. We are not going to do it. It also shouldn't be a tough choice \nas to whether or not we defund Planned Parenthood and the services they \nprovide to American women and families. That is not going to be a tough \nchoice for the President.\n  The Republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the \nconsequences of the 2016 elections, because we are fortunate that, \ntoday, we have a President who will not sign that bill but who will, \ninstead, veto that bill. Our colleagues are absolutely right. If you \nhad a different President, including, as far as I know, all of them on \nthe Republican side, they would be signing this bill. So this is an \nimportant statement of what our Republican colleagues think is the top \npriority on the first day of 2016, which is to get rid of affordable \nhealth care for 22 million Americans.\n  Let's talk about that with the American public because I believe that \nthe American public wants to do what the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Neal) said: Where we find problems and where we need to make \nadjustments, we should do it, but we shouldn't turn back the clock and \ndeny affordable health care to tens of millions of Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  It seems, whenever we have a serious issue to talk about on the \nfloor, the distortions and the utter false statements come out, and \nthat is a shame because the American people deserve better.\n  ObamaCare is harming real people, not just from an economic \nstandpoint across this great land but from a healthcare standpoint. As \na physician, I can tell you that I hear about it daily from my \ncolleagues. We hear from the other side of folks who tout the numbers \nof increase and of folks who have gained insurance. The fact of the \nmatter is, of the folks who have gained insurance and of those who had \ninsurance, many of them now have coverage, but they don't have care. If \nyou earn $30,000, $40,000, or $50,000 and if your deductible is now \n$5,000 or $10,000 or $12,000, you may have coverage, but you don't have \ncare. In fact, individuals are denying themselves treatment right now \nbecause they can't afford the deductibles because of this law. That is \nthe real world out there. That is the harm that this law is doing.\n  We heard over and over and over that we want to remove healthcare \ncoverage from 22 million people. That is utter nonsense, Mr. Speaker. \nIt is absolutely not true. In fact, my friend from Maryland quoted the \nCBO report, and he quoted it accurately, but he skipped over--kind of \nglossed over--the part that said that this would be relative to current \nlaw projections. That is right. We want to repeal this law, and we want \nto replace it with positive, commonsense, patient-centered solutions \nthat put patients and families and doctors in charge of health care, \nnot Washington, D.C., solutions that respect the principles of health \ncare: accessibility for everybody, affordability for everybody, \nchoices, and higher quality care--the things that ObamaCare has \ndestroyed. That is why the majority of the American people don't like \nthis law and oppose this law. It is because it destroys the principles \nof health care that the American people hold dear.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the first step and the next step in the process \nof repealing ObamaCare and of making certain that we move forward with \npositive, patient-centered solutions in which patients and families and \ndoctors are making medical decisions and not the Federal Government.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n3762, the Senate-Passed GOP Reconciliation Bill, appropriately dubbed \nthe ``Taking Health Coverage Away from Millions of Americans and \nAttacking Women's Health Care Act.''\n  This measure marks the 62nd House vote to repeal or undermine the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  It is the 11th time the House has voted this Congress to attack \nwomen's health care.\n  Make no mistake: champions of these damaging, reactionary policies \nare putting politics over people and undermining the fundamental notion \nthat health care is not a privilege, but a right.\n  It is unfortunate that, instead of using this time to advance \nlegislation that improves our health care system, we are again engaging \nin another futile attempt to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and \nput women's health at risk, disinvest in public health and chronic \ndisease prevention, and roll back coverage gains, consumer protections, \nand reforms advanced by the Affordable Care Act.\n  This Reconciliation measure flies in face of patient access and good \ngovernance.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this damaging \nlegislation will lead to an estimated 22 million Americans losing their \nhealth insurance after 2017.\n  Among its many nefarious provisions, H.R. 3762 is designed to halt \nMedicaid expansion.\n  This would devastate millions of hard-working adults and their \nfamilies across the country, particularly those in high need \ncommunities.\n  H.R. 3762 would eliminate Planned Parenthood's ability to receive \nreimbursement for all health care services provided under Medicaid.\n  Health centers like Planned Parenthood are the bedrock of our health \ncare safety net\n  Medicaid patients deserve to choose their health care provider and \nshould not have their choice limited by politically motivated agendas.\n  Texas is a case study in what happens when Planned Parenthood is \nattacked and access is rolled back.\n\n[[Page H66]]\n\n  In short, this measure takes away affordable health care coverage and \nputs politics ahead of common sense.\n  Our constituents deserve better.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3762 and get back to \nwork on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote against H.R. 3762, \nthe Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015, \nwhich would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and defund Planned \nParenthood. Republicans eyeing election year points are waging yet \nanother political battle with President Obama, without regards to \ncurrent health coverage and protections for millions of families and \nbusinesses and limiting health care access for millions of women.\n  The ACA is here and will remain throughout the tenure of President \nObama as a key accomplishment of his administration. Despite dire \npredictions, the results of the ACA are remarkable. Our nation's \nuninsured rate is the lowest it's been in decades; more than 19 million \nAmericans today have health coverage because of the ACA. Up to 129 \nmillion Americans who have pre-existing conditions no longer have to \nworry about being denied coverage or charged higher premiums because of \ntheir health status. Additionally, thanks to the ACA, health care \nprices have been rising at the slowest pace in nearly 50 years.\n  No one pretends the ACA is perfect; I've long claimed it is in need \nof refinement. Congress needs to work together to improve the ACA and \npass legislation that continues to make health care more affordable for \nAmericans. It's unacceptable that we leave behind some of our most \nvulnerable individuals because many Republican governors refuse to \nexpand Medicaid and extend coverage to those most in need.\n  The obsessive targeting of Planned Parenthood funding is another \nreason I will vote against H.R. 3762. The amazing Planned Parenthood \nstaff and volunteers in my community provide critical reproductive \nhealth services to more than 70,000 Oregon women annually. This \nlegislation is yet another concerted assault against the provision of \nessential service to women, especially women of color and low-income \nstatus.\n  This legislative merry-go-round must stop. We must instead focus on \nsolutions that instead build on the promise of healthcare reform; not \njust to save money, but to improve the lives of Americans of all ages.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my strong \ndisappointment in House Republicans for starting off the New Year with \nthe same failed policies from 2015. The bill before us today, the so-\ncalled Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, is \nsimply more of the same. We've been here 61 times before, making today \nthe 62nd vote to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. Enough is \nenough.\n  Ultimately, we are wasting time on a bill destined for a veto and \nhave many reasons to celebrate its imminent failure. This bill is \ndesigned to take health insurance from 22 million uninsured Americans. \nIt would cut the subsidies provided to low and middle income Americans \nliving with diabetes and other diseases that allow them to purchase \nprivate health insurance.\n  It would also eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), \nwhich provides investments in public health efforts to prevent and \ndetect diseases like diabetes and cancer. In the first 6 years of the \nFund's inception, $5.25 billion in resources have been sent to states, \ntribal, and community organizations to support community-based \nprevention. The Fund should be strengthened, not eliminated.\n  This bill is also designed to repeal the ACA's Medicaid Expansion. As \nrepresentative of a state that has opted not to expand its Medicaid \nprogram, I know full well the consequences of non-expansion. The \n139,000 working Alabamians who fall in the so-called coverage gap make \ntoo much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for \nsubsidies. My states' decision not to expand this critical program is \nhaving a devastating--almost fatal--impact on rural health clinics and \nhospitals across my district. This provision to repeal Medicaid \nExpansion would have a devastating impact on the 30 states that have \nexpanded their Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, \nincluding 14 states with Republican governors.\n  The bill is also designed to take away family planning, wellness \nexams, and life-saving cancer screenings from millions of American \nwomen. The issue of access to reproductive care is very personal to my \nconstituents as some women have to drive two counties to deliver a \nbaby. For women in Sumter County, that's as far as Tuscaloosa, which is \nan hour away. We shouldn't be in the business of restricting access to \nfamily planning and reproductive care in our communities that are \nalready struggling from high teen pregnancy, infant mortality, and STD \nrates.\n  While I am pleased to see an effort to repeal the burdensome Cadillac \ntax and the medical device tax, I cannot support this dangerous bill in \nits entirety. I will continue to work with my colleagues to repeal the \nCadillac and medical device taxes through other legislative vehicles.\n  Before passage of the ACA, we were spending more money per patient \nthan any country in the world. Under the law, health care prices have \ngrown at the slowest rate in 50 years. This is economic progress that \nall Americans benefit from. While the Affordable Care Act is not \nperfect, there are millions of Americans who now have access to quality \nhealthcare and are leading healthier lives because of it.\n  My constituents and the nurses and doctors who care for them deserve \nbetter. They deserve a Congress that works together to fix what's wrong \nwith our health care system rather that rolling back the progress made \nby the Affordable Care Act. In 2016, we should be a Congress that finds \nsolutions that benefits all Americans. Health care should not be a \nprivilege.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, it's ironic that during our first sessions \nof the new year today, the House gets down to business with fake \nbusiness--defunding Planned Parenthood and the 62nd vote to repeal \nObamacare. Never mind the inevitable veto by a Democratic President--\nthe Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Beven has already vetoed his \nown campaign promise to repeal the Medicaid expansion. A Washington \nPost editorial commended Bevin for ``good sense.'' It's also sound \npolicy and good politics to claim federal funds that your constituents \nhave paid for to improve the health care of half a million low-income \nKentuckians.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood, or federally funded health care for the \n60 percent of their Medicaid patients who depend on Planned Parenthood, \nwould have the same effect as defunding the Medicaid expansion in \nKentucky. Both would take away from the neediest living in underserved \ncommunities for spiteful political reasons.\n  Republicans began 2016 with more of the same, by targeting medical \ncare for the poor. Americans deserve better than the same old \nfoolishness in the new year.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As we begin 2016, we face the same difficulty we have faced since the \nbeginning of the Obama administration. Because the administration and \nthe entrenched Washington regulatory bureaucracy insist on piling \nburden upon burden on the backs of workers, Main Street families, and \nsmall-business owners, America is still struggling to create enough new \njobs and economic growth to produce the prosperity we need.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  To turn this problem around, we must not only stem the tide of \nunnecessarily costly new regulations; we must also get rid of the \ndeadwood in the accumulated, existing regulations that impose almost $2 \ntrillion in annual costs on our economy.\n  How can America's job creators create enough new jobs while \nWashington regulations divert so many of their resources in other \ndirections? The SCRUB Act addresses this problem head-on with new, \ninnovative ways to clear away the clutter of outdated and unnecessarily \nburdensome regulations.\n  For years, there has been a bipartisan consensus that this is an \nimportant task that must be performed. But, as with so many things, the \nhard part has always been the details. Different approaches have been \ntried by different Presidential administrations, and some solutions \nhave been offered by Congress. But, to date, no sufficiently meaningful \nresults have been produced.\n  In many ways, this is because past approaches never fully aligned the \nincentives and tools of all the relevant actors--regulatory agencies, \nregulated entities, the President, the Congress, and others--to \nidentify and cut the regulations that can and should be cut.\n  On their own, regulators have little incentive to shine a spotlight \non their errors or on regulations that are no longer needed. Regulated \nentities, meanwhile, may fear retaliation by regulators if they suggest \nways to trim the regulators' authority. And the sheer volume of the \nCode of Federal Regulations, which now contains roughly 175,000 pages \nof regulations,\n\n[[Page H68]]\n\npresents a daunting task for any Congress or President to address.\n  The SCRUB Act represents a real step forward in our attempts to \neliminate obsolete and unnecessarily burdensome Federal regulations \nwithout compromising needed regulatory objectives. By establishing an \nexpert commission with the resources and authority to assess \nindependently where and how regulations are outdated and unnecessarily \nburdensome, it overcomes the disincentives for agencies and even \nregulated entities to identify problem regulations.\n  In addition, by providing a legislative method to immediately repeal \nthe most problematic regulations, the SCRUB Act assures that we will \ntake care of the biggest problems quickly. Further, by instituting \nregulatory CutGo measures for the remaining regulations the commission \nidentifies for repeal--when Congress approves the repeal--the bill \nassures that the rest of the work of cutting regulations will finally \nhappen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the SCRUB Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Members, my colleagues, I rise, I am sorry to say, in strong \nopposition to H.R. 1155, the so-called SCRUB Act, because it threatens \nto drown agencies in additional layers of red tape and makes it nearly \nimpossible to establish any new rule, no matter how pressing, or to \nissue any guidance on existing rules.\n  Under this bill, an agency must treat every regulation the same, \nregardless of the urgency of the situation or the subject matter of the \nregulation. H.R. 1155 achieves this result in several respects.\n  First, the bill would establish a regulatory CutGo process, forcing \nagencies to prioritize between existing protections and responding to \nnew threats to our health and safety. This draconian, one-size-fits-all \nretrospective review process would obligate an agency to determine the \ncosts of a new regulation and eliminate an existing regulation in order \nto pay for it.\n  Next, the SCRUB Act is a dangerous solution in search of a problem. \nIn principle, retrospective review of existing regulations is certainly \nnot a bad idea. It is hard to argue against the notion that agencies \nshould periodically assess whether the rules they promulgated are as \ngood as they can be or whether they are even necessary in light of \nchanged circumstances.\n  However, each agency already conducts oversight through retrospective \nreview of agency rules, narrowing the delegations of authority to \nagencies, controlling agency appropriations, and conducting oversight \nof agency activity.\n  And finally, we must acknowledge that the real intent of this \nlegislation is to hobble the ability of the agencies to regulate.\n  Proponents of this legislation rely on unsubstantiated rhetoric that \nregulations inhibit economic development. Supporters of so-called \nregulatory ``reform'' measures like the SCRUB Act claim that regulation \nimposes such costs on businesses that it stifles economic growth and \njob creation.\n  In support of this contention, they repeatedly cite a widely debunked \nstudy by economists Mark and Nicole Crain that claims Federal \nregulation imposes an annual cost of $1.75 trillion on business. The \nCrain study, however, has been extensively criticized for exaggerating \nthe costs of Federal rulemaking on small businesses.\n  In recognition of these concerns, the Coalition for Sensible \nSafeguards, an alliance of more than 150 consumer, labor, research, \nfaith, and other public interest groups, strongly oppose this \nlegislation. In addition, the White House has released a Statement of \nAdministration Policy that threatens to veto this legislation.\n  Accordingly, I sincerely urge my colleagues to join with me in \nopposing H.R. 1155.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, 175,268. That is the number of \npages of Federal regulations on the books that are breaking down the \nbacks of small businesses, farmers, and families across our entire \ncountry.\n  Some of the folks across the aisle may say that there aren't any \nunnecessary regulations, there aren't regulations that cause an undue \nburden on families, there may not be any that are outdated. Let me give \nyou a list of a couple that I came across just in the last couple of \nyears.\n  I spoke to some dairy farmers in my congressional district. Not too \nlong ago, according to the EPA, if they stored more than 1,320 gallons \nof milk, they had to prepare the same kind of hazardous spill \nrequirement that these large oil companies do with oil spills.\n  Just a few years ago, we had the Department of Labor try to say \nwhether my nephews or anyone's kids or grandkids could perform common \nchores on the family farm.\n  We also had the EPA trying to implement ambient air quality standards \nthat are so unrealistic that literally the Mark Twain National Forest \nin southeast Missouri would be considered in some areas a nonattainment \nzone. And I can tell you right now that I would rather breathe the \noxygen in southeast Missouri than in any of the big coastal cities on \nthe East or the West side.\n  We have also seen this administration act with the stroke of a pen to \ntry and implement rules that could not be passed by legislation in \nCongress, such as cap-and-trade when the Democrats controlled the House \nin 2010. Now the President is trying to implement those environmental \npolicies, which would ultimately double and triple the utility rates of \npeople on fixed incomes in southeast Missouri.\n\n  We had an issue where the National Park Service implemented a rule \nsaying that a local Baptist church in south-central Missouri could not \nperform their water baptism service along the Current River, an act \nthat they had been doing for decades. This was a rule that came up.\n  Mr. Chairman, as I have stated, there are multiple rules--and I could \ngo on and on--that are unnecessary, outdated, and causing an undue \nburden on businesses. This is the opportunity where citizens across the \ncountry can come before this commission and request rules to be seen \nand to be looked at that would actually make government smaller, more \nefficient, and accountable.\n  I am asking this body to help support the SCRUB Act so we can reform \ngovernment regulation at the Federal level like we have done at the \nState level when I was there.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 1155, the SCRUB Act, a one-way ratchet \nwith the sole aim of prioritizing costs over benefits through the \nreckless elimination of rules without consideration of their benefit.\n  This legislation would shift the costs of rules from corporations to \nconsumers, while posing substantial burdens and delays to agencies, \nthereby undermining public health and safety.\n  Title II of H.R. 1155 prohibits agencies from issuing a single new \nrule until the agency first offsets the cost of the new rule by \nrepealing an existing rule specified by the commission. These \nregulatory CutGo provisions would apply to every new agency rule, no \nmatter how important or pressing, for every regulatory agency.\n  For instance, any expert regulatory agency seeking to promulgate a \nnew rule to safeguard vehicles from ignition switch failures, to \nkeeping our water clean from chemical contamination, or to protect our \nhospitals in the event of an outbreak of an infectious disease would \nfirst have to eliminate an existing rule, which would trigger a new \nrulemaking process altogether to rescind that rule, causing years in \ndelays.\n  Furthermore, title II lacks any mechanism for agencies to issue \nemergency rules that protect the public and environment from imminent \nharm. These procedures are dangerous and would tie the hands of \nagencies responding to public health crises requiring timely regulatory \nresponses.\n  Additionally, agencies are unable to simply rescind rules. Instead, \nthe APA requires that agencies follow the same notice and comment \nprocedures to eliminate a rule as would be required to issue the same \nrule in the first place.\n  Thus, under the bill's requirements, prior to promulgating a new \nrule, agencies would likely need to prepare two\n\n[[Page H69]]\n\nsets of proposals: one for a new rule and one for eliminating an \nexisting rule required by the commission through regulatory CutGo. This \nprocess may take anywhere from a few months to several years, \nespecially when the underlying rule involves complex issues.\n  Lastly, the SCRUB Act is a dangerous solution in search of a problem. \nEach branch of government already conducts effective oversight through \nretrospective review of agency rules, narrowing the delegations of \nauthority to agencies controlling agency appropriations and conducting \noversight of agency activity.\n  Congress also has the specific authority under the Congressional \nReview Act to disapprove any rule that an agency proposes.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Rather than meaningfully streamlining the rulemaking process, \nregulatory CutGo would ossify the regulatory system by causing years of \ndelay in the rulemaking process, creating additional layers and burdens \nin the regulatory system.\n  In total, the SCRUB Act would essentially function as a choke hold on \nFederal agency rulemaking; therefore, we should change the name of the \nSCRUB Act to the ``Scrooge Act.'' It delays any new action by an agency \nand drains agency resources and taxpayer dollars in a time of \nwidespread budget austerity.\n  Lastly, I would comment that imposing the same regulatory burden on a \ndairy farmer as is imposed on an oil producer or an oil company sounds \nto me like the oil companies have been having a great day with the \nrules around here of late if they have got to do what we require a \ndairy farmer to do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, here in Washington, it is often difficult \nto see the true breadth and effect of the nearly $2 trillion regulatory \nburden imposed by Federal regulations, but in my Pennsylvania district, \nyou see these burdens in everyday life.\n  Across the spectrum of businesses, the struggle with regulatory \ncompliance is an ever-present drag on creating jobs, economic growth, \nand innovation. I hear the same stories from small, family-owned \nrestaurants, to mechanics, shop owners, and even landscapers. Due to \ndecades of regulation from Washington, they are forced to focus as much \ntime or more on compliance instead of running their businesses. These \nare real costs in dollars that are lost to needless and, in many cases, \noutdated red tape.\n  The SCRUB Act will start the process of unraveling years of \nconvoluted, sometimes contradictory, regulations and eliminating the \ncosts that come with them. It is a bill that will modernize our Code of \nFederal Regulations for the 21st Century by eliminating regulations \nfrom the last one. Just as important, it is a bill that will lessen the \namount of money spent by our government in enforcing regulations that \nare no longer needed.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this piece of legislation, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  Mr. PETERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Harvard Business School's United States \nCompetitiveness Project has outlined eight actions it recommends that \nCongress take to make America the most economically competitive place \nin the world to do business, not just to increase corporate profits, \nbut to increase wages for working people across America.\n  Among those eight steps, which include immigration reform, \nresponsible Federal budgeting, tax reform, and investing in \ninfrastructure and research, is simplifying Federal regulation. The \nidea is not to lower standards but to regulate more intelligently, \nkeeping in mind costs and benefits, and focusing on outcomes rather \nthan compliance methods.\n  I am in lockstep agreement with the Harvard Business School and with \nHouse Republican leadership and with many of my Democratic colleagues \non the objective of simplifying and streamlining Federal regulation. \nBut what frustrates me today is that the House Republican leadership's \nso-called SCRUB Act has no chance of passage, and they know it. Because \nit requires costs to be arbitrarily cut, with no policy goal, and makes \nit hard to do even good rulemaking in the future, it has virtually no \nsupport among Democrats, including, most notably, the President of the \nUnited States, who would have to sign the bill for it to become law.\n  If we want to be serious about regulatory reform, we should bring up \na bill that has bipartisan support, will pass this Chamber, and has a \nchance at the President's approval as well.\n  The amendment that will be offered later by the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Murphy), my colleague, that I cosponsored, is based on the \nRegulatory Improvement Act of 2015. The bill is strongly bipartisan, \ncounting new Democrats, moderate Republicans, and even Freedom Caucus \nmembers among its cosponsors.\n  It would empower, like the SCRUB Act, an independent, bipartisan \ncommission to sift through the regulatory accumulation of the past \ndecades to recommend changes and eliminations and to present those \nrecommendations to Congress for an up-or-down vote.\n  Now, we have heard the Republican leadership say that Congress, in \n2016, will be about drawing contrasts. Apparently, that means that, \nrather than seeking to work together in areas on which we agree, we \nwill have a series of these message bills, like the SCRUB Act, that are \nmore about making a political point than making policy. So we will talk \nabout the SCRUB Act instead of passing the Regulatory Improvement Act; \nand therefore, we will not provide the economy and our workers the \nregulatory relief that we all want to provide them and we agreed that \nthey need. And that, drawing contrasts to win elections instead of \nworking on solutions for our constituents in areas in which Republicans \nand Democrats agree, is what people hate about Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan approach.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I rise this evening in support of H.R. \n1155, the SCRUB Act, and would like to thank my colleague from Missouri \n(Mr. Smith) for his leadership in this matter.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation is aimed at decreasing the regulatory \nburden facing our Nation's small businesses. Small businesses account \nfor 7 out of every 10 new jobs created in America today--7 out of 10.\n  Unfortunately, overly burdensome regulations particularly impact \nsmall businesses. Oppressive Federal regulations are holding our small \nbusinesses back from growing and creating more jobs, and we all know we \nneed more jobs created in this country.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business in the House, I hear \nfrom small-business folks every week from all over the country who are \nstruggling under the weight of excessive regulations.\n  In the West End of Cincinnati, for example, the Wegman Company is \nfinding it next to impossible to comply with ObamaCare and SBA loan \nrequirements. They say that reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens \nwould allow them to focus their energy and time and resources on \ngrowing and expanding their business and creating the jobs that are \nsorely needed in Cincinnati.\n  The SCRUB Act will create a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission to \nclosely examine the mountain of costly existing Federal regulations and \ntarget those that ought to be repealed. In particular, the commission \nwill prioritize reviews of major rules, some that are more than 15 \nyears old and that impose disproportionately high costs on America's \nsmall businesses.\n  H.R. 1155 will provide a commonsense way to identify and repeal \noutdated regulations that unnecessarily and disproportionately burden \nsmall businesses. I urge my colleagues to support the SCRUB Act.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n\n[[Page H70]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have certain sympathy to what my friend from \nCalifornia talked about. There are areas of being able to move forward \nto be able to fine-tune the regulatory system. The problem with the \napproach that is taken here--it has no chance of being enacted into law \nand includes sort of a mindless approach in a formula basis that has no \nreality basis going forward.\n  We have used government regulation to be able to fine-tune \nlegislation. Can it be done better? I have no doubt.\n  One of the things I feel very strongly about, it is not a case of \nhaving a mindless formula, having a group of unelected bureaucrats. I \nfind that my friends on the other side of the aisle had spasms of angst \nand fury about unelected bureaucrats advising Congress dealing with the \nAffordable Care Act to try and help maintain targets for Medicare \nsavings, but they have referred to unelected bureaucrats in this \nregard.\n  One of the things that I think is important is that we not implement \na theory here that would engage us in more rulemaking, more expenses. \nThis would effectively dramatically increase the amount of time and \nenergy, reducing the flexibility to be able to move forward.\n  It would be much more productive if we were focusing on the principle \nof performance-based regulation. Establish what it is that we are \ntrying to do; provide the actors and actresses in the private sector \nand in government with achievable benchmarks to guide the behavior that \nwe are trying to achieve.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. A performance-based regulatory system would have less \noverall regulation, give people a target to shoot for that wouldn't \nhave to be as contentious, and actually be able to get the job done. \nThis would be a much more productive approach rather than legislation \nthat isn't going to go anywhere and, frankly, shouldn't go anywhere.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the fourth branch of government is the bureaucrats. We \ndon't know who most of them are, but they are everywhere. And what they \ndo is, with a certain group of bureaucrats, they regulate. Congress has \nallowed them to do that, by law, and they make all kinds of rules about \neverything.\n  Usually they will take a law, and then they will regulate or form \nrules about that law; and because of that, we have about 175,000 pages \nof regulation. Come a long ways since the Ten Commandments--10 words, \nbasically. Now they have got 175,000 pages of regulations, rules by \nFederal bureaucrats on American businesses and American individuals.\n  Do we really need 175,000 rules? Maybe a few thousand less would be \nbetter.\n  The SCRUB Act tries to organize all of these rules because a lot of \nthem are important. A lot of them are good, and a lot of them are bad. \nA lot of them are dumb, and a whole lot of them are very expensive to \nAmericans.\n  Now, let's just use one example. The Lacey Act was written in about \n1900, and the Lacey Act says, if a crime is committed in another \ncountry regarding importing into the U.S., it is a crime in the U.S. if \nit is a crime in another country.\n  So Abner Schoenwetter was charged with a crime under the \ninterpretation of the Lacey Act because he had the audacity to import \ninto the United States the Caribbean spiny lobster from Honduras that \nwere too small, and he shipped them in paper boxes, cardboard boxes, \ninstead of plastic boxes.\n  Now, never mind that the Honduran Government did not enforce this \nlaw. In fact, the Honduran Government said, in a brief to the U.S. \nGovernment from the Attorney General of Honduras: Don't prosecute him. \nWe don't enforce this law.\n  But no, he is prosecuted under the interpretation of the Lacey Act \nfor bringing in those little bitty lobsters and bringing them in paper \nrather than in plastic. So you know the result? He got 8 years in \nprison for this.\n  Are you kidding me? I mean, I am a former judge. Do we really need to \nbe spending America's money and time on prosecuting people for using \npaper instead of plastic? And that is what happened to him.\n  So the SCRUB Act will go through and try to regulate the regulators \nand regulate the regulations.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is clear that the driver of the SCRUB Act is not the \ndairy farmer, but it is the oil company and those as rich and powerful \nas those are.\n  So, in summary, H.R. 1155 is yet another antiregulatory bill on the \nbig corporation wish list, saddling American taxpayers with a $30 \nmillion check for a bill that wouldn't create one job beyond the \nmembership of the commission itself.\n  This bill has serious flaws, and I would urge my colleagues to reject \nit. Vote ``no'' on H.R. 1155.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  During this debate, my friends from the other side of the aisle have \nraised several false alarms about the alleged harms of this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  The alarm bells that should be ringing for all Americans, however, is \nthe alarm bell about the damage the dead weight of Washington \nregulation is piling on American jobs and wages.\n  All rhetoric aside, the question that needs to be asked is, at the \nturn of this new year, where do American jobs and wages stand? The \nInvestor's Business Daily reports that we have just concluded 8 years \nof zero real wage growth for American workers and families. That means \nzero wage growth for the entire Obama administration--0.0.\n  What about jobs? Ninety-four million Americans above the age of 16 \nare out of the workforce--completely out of the workforce. Labor force \nparticipation has fallen sharply for working-age Americans. And we \nwould have created about 6 million more jobs if the so-called Obama \nrecovery had just been as good and as strong as the average recovery \nsince World War II. The Obama recovery, instead, is the worst recovery \nfrom recession in a postwar era. The near $2 trillion of annual \nregulatory costs crushing our economy's ability to create new jobs and \nhigher wages is a critical part of this problem.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill to help deliver new jobs and better wages to America's workers and \nfamilies.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to first start by thanking the leadership of \nJason Smith in bringing this bill before us.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1155, the Searching for and Cutting \nRegulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2015, also known \nas the SCRUB Act, which we have been talking about.\n  The bill addresses an important issue facing American taxpayers: \never-growing regulation. Each year the Federal agencies add regulation \nafter regulation piling up into an already complex and crowded \nregulatory system. The Code of Federal Regulation now exceeds 175,000 \npages, and every year the Federal Government promulgates thousands of \nnew regulations. It is hard to keep up with all the regulation time and \ntime again.\n  In just the fall of 2015, the semiannual Unified Regulatory Agenda \ncontained 2,000 more regulations, including 144 regulations expected to \ncost over $100 million each. This ever-growing stack of regulations has \nconsiderable impacts on the economy.\n  I want to be clear. This happens no matter what the administration \nis--Democrat, Republican, Bush, Obama, it doesn't matter. It is a \nnatural tendency of the executive branch to want to do what Congress is \nsupposed to do, and there are just things that get implemented that \nneed to be scrubbed out of the system so we can get to some sanity and \nsome reasonableness, so that people can understand what their \ngovernment is expecting of them.\n  I think there is room and there is place for regulation, but it is a \nlimited\n\n[[Page H71]]\n\none. It needs to be well understood, and it is reasonable to search, \ncut, find, and get rid of these burdensome regulations.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my dear friend, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Cummings).\n  I must say, the previous speaker representing the majority on the \nJudiciary Committee reminded me of the meaning of the word chutzpah. To \ncomplain about job growth when your party hands a new, Democratic \nPresident the deepest and worst recession since the Great Depression; \nwhen you leave the country with 10.2 percent unemployment, and that \nPresident and these Democrats in this Congress reversed all that. \nUnemployment is less than half of that, 5 percent. We have had 64 \nconsecutive months of positive--net positive--private-sector job \ngrowth, the longest stretch in American history. And you want to say it \ncould have been better if we hadn't had so much regulation? What an \nextraordinary narrative--and a false one and a dangerous one.\n  The name of this bill is the SCRUB Act. The best thing we can do with \nthis bill is to scrub it from the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives. It is dangerous because it will lift protections on \npublic health and public safety.\n  You don't like regulation. Some regulation is burdensome, and \ncertainly we ought to have regular reviews to make sure we reduce or \neliminate those. We already do. Agencies are already required to do so \nunder the executive orders signed by this President.\n  In fact, those efforts are yielding results. The Administrative \nConference of the United States reports that agencies have identified \n``tens of billions of dollars of cost savings and tens of millions of \nhours of reduced paperwork and reporting requirements through \nmodification of existing regulations'' because of those reviews already \nin place. The Department of Labor, for example, modified its chemical \nhazard labeling requirement, reducing costs to industry by $2.5 billion \nover the last 5 years.\n  I am particularly troubled by the bill's creation of a CutGo scheme \nwhich seems deceptively appealing. That is a plan in which agencies \nwould be required to eliminate an existing regulation before they could \npossibly promulgate a new one. That forces agencies into an arbitrary \nand untenable position of having to choose between preserving existing \npublic health and safety protections or moving to protect against new \nthreats. The bill provides no safe harbor exceptions for any rules, no \nmatter how important, potentially jeopardizing the very public health \nand safety mission of Federal agencies.\n  Of course, Mr. Chairman, the real intent behind this bill and another \nthe House will consider tomorrow is not about improving regulatory \nprocesses but to create delays ad infinitum to grind the regulatory \nprocess to an absolute halt for the benefit of certain corporate \ninterests in America at the public's expense. In addition to not giving \nthe administration any credit for its herculean efforts to streamline \ncurrent regulations, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nconveniently fail to mention any of the health or safety benefits of \nregulation. OMB estimates the annual net--net--benefit of major rules \nissued during this administration is approximately $215 billion. But \nthat is an inconvenient fact. That is a difficult thing to talk about, \nthat there actually could be benefits to public health by cleaner air \nand cleaner water.\n  Further, my colleagues have provided no evidence that regulation \nsomehow serves as the hobnail boot on the neck of the economy, as they \nwould have us believe. I mentioned it is quite the opposite in terms of \nunemployment, in terms of job growth, and in terms of GDP growth.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is this legislation that is unnecessary and \nburdensome and, I suggest, a threat to public health and safety. We \nought to scrub it from the calendar. Short of that, I certainly urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it, as I will.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, The Washington Times cited the Federal \nRegister. In 1 year alone, there were 81,611 pages of new regulations. \nI think it is time that we go back and look at those.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) for \nhis passion on this topic.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, since 2008, the term of the current administration, for \nthe first time since records have been kept, we have a net reduction in \nsmall businesses, according to the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness.\n  I am going to say that again. We have, for the first time in recorded \nhistory, a net reduction in small businesses in this country.\n  There is a study that was done in 2012 by the National Association of \nManufacturers. It says for small manufacturers--for small \nmanufacturers--the cost per employee of complying with regulations is \n$35,000. There is another study that was done for the SBA that \ndetermined that $15,000 per family--per household--is the cost of \ncomplying with regulations in the United States. This is absolutely a \nburden on our families. It is a burden on our economy.\n  Now, at the same time, the administration is out there talking about \nthe promotion of free trade agreements around the country. Explain to \nme how we are going to be able to compete on a level playing field with \nthese other countries if we are tying the American workers' hands \nbehind their backs and throwing them out there on the field?\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I am not sure what bill is being described here by some \nof the previous speakers. This bill sets up a bipartisan commission. \nYou heard numerous examples of regulations that are outdated that might \nhave made a ton of sense in the 1940s and the 1950s. It is 2016. We \nneed to take a fresh look at this.\n  A study was done that determined that this bill could result in the \nreduction or a cost savings of $48 billion annually by taking a fresh \nlook at regulations. Government is not going to save this country. \nGovernment didn't make this country the greatest country in the world. \nIt was competition, it was innovation, and it was hard work by the \nAmerican workforce.\n  Take this regulatory burden off of our workforce, Mr. Chairman, and \nlet's put these people back to work.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this legislation. The SCRUB Act \nwould establish a $30 million commission to duplicate work agencies are \nalready supposed to be doing. The bill would entrust this commission \nwith extraordinary powers that could be subject to abuse. This bill is \nopposed by Citizens for Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more than \n150 consumer, labor, and good government groups. In addition, the \nadministration announced last night that if this bill were presented to \nthe President, his advisers would recommend that he veto it.\n  President Obama has already issued two executive orders to eliminate \nunnecessary regulations. On January 18, 2011, President Obama issued \nExecutive Order No. 13563, requiring each agency to implement plans for \nreviewing its existing rules. It requires each agency to ``periodically \nreview its existing significant regulations to determine whether any \nsuch regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or \nrepealed.''\n  In addition, President Obama issued Executive Order No. 13610 on May \n10, 2012, requiring agencies to report twice a year to the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs on the status of their retrospective \nreview efforts.\n  In November 2014, the Administrative Conference of the United States \nissued a report highlighting the impact of these mandated reviews. The \nreport concluded: ``Implementing President Obama's executive orders on \nretrospective review of regulations, agencies identified tens of \nbillions of dollars of cost savings and tens of millions of hours of \nreduced paperwork and reporting requirements through modifications of \nexisting regulations.''\n  Congress also has the authority and the responsibility to conduct \noversight to review existing agency rules and to recommend or mandate \nreforms. Yet this bill attempts to reduce bureaucracy by creating a new \ncommission\n\n[[Page H72]]\n\nthat would cost taxpayers $30 million--let me say that again--$30 \nmillion to do what agencies and Congress are already doing.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of this bill is the broad authority \nit would give to the commission. The commission would have virtually \nunlimited authority to subpoena witnesses or documents. Specifically, \nsection 101(c) of this bill states: ``The Commission may issue \nsubpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the \nproduction of any evidence relating to the duties of the Commission. \nThe attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence may be \nrequired from any place within the United States at any designated \nplace of hearing within the United States.''\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Most agency inspectors general do not have such broad authority to \ncompel witness testimony, yet this unelected commission would have this \nauthority. The commission would have jurisdiction over every existing \nregulation.\n  This means that it could compel an individual to testify on any \nsubject. A schoolteacher could be compelled to testify about education \nrules or a senior citizen could be compelled to testify about Medicare \nor Social Security rules.\n  Three prominent law professors with the Center for Progressive Reform \nsent a letter opposing this bill last month. The letter said:\n  ``H.R. 1155 would create a convoluted, complex, and potentially very \nexpensive new bureaucracy to review existing agency rules and make \nrecommendations for the repeal or weakening of those rules with little \nmeaningful oversight, transparency, or public accountability to ensure \nthat these recommendations do not subvert the public interest.''\n  This may be a well-intended bill, but it could have dangerous \nconsequences. I urge Members to oppose it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration \nPolicy, dated January 5, 2016.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nH.R. 1155--Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily \n                         Burdensome Act of 2015\n\n                    (Rep. Smith, R-MO, Jan. 5, 2016)\n\n       The Administration is committed to ensuring that \n     regulations are smart and effective, and tailored to further \n     statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient \n     manner. The retrospective review of regulations has been an \n     ongoing priority of this Administration. Starting in 2011, \n     the President institutionalized the retrospective review of \n     regulations in Executive Orders 13563 and 13610, requiring \n     agencies to report twice a year on the status of their \n     efforts. H.R. 1155, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations \n     that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, would make the process \n     of retrospective regulatory review less productive. Further, \n     the bill also would create needless regulatory and legal \n     uncertainty; increase costs for businesses and State, local \n     and tribal governments; and impede common-sense protections \n     for the American public. Accordingly, the Administration \n     strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1155 in its current \n     form.\n       Although outside input and perspective on what rules may be \n     ripe for potential reform or repeal is crucial, retrospective \n     review is most effective when led by the agencies. The bill's \n     creation of a stand-alone commission to review the entire \n     Code of Federal Regulations is likely to produce a haphazard \n     list of rules that, under the procedures in the bill, must be \n     repealed if approved by a joint resolution. There appears to \n     be no mechanism for making thoughtful and modest \n     modifications to rules to improve their implementation and \n     enforcement, which is often the best course of action for \n     making regulations work better. Moreover, the bill's ``cut-\n     go'' approach is problematic: it would interfere with the \n     ability of agencies to issue regulations that are essential \n     for the protection of public health, safety, and the \n     environment.\n       The Administration recognizes that the applicability of \n     ``cut-go'' in H.R. 1155 is narrower than in other bills being \n     considered in the Congress. Nonetheless, it is essential that \n     agencies have the flexibility to promptly issue new, vital \n     rules. This ability should not be constrained by a \n     Commission's recommendation, or Congressional approval of a \n     list of repealable rules. While retrospective review is an \n     Administration priority and an essential tool to relieve \n     unnecessary regulatory burden, it is important that \n     retrospective review efforts not unnecessarily constrain an \n     agency's ability to provide a timely response to critical \n     public health or safety issues, or constrain its ability to \n     implement new statutory provisions.\n       For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. \n     1155 in its current form. If the President were presented \n     with the current version of H.R. 1155, his senior advisors \n     would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIowa (Mr. Blum). I appreciate his passion on this issue.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1155, the Searching for and Cutting \nRegulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act.\n  While the full title is a mouthful, I can assure you that the idea \nbehind this bill is simple and clear: removing obsolete and burdensome \nregulations so our economy can grow.\n  This legislation creates a commission to identify outdated rules, \nstreamlines and updates our regulatory system, and enforces executive \nagencies to repeal unnecessary regulations to offset the cost of new \nones.\n  As a career small business person, I know firsthand what it is like \nto operate and grow a business under the burden of excessive \nregulation. I have met a payroll every week for the last 20 years.\n  I would propose to you, Mr. Chairman, if more of my Democratic \ncolleagues had signed the fronts of paychecks, this Federal Government \nwould produce fewer regulations on businesses today.\n  According to a report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the \ncost to the economy of regulations is a staggering $2 trillion a year. \nAnd we wonder, Mr. Chairman, why manufacturers choose to move their \noperations outside the United States.\n  Instead of hiring more workers, raising wages and benefits, and \ninvesting in technology, many businesses are forced instead to divert \ninvestments toward complying with evermore government regulations. This \nhas to change.\n  As I travel in my district, I am often asked how do we reignite the \neconomy. The answer, Mr. Chairman, is relatively simple. We have the \nfinest entrepreneurs and the finest small-business people in the entire \nworld here in the United States.\n  Simply get out of our way, get off of our backs with excessive \nregulations, get out of our back pockets with excessive fees and taxes, \nand we will grow our businesses, will hire more employees, and we will \ncreate opportunities for our citizens to live their versions of the \nAmerican Dream.\n  I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) for putting this \nproposal forward. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \nmeasure so our businesses can be free from outdated regulations that no \nlonger make sense for America.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman \nyielding.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1155. I think, if all of us are honest in \nthis House, every one of us, certainly myself included, I would be the \nfirst to say I hear on a regular basis from the people of Georgia of \nhow they are literally being strangled economically because of the \noverburdened Federal regulations that are upon them.\n  It is an issue that we must absolutely address. It is an issue that \nwe have dealt with time and again in the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee. Now we have an opportunity to do something about it. \nThat is why I support H.R. 1155.\n  The SCRUB Act, in essence, will establish a blue-ribbon commission to \nidentify outdated and unnecessary regulations that are placing a burden \non our businesses and individuals. This commission will be comprised of \nexperts from the private sector, academia, as well as government \nagencies.\n  I hope we have heard what has already been said here today. There are \n175,000 pages of regulations amounting to some $2 trillion a year of \nburdens upon our economy, upon businesses, and upon individuals in this \ncountry. It amounts to, as was stated previously, some $15,000 per \nhousehold if it were spread out.\n  How can we tolerate this any longer? We can't. That is the bottom \nline. The commission that will be established\n\n[[Page H73]]\n\nhere will help go through all of these 175,000 pages of regulations and \nhelp end a culture of suffocation and regulation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to have supported the SCRUB Act in the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform in the past, and I am \npleased to do so again today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1155.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make my counterpart aware \nthat I have one additional speaker and then I am prepared to close.\n  At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nHultgren).\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman.\n  I rise today as an original cosponsor of the SCRUB Act that relieves \nthe burdensome impact of unnecessary Federal regulation on Americans.\n  This legislation establishes a systematic process to reduce \nregulatory costs. It comes at a time when the President continues to \nlimit Americans' economic freedom by issuing new decrees from \nWashington.\n  According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Obama \nadministration issued a staggering 82,036 pages of proposed rules just \nin 2015, eclipsing its own 2010 record. In 2015, that equaled a total \nof 3,408 rules and regulations.\n  The weight of Federal regulations is a millstone around the necks of \nentrepreneurs and small businesses struggling to survive amid economic \nuncertainty. The SCRUB Act provides a means to cut unnecessary \nregulations and help the economy recover. It incorporates elements of \nmy own bill, the Regulatory Review and Sunset Act.\n  Like my bill, the SCRUB Act requires the review of existing \nregulations to identify those in need of repeal. Under the review \nprocess, it prioritizes those regulations with a major economic impact \nand that impose a disproportionate economic burden on small businesses.\n  It requires recommendations on regulatory repeal to be presented to \nCongress for approval. If Congress gives the okay, repeal must happen.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike support eliminating the costs of \nunnecessary and obsolete regulations to help economic recovery. The \nSCRUB Act provides a meaningful, bipartisan mechanism to achieve this \ngoal.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman. I urge passage.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, Mr. Chairman, the Members on the other side of the aisle \ntalk about the costs of regulations. I think we always have to keep in \nmind there is a reason for regulations.\n  Sadly, in many instances, there have been abuses where public health \nsafety is concerned. We have to make sure that we draw that balance. I \nthink President Obama has done a lot in that regard and has probably \ndone more than many of his predecessors.\n  It is important to remember that these regulations have enormous \nbenefits. In October, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nreported that the net benefits of major rules issued during the Obama \nadministration, from 2009 to 2014, is some $215 billion. Agencies have \nalso reduced the cost of regulations by streamlining existing rules.\n\n  In 2014, the Administrative Conference of the United States reported \nthat more than 90 percent of agency retrospective reviews resulted in \namendments to the Code of Federal Regulations. For example, the \nDepartment of Labor modified the chemical hazard labeling requirements, \nwhich saved manufacturers around $2.5 billion over 5 years.\n  We do not need to waste $30 million on a new commission to review \nrules when agencies are already performing this function without \nadditional taxpayer funding.\n  I urge all Members to vote against this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I urge passage of this bill. I want to congratulate our colleague, \nCongressman Jason Smith, for his good, diligent work on this. A lot of \nMembers have had a deep-seated interest in this. There has been, I \nthink, a good discussion about this.\n  In general, I think what we are proposing is very fair and it is very \nbalanced. We are asking for a bipartisan group of people to go back and \nreview things. I think it would be naive at best to think that things \nthat were added as regulations in the 1940s or the 1950s are \nautomatically--automatically--by default necessary today.\n  Sometimes you have to go back and look. And we are asking to do this \nin a bipartisan way. That is not a heavy lift. It is not unreasonable. \nIt is very balanced in its approach. I think it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Is there a proper role of regulation? Of course. It doesn't mean that \neverything needs to be regulated. I worry about the men and women, the \nyoung entrepreneurs, that are trying to get things done because they \nrun into hurdles they never knew were there. We handcuff people. There \nare unintended consequences. The economy is different today than it was \nin the 1930s or the 1940s.\n  It is reasonable to go back and try to scrub out some of these \nregulations and do so in a bipartisan way, but, yet, there is \nopposition to that. Nevertheless, I think we put together a good bill. \nI urge Members to vote for it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule and is considered read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The President shall appoint 2 members of \n     the Commission from each list provided under this \n     subparagraph, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C).\n\n[[Page H74]]\n\n       (C) Resubmission of candidate.--The President may request \n     from the presenter of the list under subparagraph (B) a new \n     list of one or more candidates if the President--\n       (i) determines that any candidate on the list presented \n     pursuant to subparagraph (B) does not meet the qualifications \n     specified in such subparagraph to be a member of the \n     Commission; and\n       (ii) certifies that determination to the congressional \n     officials specified in subparagraph (B).\n       (c) Powers and Authorities of the Commission.--\n       (1) Meetings.--The Commission may meet when, where, and as \n     often as the Commission determines appropriate, except that \n     the Commission shall hold public meetings not less than twice \n     each year. All meetings of the Commission shall be open to \n     the public.\n       (2) Hearings.--In addition to meetings held under paragraph \n     (1), the Commission may hold hearings to consider issues of \n     fact or law relevant to the Commission's work. Any hearing \n     held by the Commission shall be open to the public.\n       (3) Access to information.--The Commission may secure \n     directly from any agency information and documents necessary \n     to enable the Commission to carry out this Act.

The application may be made within the \n     judicial district where the hearing is conducted or where \n     that person is found, resides, or transacts business. Any \n     failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the \n     court as civil contempt.\n       (C) Service of subpoenas.--The subpoenas of the Commission \n     shall be served in the manner provided for subpoenas issued \n     by a United States district court under the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure for the United States district courts.\n       (D) Service of process.--All process of any court to which \n     application is made under subparagraph (B) may be served in \n     the judicial district in which the person required to be \n     served resides or may be found.\n       (d) Pay and Travel Expenses.--\n       (1) Pay.--\n       (A) Members.--Each member, other than the Chair of the \n     Commission, shall be paid at a rate equal to the daily \n     equivalent of the minimum annual rate of basic pay payable \n     for level IV of the Executive Schedule under section 5315 of \n     title 5, United States Code, for each day (including travel \n     time) during which the member is engaged in the actual \n     performance of duties vested in the Commission.\n       (B) Chair.--The Chair shall be paid for each day referred \n     to in subparagraph (A) at a rate equal to the daily \n     equivalent of the minimum annual rate of basic pay payable \n     for level III of the Executive Schedule under section 5314 of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Travel expenses.--Members shall receive travel \n     expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, in \n     accordance with sections 5702 and 5703 of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (e) Director of Staff.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall appoint a Director.\n       (2) Pay.--The Director shall be paid at the rate of basic \n     pay payable for level V of the Executive Schedule under \n     section 5316 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (f) Staff.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Director, \n     with the approval of the Commission, may appoint, fix the pay \n     of, and terminate additional personnel.\n       (2) Limitations on appointment.--The Director may make such \n     appointments without regard to the provisions of title 5, \n     United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive \n     service, and any personnel so appointed may be paid without \n     regard to the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of \n     chapter 53 of that title relating to classification and \n     General Schedule pay rates, except that an individual so \n     appointed may not receive pay in excess of the annual rate of \n     basic pay payable for GS-15 of the General Schedule.\n       (3) Agency assistance.--Following consultation with and \n     upon request of the Chair of the Commission, the head of any \n     agency may detail any of the personnel of that agency to the \n     Commission to assist the Commission in carrying out the \n     duties of the Commission under this Act.\n       (4) GAO and oira assistance.--The Comptroller General of \n     the United States and the Administrator of the Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs shall provide assistance, \n     including the detailing of employees, to the Commission in \n     accordance with an agreement entered into with the \n     Commission.\n       (5) Assistance from other parties.--Congress, the States, \n     municipalities, federally recognized Indian tribes, and local \n     governments may provide assistance, including the detailing \n     of employees, to the Commission in accordance with an \n     agreement entered into with the Commission.\n       (g) Other Authority.--\n       (1) Experts and consultants.--The Commission may procure by \n     contract, to the extent funds are available, the temporary or \n     intermittent services of experts or consultants pursuant to \n     section 3109 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Property.--The Commission may lease space and acquire \n     personal property to the extent funds are available.\n       (h) Duties of the Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall conduct a review of \n     the Code of Federal Regulations to identify rules and sets of \n     rules that collectively implement a regulatory program that \n     should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to the \n     economy. The Commission shall give priority in the review to \n     rules or sets of rules that are major rules or include major \n     rules, have been in effect more than 15 years, impose \n     paperwork burdens that could be reduced substantially without \n     significantly diminishing regulatory effectiveness, impose \n     disproportionately high costs on entities that qualify as \n     small entities within the meaning of section 601(6) of title \n     5, United States Code, or could be strengthened in their \n     effectiveness while reducing regulatory costs. The Commission \n     shall have as a goal of the Commission to achieve a reduction \n     of at least 15 percent in the cumulative costs of Federal \n     regulation with a minimal reduction in the overall \n     effectiveness of such regulation.\n       (2) Nature of review.--To identify which rules and sets of \n     rules should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to \n     the economy, the Commission shall apply the following \n     criteria:\n       (A) Whether the original purpose of the rule or set of \n     rules was achieved, and the rule or set of rules could be \n     repealed without significant recurrence of adverse effects or \n     conduct that the rule or set of rules was intended to prevent \n     or reduce.\n       (B) Whether the implementation, compliance, administration, \n     enforcement or other costs of the rule or set of rules to the \n     economy are not justified by the benefits to society within \n     the United States produced by the expenditure of those costs.\n       (C) Whether the rule or set of rules has been rendered \n     unnecessary or obsolete, taking into consideration the length \n     of time since the rule was made and the degree to which \n     technology, economic conditions, market practices, or other \n     relevant factors have changed in the subject area affected by \n     the rule or set of rules.\n       (D) Whether the rule or set of rules is ineffective at \n     achieving the purposes of the rule or set of rules.\n       (E) Whether the rule or set of rules overlaps, duplicates, \n     or conflicts with other Federal rules, and to the extent \n     feasible, with State and local governmental rules.\n       (F) Whether the rule or set of rules has excessive \n     compliance costs or is otherwise excessively burdensome, as \n     compared to alternatives that--\n       (i) specify performance objectives rather than conduct or \n     manners of compliance;\n       (ii) establish economic incentives to encourage desired \n     behavior;\n       (iii) provide information upon which choices can be made by \n     the public;\n       (iv) incorporate other innovative alternatives rather than \n     agency actions that specify conduct or manners of compliance; \n     or\n       (v) could in other ways substantially lower costs without \n     significantly undermining effectiveness.\n       (G) Whether the rule or set of rules inhibits innovation in \n     or growth of the United States economy, such as by impeding \n     the introduction or use of safer or equally safe technology \n     that is newer or more efficient than technology required by \n     or permissible under the rule or set of rules.\n       (H) Whether or not the rule or set of rules harms \n     competition within the United States economy or the \n     international economic competitiveness of enterprises or \n     entities based in the United States.\n       (I) Such other criteria as the Commission devises to \n     identify rules and sets of rules that can be repealed to \n     eliminate or reduce unnecessarily burdensome costs to the \n     United States economy.\n       (3) Methodology for review.--The Commission shall establish \n     a methodology for conducting the review (including an overall \n     review and discrete reviews of portions of the Code of \n     Federal Regulations), identifying rules and sets of rules, \n     and classifying rules under this subsection and publish the \n     terms of the methodology in the Federal Register and on the \n     website of the Commission. The Commission may propose and \n     seek public comment on the methodology before the methodology \n     is established.\n       (4) Classification of rules and sets of rules.--\n       (A) In general.--After completion of any review of rules or \n     sets of rules under paragraph (2), the Commission shall \n     classify each rule or set of rules identified in the review \n     to qualify for recommended repeal as either a rule or set of \n     rules--\n       (i) on which immediate action to repeal is recommended; or\n       (ii) that should be eligible for repeal under regulatory \n     cut-go procedures under title II.\n\n[[Page H75]]\n\n       (B) Decisions by majority.--Each decision by the Commission \n     to identify a rule or set of rules for classification under \n     this paragraph, and each decision whether to classify the \n     rule or set of rules under clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph \n     (A), shall be made by a simple majority vote of the \n     Commission. No such vote shall take place until after all \n     members of the Commission have been confirmed by the Senate.\n       (5) Initiation of review by other persons.--\n       (A) In general.--The Commission may also conduct a review \n     under paragraph (2) of, and, if appropriate, classify under \n     paragraph (4), any rule or set of rules that is submitted for \n     review to the Commission by--\n       (i) the President;\n       (ii) a Member of Congress;\n       (iii) any officer or employee of a Federal, State, local or \n     tribal government, or regional governmental body; or\n       (iv) any member of the public.\n       (B) Form of submission.--A submission to the Commission \n     under this paragraph shall--\n       (i) identify the specific rule or set of rules submitted \n     for review;\n       (ii) provide a statement of evidence to demonstrate that \n     the rule or set of rules qualifies to be identified for \n     repeal under the criteria listed in paragraph (2); and\n       (iii) such other information as the submitter believes may \n     be helpful to the Commission's review, including a statement \n     of the submitter's interest in the matter.\n       (C) Public availability.--The Commission shall make each \n     submission received under this paragraph available on the \n     website of the Commission as soon as possible, but not later \n     than 1 week after the date on which the submission was \n     received.\n       (i) Notices and Reports of the Commission.--\n       (1) Notices of and reports on activities.--The Commission \n     shall publish, in the Federal Register and on the website of \n     the Commission--\n       (A) notices in advance of all public meetings, hearings, \n     and classifications under subsection (h) informing the public \n     of the basis, purpose, and procedures for the meeting, \n     hearing, or classification; and\n       (B) reports after the conclusion of any public meeting, \n     hearing, or classification under subsection (h) summarizing \n     in detail the basis, purpose, and substance of the meeting, \n     hearing, or classification.\n       (2) Annual reports to congress.--Each year, beginning on \n     the date that is one year after the date on which all \n     Commission members have been confirmed by the Senate, the \n     Commission shall submit a report simultaneously to each House \n     of Congress detailing the activities of the Commission for \n     the previous year, and listing all rules and sets of rules \n     classified under subsection (h) during that year.

This report may be \n     included in the final annual report of the Commission under \n     paragraph (2) and may include the Commission's recommendation \n     whether the Commission should be reauthorized by Congress.\n       (j) Repeal of Regulations; Congressional Consideration of \n     Commission Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2)--\n       (A) the head of each agency with authority to repeal a rule \n     or set of rules classified by the Commission under subsection \n     (h)(4)(A)(i) for immediate action to repeal and newly listed \n     as such in an annual or final report of the Commission under \n     paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (i) shall repeal the rule \n     or set of rules as recommended by the Commission within 60 \n     days after the enactment of a joint resolution under \n     paragraph (2) for approval of the recommendations of the \n     Commission in the report; and\n       (B) the head of each agency with authority to repeal a rule \n     or set of rules classified by the Commission under subsection \n     (h)(4)(A)(ii) for repeal and newly listed as such in an \n     annual or final report of the Commission under paragraph (2) \n     or (3) of subsection (i) shall repeal the rule or set of \n     rules as recommended by the Commission pursuant to section \n     201, following the enactment of a joint resolution under \n     paragraph (2) for approval of the recommendations of the \n     Commission in the report.\n       (2) Congressional approval.--\n       (A) In general.--No head of an agency described in \n     paragraph (1) shall be required by this Act to carry out a \n     repeal listed by the Commission in a report transmitted to \n     Congress under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (i) until a \n     joint resolution is enacted, in accordance with the \n     provisions of subparagraph (B), approving such \n     recommendations of the Commission for repeal.\n       (B) Terms of the resolution.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (A), the term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint \n     resolution which is introduced after the date on which the \n     Commission transmits to the Congress under paragraph (2) or \n     (3) of subsection (i) the report containing the \n     recommendations to which the resolution pertains, and--\n       (i) which does not have a preamble;\n       (ii) the matter after the resolving clause of which is only \n     as follows: ``That Congress approves the recommendations for \n     repeal of the Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission as \n     submitted by the Commission on ____'', the blank space being \n     filled in with the appropriate date;

App.).\n       (2) Advisory committee management officer.--The Commission \n     shall not be subject to the control of any Advisory Committee \n     Management Officer designated under section 8(b)(1) of the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).\n\n[[Page H76]]\n\n       (3) Subcommittee.--Any subcommittee of the Commission shall \n     be treated as the Commission for purposes of the Federal \n     Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).\n       (4) Charter.--The enactment of the SCRUB Act of 2015 shall \n     be considered to meet the requirements of the Commission \n     under section 9(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 \n     U.S.C. App.).\n\n                      TITLE II--REGULATORY CUT-GO\n\n     SEC. 201. CUT-GO PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in section 101(j)(2)(A) \n     or section 202, an agency, when the agency makes a new rule, \n     shall repeal rules or sets of rules of that agency classified \n     by the Commission under section 101(h)(4)(A)(ii), such that \n     the annual costs of the new rule to the United States economy \n     is offset by such repeals, in an amount equal to or greater \n     than the cost of the new rule, based on the regulatory cost \n     reductions of repeal identified by the Commission.\n       (b) Alternative Procedure.--An agency may, alternatively, \n     repeal rules or sets of rules of that agency classified by \n     the Commission under section 101(h)(4)(A)(ii) prior to the \n     time specified in subsection (a). If the agency so repeals \n     such a rule or set of rules and thereby reduces the annual, \n     inflation-adjusted cost of the rule or set of rules to the \n     United States economy, the agency may thereafter apply the \n     reduction in regulatory costs, based on the regulatory cost \n     reductions of repeal identified by the Commission, to meet, \n     in whole or in part, the regulatory cost reduction required \n     under subsection (a) of this section to be made at the time \n     the agency promulgates a new rule.\n       (c) Achievement of Full Net Cost Reductions.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph \n     (2), an agency may offset the costs of a new rule or set of \n     rules by repealing a rule or set of rules listed by the \n     Commission under section 101(h)(4)(A)(ii) that implement the \n     same statutory authority as the new rule or set of rules.\n       (2) Limitation.--When using the authority provided in \n     paragraph (1), the agency must achieve a net reduction in \n     costs imposed by the agency's body of rules (including the \n     new rule or set of rules) that is equal to or greater than \n     the cost of the new rule or set of rules to be promulgated, \n     including, whenever necessary, by repealing additional rules \n     of the agency listed by the Commission under section \n     101(h)(4)(A)(ii).\n\n     SEC. 202. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       An agency shall no longer be subject to the requirements of \n     sections 201 and 203 beginning on the date that there is no \n     rule or set of rules of the agency classified by the \n     Commission under section 101(h)(4)(A)(ii) that has not been \n     repealed such that all regulatory cost reductions identified \n     by the Commission to be achievable through repeal have been \n     achieved.\n\n     SEC. 203. OIRA CERTIFICATION OF COST CALCULATIONS.\n\n       The Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget \n     shall review and certify the accuracy of agency \n     determinations of the costs of new rules under section 201. \n     The certification shall be included in the administrative \n     record of the relevant rulemaking by the agency promulgating \n     the rule, and the Administrator shall transmit a copy of the \n     certification to Congress when it transmits the certification \n     to the agency.\n\n              TITLE III--RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF NEW RULES\n\n     SEC. 301. PLAN FOR FUTURE REVIEW.\n\n       When an agency makes a rule, the agency shall include in \n     the final issuance of such rule a plan for the review of such \n     rule by not later than 10 years after the date such rule is \n     made. Such a review, in the case of a major rule, shall be \n     substantially similar to the review by the Commission under \n     section 101(h). In the case of a rule other than a major \n     rule, the agency's plan for review shall include other \n     procedures and standards to enable the agency to determine \n     whether to repeal or amend the rule to eliminate unnecessary \n     regulatory costs to the economy. Whenever feasible, the \n     agency shall include a proposed plan for review of a proposed \n     rule in its notice of proposed rulemaking and shall receive \n     public comment on the plan.\n\n                       TITLE IV--JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n     SEC. 401. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Immediate Repeals.--Agency compliance with section \n     101(j) of this Act shall be subject to judicial review under \n     chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (b) Cut-Go Procedures.--Agency compliance with title II of \n     this Act shall be subject to judicial review under chapter 7 \n     of title 5, United States Code.\n       (c) Plans for Future Review.--Agency compliance with \n     section 301 shall be subject to judicial review under chapter \n     7 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given such \n     term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the \n     Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission established under \n     section 101.\n       (3) Major rule.--The term ``major rule'' means any rule \n     that the Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs determines is likely to impose--\n       (A) an annual cost on the economy of $100,000,000 or more, \n     adjusted annually for inflation;\n       (B) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, \n     individual industries, Federal, State, local, or tribal \n     government agencies, or geographic regions;\n       (C) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, \n     investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of \n     United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based \n     enterprises in domestic and export markets; or\n       (D) significant impacts on multiple sectors of the economy.\n       (4) Rule.--The term ``rule'' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (5) Set of rules.--The term ``set of rules'' means a set of \n     rules that collectively implements a regulatory authority of \n     an agency.\n\n     SEC. 502. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-388. Each such amendment may be \noffered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated \nin the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the \ntime specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall \nnot be subject to a demand for division of the question.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Foxx\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-388.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 10, line 13, insert after ``paperwork burdens'' the \n     following ``or unfunded mandates''.\n       Page 11, line 12, insert after ``enforcement'' the \n     following: ``, imposition of unfunded mandates,''.\n       Page 12, line 9, insert after `` excessive compliance \n     costs'' the following: ``, imposes unfunded mandates,''.\n       Page 25, insert after line 4 the following:\n       (n) Definition.--In this section, the term ``unfunded \n     mandate'' has the meaning given the term ``Federal mandate'' \n     in section 421(6) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 \n     U.S.C. 658(6)).\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is relatively simple in that \nit adds consideration of unfunded mandates to the Commission's review \nof existing rules.\n  Each year, Washington imposes thousands of rules and regulations. \nRather than following the rules themselves and asking for funds for new \nprograms, regulators pass the cost along to others by requiring the \nprivate sector, as well as State and local governments, to pay for new \nFederal initiatives through compliance costs.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  These costly mandates make it harder for companies to hire and for \ncash-strapped States, counties, and cities to keep streets safe and \nparks clean.\n  My amendment asks the commission to consider in its review whether \nunfunded mandates imposed in existing regulations are economically \ndefensible and the least burdensome policy option available.\n  Federal agencies often advance Federal Government initiatives without \nusing Federal taxpayer dollars by imposing regulations on local \ngovernments or the private sector. This simple amendment ensures that \ncosts passed to State and local governments or to the private sector \nare both necessary and minimal.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This amendment does nothing to address the fundamental flaws in the \nunderlying legislation. This amendment would simply add unfunded \nmandates as another basis for the commission to prioritize the review \nof certain rules. The underlying legislation contains no exceptions for \nrules, no matter how important.\n  The commission the bill creates could recommend the repeal of rules\n\n[[Page H77]]\n\nsuch as the ones the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives finalized this week that strengthen background check \nrequirements for buying firearms. Such important public safety rules \ncould be jeopardized by this bill.\n  I oppose the underlying bill, and I oppose this amendment, which does \nnot improve the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Messer).\n  Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for offering \nthis important amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment will ensure that costly, unfunded \nmandates are given full consideration by the commission established by \nthis underlying bill.\n  Over the past 10 years, unelected bureaucrats in Washington have \nissued over 36,000 new regulations. Think about that. Over the past 10 \nyears, unelected bureaucrats have issued over 36,000 new regulations. \nThat is a lot. Each of these shift the costs and burdens of this \nadministration's Big Government agenda onto the backs of everyday \nworking people, small businesses, and local governments.\n  These unfunded mandates cost jobs, hurt working Americans, and place \nankle weights on the U.S. economy. It is past time to slow down this \nrunaway train. I urge my colleagues to support the Foxx amendment and \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, in response to my colleague from Maryland, \nlet me say that unfunded mandates take many forms that may not be \nincluded when regulatory costs are counted. That is why strong, \nbipartisan majorities in the House and Senate passed the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act in 1995.\n  Similarly, my amendment ensures that costs passed from Federal \nagencies to State and local governments and private businesses are \nproperly counted and considered. If mandates under review are \neconomically defensible and represent the best policy option available, \nthen the commission will not recommend they be repealed.\n  The issue of unfunded mandates is frequently overlooked in the \ndebates about reforming our regulatory system and carrying out Federal \npolicies. It is all too easy for Washington bureaucrats to write off \nconcerns expressed by a handful of local governments or of a small \nsubset of private businesses, but these decisions have real costs and \nreal effects on the individuals, families, and communities we each \nrepresent.\n  While my amendment is a small change, it ensures that costs passed \ndown to businesses and to State and local governments are truly the \nbest means to achieve desired policy ends; so I thank my colleagues for \ntheir consideration and ask for their support.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Schweikert\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 13, insert after line 12 the following:\n       (I) Whether or not the rule or set of rules limits or \n     prevents an agency from applying new or emerging technologies \n     to improve efficiency and effectiveness of government.\n       Page 13, line 13, strike ``(I)'' and insert ``(J)''.\n       Page 17, line 24, strike ``(G), or (H)'' and insert ``(G), \n     (H), or (I)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, this is one of those occasions in which \nwe walk up to the mike, and we always say it is a simple amendment. \nThis one really is a simple amendment. Many of us here, particularly \nmyself, have a fixation on information and technology as a dramatically \nmore efficient, safe, and healthy way to regulate. So, if you are going \nto have a commission looking at agencies, looking at the levels of \nregulations, looking at the mechanics out there, can it also take a \nlook and make sure it has adopted the most technically appropriate and \nefficient technology for that regulation?\n  A couple of years ago, when sitting on the Committee on Science, \nSpace, and Technology, a division of the EPA and these businesses came \nin, and they brought in stacks of paper that they had to fill out and \nfax in. Okay. It is absurd in today's world, but that is the way the \nregs they were up against were written. If you are going to have a \ncommission looking at what is wrong out there, at what can be made more \nefficient, and at what is inappropriately burdensome, let's also take a \nlook and ask: What can actually be made less burdensome through the use \nof technology?\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment establishes \nadditional criteria for the commission's one-sided review of all \nFederal regulations, authorizing it to identify rules for repeal that \nmay limit or prohibit agencies from adopting technology to improve \nefficiency and effectiveness in order to lower regulatory costs.\n  Although this criteria, itself, may be unobjectionable on its face, \nit does nothing to change the commission's cost-only, deregulatory, and \ndangerous mandate under title I of H.R. 1155. Furthermore, rather than \nallowing agencies to modify or improve existing rules to accommodate \nfor technological changes, this amendment would only create a basis for \neliminating rules.\n  For instance, this amendment would authorize the commission to \nidentify for elimination a rule protecting workers against \ndiscrimination, regardless of the rule's benefits, if the costs \nassociated with the rule could be mitigated by adopting new \ntechnologies to improve efficiency. In other words, no matter how \nimportant and beneficial a rule prohibiting discrimination may be, it \ncould be eliminated if the commission determines that it somehow \nencumbers agency efficiency. That is laughable.\n  As the administration notes in its Statement of Administration \nPolicy, which threatens to veto this bill should it reach the \nPresident's desk, this bill lacks any ``mechanism for making thoughtful \nand modest modifications to rules to improve their implementation and \nenforcement,'' which is often the best course of action before we \nscuttle a rule or as we try to make the regulation work. Accordingly, I \nmust oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, may I quickly inquire as to the time \nremaining.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, let's try something that is, actually, \nfairly novel around here because, in this particular case, this is just \na few words. Let's actually read it: ``Whether or not the rule or set \nof rules limits or prevents an agency from applying new or emerging \ntechnologies to improve efficiency and effectiveness of government.''\n  Oh, come on. How do you oppose that? I understand you may not like \nthe bill, itself, but as an amendment, if we are really trying to push \nour government into this century of utilization of information and \ntechnology, you would at least like this amendment.\n  Look, this is simple. This is actually something we should be weaving \nin and out of what we do here in order to try to drive the use of \ntechnology and information to make us more efficient and more \nrespectful of our taxpayers. As to the quality of information, how do \nyou even know that the way a regulation is being done is actually being \ndone in the most efficient, technologically sound, and rational way? I \nbelieve the simple language here helps drive the commission to actually \nreflect that.\n\n[[Page H78]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Walberg\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 13, insert after line 12 the following:\n       (I) Whether the rule or set of rules harms wage growth, \n     including wage growth for minimum wage and part-time workers.\n       Page 13, line 13, strike ``(I)'' and insert ``(J)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that will \ngive us greater insight into the impact of Federal regulations on the \nwages of American workers.\n  We already know from countless studies that the accumulation of \nregulations increases the cost of goods, which reduces the buying power \nof families and individuals to purchase the items they need and want. \nAn area that we need to study more, though, is what impact regulations \nhave on the wages of most Americans. Given the negative impacts of \nregulations on prices, it is reasonable to conclude that regulations \ncould be a major contributing factor to flattening wages, especially--\nand I say this clearly--for lower income individuals.\n  According to the U.S. Census, the median wage in the U.S. is the same \ntoday as it was in 2007. That is 8 years of no income gain for families \nand workers in Michigan and across the country. The University of \nCalifornia's economists have also found that, since 2009, the average \nincome of the top 1 percent grew by 11.2 percent in real terms while \nthe bottom 99 percent saw their incomes decrease by 0.4 percent. During \nthat same time, there have been over $100 billion in new regulatory \ncosts, according to the Mercatus Center.\n  Many employers I speak to would rather hire more workers or give \ntheir current staffs a raise. Instead, they are forced to spend limited \nresources on making sense of the thousands of pages of new regulations \nthat are coming out of Washington. Employers are spending more on \ncompliance than ever before, leaving little left in their budgets to \nincrease the take-home pay of employees.\n  Some of my colleagues here in Congress believe that more bureaucratic \nred tape and mandates from the Federal Government will actually \nincrease wages and reduce inequality. While these regulations may sound \ngood in theory--some of them--the hard truth is that, over time, they \nlimit economic growth and career advancement opportunities. Most \nalarming is that these negative economic impacts affect lower wage \nworkers the very most--immobilizing them from finding work, from rising \nin their careers, and from increasing their wages.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Fortunately, the SCRUB Act is an innovative approach; and I commend \nits sponsor, Representative Jason Smith, for his work.\n  My amendment, Mr. Chairman, will enhance this important bill by \ninstructing the commission to review the impact of regulation on wages \nas part of their retrospective review.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support my amendment and the bill so \nwe can unleash individuals and industry from regulatory burdens and \ncreate an environment where wages and economy can grow for everyone.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to point out some \nserious concerns about the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nMichigan, which would direct the commission to examine the role that \nregulations have on wage stagnation and income inequality by examining \nthe negative impact regulations have on wages.\n  It is my belief that this amendment is based on the false premise \nthat all regulations have some negative impact on workers and their \nwages. It should be clear that this one-sentence amendment does not \nencompass the full story about the critical impact that workplace \nregulations can have on improving the health, safety, and income of \nworkers.\n  For example, the rules and regulations that have been offered and put \ninto effect by the Department of Labor under this administration have \nimproved worker safety, increased workplace opportunity, and increased \nwages. The benefits are indisputable and far outweigh the costs. For \nexample, the home care workers rule would extend overtime and minimum \nwage protection to 2 million home care workers. The proposed overtime \nrule would extend overtime pay protections for more than 5 million \nAmerican workers who currently would be putting in dozens of overtime \nhours for no extra pay at all.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to note that the description of this \namendment shows an apparent concern for the problems that working \nfamilies face, and the gentleman from Michigan has talked very \nextensively about it: wage stagnation and income inequality. If that is \nwhat we are going to address, there are ways of addressing it.\n  For example, we could bring to the floor for a vote the Raise the \nWage Act, which would increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020 \nand would give over 30 million Americans a raise.\n  We could support the Department of Labor's proposed rule that \nincreases the overtime salary threshold, which would update the \novertime rule to ensure that 5 million more Americans would be eligible \nto earn overtime for hours worked over 40 hours a week. Since the \n1970s, worker output has increased by 74 percent, while the hourly \ncompensation of the typical worker has only increased 9 percent. \nWorkers simply aren't receiving a fair share of the wealth they create, \nand the overtime rule would help address this disparity.\n  We could cosponsor the WAGE Act that would protect hardworking \nAmericans' fundamental right to join together and bargain for better \nwages. To date, 67 House Democrats support the Workplace Action for a \nGrowing Economy, the WAGE Act, legislation that would strengthen \nprotections for workers who want to raise wages and improve workplace \nconditions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support these alternatives, but \nto oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the concerns expressed by the \nranking member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, my \nfriend from Virginia. I appreciate the fact he sits in on all of our \nWorkforce Protections Subcommittee hearings that I have the privilege \nof chairing.\n  We have looked at regulatory changes that the gentleman speaks to. \nHe, as well as the rest of my colleagues on that subcommittee, have \nheard very clear testimony that while they are based on wonderful \ndesires, we all want safe workplaces, we all want people making better \npay, having better benefits, living wages. Yet, all of those come with \ncosts, and, in fact, basically every one of those regulatory ideas \nwould cost jobs and job security. I have seen that very clearly with \nseveral of those in the great State of Michigan as they have been \nimplemented.\n  Mr. Chairman, we should have commonsense, effective regulations that \ntruly punish bad actors, but regulations cannot come at the \noverwhelming costs we are seeing now with anemic growth and stagnant \nwages. Sadly, we don't know how much wages have truly been hit by these \nregulations, which is why my amendment is needed.\n  I ask for support for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Moolenaar). It is now in order to consider \namendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 114-388.\n\n[[Page H79]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 25, strike line 5, and all that follows \n     through page 27, line 13.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike title \nII of H.R. 1155, which would require agencies to undertake a regulatory \nCutGo process to repeal rules identified by the commission with little \nto no consideration of the rules' benefits prior to issuing the new \nrule.\n  These regulatory CutGo provisions would apply to every new agency \nrule, no matter how important or pressing, for every regulatory agency. \nAlarmingly, title II would also require agencies to undertake a notice \nand comment process for all rules eliminated through CutGo because, as \nI noted earlier, agencies are unable to simply rescind the rules. Thus, \nthis bill would substantially delay or even prevent new regulations \nthrough this burdensome and time-consuming requirement.\n  As several of my colleagues' amendments demonstrate, the bill's \nregulatory CutGo procedures are unsafe, dangerous, and would tie the \nhands of agencies responding to public health crises requiring timely \nregulatory responses. In fact, this bill lacks any mechanism for \nconsideration of public policy and safety, which would leave no option \nfor agencies to issue emergency rules to protect the public and \nenvironment from imminent harm.\n  The bill's proponents claim that title I of H.R. 1155 would allow the \ncommission to consider whether the costs of the bill are not justified \nby the benefit to society. As Professor Levin testified during the \nsubcommittee's consideration of a previous version of this bill, the \ncatchall language of subsection (h)(2)(I) would allow the commission to \nrecommend the repeal of ``any rule promulgated by any agency if it \ndeems the rule's requirements to be unnecessarily burdensome.'' In \nshort, the commission would be completely free to disregard any benefit \nof the regulation by proceeding under this language or the bill's other \nadvisory language.\n  Furthermore, H.R. 1155 is silent on what methodology the commission \nmust follow, requiring only that it must have one, which leaves the \nwindow wide open for absolutely no consideration of the benefits of \nregulation.\n  While consideration of the cost of regulations is sometimes \nimportant, there is overwhelming consensus that the benefits of \nregulation vastly exceed the costs. In both the Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, the benefits of our regulatory system of \nregulatory protections have made our country safer, stronger, \nhealthier, and cleaner.\n  The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has observed that \nthese benefits ``include, among other things, ensuring that workplaces, \nair travel, foods, and drugs are safe; that the Nation's air, water, \nand land are not polluted; and that the appropriate amount of taxes is \ncollected.''\n  The GAO reported in 2007 that while ``the costs of these regulations \nare estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, the \nbenefits estimates are even higher.'' In 2012, the Office of Management \nand Budget likewise concluded that even by conservative estimates, the \nbenefits of major regulations exceeded the costs on a 2-to-1 basis over \nthe past decade. Between fiscal years 1999 and 2009, the benefits of \nregulations produced a net benefit of $73 billion, vastly exceeding the \nregulations' costs.\n  This evidence overwhelmingly refutes the bald assertion that \nregulatory costs are burdensome, eliminate jobs, or harm our economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, to oppose this \nmisguided bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Marino).\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  Title II of the bill contains one of the bill's most important \ninnovations, a CutGo process for the repeal of regulations Congress \napproves for repeal.\n  This process is modeled on the CutGo process pioneered in Congress \nitself to control Federal spending. By allowing regulatory repeals to \noccur on a CutGo basis, the bill both stabilizes total Federal \nregulatory costs and avoids forcing all repeals to occur immediately. \nThis creates the opportunity for regulatory agencies applying their \nexpertise and working with the entities they regulate to administer a \nsmoother process of regulatory repeal with ample opportunities to \nprioritize the order of repeals and cooperatively consider any needed \nreplacement regulations.\n  The CutGo process also avoids one of the major flaws of the \nregulatory lookback process applied under executive order by the Obama \nadministration. Although the process has resulted in some cost \nreductions under individual regulations, the net result of the process \nhas been an alarming increase in total costs imposed by all Federal \nregulations. That is a giant step backwards, and it is a result the \nSCRUB Act's CutGo provisions will emphatically prevent.\n  I would like to say for the record, a report by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers states that the total cost of Federal \nregulation in 2012 was $2.028 trillion. The annual cost burden for an \naverage U.S. firm is $233,000, or 21 percent of the average payroll. \nWith that kind of number, no wonder we have the problems that we have. \nListen to this figure: A small manufacturer with fewer than 50 \nemployees will pay an estimated close to $35,000 per employee per year \nto comply with Federal regulations.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I simply want to say that I concur with the gentleman from \nPennsylvania who has studied this and spent a considerable amount of \ntime with this.\n  We would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. This amendment removes \ntitle II of the bill, which is one of the bill's truly most important \nprovisions.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Cummings\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike title IV.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My amendment, which is cosponsored by the Subcommittee on Government \nOperations' Ranking Member Gerry Connolly, would strike title IV of \nthis bill.\n  Title IV provides for judicial review of agency compliance with \ncertain requirements of the bill, including regulatory CutGo \nprocedures.\n  The agency rulemaking process already provides interested parties \nwith ample opportunity for participation.\n\n[[Page H80]]\n\n  When an industry or special interest does not like the result of the \nrulemaking process, this bill gives them another bite at the apple.\n  Judicial review provides opponents of rules with the opportunity to \ndelay regulations by tying them up in court. No rules would be exempt.\n  Corporate and special interests with deep pockets could use judicial \nreview to delay critical regulations that would protect public health, \nsafety, and the environment.\n  Let me give you an example. In August of last year, the EPA finalized \nits Clean Power Plan rules. According to EPA, by 2030, the plan will \ncut carbon pollution from the power sector by nearly a third, yielding \nsubstantial health benefits to Americans.\n  EPA estimates that, because of these regulations, Americans will \navoid 90,000 asthma attacks and save 3,600 lives.\n  These important rules were developed with industry and public input. \nEPA states that it received 4.3 million public comments and held \nhundreds of meetings with stakeholders. The final rules reflect this \nvigorous process.\n  However, if the SCRUB Act were enacted, industry or special interests \ncould use the judicial review provisions to stall important rules like \nthe Clean Power Plan.\n  The judicial review provisions of this bill are yet another attempt \nby the House Republicans to erect a roadblock for important public \nhealth and safety protections.\n  This amendment removes this flawed provision from the underlying \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Marino).\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The amendment strikes the bill's title providing for judicial review \nof agency compliance with requirements for repeal of existing rules and \npublication of plans for decennial review of newly promulgated rules.\n  These provisions must be retained, not stricken. They are critical to \nensure that recalcitrant agencies abide by Congress' approvals of rules \nfor repeal and actually do plan for effective, decennial cost-reduction \nreviews for newly promulgated regulations.\n  We know that, without provision for judicial review, retrospective \nreview of agency regulations can lead to nothing but increases in the \noverall cost of regulation.\n  Just look at the results of the Obama administration's retrospective \nreview under Executive Order 13563, which precluded judicial review.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I again concur with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino). \nThis amendment strikes the applicability of judicial review of agency \ncompliance with this legislation. That is why I am urging a ``no'' vote \non this amendment.\n  The legislation will begin a much-needed review of our Nation's \nregulatory structure and hopefully identify many outdated regulations. \nThis amendment gets in the way of that. I think it would slow this \nprocess down. It gets rid of something that, again, makes it an \nalteration that I think has been well debated and well discussed.\n  I urge the passage of the overall bill, but I stand in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Cummings\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 28, line 22, insert before the period the following: \n     ``, except that the term does not include an independent \n     establishment as defined in section 104 of such title''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My amendment, cosponsored by Subcommittee on Government Operations' \nRanking Member Gerry Connolly, would exempt independent agencies from \nthe requirements of this bill.\n  Independent agencies serve an important role in protecting the \nAmerican people from a range of threats, including the collapse of our \nfinancial markets and health and safety risks.\n  Agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission are designed to independently regulate the industries they \ncover.\n  These agencies are not required to obtain approval for their rules \nfrom the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, as other \nexecutive branch agencies must do. The reason independent agencies are \ntreated differently is to protect them from political interference in \ntheir rulemaking.\n  The SCRUB Act would jeopardize the independence of these agencies by \nsubjecting their rules to oversight by the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs.\n  Section 203 of the SCRUB Act would require OIRA to review and certify \nthe cost estimate for every new rule promulgated by an independent \nagency. This bill would also require independent agencies to comply \nwith the bill's regulatory CutGo requirements.\n  For example, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has a proposed \nrule that would establish safety standards for infant high chairs. How \nwould the Commission choose which unsafe product to stop regulating in \norder to protect the approximately 10,000 children injured each year by \nunsafe high chairs?\n  The Commission recently wrote a rule creating the strongest crib \nsafety standards in the developed world. Would they have to repeal that \nrule? Under our amendment, independent agencies would not have to make \nthis choice.\n  Bank regulators are already subject to the Economic Growth and \nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996, which requires them to \nreview all existing banking regulations and ``eliminate unnecessary \nregulations.''\n  The bank regulators are already required by law to remove all \noutdated, unnecessary, and overly burdensome regulations. They cannot \nsave up outdated regulations for the purpose of promulgating new rules \nunder the SCRUB Act, like other agencies.\n  This bill would handcuff our bank regulators and make financial \ncrises and the recessions that follow that much more likely.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to keep the \nindependent agencies truly independent.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are not proposing to hurt or kill babies, and we are \nnot proposing to put handcuffs on certain regulators in the financial \ninstitutions.\n  What we are asking for is to simply have a bipartisan group of \npeople--bipartisan--look at regulations that may be outdated and scrub \nthem. I think that is a reasonable expectation. That is not asking too \nmuch.\n  It doesn't mean that every regulation is going to go away. There are \nsome good regulations, but there are a lot of bad ones and there are a \nlot that are outdated. Things come into this institution, whether they \ncome in through laws or they come from the executive branch. They never \ngo away. A lot of them are unnecessary.\n\n[[Page H81]]\n\n  The bill creates a bipartisan, impartial commission to conduct a \ncomprehensive review of the Federal regulations system. The commission \nwill identify out-of-date and expensive regulations.\n  Independent agencies function very similarly, if not the same, as \nexecutive agencies, and the regulations impose significant costs on the \neconomy. Unfortunately, independent agencies often impose major \nregulations without reporting any quantitative information on benefits \nand costs, which makes it even more important that those regulations be \nreviewed.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is no need to distinguish independent and \nexecutive agencies in requiring the Federal agencies to clean up out-\nof-date and unnecessary regulations.\n  A regulation identified as unnecessary remains unnecessary regardless \nof whether it came from an independent agency or an executive branch \nagency. It doesn't matter. It should be reviewed or be eligible to be \nreviewed. We think that is reasonable, and that is why we would urge a \n``no'' vote on this particular amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 21, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``, \n     except for a special rule''.\n       Page 29, insert after line 24 the following:\n       (6) Special rule.--The term ``special rule'' means a rule \n     made by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My amendment to H.R. 1155 would exempt rules and regulations made by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs from the burdensome provisions of \nthis legislation.\n  The rules that are promulgated by the Department of Veterans Affairs \nserve the nearly 21.9 million veterans who have served our country, \nmore than 9 million of whom are enrolled in the VA health system.\n  These are the rules that will improve the VA, and these improvements \nare urgently needed to repair a system that is poorly equipped to \nhandle the increasing numbers of veterans returning from overseas. \nThese are the rules that will ensure that those who have served our \ncountry have access to critical and quality health care.\n  However, in its current form, the SCRUB Act would delay or even block \nthe implementation of these rules. For example, it would delay rules \ndesigned to provide care to the 2.6 million veterans who were \npotentially exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam war.\n  To help these veterans, the VA issued a final interim rule in June of \n2015 that would expand the class of veterans presumed to be eligible \nfor treatment. The new regulation would include those who worked with \nC-123 aircraft known to have been sprayed with this herbicide during \nthe war.\n  But under the terms of this legislation, the VA would be required to \ngo through additional hurdles to meet the procedural requirements of \nthis legislation with absolutely no additional benefits. If this rule \ncomes with any cost to the economy, the VA must repeal a rule of equal \nor greater cost. All of this means delays for our veterans who deserve \nbetter.\n  In effect, the SCRUB Act asks the VA to choose between classes of \nailing veterans. It would delay treatment and create a zero-sum game in \nwhich our veterans ultimately lose. This is completely wrong. It would \ndelay essential reforms to improve the system, address existing flaws, \nand better serve our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  The problems that have plagued the system have been well-documented \nboth in congressional hearings and in the press.\n  Since the year 2000, at least 22 government reports have looked into \npatient wait times at VA facilities. One of these reports found that \nmore than 57,000 of our veterans have waited longer than 90 days for \nhealth care. The audit found that staff were instructed to misrepresent \ndata in 76 percent of VA facilities.\n  The VA is in need of immediate attention and reform, and we are doing \na disservice to our veterans by delaying these reforms and the rules \nthat are necessary to accomplish these reforms.\n  The SCRUB Act is based upon the faulty idea that it is more important \nto cut regulations than it is to move forward to improve care for our \nveterans.\n  While my amendment will not cure all that ails this legislation, it \nwill address one of the most glaring flaws and preserve the ability of \nthe VA to effectively serve our veterans by ensuring that these reforms \nmove forward without delay.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, this amendment indicates a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the purpose and the function of the bill. The SCRUB \nAct merely clears the underbrush of outdated and unnecessary \nregulations.\n  There is no reason to exclude any specific agency from retrospective \nreview. A regulation identified as unnecessary remains unnecessary, \nregardless of its subject matter or agency that originally issued it.\n  I am sure that there are regulations that were issued in the 1920s, \n1930s, or 1940s--pick your decade--that were well-intended, but the \nworld has changed, and I think it is time that we actually go and \nreview this.\n  In the case of this amendment, it could disadvantage veterans who are \nlikely to bear the burden of unnecessary regulations. So with all the \nlaws and all the regulations, guess what. The Veterans Administration \nisn't getting it done.\n  So let's clear the underbrush of regulations. Let's work in a \nbipartisan way to fix the Veterans Administration. But it is not \nunreasonable to ask for a bipartisan group of people to go in and look \nat this and study this and make these types of recommendations. I think \nthat is reasonable, it is balanced, and it is not going to harm \nveterans. In fact, I think it is actually going to help veterans. I \nthink it is going to help an administration and a bureaucracy that is \nso bloated, once things get in, they never come out. That is what we \nare trying to change, and that is why I think this amendment is \nunnecessary and counterproductive, and I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Just to respond briefly, we have heard a lot about clearing the \nunderbrush and about scrubbing the regulations. But the reality is, if \nthis legislation passes, there will be certain implications; and it \nwill, in fact, require the VA, who is in the midst of major reform, to \nnot move forward on its regulations that are intended to improve the \nlives of our veterans until they find another regulation to repeal that \nsomeone has determined is of equal cost.\n  So the reality is that it will delay implementation of these \nimprovements. We can describe it as clearing the underbrush and \nscrubbing, but what it will mean for America's veterans in many \ninstances is that they\n\n[[Page H82]]\n\nwill be denied the quality care that they deserve and that they have \nearned in the defense of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that will carve out \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, the agency charged with honoring \nthe service of our veterans, and ensure that the improvements that are \nunderway and that we are all demanding will not be delayed because of \nthe SCRUB Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, there is nothing in the SCRUB Act that is \ngoing to slow it down. It is not an excuse for the administration to do \nwhat they have been trying to do for the last 7 years and have \nabsolutely, totally failed to do.\n  How many times are we going to get constituents coming into our own \noffices complaining about the VA? I guarantee that if you go across \nthis country and ask the people that work in your offices what are the \nnumber one, two, and three complaints and problems that they have, I \nguarantee you in the top three it is going to be veterans.\n  We are not taking care of the veterans that we need to take care of. \nWe are not going to be introducing a bill that is going to harm our \nability to fix that problem. But you are naive, at best, if anybody \nthinks that all the regulations in place right now are just perfect, \nbecause that is, in essence, what they are arguing: it is perfect. We \ndon't need to get rid of anything. We just need more, more, more \nregulations.\n  Take a bipartisan group of people, let them look at it, study it, and \nspend the time necessary in a bipartisan way. That is reasonable. That \nis why we should vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Ms. DelBene\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-388.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 21, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``, \n     except for a special rule''.\n       Page 29, insert after line 24 the following:\n       (6) Special rule.--The term ``special rule'' means a rule \n     made by an agency in response to an emergency.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Ms. DelBene) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Like the mountain of antiregulation bills we have considered in the \npast, the SCRUB Act is in no way a serious effort to make targeted \nimprovements to the rulemaking process.\n  Touted by its supporters as a job creation measure, this \nirresponsible bill takes a sledgehammer approach to reform. \nParticularly egregious is this legislation's complete failure to \nprovide an exemption for emergency situations. My amendment would \ncorrect this very serious mistake.\n  In March 2014, the Oso landslide, a horrific natural disaster that \ntook the lives of 43 people in my district, required every available \nresource to be deployed without delays. And given the many crises the \ncountry faced last year alone, from wildfires to terrorist threats, I \nam alarmed that we are considering a bill today that would get in the \nway of an agency trying to do its job at critical moments like these. \nThe idea that an agency responding to an emergency would be forced to \nweigh what existing regulations to get rid of before they can take new \naction, while lives are at risk, cannot be what this body intends.\n  Bills like this are not jobs packages. They are pandering to a few \nselect corporate special interests that put the lives and well-being of \nevery American at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment and to ensure, \nthe next time our country faces an emergency, the citizens of this \ncountry can rest assured knowing that the Federal agencies they expect \nto provide services in times of crises will not have their hands tied \nby this irresponsible legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I have the greatest respect for our \nMembers here. But to suggest that what we are doing is throwing a \nsledgehammer and that it is pandering, come on. This is a serious \neffort to suggest, in a bipartisan way, to go back and review things.\n  Now, in the case that was brought up earlier in this debate, there \nmay have been an emergency to deal with something in, say, the State of \nWashington. And I hope that was dealt with very successfully. But 70 \nyears from now, it is probably not applicable. And I guarantee you, \nthere are regulations and things that are happening by the tens of \nthousands, by the way, on a regular basis that are no longer needed.\n  All we are asking for is an opportunity to put together a bipartisan \ngroup to go review these. That is what Jason Smith has been passionate \nabout. That is what he is fighting for. That is what is reasonable. \nThat is why we are here today. But to suggest that it is because of \npandering or any other negative word, our heart is sincere in that we \nactually do think that these regulations cause problems.\n  You have got to have bureaucrats who understand all these \nregulations. It is not just the taxpayers--who we work for--but it is \nalso the bureaucrats who are supposed to try to sort all of this out \nand have manual after manual after manual to bind people to the point \nwhere they have a difficult time doing their very jobs that they are \nsupposed to be doing.\n  So should we review things that were put forward on an emergency \nbasis? Yes. I am not saying that has to be done 3 months afterwards. \nBut we are going to be able to have a long look back, and you shouldn't \nexempt out veterans and, in this case, you shouldn't exempt out \nsomebody who is just trying to go back and look at something that may \noriginally become a very legitimate emergency. Why would we not look at \nthat?\n  It is just this attitude and this approach that says everything is \nperfect. Essentially, what the Democrats are arguing is that all of the \nregulations are perfect. No need for any changes. No reason to get rid \nof anything.\n  What we are saying is, in a bipartisan way, let's go back, let's \nreview these, and let's come up with a way to cut out that underbrush. \nLet's try to find the ones that are no longer needed and streamline \nwhat we are trying to do in our government. It will be better for the \nemployees. It will be better for the taxpayers. It will be better for \nAmerica because we will actually understand what the rules and \nregulations are.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chair, I think that my colleague, Mr. Chaffetz, \nwould agree with my amendment because this bill requires that before \nagencies can issue a new rule, they get rid of an old one, and there is \nno exception for emergencies. It seems like a very reasonable approach \nto make sure that, again, in a time of crisis, agencies are able to \nrespond right away.\n  This is an important amendment. It is a very reasonable amendment. It \naddresses a serious flaw in the bill. I ask again for my colleagues to \nvote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I would just remind our colleagues that \nthe cutting doesn't apply until the commission reports back. So until \nthey have had a chance to go in and look and review, then there is an \nopportunity to cut out this underbrush. And I think I have made my \npoint. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).\n\n[[Page H83]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. DelBENE.

Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Cicilline\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) to offer an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 21, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``, \n     except for a special rule''.\n       Page 29, insert after line 24 the following:\n       (6) Special rule.--The term ``special rule'' means a rule \n     made by the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague on the Judiciary Committee, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to Chairman Sessions and \nRanking Member Slaughter for their leadership and for making the \nJackson Lee amendment in order.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to explain this amendment to H.R. 1155, \nthe Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily \nBurdensome Act of 2015, referred to as the SCRUB Act.\n  This amendment would exempt any rule issued by the Department of \nHomeland Security from the onerous mandates of this legislation. If \nenacted, the SCRUB Act would establish a retrospective regulatory \nreview commission to identify existing Federal regulations that can be \nrepealed to reduce unnecessary regulatory costs to the U.S. economy.\n  This bill purports to reduce bureaucracy by establishing a new \nregulatory review commission charged with identifying duplicative, \nredundant, or so-called obsolete regulations to repeal. I am offering \nthis amendment because I am concerned about the procedural process by \nwhich the SCRUB Act attempts to accomplish this worthy goal and the \nreal and potential dangers this legislation presents to our public \nhealth and safety.\n  If passed without this amendment, this legislation could really \nundermine and jeopardize public health and safety. In particular, this \nbill undermines the ability of agencies to act in times of imminent \nneed to protect citizens.\n  The SCRUB Act would prohibit any regulatory agency from issuing any \nnew rule or informal statement, including nonlegislative and procedural \nrules, even in the case of an emergency or imminent harm to public \nhealth, until the agency first offsets the costs of the new rule or \nguidance by eliminating an existing rule identified by the commission. \nThis regulatory CutGo process would force agencies to prioritize \nbetween existing protections and responding to new threats to the \nhealth and well-being of our people and the safety of our homeland.\n  Such a sweeping requirement would endanger the lives of Americans by \ncreating unnecessary delays in the Federal rulemaking process and \ncreating additional burdens and implementation problems that will only \ndivert critical agency resources and diminish agencies' ability to \nprotect and inform the public in times of imminent danger and need.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  For instance, if an agency needed to respond to an imminent hazard to \nthe public or environment, it would have to either rescind an existing \nrule that is identified by the commission's arbitrary and cost-centric \nprocess or choose not to act.\n  This amendment is a simple solution to that problem, and it will \nprotect the health and well-being of all Americans. It would ensure \nthat the Department of Homeland Security is not unnecessarily burdened \nwith regulatory mandates that would jeopardize its ability to carry out \nits mission to prevent terrorism, enhance security, manage our borders, \nadminister immigration laws, secure cyberspace, and ensure disaster \nresilience.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is the first line of defense in \nprotecting the Nation and leading recovery efforts from all hazards and \nthreats, which includes everything from weapons of mass destruction to \nnatural disasters.\n  You may recall the Nation's first documented case of Ebola last year \nin Dallas, Texas. It was an unforeseen and singular event that required \nDHS to develop new procedures and rules governing travel to the United \nStates by individuals who had recently visited countries suffering \nthrough the Ebola outbreak.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was also recently tasked with \nadjusting its efforts to secure the southern border when a wave of \nunaccompanied minors entered the country without notice.\n  We do not need to be reminded of the heightened state of security \nthat we are now in and the increasing demand upon our government \nagencies tasked with keeping our borders and citizens safe.\n  The overall mission of the Department of Homeland Security is too \ncritical and its function so essential that it would be irresponsible \nto impede the agency in the performance of its duties, as this bill \nwould do.\n  Now is not the time to undermine or slow the ability of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to address growing threats and active \nacts of terrorism. The Department of Homeland Security must remain \nfocused on the crucial mission of securing the homeland. This amendment \nwill help them achieve that goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, the amendment indicates a fundamental, I \nthink, misunderstanding of the purpose and the functionality of the \nbill.\n  The SCRUB Act is intended to cut out unnecessary regulations. So the \nfirst question you really have to ask yourself is, are there \nunnecessary regulations?\n  I would remind Members that on May 26, 2011, the Homeland Security \nDepartment, which really hadn't been in place for a very long, as it is \na new agency, started an initiative to cut out unnecessary regulations.\n  The President, three times, has asked to cut out unnecessary \nregulations. So we are formalizing that process a little bit more so \nthat it is true for every department and agency, and we are doing so in \na bipartisan way.\n  So what are we afraid of? What are we afraid of?\n  We are trying to say things need to be reviewed, and they need to go \nlook. And if they are perfect--I doubt it. I really doubt it. But they \nare going to have this opportunity, in a bipartisan way, to allow the \ncommission to go do its work, make recommendations, look at these \nthings that are just there by the tens of thousands.\n  The world has changed. It has dramatically changed. And we ought to \nbe reviewing this on a regular basis, and that is what the SCRUB Act \ndoes.\n  That is why I think, again, creating another carve-out for somebody \nis unnecessary and counterproductive and ill-advised. That is why I \nwould urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, that may well be the purpose of this \nbill, and I don't think anyone would disagree with reviewing \nregulations and making recommendations. That may be the purpose of the \nbill, but that is not what the bill does.\n  What the bill does--and we have to understand the implications, and I \nwill repeat it--it prohibits any regulatory agency from issuing any new \nrule or informal statement, including nonlegislative and procedure \nrules, even in the case of an emergency or imminent harm to the public, \nuntil the agency first offsets the cost of the new rule or\n\n[[Page H84]]\n\nguidance by eliminating an existing rule identified by the commission.\n  So it is not that anyone is suggesting everything is perfect and a \nreview isn't necessary, but it is the procedure that the bill sets \nforth which will become law that requires agencies to delay doing \nanything until they find something to undo.\n  In the context of the requirements and the responsibilities of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, this has potentially life-threatening \nimplications. So it is not that anyone is suggesting everything is \nperfect and a review isn't necessary.\n  But the bill does much more than that. It says to agencies like the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, you may not act, even if it is \nnecessary to protect the public, until you repeal or rescind a \ncorresponding amount of regulation. That is a danger. It is what this \nbill will do.\n  This amendment relieves that and provides an exemption so that, at \nleast on issues of defending the homeland, we do not delay \nimplementation of the rules.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's passion for \nthis issue. All we are asking for, in a bipartisan way--and I sound \nlike a broken record up here--is to review these regulations, go back \nover an indefinite amount of time to look way back, back, and go look \nat what these rules and regulations that have been put out there.\n  Remember, we are supposed to be implementing it by law. There are \ntimes when regulations and rules--certainly in emergency situations, it \nhas to be dealt with. But they can go back and look at these. It is not \ngoing to slow down our dealing with an emergency.\n  What we are going to do, and I think we are going to find, is that it \nis actually going to clean up the process in the system.\n  It is like--I am trying to think of a good example of this--but they \nkeep throwing things into the garage, and there is so much clutter you \ncan't even get in the garage.\n  And I just think they are living on a different planet if we think \nthat all these regulations are perfect; nothing needs to be cleared \nout; we don't want to take any time; we want just the administration to \ndo it; we don't want the other party to be involved.\n  Republicans are suggesting to do this in a bipartisan way. I think \nthat is reasonable. I think that is what the American people want.\n  But Democrats don't want us to do that. They don't want a bipartisan \ngroup of people looking at rules and regulations in the executive \nbranch. I don't think that is fair. I don't think that is balanced.\n  What we are offering, I think, is an opportunity to do that. They are \nallowed to go through, this commission goes through this process. The \ndepartment and agency can identify a list of things that need to be \ncleaned out of that garage.\n  I think that is a reasonable way to go and why, again, nobody should \nbe excluded. I think it is a healthy part of the process.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Pocan\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-388.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 21, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``, \n     except for a special rule''.\n       Page 29, insert after line 24 the following:\n       (6) Special rule.--The term ``special rule'' means a rule \n     pertaining to consumer safety made by the Commissioner of \n     Food and Drugs, including any rule made under the FDA Food \n     Safety Modernization Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of this amendment to protect food safety \nstandards for consumers.\n  In 2010, Congress updated our food safety protections for the 21st \ncentury by passing the Food Safety and Modernization Act, greatly \nexpanding these consumer protections through the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Today it is critical that we maintain this progress and protect the \nimplementation of this law from the obstructionist policies included in \nthe SCRUB Act. It is especially important that we allow the FDA to \ncarry out this effort unimpeded because our food safety standards are \nfacing attacks from many other directions.\n  A recent decision from the World Trade Organization repealed our \ncountry-of-origin labeling standards on beef and pork, undermining \nconsumers' right to know where their groceries are coming from.\n  Meanwhile, the United States is considering entering the Trans-\nPacific Partnership, a massive multinational trade agreement that may \nallow food into our grocery stores and restaurants that may not even \nmeet basic safety standards. The TPP weakens our ability to inspect \nthese dangerous foods before they end up on our dinner plates.\n  We know that seafood imported from countries like Vietnam and \nMalaysia are often contaminated with dangerous antibiotics and \nfoodborne pathogens. Between 2002 and 2010, 44 percent of catfish and \nrelated species from China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia \ntested positive for antibiotics banned in the United States. Further, \nin 2013, 100 percent of the Vietnamese catfish farms used antibiotics \nnot approved in the United States.\n  Meanwhile, large amounts of shrimp imported to the United States also \ncontain dangerous bacteria. Last year, harmful bacteria were found in \n83 percent of the shrimp from Bangladesh, 74 percent of the shrimp from \nIndia, and 58 percent of the shrimp from Vietnam.\n  For these reasons, the number of dirty seafood shipments from Vietnam \nand Malaysia rejected by the FDA increased 224 percent in the first 2 \nmonths of 2015 alone. We must amend this legislation to preserve the \nFDA's ability to protect our food.\n  It is not too much to ask that families are assured basic food safety \nstandards and protections are met. Please support this amendment, which \nwill allow the FDA to continue doing its job by protecting consumers \nand making sure our food is safe to eat.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. The SCRUB Act is not going to take away the entire FDA. \nOur food, and the people that work at the FDA, the food safety is an \nimportant part of the function that they hold.\n  But I would appreciate anybody to have us understand--we actually, \nthrough the staff, read this report from George Mason University. In \nFebruary of 2014 they wrote a really good report, ``The Consequences of \nRegulatory Accumulation and a Proposed Solution.'' I just want to \nhighlight one of the examples of something that is still on the books. \nThe Food and Drug Administration has been creating rules since its \ninception in 1906.\n  There is still a regulation on the FDA's books that governs the width \nof strings in canned string beans. That is still on the books. You are \nbreaking the law if you go past this regulation.\n  This is the kind of stuff that should be out of there because, you \nknow what, there is some entrepreneur, there is some business that has \nthe liability now hanging over their head. In 1906, somehow, somebody \nthought that was a good rule, but it is not anymore. It is unnecessary. \nIt is burdensome. It is still on the books.\n  Let's have a bipartisan group of people look at this and go find the \nwidth of string beans and get rid of that regulation. What is wrong \nwith that? That\n\n[[Page H85]]\n\nis what the SCRUB Act does. That is what Jason Smith is talking about.\n  There are other examples. It was just, I believe, according to The \nWall Street Journal, the EPA had saccharine, was treated as a dangerous \nchemical. But the FDA said it was safe for people to consume. And it \nwasn't until just last month that the EPA said: All right, it is not a \ndangerous, hazardous chemical. And the FDA prevailed. But there are \nconflicts.\n  Again, a commission looking at this, with professionals, staff, \npeople who are looking at these types of things are going to go find \nthese regulations and try to go weed them out. It will streamline what \nwe are doing. It is good for the economy. It is good for the country. \nIt makes common sense, and we are trying to do so in a bipartisan way.\n  So the FDA, they do good work. But we are talking about a lot of \nother regulations and rules that were put forth that are no longer \nnecessary and need to be eliminated.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, first let me say I am not going to impugn \nanyone's motives why it was introduced. My problems are with the \nimplementation of the law.\n  If you would like to, with my office, sign a letter to repeal the \n1906 string bean width regulation, I am with you. We can do that, and \nthat is a commonsense way to get things done.\n  You mentioned things from the twenties and thirties and forties that \nmight be there. But let's put it another way. You are saying every time \na new regulation is necessary, you have to find an old regulation, \nwhich is overly simplistic, ultimately impractical and, I think, \nultimately dangerous, especially when it comes to issues like food \nsafety and veterans and other areas. So it is the impracticality.\n  You are telling a consumer, if they have old things in their \nrefrigerator that are outdated, when you buy your new milk, you take \nout your old milk, but you don't clean out your refrigerator. That is a \nridiculous notion.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Only in Washington would we come up with a law as ridiculous as \nsaying that you take one for one rather than just cleaning out old \nitems. So I just have a problem with the bill itself. I am not \nimpugning anyone's motives for introducing it. I just think it is a \nsilly way of accomplishing what you want to accomplish.\n  I don't disagree with the gentleman, and I don't think many of us \ndisagree that there are regulations that should be gotten rid of. But \nthere is a way to do it that would make sense, that the public would \nunderstand, and that wouldn't be just the brainchild of the Beltway \ninside Washington which, unfortunately, is what the SCRUB Act is.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, here is the problem.\n  The Federal bureaucracy continues to grow and expand to the point \nwhere we have millions of people who wake up every day. A lot of them \nare regulators. They can't justify their existence unless they regulate \nsomething.\n  There is no incentive to get rid of those regulations. There is every \nincentive to add regulations because that is what they get paid to do. \nWe want to just have a bipartisan group of people who can go and weed \nout all of this unnecessary underbrush, as I keep calling it, to \nstreamline the system.\n  It should be done by every agency. It is going to take time to go \nthrough it. I hope we are saying that we recognize that there is this \nproblem because we can keep coming up with examples and going through \nand saying, ``Hey, we will pass''--do you know how expensive it is to \nintroduce and pass a piece of legislation and try to get it over to the \nSenate?\n  We are trying to create a commission in a bipartisan way to have \npeople dive in and look at these regulations. That is what we are \nasking for. That is why I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment and a \n``yes'' vote on the underlying bill introduced by Mr. Jason Smith.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Murphy of Florida\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Murphy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the \nsubstitute amendment to provide a bipartisan approach to this \nregulatory reform discussion.\n  As a CPA and a small-business owner myself, I have seen firsthand the \nburden that unnecessary regulations can have on businesses, \nparticularly small businesses.\n  My substitute amendment would establish a regulatory improvement \ncommission consisting of experts appointed by the President and \ncongressional leaders of both parties to evaluate and provide \nrecommendations for the modification, consolidation, or repeal of \nregulations that are unnecessarily burdensome.\n  The commission would have an aim toward reducing compliance costs, \nencouraging growth and innovation, and improving competitiveness, all \nwhile protecting public health and safety. After opportunities for \ninput and consultation from experts, industry stakeholders, and the \ngeneral public, the commission would submit a report to Congress \ncontaining proposed legislation to implement its adjusted changes. If \nCongress chooses to act and the President chooses to sign the report, \nagencies would have 180 days to implement.\n  My amendment is based on the Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, \nwhich I was proud to introduce with the gentleman from South Carolina \n(Mr. Mulvaney) along with 14 cosponsors, 7 Democrats and 7 Republicans.\n  Our bipartisan proposal rejects the partisan approach before us today \nin favor of a true, bipartisan compromise that all Members should be \nable to get behind.\n  My constituents sent me to Congress with the expectation that I would \nbe willing to work with anyone with a good idea. It shouldn't matter \nwhat party you have behind your name.\n  Traveling up and down my district, I hear the same thing from all of \nmy constituents, whether they are Republican, Democrat, Tea Party \nalike. They get that there can be a cost to protecting the environment. \nBut in my district on the Treasure Coast and Palm Beaches, they also \nknow that having clean water is probably worth it.\n  They also get that there can be a cost to protecting their workers \nand workplace safety. But many of them have had the same workers for \nmany, many years, if not decades, and they know that the safety of \ntheir employees is also probably worth it.\n  So what frustrates, I think, those constituents the most and those \nbusiness owners the most is the unnecessary red tape and the excessive \ncosts for the hoops that they have to jump through that don't make the \nair any cleaner and don't make the projects any safer. They expect \nWashington to work to fix that problem. That is why I have offered this \namendment today.\n  I know that some on the left are going to say that this goes too far \nand some on the right think it doesn't go far enough. But I also know \nthat, in a divided government, the partisan bill before us will do \nnothing to help relieve the regulatory burden on the small businesses \nin my district and across this country.\n  Riddled with poison pills, the SCRUB Act is a messaging bill, trying \nto send a message about one side allegedly not caring enough about jobs \nand the other side doesn't care enough about clean water or public \nsafety.\n  But that is not the message that the small businesses care about and \nthe small businesses in my district want to hear. They want results. \nThey want solutions to this. Their message shouldn't be that Congress \ndoesn't care.\n  So while I hoped that we would be able to pick up where we left off \non this bill in the last Congress and find some areas where we can come \ntogether to solve problems for the American people, I understand that \nthere are concerns with the amendment, and I do intend to withdraw it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say how \nmuch I appreciate the gentleman from Florida's bipartisan work on this \nissue.\n  I look forward to working with the gentleman on this issue as well as \nother issues of joint concern, like criminal justice reform and the \nrestoration of the Voting Rights Act.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working together and to working with \nour friends on the other side of the aisle, getting back to getting \nthings done for the American people.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nBabin) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moolenaar, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1155) to \nprovide for the establishment of a process for the review of rules and \nsets of rules, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution \nthereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H87-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H87-H88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act came with a lot of \npromises. Remember the President's words in 2009, ``If you like the \nplan you have, you can keep it. If you like the doctor you have, you \ncan keep your doctor, too. The only change you'll see are falling costs \nas our reforms take hold.''\n  This, Mr. Speaker, was false advertising. While some may have gained \ncoverage under the ACA, far too many others were harmed by the law. \nMillions of Americans lost their plans or saw their premiums and out-\nof-pocket costs skyrocket, like the mom in my district who now has to \npay $400 for her daughter's lifesaving peanut allergy medication when \nit used to cost her $10. That is not what was promised.\n\n[[Page H88]]\n\n  We need to empower all patients with more choice while also offering \nsolutions for the uninsured and those with preexisting conditions. And \nthere is a way. For decades, Republicans have proposed patient-\ncentered, market-based answers to our health insurance challenges.\n  Today's historic vote, which is a victory over Harry Reid's 5 years \nof obstruction, gets us a step closer to real reform. I urge the \nPresident to sign today's bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H88-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H88-H94]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FACES OF ADDICTION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise as the co-chair of the \nBipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic to call upon my \ncolleagues to refocus our efforts on bringing an end to the opioid \nepidemic that continues to threaten communities all across New \nHampshire and across this country.\n  The opioid epidemic has grown to historic proportions. Our medical \nproviders are struggling to keep up with the flow of overdoses entering \nour clinics and to secure treatment for those who need it.\n  Our law enforcement, as first responders, have taken on the burden of \nresponding to more and more potentially dangerous situations when a \ncall for help comes in, and these calls are becoming more and more \nfrequent. Statistics now show that more Americans die from drug \noverdoses than do in car crashes in this country.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, the opioid epidemic continues to \ngrow. In 2015 alone, the total number of drug deaths in the Granite \nState exceeded 400, more than one per day, far surpassing the current \nrecord of fatalities set just last year at 324.\n  There is no doubt that these numbers are staggering. But behind each \nand every one of these numbers is a daughter or a son, a mother or a \nfather, a community leader or a neighbor whose life was precious and \nwhose death has inflicted terrible pain on loved ones.\n  For every life lost, there are also many more individuals and \nfamilies whose lives have been forever changed by opioid misuse. We \nmust never forget or overlook what each number represents.\n  As the epidemic has continued to infiltrate communities across New \nHampshire and New England, experts and advocates have risen to \nchallenge opioid abuse in a number of important ways and sometimes from \nunexpected places.\n  My dear friend Kriss and I have known each other for years now, and \nshe has taken it upon herself to be a champion of this issue. Through \nher unique position as a premier cosmetologist in the State and the \nmake-up artist of choice for many of the Presidential candidates that \npass through New Hampshire during primary season, Kriss has forced a \nconversation about the need to end the opioid epidemic onto the \nnational stage.\n  Kriss has emerged as a leader on the issue back home, and she and her \nhusband, Mark, continue to display remarkable courage and strength as \nshe shares the story of her stepdaughter, Amber, who is with me here \ntoday in this Chamber, who lost her life to a heroin overdose.\n  Kriss' hope is that her experience might help and enact real change. \nSo with Kriss' and Mark's blessing tonight, it is my honor to share \nAmber's story with you.\n  As Kriss puts it, Amber was the girl who helped everyone else. But, \ntragically, she could not help herself once she took that first drug at \nthe young age of 15.\n  As Amber's stepmother, Kriss came into her life when she turned 17. \nAt that point, Amber had already passed through the gateway drugs of \nover-the-counter Benadryl, marijuana, alcohol, and prescription opiates \nthat were available on the streets.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  She suffered from untreated bipolar disorder, but she did not have \naccess to the appropriate medication and, like so many others, was left \nuncomfortable in her own skin, self-prescribing medication to find \nrelief.\n  In Kriss' words, Amber was a girl hard to catch. She chose ``life on \nthe run.''\n  When she found herself living on the streets, she would help others \nby giving them the coat off her back, panhandling to buy food, or \nhelping others as they detoxed from heroin while homeless.\n  By age 20, she took her first hit of heroin and became spellbound by \nit. It made choices for her. She had the opportunity to have a loving \nhome, an education, and parents that could support her recovery, but \nher addiction led her to a life of homelessness on the streets of \nManchester, New Hampshire.\n  After four incarcerations in the last 2 years of her life for heroin \npossession and prostitution, she was a victim of trafficking on the \nstreets of Manchester to maintain her high.\n  When incarcerated and craving treatment, a bed finally became \navailable for Amber at a wonderful treatment center in New Hampshire, \nbut, meanwhile, the prison would not let her out. The prison itself \noffered no recovery. When she was released, the bed was no longer \navailable. Amber even had to lie to the emergency room to get help by \nsaying, ``I want to kill myself.''\n  She detoxed in that hospital, but no recovery aftercare was \navailable. Kriss and her husband, Mark, brought Amber home, and on the \nthird night, she fled home leaving them a note that said, ``I have to \ngo back to my people.''\n  The last time that Kriss and Mark saw her was Easter Sunday. She was \nhigh, vacant, and the drug had consumed her soul. Three days later she \nwas found in an alley dead of a heroin overdose. She was 22 years old.\n  Her death would be easy to blame on institutional failure to ensure \nthat those in need can access resources or on a general lack of empathy \nfor individuals crippled by addiction. Kriss and Mark have made a \nconscious effort to use Amber's life, her death, and her ongoing \nvibrant spirit to wake up the hearts and minds of those who have the \npower to change fate.\n  Tonight, I share Amber's heart-wrenching story in the hopes that we \ncan all recognize opioid abuse is not a disease singular to a certain \nsocioeconomic group or race or region. It can take hold of anyone.\n  Amber's parents have been incredibly brave to share her story and to \ncome to Washington to push for reform. We need to erase the stigma from \nsubstance abuse disorder, and we need to be far more honest and \nproductive considering the effect on daughters or sons, mothers or \nfathers.\n  That is why tonight we called our colleagues together for this \nSpecial Order so that we can speak from both sides of the aisle and \nshare the lives of friends and loved ones. It is my intention that by \nhonoring those we have lost and by acknowledging the complexities of \nopioid abuse and the human lives that are behind these fatalities, we \ncan come together to convey the urgency behind bringing an end to the \nopioid epidemic.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join bipartisan Members, Republicans and \nDemocrats from around the country, to talk about heroin use, an \nincreasingly deadly public health crisis. I welcome Kriss and Mark from \nNew Hampshire, who are here today to honor the life of Mark's daughter.\n  A special thank-you to Congresswoman Ann Kuster, my fellow Granite \nStater and partner on our Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic. We formed this task force last year to bring attention to \nopiate addiction and overdose spreading nationwide. Now over 40 House \nMembers have joined our task force and this cause.\n  We aim to inform not just members of the public, but the Nation about \nthe tragedies and the challenges that face our families, our \ncommunities, our States, our loved ones, and our friends. We are here \nnot just to combat this epidemic, but bring solutions not just to this \nbody, but to every area of the Nation.\n  Congresswoman Kuster and I have held a roundtable with addiction and \nlaw enforcement experts in Concord, New Hampshire, our home State. We\n\n[[Page H89]]\n\nheld a subsequent policy briefing in Washington, D.C., featuring \nofficials from the Drug Enforcement Agency, Centers for Disease \nControl, and other Federal agencies.\n  They are providing a fuller picture of the scope of the problem, \nwhich in New Hampshire has claimed 400 lives in 2015. To put that \nfigure in perspective, 1 out of every 3,000 people have died of a \nheroin overdose just last year. The CDC reports that, nationally, \noverdose deaths have tripled over the last 10 years. These numbers, \nunfortunately, are likely to rise.\n  But numbers don't tell the whole story. To truly illustrate the \ndangers of heroin use, we need to hear from fathers like Doug Griffin \nof Newton in New Hampshire's First Congressional District. At a forum \nyesterday in Manchester, New Hampshire, where I proudly served as \nmayor, he told the audience about his daughter Courtney, who fell \nvictim to heroin at just 20 years young.\n  Doug remembers his daughter as an exuberant young girl who had a \ngreat sense of humor and a passion for life until a mix of prescription \npills, fentanyl, and street heroin ensnared Courtney--like millions of \nother Americans--in a fatal web of addiction. Before the drugs overcame \nher, she played music and she loved s'mores.\n  She wanted to be a marine and trained for it. But just 3 years later, \nCourtney was lost on the streets, in and out of rehab facilities. She \nno longer had the will to live. Because Courtney's situation was so \ndire, because it seemed like they had so few options, Doug said he and \nhis family hid the truth from the outside world. Bravely, Doug is now \ntelling everyone he knows about the warning signs of heroin addiction \nand deficiencies in our public response.\n  Tonight is about telling the truth in order to build momentum towards \nbetter solutions. It is about putting political disagreements aside, \nbecause the heroin epidemic crosses party lines. It crosses every \ncongressional district in the United States.\n  The truth is addiction strikes every demographic and every geographic \nregion. There are too many stories like Courtney's. However, we also \nhave a wealth of ideas to combat this problem. Congresswoman Kuster and \nI formed the Bipartisan Task Force to gather those stories and ideas \nand assemble them into effective legislation.\n  We introduced the STOP ABUSE Act as the first order of business to \ncoordinate law enforcement and public health agencies at the Federal, \nState, and local levels. The bill targets high-intensity drug \ntrafficking areas for special attention. Newton, New Hampshire, where \nDoug Griffin's daughter died of an overdose, lies on such a route just \nnorth of the Massachusetts border.\n  The STOP ABUSE Act creates a stronger prescription pill monitoring \nprogram. In fact, it was overprescribed legal opiates that hooked \nCourtney in the first place. Personally, I have introduced legislation \nto increase access to lifesaving overdose medication.\n  The STOP ABUSE Act includes treatment and prevention grants to \nlocalities overwhelmed by the scale of addiction, as my colleagues \ngathered here tonight will continue to tell you. They have their own \nstories and their own ideas to share. I am grateful for their \npartnership and leadership as we work together to combat heroin abuse \nin the United States.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Thank you, Mr. Guinta.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Neal).\n  (Mr. NEAL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. NEAL. First, Mr. Speaker, I want to call attention to the efforts \nthat have been made by Congresswoman Kuster and Congressman Guinta. \nWhen Congresswoman Kuster approached me on this issue, I was all too \nhappy to join in. I think that the perseverance that she has offered in \nthe early days on this is, I think, a challenge for all of us across \nNew England, because what has happened across New England now is \ngripping in terms of the attention that this issue has drawn.\n  But I want to call attention specifically to a very important case in \nwhich there is an individual whom I had a chance to witness his \ntestimony. At the same time, I intend to quote liberally from the \nSpringfield Republican, which is the paper of record for western \nMassachusetts.\n  I want to call attention tonight to a former Ludlow, Massachusetts, \npolice lieutenant, Thomas Foye. Lieutenant Foye had a strong upbringing \nwith supportive parents, a college education, a good marriage, three \nchildren, and a long career as a lieutenant in the Ludlow Police \nDepartment.\n  The 50-year-old was a longtime head of the detective bureau and even \nserved on an FBI task force. He arrested many drug addicts and \nresponded frequently to overdoses. He was at the scene of many drug-\nrelated suicides. He warned schoolchildren about the dangers of drugs. \nHe was even an official who had been elected to the Ludlow School \nCommittee.\n  That was, however, until he got addicted to OxyContin pills following \nshoulder surgery. Two surgeries and more pain medication prescriptions \nlater, Lieutenant Foye found himself admitting that he was addicted.\n  After trying to quit on his own multiple times and suffering \nsickening withdrawals, he turned to his doctor for help. The same \ndoctor who had originally prescribed him OxyContin now prescribed him \nmore pills to both wean him off the painkillers and to put an end to \nhis sickness.\n  When none of that worked, Foye admits that he broke the law and began \nto acquire pills illegally, taking them straight from his police \ndepartment's own evidence room. When he was arrested in his office at \nthe Ludlow Police Department in 2013, he was charged with tampering \nwith substances, two counts of possession of a class B substance--\ncocaine and OxyContin--and two counts of larceny of a drug. \nSubsequently, he was sentenced to 2 years in jail.\n  He said that it was not fear, dread, or panic that he felt when the \ninvestigation finally came to a head; rather, he felt relief. He now \nwould be able to get help.\n  He talks about the police officer who stayed with him in the detox \nfacility following his arrest. ``Some day I want to be that guy,'' he \nsaid. ``There needs to be some dignity in drug addiction treatment.''\n  Lieutenant Foye was lucky in the sense that he survived his addiction \nand is telling his story to help others. Those who have not survived, \nincluding eight people this weekend in my congressional district in a \nvery small geographic area, died from a lethal string of heroin that \nwas identified as the Hollywood brand.\n  The Opioid Overdose Reduction Act of 2015 would exempt from civil \nliability emergency administration of opioid overdose-reversing drugs, \nlike naloxone, by people who prescribe or are prescribed them. Senator \nMarkey has offered the same legislation down the hallway in the United \nStates Senate.\n  When an opioid overdose occurs, administration of an opioid-reversal \ndrug is necessary to prevent death, but it must occur within a certain \nwindow of time before the chance of survival is lost. This is a time of \nquick action, not deliberations or a potential lawsuit.\n  Every day, 120 people die as a result of drug overdoses fueled by \nprescription painkillers, and another 6,748 are treated in emergency \nrooms for the misuse or abuse of illegal drugs. According to The \nWashington Post, ``overdosing is now the leading cause of accidental \ndeath in the United States, accounting for more deaths than traffic \nfatalities or gun homicides and suicides. Fatal overdoses from opiate \nmedications such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone have \nquadrupled since 1999, accounting for an estimated 16,651 deaths in \n2010.''\n  It is time to bring a face to those affected by addiction and stop \nthe epidemic in communities across this country.\n  I want to close as I started with a note of congratulations to Ms. \nKuster and to Mr. Guinta for calling attention to what is really \nhappening across New England now. We need to be mindful of the lives \nthat are being destroyed and the families that are succumbing to this \ntorture over long, long periods of time trying to treat those who are \naddicted and to make sure they get adequate help.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Rothfus).\n\n[[Page H90]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire \n(Mr. Guinta) and the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) for \norganizing this Special Order this evening, and also for the \nparticipation with the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic; and to also recognize the individuals from New Hampshire, \nKriss and Mark, who came down, and for the bravery in sharing the story \nof Amber and how it is important for all of us to be reflecting on this \nvery serious crisis that we have.\n  Many of our communities have been hit hard by the opioid abuse \nepidemic. Like other regions of the country, this brutal epidemic is \naffecting western Pennsylvania, destroying lives, breaking up families, \nand claiming far too many of our loved ones.\n  Vonda Probst from Friedens, Pennsylvania, knows firsthand the \ndevastating reality of losing a loved one to drugs. Nearly 2 years have \npassed since Ms. Probst lost her son, Jared Carter, to a heroin \noverdose. Jared enjoyed motorcycle riding, four-wheeling, fixing old \ncars, and just being outdoors. He would have turned 30 this last \nsummer.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  There are far too many stories like Jared's in Pennsylvania and \nthroughout our Nation, lives full of potential and value that are cut \nshort by drug abuse.\n  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, last year alone \nthere were well over 10,000 heroin overdose deaths. This number \nreflects a six-fold increase in the number of heroin deaths since 2001.\n  In my State of Pennsylvania alone, drug overdose deaths have \nincreased by 470 percent over the past two decades, and heroin and \nopioids are increasingly to blame. These drugs have been responsible \nfor the loss of nearly 3,000 lives in our State in just the last 5 \nyears.\n  Parts of the 12th District have been especially hard hit as heroin \nuse is the leading cause of accidental deaths. In fact, in 2012, there \nwere a record 261 drug overdose deaths in Allegheny County, which is \nmore than Allegheny County's traffic fatalities and homicides put \ntogether and is 30 percent higher than the State average. In Cambria \nCounty, the drug overdose death rate is nearly double the State \naverage.\n  These statistics are horrifying, but behind the numbers are people \nand tragedy. Every heroin-related death cuts short a valuable human \nlife that should have ended with a much brighter and a much later \nchapter. Every American who dies from a drug overdose is a person who \nhad dignity and potential. Without adequate assistance, however, each \none did not have hope.\n  It is time to turn a new page in order to proactively defeat this \ndeadly epidemic with renewed dedication. As a member of the Bipartisan \nTask Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic, I am strongly committed to \nending this scourge.\n  We need to find new ways to combat this crisis and to continue \nlearning from our community-based organizations on how they are \nproviding help on the front lines. I have worked with local leaders in \nmy district, such as Reverend Sylvia King, the pastor and founder of \nJohnstown's Christ Centered Community Church, which provides drug \nrecovery services and counseling. I have also worked with local law \nenforcement and other treatment groups to make sure the necessary \nresources are available to help those in need.\n  Here in Congress we also need to be looking at legislative responses \nto help address this issue. In the past, I have supported increased \nfunding for the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which \nprovides resources and support for heroin victims through prevention \nand education programs as well as drug treatment and enforcement.\n  I am also a cosponsor of legislation that has been introduced by \nRepresentatives Susan Brooks and Joe Kennedy--the Heroin and \nPrescription Opioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act--\nto reauthorize the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs that are so \ncritical to local law enforcement efforts, to increase access to the \nlife-saving opioid reversal drug Naloxone, and to raise public provider \nand patient awareness of opioid drugs and their link to heroin.\n  We must remember heroin's victims, such as Jared Carter and so many \nother like him, who have lost their lives. Let's galvanize the support \nnecessary to stop these tragedies. We must be mindful in that people, \nas they watch this discussion this evening, may know somebody who is \nhurting right now, somebody in need. It may be somebody, himself, who \nis watching.\n  Get help. Reach out. Don't do this alone.\n  I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire, and I thank the gentlewoman \nfrom New Hampshire for organizing this Special Order. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work back home and here in D.C. to address this crisis.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for sharing that \nheartfelt story as well as the challenges that your community is \nfacing.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois \n(Mrs. Bustos).\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. I thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for yielding \ntime on this critically important issue.\n  I also thank the gentlewoman and Congressman Guinta for pulling this \nSpecial Order together and for their hard work on the Bipartisan Task \nForce to address this heroin epidemic.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the heroin epidemic sweeps the Nation, too many \nfamilies and communities are mourning the deaths of loved ones who have \nbeen lost over the years due to heroin addiction and addiction to \npainkillers. One of the lives we lost not too long ago was in a town \ncalled Rockford, Illinois, which is in the heart of my congressional \ndistrict.\n  The gentleman's name was Chris Boseman. He was 32 years old when he \ndied in the summer of 2014. He was a kind, tender-hearted son and \nbrother. He had a back injury that led to his addiction to pain \nmedication.\n  When he could no longer get relief from that pain medication, he \nbegan to buy different kinds of pain relief on the street. As the costs \nwould add up, his dealer told him about something called heroin and \nthat he could get this for $10.\n  After his first overdose, Chris tried hard to fight his addiction. He \nhad a couple of relapses, but it appeared that he had been successful \nin overcoming this addiction.\n  He enrolled at Rock Valley College, a community college, where he \nstudied construction management. He was 1 year away from graduating. No \none knew that he was still fighting this battle because he was ashamed \nof it. One night he was home alone--he was just over 1 year clean--when \nhe relapsed again and died.\n  The sad thing is that Chris' story is all too common. In fact, I lost \na member of my own family to the heroin epidemic when my brother-in-\nlaw's son died after overdosing on heroin in the summer of 2013.\n  He was not the kind of kid one would think would be taking something \nlike heroin. His dad had no idea. His family had no idea. He was a \ncollege football player. He was a musician. He was an avid weight \nlifter and was just a red-headed kid who was fun to be around.\n  Yet, when he injured his back and his knee and felt that he needed \nmore than just aspirin and a little physical therapy to overcome this \npain, he got on painkillers. As we are telling these stories this \nevening, this eventually led to his trying heroin as a way to relieve \nhis pain. It was probably, they thought, the third time that he took \nheroin. He ingested what would be considered pure heroin, and he died.\n  I am here to say that we can no longer sit on the sidelines while \nfolks in our communities and our family members are suffering and are \ndying, when parents are burying their children, and when the men and \nwomen who are struggling with this addiction are crying out for help.\n  We also know that heroin use is increasing among young people, \nespecially in my home State of Illinois, with a nearly 50 percent \nincrease in the use of heroin just in the last several years.\n  In Winnebago County, which is where Rockford is, which I was talking \nabout earlier, there were 51 heroin-related deaths in 2013 alone. In \nPeoria, which is also in the heart of my congressional\n\n[[Page H91]]\n\ndistrict, emergency responders see at least one heroin overdose every \nsingle day.\n  Perhaps the most troubling is not just this rapid increase in the \nusage or in the rising number of overdoses, but in our inability to \ntreat those who need it the most. While heroin use is increasing \nrapidly in every region of my home State, there has been a dramatic \ndecrease in the availability of treatment. In fact, Illinois ranked \nworst--last in the Nation--in the overall decline in treatment \ncapacity.\n\n  While we are at the height of this heroin epidemic, last year our \nGovernor proposed a budget that would cut our already inadequate State-\nfunded treatment programs by 60 percent.\n  To make matters worse, the ongoing budget crisis in Illinois has \ngutted the funding for treatment programs like one in my district of \nRockford. It is called Remedies Renewing Lives. That is why next week, \nwhen the President gives his State of the Union, my guest will be a guy \nnamed Gary Halbach, who is the president of Remedies.\n  It is so he can witness the State of the Union and so he can talk \nabout the important work that he and his colleagues at Remedies are \ndoing every single day. Under the pressure of tremendous budgetary \nshortfalls, Gary and his team have been on the front lines in providing \ntreatment to heroin addicts and support for victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  We will not end the heroin epidemic if the programs that have been \nproven to help continue to be undermined and significantly underfunded. \nWe cannot turn a blind eye to the families and to the communities that \nhave been affected by the heroin epidemic. They deserve better. They \ndeserve solutions.\n  Ms. KUSTER. For the record, this concept of bringing the faces of \naddiction to the floor of the House was the idea of the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois. I thank her for that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \ntonight. As I stepped to the podium, I noticed two of the values that \nAmerica has etched into or has carved into the Speaker's rostrum, \n``liberty'' and then, to my left, ``peace.''\n  They are two values that we hold dear; yet, they are two values that \nare lost to people when they come under the cruel, cruel domination of \nheroin and other opiates. So it is good for us to talk about this \ntonight but, more importantly, for us to do something about it.\n  I thank Congressman Guinta, Congresswoman Kuster, and my colleagues \nwho are participating in this Special Order, which highlights the \nongoing epidemic of heroin and prescription drug abuse.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to \nCombat the Heroin Epidemic in order to discuss a growing public health \ncrisis in the United States and, more personally, to discuss a crisis \noccurring in my home district, the Michigan Seventh.\n  You see, we can talk statistics over and over again, but, really, \nthis is all about lives: friends, family, neighbors, people who are \nhighly respected, and people whom we wouldn't know. Yet, they are \nimpacted. The tragic stories of prescription drug abuse and fatal \noverdoses hit close to home in far too many Michigan communities.\n  Through September of this year, Washtenaw County, the home of the \nUniversity of Michigan, suffered 41 opioid overdose deaths.\n  Local law enforcement officials in Monroe County--the gateway to \nMichigan from Ohio--believe the number of heroin overdose deaths in \n2015 will top those in 2014.\n  In Jackson County, which is in the center of the State, the total \nnumber of drug overdoses has nearly tripled in the last 5 years. In \n2015, 131 overdoses were reported.\n  These are troubling statistics, but, again, they are about lives, \npeople. Behind these numbers are real individuals and families who have \nbeen affected by this tragic epidemic.\n  On May 17, 2010, Andrew Hirst died of a heroin overdose at the age of \n24. For his father, Mike Hirst, a respected businessperson in Jackson, \nMichigan, this tragic loss has led him to dedicate himself to stopping \nheroin overdoses in the Jackson area by sharing the experience of his \nson's death and the life of his family.\n  For the past 5 years, Mike has counseled addicts, supported families, \nand mentored at-risk youths away from heroin and opiate drugs through \nhis foundation, Andy's Angels. In addition, he has led educational \nefforts to inform people of the link between prescription opioid use \nand heroin addiction.\n  He has also teamed up with local police agencies to investigate \nheroin dealers in order to eliminate access points for this deadly \ndrug. In recognizing his tireless efforts, the Jackson Citizen Patriot \nnewspaper recently named Mike Hirst their Citizen of the Year.\n  Fortunately, Mike is not alone in this fight. Across Michigan's \nSeventh District, communities are ramping up education and prevention \nefforts as well as enforcement strategies. For example, Monroe County \nrecently held its third annual Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin \nSummit.\n  Jackson County held its second drug summit in December, and the \nCounty Prosecutor's Office plans to host a series of additional \nmeetings in 2016. I applaud them for that.\n  Local efforts to raise awareness and to fight this growing epidemic \nare also underway in Branch, Eaton, Hillsdale, Lenawee, and Washtenaw \nCounties. Fighting against heroin and opioid abuse will take the work \nof citizens, treatment providers, law enforcement, and elected \nofficials at every level, including each of us.\n  In Congress, we must continue to pursue legislative solutions to \nimprove the coordination between Federal agencies and the States and to \nequip our first responders on the front lines.\n  Just as importantly, Mr. Speaker, we can promote awareness in our \ncommunities and support those who have been affected by this crisis.\n  Tonight's speeches aim to raise the profile of this issue, to \nincrease education, and to honor people like Mike Hirst who are \nfighting to save others from the dangers of drug overdoses and to bring \nliberty and peace back to people's lives.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for outlining, \nthrough the lens of liberty and peace, the challenge that Andrew Hirst \nand his father, Mike, have endured. My heart is with them and with your \nconstituents.\n  I also want to thank you for your hard work on the Bipartisan Task \nForce. I look forward to your continuing leadership in Michigan and \nhere in Washington, D.C.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the remaining time?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New Hampshire has 13 \nminutes remaining.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nTonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire, our colleagues who have made available this Special \nOrder this evening through the auspices of the Bipartisan Task Force to \nCombat the Heroin Epidemic.\n  As co-chair of a similar panel, the bipartisan caucus that addresses \nthe disease of addiction, it is important, I believe, to share \ninformation and encourage response out there from the general public to \ndrive the policy process here in Washington.\n  According to SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the use \nof heroin has almost tripled in the past 8 years, going from 161,000 in \n2007 to some 435,000 in 2014. Much of what is fueling this epidemic has \nbeen the proliferation of stronger and stronger prescription drug \npainkillers. Many individuals first get addicted to these prescription \ndrugs and then turn to heroin as a cheaper alternative.\n  One in 15 people who take prescription pain relievers for a \nnonmedical use will try heroin within 10 years. These statistics are \nsobering and require a degree of response, an ultimate response, with \ngreat emergency.\n  I have seen these issues firsthand in my district, and all of my \ncolleagues are acknowledging here that it is beyond the Northeast. It \nis penetrating our Nation.\n  While there has been increased congressional interest in these \ncrises, not enough is being done to effectively end the epidemic. \nFirst, we need to increase funding for the Substance Abuse\n\n[[Page H92]]\n\nPrevention and Treatment Block Grant. This funding stream represents \nthe cornerstone of our States' response, their substance abuse \nprevention, their treatment and recovery systems.\n  Unfortunately, funding has not kept up with inflation over the past \ndecade and adjusted for inflation, so we are actually funding the block \ngrant program at a level that is some 25 percent less than we were in \n2006. Contrasted to the stats that I shared on the growth of this \nepidemic, it is simple. It is immoral that we are not doing more.\n  In addition, we need to make certain that we are increasing access to \neffective, evidence-based treatments. One way we could do this is to \nraise the DATA 2000 caps that limit the number of patients that a \ndoctor can treat with buprenorphine, which is a medication-assisted \ntreatment for opioid abuse.\n  There are many doctors who have months-long, if not years-long, \nwaiting lists of patients seeking help with their addictions, yet they \ncannot get in the door for treatment due to this arbitrary cap.\n  I was proud to join with my colleague from upstate New York, \nRepresentative Higgins, in introducing the TREAT Act to address the \nissue of prescriber caps, and I hope to continue to work with \ninterested Members on both sides of the aisle to address the issue of \naccess to treatment.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for bringing attention to this critical \nepidemic here this evening. Let's get the people's business done.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nKildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her work on \nthis.\n  Tonight, I want to share the story of a young man from my district, \nJames Brendan Bye. His mother, Barbara, a good friend of mine, shared \nher story with me and asked that I share it tonight with this Congress \nand with the country.\n  Brendan was born on August 3, 1989, followed by his sister, Megan \nElizabeth. Their father left early on, leaving Barbara as a single \nworking parent. Another sibling, Preston, blessed them in 1999.\n  Brendan was a wonderful kid, a respectful young man, an honor \nstudent. His love of playing sports was never realized because of \nasthma.\n  In his senior year of high school, things changed. He became \nparalyzed with fear, couldn't go to school, dropped out, and spent a \nyear looking for help. He met friends that turned out to be bad \ninfluences, made experimental choices. His mother was aware of this \nsudden change and saw the signs of anxiety and depression.\n  Brendan, though, got his GED, started a job at 18, grateful for work \nin a city with high unemployment.\n  He struggled through his early twenties. His mother did everything in \nher power to help him. As a single mom, she worked and raised a family \nof three on one paycheck, often finding herself needing to look for \nhelp, including Medicaid.\n  For Brendan, because his symptoms of mental illness were not so \neasily recognizable, help was harder to get. He was not properly \ndiagnosed or treated. His treatment plan did not work. It was not \nsuccessful. As he sunk further into depression, prescription drugs led \nto illegal drug use. He self-medicated.\n  His mother, Barbara, did not share her home life with others. For \nher, it was an element of confusion and shame which became the norm. \nUnfortunately, in their community of Grand Blanc, heroin was readily \navailable. Like many other communities, lots of kids from all \nbackgrounds were using and dying from heroin.\n  Brendan first overdosed when he was 24. He was saved by his \ngrandfather, Al, who helped him get into rehab. He was able to get \nongoing treatment at Sacred Heart in Flint, where he had a great \ncounselor who helped him. Things were looking up.\n  Last year, Barbara was happy. All three of her kids were employed for \nthe first time. Their future looked bright. Heroin, it seemed, was out \nof Brendan's life.\n  He started taking medication prescribed by a doctor to reverse the \neffects of heroin, volunteered at a food bank, loved nature, loved his \npets, loved his brother and sister. His relationships flourished, \nespecially with his Aunt Amy, Aunt Carla, and his cousins. As Barbara \ntold me, ``he was a beautiful person inside and out.''\n  At the end of August this last year, things changed again. He was \ntaken off prescription medication, and a short time later his mother \nand sister found him collapsed in his bedroom. Brendan, at the age of \n26, on September 8 of last year, died.\n  For Brendan, he is now in heaven. His struggles with mental illness \nand addiction are gone. For his family and friends, they continue to \ngrieve.\n  Barbara has become an advocate. She wants to make sure we honor \nBrendan and his life by making sure that those who need health care can \nget health care, those who need mental health services can get mental \nhealth services. Her message, and really Brendan's message, is that we \nhave to do more as a society and as a nation to deal with this \nincredible problem. It is the way we honor those that we have lost. It \nis the way we honor Brendan.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent if I could have an \nextra 5 minutes. I have three more speakers on our side of the aisle \nand one more Member would like to include Mr. Davis as a speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bishop of Michigan). The Chair cannot \nentertain that request for additional time.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentlewoman from New Hampshire \nyield for that purpose?\n  Ms. KUSTER. Yes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I believe the Chair can entertain \nrequests for unanimous consent at any time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot entertain a unanimous \nconsent request to extend a Special Order speech.\n  Ms. KUSTER. So as not to lose any of our precious time, I yield to \nthe gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. This \nis a very important issue that is affecting central Illinois that I am \nblessed enough to represent right here in this great institution.\n  As a Member of Congress, I have witnessed firsthand what heroin and \nopioids can do to communities like my hometown of Taylorville, \nIllinois. In my hometown of 12,000 people, I never would have thought, \ngrowing up in the 1980s, that a drug like heroin would cause such a \nscourge.\n  As a matter of fact, it is interesting to hear many of my colleagues \ntalk about what is happening in their communities. Not too long ago, in \nthat hometown of 12,000 people, our local newspaper had a coroner's \njury report that I believe I remember mentioned four deaths in one \ncoroner's jury report related to heroin and opioid overdoses. This is \nsomething in my community I never thought I would witness, and it is \nalso something in my community that demands action.\n  I am so proud to sponsor the STOP ABUSE Act with my colleagues here \ntonight. What they are talking about and what everybody who has stood \nin front of this sign tonight has talked about is the importance of \naddressing opioid abuse. This bill is something that, because of small \ntowns like my hometown, we are here to address. It has become a Federal \nissue.\n  I want to end by talking about a friend of mine, a gentleman that I \ngrew up with, his family. He actually used to run our county health \ndepartment at the time he was arrested for heroin use. Who would have \nthought that in a town of 12,000 people the director of the county \nhealth department would be addicted to heroin?\n  It doesn't matter what your socioeconomic status is, it doesn't \nmatter what your job is, and it doesn't matter where you were born or \nwho you were born to; you, too, can become addicted to heroin. That is \nwhy we have demanded action tonight. That is why I am thankful to be \nhere. That is why I am thankful to be able to help each and every one \nof my colleagues in a bipartisan way to address this problem. Mr. \nSpeaker, we are going to do something about this issue.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. \nKaptur).\n\n[[Page H93]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kuster for her \nleadership in bringing us together this evening. Congressman Guinta has \nreally done the Nation a huge service.\n  I rise tonight to speak for the mothers and fathers, brothers and \nsisters, children and friends who have buried a loved one because of \nheroin. Nationwide, there has been a fourfold increase in death from \nopiates over the last decade, and every year nearly 17,000 people die \nfrom prescription opiate overdoses. Over 8,000 die from heroin \noverdoses, and more than 400,000 seek treatment in emergency rooms. In \nOhio alone, heroin kills an average of 23 people every week, more than \n1,100 persons per year.\n  Heroin and opiate abuse is not a criminal justice issue alone. This \nNation must recognize this addiction as the overwhelming, powerful, \nchemical dependance condition it is. Concurrently, too, it is often a \nmental health and medical crisis as well.\n  They tell us the annual financial cost for our society now is over \n$33 billion a year, and that is based on 1996 figures. The gravest cost \nis in lives lost and grief felt by those loved ones whom the overdose \nvictims leave behind.\n  I think of the family of my own district staffer, Theresa Morris, who \nlost her beloved cousin, Angelique ``Angel'' Kidd, this past July to \nheroin. Angel grew up in a working class family, got married young, had \ntwo children, and went to work in food service. One night on her way \nhome, she was in a terrible car accident and was given opioid pain \nmedicine to help her with her discomfort.\n  As she regained strength, she found it difficult to live with chronic \npain and turned to other prescription medication and eventually to \nillegal substances in order to cope. She and her husband eventually \ndivorced, and she became somewhat depressed.\n  As her addiction grew, the price of her prescriptions rose. She \nturned to the cheaper substitute: heroin. She eventually lost her job \ndue to poor performance and began withdrawing and even stealing from \nher family and got into trouble. It was a horrible descent.\n  She died on Friday, July 24, 2015, this past year of combined drug \ntoxicity. She was 41 years old. She was a mother, a daughter, a sister, \na niece, a cousin, and a grandmother. There was no obituary in the \npaper, no public visitation, just a quiet service attended by those who \nloved her. The sorrow in her family simply can't be repeated.\n  I know that the time has expired, but we must simply treat the \nchemical dependence that these terrible opioids cause in the American \npeople, and we must call to task pharmaceutical companies like Purdue \nPharma, Cephalon, Janssen, Endo International, and Actavis, because \nwith over $11 billion of profits from these opioid pills alone, they \ncan surely afford to help the American people.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues \nCongresswoman Ann Kuster and Congressman Frank Guinta for leading this \nimportant Special Order Hour on opioid and heroin abuse and dependence.\n  Today's theme, ``Faces of Addiction,'' gives us a unique opportunity \nto the powerful addicting qualities of heroin and opioids, which have \nserious implications for every family impacted by its abuse.\n  Some of you may have seen the 60 Minutes segment, ``Heroin in the \nHeartland,'' which filmed in parts of my district.\n  Let me share the story of Robbie, whose struggle stands out to me.\n  Robbie was prescribed opioids--Oxycodone and Oxycontin, among \nothers--for a chronic pain condition.\n  Although he said he never intended to abuse these medications, Robbie \nbecame an addict, taking painkillers for 25 years as his doctors kept \nprescribing higher and higher doses to manage his pain.\n  Robbie eventually stopped caring about anything except opioids and \nfinding his next dose of medication.\n  His marriage fell apart.\n  He became estranged from friends.\n  He gained 90 pounds and developed diabetes, heart disease, and \narthritis.\n  He lost his will to live and contemplated suicide.\n  Ultimately, it was a pharmacist who put a stop to Robbie's opioid use \nby refusing to fill his prescription.\n  This abrupt end to the drugs led Robbie to connect to a new doctor, \nan addiction specialist.\n  Robbie is not alone in his struggle with opioid dependence and abuse.\n  According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, over 100 \nAmericans died from drug overdose deaths each day in 2013.\n  46 Americans die each day from prescription opioid overdoses, which \nis two deaths per hour or 17,000 deaths annually.\n  In Ohio, according to the Ohio Department of Health, from 2000 to \n2012, Ohio's death rate due to unintentional drug poisonings increased \n366 percent, and this increase in deaths has been driven largely by \nprescription drug overdoses.\n  On average, approximately five people die each day in Ohio due to \ndrug overdose.\n  As these statistics illustrate, much work remains to be done toward \nresolving the problems of opioid abuse nationally as well as in my home \nstate.\n  We need an honest effort to integrate prevention, treatment, and \nenforcement.\n  Ohio is adding a weapon to its arsenal in fighting drug abuse by \nproviding doctors and pharmacists with a one-click link to the state \nopiate tracking system.\n  Ohio will become the first state to integrate its database, the Ohio \nAutomated Rx Reporting System (OARRS), with electronic medical records \nalready maintained by doctors and pharmacists.\n  This database linkup is one of the latest tools utilized by state \nofficials to combat the epidemic of overdose deaths.\n  The opioid epidemic has been particularly devastating to our fight to \nend infant mortality in central Ohio.\n  When a pregnant mother abuses drugs, her unborn baby isn't just an \ninnocent bystander. The drugs can affect that child to the degree that \nthe baby will likely suffer withdraw after birth.\n  As of 2013, about 12 in every 1,000 babies born in Franklin County \nfaced that uphill battle.\n  Those numbers grow year after year and experts say heroin is fueling \nthe increase.\n  That is why at the federal level, I co-sponsored and voted in favor \nof the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015, which was signed into law \nNovember 25, 2015.\n  This new law will help prevent and treat babies exposed to opioids in \nutero.\n  It will also support efforts to collect and disseminate strategies \nand best practices to prevent and treat maternal opioid use and abuse.\n  Finding solutions to this epidemic will require all of us to work \ntogether at the Federal, State, and local levels.\n  Drug abuse certainly isn't a partisan issue and many Members of \nCongress are actively engaged on the matter.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to address \nthis epidemic.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to \nCombat the Heroin Epidemic, I would like to thank our co-chairs for \narranging this special order to discuss the faces of heroin and opiate \naddiction.\n  The faces of heroin and opiate addiction are getting younger. In my \nhome State of Ohio and across the country, we have seen a dramatic \nincrease in the number of infants born with opiates in their system and \nneeding for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, or NAS. Tragically, these \nchildren are born addicted to drugs and have no voice or awareness as \nto why they are suffering.\n  The symptoms of withdrawal begin almost immediately. They may suffer \nfrom low birth weight, difficulty feeding or breathing, seizures, \ndehydration, tremors, and excessive or continuous high-pitched crying. \nHospital personnel may spend ten hours in a single day to holding and \nrocking these newborns in an effort to console them, but over 80 \npercent of children with NAS still require medication to treat their \nwithdrawal.\n  The toll that the heroin epidemic takes on these children can go \nbeyond the terrible physical symptoms and complications, and the \neffects can be lasting ones. The faces of heroin addiction are young \nand they are fighting an incredibly difficult and painful battle \nwithout ever choosing to suffer. Through no action of their own, these \nchildren are victims of the heroin epidemic.\n  Parents who do not successfully treat their addiction have overdosed \nand died, leaving these children without their mothers and fathers. We \nmust work to ensure that children are not born addicted and not left \nwithout a parent.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to do as I have, and go out \ninto your communities and meet with your local hospitals, doctors, and \nhealthcare professionals to see how they are dealing with the growing \nnumber of heroin and opiate addicted newborns. I have held multiple \nforums to better understand how we can begin to prevent addiction \nbeginning at birth.\n  The faces of the heroin epidemic are not limited in age or gender. We \nknow now that it can be anyone: a child born unknowingly addicted or a \nparent who does not know where to turn for help. We must remain \ncommitted to combating the heroin epidemic and the devastating effects \nit has on these children and families.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from New \nHampshire has expired.\n\n[[Page H94]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, do I have any time remaining, as I have two \nmore speakers just for 1 minute each?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. KUSTER. It is regrettable. This is such an important topic for \nthe country.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair could entertain requests for 1-\nminute speeches at this time.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  (By unanimous consent, Mr. Cicilline was allowed to speak out of \norder.)\n\n\n                           faces of addiction\n\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, addiction has many faces, and one of \nthose is my friend from Rhode Island, Tom Coderre, who was elected to \nthe State senate at the age of 25 and also oversaw 40 employees as the \ndirector of a local nonprofit.\n  Already a heavy drinker, Tom soon started using cocaine as a way to \ncope with the stress of his responsibilities, and when he realized that \ndrugs were taking hold of his life, he tried to quit on his own but was \nnever able to maintain sobriety for more than a month or two.\n  Eventually, he checked himself into an inpatient treatment at Butler \nHospital. There he was able to get help and support and to maintain his \nsobriety and get his life back on track.\n  Today, more than 10 years sober, Tom works as the chief of staff for \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. His \nvictory over addiction is an inspiration for all who are struggling \ntoday.\n  It is a reminder for those of us in Congress that we need to do more \nto provide resources and support for those who need it most. We need a \ncomprehensive approach from the Federal Government that focuses on \nensuring that those struggling with addiction get the support and \ntreatment they need. That is particularly important in the area of \nopiate and heroin abuse.\n  In 2012, of the 23.1 million Americans who needed treatment for drugs \nor alcohol, only 2.5 million received it through a specialty facility.\n  There are millions of Americans who are in need of treatment. We have \na responsibility to do all that we can. Heroin use has grown \ntremendously over the last decade, particularly in New England. It is \nan epidemic that cuts across all demographic boundaries--Black and \nWhite, rich and poor, young and old--and we need to do something about \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H94-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H94]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REQUEST FOR ONE-MINUTE SPEECH\n\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Stutzman) is \nrecognized until 10 p.m. as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Indiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with quite a few \nMembers to address the issue of gun control and Americans' Second \nAmendment rights.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing the Third District of \nIndiana. In the Hoosier State, we cherish our constitutional right to \nbear arms. For many years I also had the honor of serving in the \nIndiana General Assembly, where I was proud to coauthor and get signed \ninto law the lifetime concealed carry permit so that Hoosiers could \nprotect themselves, their families, and their homes.\n  Starting in 2013, in response to the push for radical gun control \nlegislation from Senate Democrats, we founded the Republican Study \nCommittee's Second Amendment Initiative here in Congress, which serves \nas a platform for House Republicans to share the most important facts \nabout gun control and the Second Amendment.\n  Tonight I will be joined on the House floor by many members of the \nSecond Amendment Initiative and other proud Members who steadfastly \ndefend Americans' gun rights.\n  Mr. Speaker, we come to the House floor tonight to set the record \nstraight. Yesterday President Obama announced his intentions to \nunilaterally pursue executive actions on gun control.\n  Like times past, I wholeheartedly oppose the manner in which the \nPresident has chosen to pursue changes to current law. In fact, when \nreports surfaced this past fall that the President was considering \nexecutive actions on guns, I led over 30 of my House colleagues in \nsending a letter to the White House requesting information on what \nexactly he planned to do and why.\n  My colleagues and I had a number of very simple questions. First, if \nthe President is planning on closing the supposed gun show loophole, \ndid the Vice President and his gun control commission recommend this \npolicy for inclusion among the 23 executive actions announced by the \nWhite House in January of 2013? If so, why was it excluded from the \nannouncement?\n\n  Second, is the White House relying on any new data that was not \navailable when those 2013 actions were announced?\n  Third, does the White House have any evidence private sellers' \ntransaction volumes and propensity for illegal sales are positively \ncorrelated?\n  Fourth, does the White House believe this new policy would have \nprevented any of the recent year's major shootings?\n  Finally, does the White House expect criminals to voluntarily comply \nwith these new rules?\n  The White House still has not responded to our letter. Tomorrow, the \nPresident plans to hold a Q townhall televised on CNN regarding guns \nin America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I fear after this event, Americans will continue to be \nleft with more questions than answers, like, first and foremost, why \ndoes President Obama insist on infringing on Congress' lawmaking \nauthority?\n  The reason we don't have any answers to the questions about this new \ngun control policy is because it was crafted in back rooms, out of view \nof the public, instead of in Congress, where we would have held \nhearings, committees would have reviewed the policy, and our \nconstituents would have had the opportunity to comment on it.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the event Congress would have held a hearing on this \nissue, we probably would have uncovered the glaring reality that there \nis no gun show loophole. If you were one of the 55,277 federally \nlicensed gun dealers in America in fiscal year 2014, you would have \nbeen required, by law, to run background checks on individuals, no \nmatter if you sold a gun at your place of business or at a gun show.\n  Congress would probably also have come across the Department of \nJustice's study of inmates from 2001 that\n\n[[Page H95]]\n\nfound that less than 1 percent of inmates, when interviewed, actually \nbought their crime gun at a gun show. In contrast to this, almost 40 \npercent reported acquiring their guns illegally, such as by theft.\n  Members of Congress would have also found interesting a December 10 \nFact Checker's column in The Washington Post which reported as true the \nfact that none of the past year's and month's tragic mass shootings \nwould have been prevented by newly proposed gun laws.\n  Due to the President's insistence on going it alone and pursuing \nactions that challenge the Constitution, today we introduced H.R. 4321, \nthe Separation of Powers Restoration and Second Amendment Protection \nAct. Joined by over 60 colleagues in the House, this bill would render \nany executive action that violates the Second Amendment or infringes on \nCongress' article I responsibilities as having no force or effect, and \nto prohibit funds for such actions and established standing for \nCongress, State, and local governments, and for aggrieved persons to \nchallenge such actions in District Court. This legislation is the House \ncompanion bill to Senator Rand Paul's bill S. 2434.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time the White House cut out the distractions. \nStop blaming gun owners and start taking threats to Americans' safety \nseriously. Instead of continuing to blame Congress for not enacting new \nlaws, perhaps the President should look to laws already on the books.\n  Reports suggest that some Federal prosecutors are choosing not to \nprosecute straw purchasers as a matter of policy. These are the \nindividuals that purchase guns and illegally give or sell them to \nindividuals they know could not pass a background check. For example, \nin 2012, the U.S. attorney for Chicago announced a transition to \nfocusing on interstate trafficking and other violations instead of \nthese illegal straw purchases.\n  On top of this solution, the President could also look to Congress \nfor ideas. For example, States have been expanding concealed carry \nreciprocity to the point that Federal laws ought to catch up. I have a \nbill, H.R. 923, the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, \nwhich would do just that.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the coming months, I look forward to working with \nHouse Republican leadership on bold strategies to actually make America \nsafer.\n  At this time, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan \n(Mr. Huizenga).\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I thank my friend from Indiana for doing \nso. It has been a pleasure working with him on this and many other \nissues.\n  I have to tell you, my heart breaks for those families who have been \nimpacted by violent crimes. These tragedies, however, do not give \nPresident Obama the authority to circumvent the Constitution.\n  Just yesterday, the President announced unilateral actions to \nundermine the Second Amendment without input from Congress, making good \non his vow from an October 2015 speech of his willingness to politicize \ntragedies to advance his gun control agenda.\n  The President needs to enforce the laws currently on the books. \nCriminals who abuse firearms or obtain them illegally should be \nprosecuted to the fullest extent, and that isn't always the case \ncurrently.\n  I wish President Obama understood what a majority of Americans \nalready know, and especially those of us who have purchased weapons and \npurchased guns. Those who abuse firearms or obtain them illegally \nshould be prosecuted. However, purchasing a legal gun is not quick or \neasy.\n  They also know limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens will not \nsolve this problem. Instead of pursuing his political agenda, the \nPresident should join the bipartisan effort to fix our Nation's broken \nmental health system.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of Representative Tim Murphy's Helping \nFamilies in Mental Health Crisis Act. This legislation would overhaul \nour Nation's inadequate and outdated mental health system so people who \nneed treatment can receive it. Simply throwing more money at this issue \nwithout these reforms is like giving the VA more money without \ndemanding better care for our veterans.\n  According to ABC News, 63 percent of Americans see mass shootings as \na reflection of problems identifying and treating people with mental \nillness and mental health problems rather than adding more restrictive \ngun laws.\n  Also, according to The New York Times, not exactly a conservative \nnewspaper, 77 percent of those asked said that they thought that better \naccess to mental health treatment and screening would reduce gun \nviolence.\n  The American people are correct. These people who have been polled on \nthis are absolutely correct. Responsible gun ownership is not the \nproblem. The House must remain vigilant to protect the American people \nfrom an ever-encroaching Obama administration that is more interested \nin creating a political issue than a solution.\n  As a responsible gun owner myself, I am committed to being an \nadvocate for Second Amendment rights, the constitutional legislation \nthat will actually help prevent gun violence across America, and those \nwho have been impacted by its violence.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I want to voice my \nstrongest opposition to the Obama administration's continued assaults \non our Second Amendment rights.\n  After seeing his gun control agenda fail in the Democrat-controlled \nSenate, President Obama is once again trying to go around the will of \nthe American people and unilaterally take action through executive \nfiat.\n  This latest effort to unconstitutionally restrict one of our most \nfundamental rights has nothing to do with safety and security and has \neverything to do with government control. This is neither what the \nAmerican people want nor deserve.\n  In fact, the executive action the President announced yesterday would \nnot have prevented the recent tragedies our Nation has experienced, \nincluding the San Bernardino attack. Instead, it would trample the \nrights of law-abiding citizens. It could actually have a chilling \neffect on people seeking help for mental illness.\n  Nobody wants to see guns in the hands of someone who is dangerous \nbecause of mental incapacity, but we really need to look at the \nconsequences of this type of action. It is just common sense. If folks \nbelieve that they could potentially lose their rights for simply \nseeking mental health, it is going to be a deterrent to folks actually \nseeking that help.\n  Let me give you an example. In our country, we have an absolute \ntragedy of veteran suicide. If one veteran who returns home from the \nconflict doesn't seek help for issues that may have arisen from that \nservice, then shame on the President for this action. If they are \nafraid that if they go seek help, that one day they could lose their \ngun rights the rest of their life, what a deterrent effect that might \nhave on a population that desperately needs help.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  We will never regulate people's actions by regulating their freedoms. \nIf that were the case, then the streets of Chicago would be some of the \nsafest streets in America, because they have some of our strictest gun \ncontrol laws.\n  Rather than infringing on our Second Amendment and governing by \nexecutive fiat, this administration should work with Congress on \ncommonsense reforms that would actually reduce gun violence, like \nconfronting our mental health crisis and preventing criminals and \nterrorists from actually entering our country in the first place.\n  Mr. Speaker, like many of my constituents back home in North \nCarolina, I am a responsible, law-abiding gun owner who cherishes our \nSecond Amendment freedom. This right to keep and bear arms is a freedom \nby which we protect all of our other freedoms as a fundamental first \nfreedom. For that reason, I encourage my colleagues in the House to \nstand with me against the President's proposed executive actions.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana for organizing this \ntonight and bringing us together for this very important discussion.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe).\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, the President's plan to once again bypass \nCongress and unilaterally implement gun control measures represents yet \nanother, sadly, all too familiar assault\n\n[[Page H96]]\n\non our Constitution. This time, the President is doubling down with a \ntwo-for-one special by proposing executive orders which violate our \nSecond Amendment rights, while at the same time abusing the separation \nof powers written in our Constitution. In the process, the President \nclaims that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including gun \nowners, support his executive actions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can assure him that when it comes to the Texans that I \nrepresent, the President is dead wrong. This isn't the first time I \nhave had to fight the President's radical agenda on gun control--and \njust like before, I won't back down.\n  So today, I stand in support and as a cosponsor of the Separation of \nPowers and Second Amendment Protection Act, a critical bill that we \nnow, unfortunately, need to put a stop to any action by this President \nto weaken our Second Amendment rights.\n  I refuse to let this President use these unconstitutional executive \norders as a way to distract the American people from his epic foreign \npolicy failures, to turn our focus away from his failure to keep \nAmericans safe not from the Second Amendment, but from ISIS-inspired \nterrorists in our own homeland. San Bernardino was not, as the \nPresident called it, ``an act of violence.'' It was terrorism.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Stutzman, for \nputting this important Special Order together.\n  Yesterday, President Obama moved unilaterally, via executive order, \nin a misguided attempt to curb gun violence in America. He stated he \nhad to take unilateral action because the Congress refused to support \nhis initiatives. That is true, somewhat, but not because this Nation \nwishes to curb gun violence that has fallen upon innocent victims of \nAmerica--victims like Kathryn Stienle.\n  This young lady was murdered in San Francisco by a person here \nillegally--a person that had been deported over four times and should \nhave been deported once again, but instead was allowed to stay in this \ncountry illegally because of this President's policies and the policies \npromoted by sanctuary cities like San Francisco.\n  Obviously, I cannot speak for her family, but I would venture to say \nher family would have had a very different holiday this year than the \none they experienced had the justice system not failed them and the man \nwho murdered her had been deported. She would be here today if the \nPresident and his administration had chosen to simply enforce the laws \non the books.\n  President Obama's executive order will not curb this kind of \nviolence. Only the enforcement of the laws will. And, Mr. President, \nyou know this.\n  Please abide by article II, section 3 of our Constitution: The \nexecutive shall faithfully execute the laws of the land.\n  Now, I agree with the President that we should appropriate more money \nto mental health, as has been talked about here tonight. The lack of \nresources for those seeking mental health in this country is abysmal. \nThirty years ago, this Nation had over 500,000 hospital bed facilities \nfor mental health care. Today, there are less than 50,000. This is \ninexcusable.\n  I also agree with the President that we should increase the number of \nATF inspectors to process background checks more quickly and more \nefficiently. We can work this out through the legislative process--the \nway it should be done--and not through, again, executive fiat.\n  With all due respect, Mr. President, your phone and pen are not a \nsubstitute for the other two branches of government.\n  Aside from sidestepping Congress again, your other initiatives \nencroach on Americans' personal liberties and freedoms. Take, for \nexample, your plan to revoke gun ownership from folks whose oversight \nof their finances are turned over to someone else--specifically, those \nreceiving disability through the Social Security Administration or the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  For reasons beyond their control, sometimes additional help is needed \nin managing one's finances. Sometimes they do it voluntarily. This does \nnot mean they are incapable of making sound, moral decisions, and \ncertainly does not mean their Second Amendment rights can and should be \ninfringed upon.\n  As an aside, I want to highlight how this President's administration \nallowed for Syrian rebels to receive military grade weapons and they \nsupplied Mexican drug cartels with weapons through the failed Fast and \nFurious program administered under Attorney General Eric Holder at the \ntime. All of this has been done irresponsibly and without conducting \nbackground checks.\n  This administration's gun policies have killed innocent people. \nCustoms and Border Security Agent Brian Terry was a victim of this. Yet \nthis President's solution to gun violence is to restrict law-abiding \nAmerican citizens from one of our most basic rights of American freedom \nand liberty. It simply does not make sense.\n  The Second Amendment of our Constitution is very clear and concise. \nAllow me to read it: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the \nsecurity of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms \nshall not be infringed.''\n  This amendment was not added in the early years of our Nation's \nfounding for hunting or sporting purposes, but for personal protection \nto fend off an overbearing, tyrannical government. It is very clear and \nhas consistently been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I understand and sympathize with your frustrations, \nbut please uphold the Constitution and come to Congress. Let's work \ntogether on those areas where we agree upon to curb gun violence. And \nlet's preserve the Second Amendment. Let's all respect and revere \nthe Constitution for all Americans.\n\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. I thank the gentleman from Florida.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I thank my colleague and good friend \nfrom Indiana for organizing this Special Order, and I am very pleased \nto be here this evening to help defend our Second Amendment, which is \nthe amendment giving teeth to all our other amendments and rights.\n  The Second Amendment is one of the most fundamental principles of our \nRepublic. And yet the Obama administration and the Democratic Party as \na whole have now been engaged for years in an attempt to undermine the \nrights of law-abiding American citizens to keep and bear arms.\n  President Obama, as has already been discussed this evening, has come \nbefore the American people just yesterday announcing his attempt to yet \nagain infringe upon the rights of law-abiding American citizens by \nunilaterally instituting new restrictions on firearm sales.\n  The President's blatant disregard for the constitutional role of \nCongress to write the laws of the land is absolutely astounding to me. \nThis latest move is just yet a larger part of executive abuse that has \nbeen going on for quite some time and an overreach.\n  In 2013, Congress rejected legislation that would have expanded \nbackground checks. I fully believe that that would have the same result \ntoday. And yet because it was not in accord with the wishes of the \nPresident, he now claims that Congress has relinquished its \nresponsibility. Therefore, he somehow has the right to create laws as \nhe sees fit. Well, he is wrong.\n  As well as being unconstitutional, this moral imperative that the \nPresident claims to have regarding gun controls is not even \nstatistically or logically on sound ground. In fact, the President has \npointed directly to a string of domestic terror attacks as the reason \nfor his executive action. And yet we all know that his unconstitutional \nexecutive order would not have prevented any of these terror attacks.\n  So the real issue here is that this gun grab by the President is a \nsmokescreen to hide from his own failed policies and his refusal to \ndeal with terrorism and to eliminate it. And it is time for the truth \nto be told and for us to stand in opposition against this continued \nassault on the Second Amendment.\n  Personally, my defense of the Second Amendment is firm and \nunwavering. I will never support any measure that infringes upon the \nrights of law-abiding American citizens to purchase, use, and keep \nfirearms and ammunition. I believe that any law that restricts these\n\n[[Page H97]]\n\nrights is unconstitutional and should be steadfastly opposed.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time to share this tonight. And I \nam just reminded of Thomas Jefferson's statement: ``No freeman shall \never be debarred the use of arms.''\n  This is an issue upon which our liberties rest.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. I thank the gentleman for the reminder from one of our \nFounding Fathers, and I appreciate your service to the citizens in \nGeorgia.\n  I yield to another Member from the great State of Georgia (Mr. \nLoudermilk).\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. I thank my colleague from Indiana for reserving this \ntime and for giving me a few minutes to speak on this very important \nand critical issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I am standing here, I see the word ``liberty'' \nengraved at the base of the rostrum. One of the great principles of \nthis Nation is one of the principles of which our Founding Fathers \nsought to take on in the field of battle the most powerful military \nforce in the history of the world for an idea, a principle of liberty.\n  One of the great influencers on our Founding Fathers was Charles \nMontesquieu, an 18th century philosopher and judge. He said that when \nthe legislative and the executive power is vested in one person or one \nbody, there can be no liberty.\n  Many of my colleagues that stood here before I came this evening have \ntestified to the role that the President has taken upon himself to \nbecome both the legislator and the executive in this matter. In fact, \nin his statement on the White House Web site, he said that he was going \nto have to take action, even though some of the gaps in our gun laws \ncould only be fixed by legislative action by Congress. But because \nCongress failed to act, he is going to have to take action.\n  Clearly, he is admitting to stepping into the constitutional role of \nthis body and the body on the other side of this building. When that \nhappens, there can be no liberty.\n  Now, the President has said he must take this action because Congress \nhas failed to act. No, Congress did act. But Congress did not act in \nthe way that he wanted us to. And because we didn't act in the way that \nhe specifically wanted, now he has to take action. And the action he \nsays that he must take is to make America safe.\n  Many have talked about the constitutional issues. Clearly, he is \ntaking an unconstitutional approach in this decision that he has made \nand in this action. But I want to highlight the ultimate hypocrisy of \nhis statement that his actions are to make America safe.\n  This body has taken actions which he has ignored that would truly \nmake America safe. Back in February, as a member of the Committee on \nHomeland Security, I traveled to our open and porous southern border, \nand I traveled side-by-side with Border Patrol agents, the Coast Guard, \nand local law enforcement who have committed their time and their \nlives. It is their mission to secure that border. We saw that the \nborder is controlled by illegal cartels that smuggle human traffic. \nThey smuggle narcotics and they smuggle drugs across the border into \nthis country.\n  Now, if guns just arbitrarily kill people, then maybe the action the \nPresident is taking would have some effect. But I have been around guns \nall my life and I have yet to have a gun jump up and just arbitrarily \nstart shooting anyone. Guns don't kill people. People kill people.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Bad people that use guns come into this country, and often those guns \nare smuggled in through the southern border.\n  Now, as a result of being on the border, we realized that the only \nway to secure that border is we have to have a combination of physical \nbarriers, of technology, but, most importantly, boots on the ground.\n  We have talked about building fences and building walls. Well, I had \none Border Patrol agent say that those are really ineffective unless \nyou have boots on the ground. You build a 12-foot wall. The cartels buy \n13-foot ladders.\n  The cartels use high technology. They use engineers to build tunnels. \nThey use aircraft to drop contraband on our side of the border and \nsmuggle people, many people who are intent to do ill to people in this \nNation, as we saw in San Francisco earlier this year.\n  But the President has basically ignored Congress' call to secure the \nborder. Instead of putting more Border Patrol agents on the border to \nsecure the border, he wants to bring 200 more ATF agents to investigate \nAmerican citizens.\n  Just a few weeks ago, we dealt with the threat of ISIS and al Qaeda \nthat says they are going to exploit our refugee resettlement program to \nget operatives into this Nation to conduct terrorist attacks against \nthis Nation.\n  This Congress, out of this body, passed a bill to pause that program \nuntil we could fully vet every person. The President decided he would \nignore the call of Congress, and he pursued on with the refugee \nprogram.\n  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I was able to \nquestion the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the \nFBI, saying: If we do bring these refugees in, how are you going to \nmonitor them?\n  The FBI said: We don't have the resources to monitor 10,000 new \nrefugees coming into this Nation.\n  But, yet, in his executive order, the President wants to hire 230 \nadministrators, administrative personnel, to conduct background checks \ninstead of providing us with more FBI agents to investigate terrorist \nactivities. You tell me who is wanting to make America safe.\n  He also has proposed $500 million toward mental health care and \neventually tie mental health assessments to background checks. I \napplaud that.\n  But, at the same time, we have thousands of soldiers coming back from \nwar areas suffering from PTSD that this administration and the Veterans \nAdministration has ultimately abandoned.\n  Finally, he wants to use taxpayer dollars and resources to research \nand test smart gun technology. Well, maybe that is a technology in the \nfuture that could be applicable.\n  But, yet, the TSA has postponed time and time again putting in new \nscanning technology that is desperately needed at our airports to stop \ncontraband and banned items from getting through to our Nation's \nairlines and into our transportation system. Once again, that has been \npostponed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say that the President and his call that he wants to \nmake America safer is making America more dangerous because he \ncontinues to ignore what the will of the people is.\n  What this Congress is calling for is that we need to close our \nborders, we need to put more FBI agents investigating terrorist \nactivities, we need to take care of our war veterans, we need to stop \nthe influx of refugees that we know are going to be exploited by our \nenemies, and we also need to invest in technologies to make our \ntransportation safe and secure.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia and appreciate his \ncomments tremendously. I think he made some very good points.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I appreciate this opportunity to certainly \nstand in support of our Second Amendment.\n  This is an issue that has obviously been around for some time. With \nthe recent very violent events that have stricken various communities \naround our country, I think that the way the President has chosen to \nrespond is ineffective. I think it is inappropriate, certainly an \noverreach by the President himself.\n  I believe that, as the President has chosen to operate without going \nto Congress or even attempting to work with Congress on many issues, \nbut especially this one, it is disappointing.\n  We already have laws on the books that need enforcing. Those laws \nthat we have I think can be effective.\n  Certainly, I don't think anyone will say that someone can just \nautomatically go buy a gun without any effort whatsoever.\n  But, disappointingly, none of the President's recent unilateral \nactions targeting law-abiding citizens and restricting gun ownership \nwould have prevented the tragedies that the President himself has \nreferenced.\n  I would like to highlight one area of the executive order which falls \nunder the jurisdiction of the committee on which I serve, the Ways and \nMeans\n\n[[Page H98]]\n\nCommittee, which is the President's proposal to have Social Security \nbeneficiaries with representative payees included in the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System.\n  Now, let me say that the mismanagement of one's finances alone should \nnot mean that an individual would lose their Second Amendment rights. I \nam concerned not only that this targets law-abiding citizens, but that \nit would also discourage some beneficiaries from seeking needed \nassistance for fear of losing their constitutional rights. Many similar \nviews have been shared here earlier this evening.\n  Also, when the Los Angeles Times first reported consideration of the \nrepresentative payee issue last summer, I joined the majority of the \nWays and Means Committee members in writing to the President opposing \nthis proposal.\n  Despite the administration's unwillingness so far to change its \nstance on representative payees, I remain hopeful we can scale back \nthese orders.\n\n  Early last year, when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives proposed banning M855 ammunition, I was one of the 238 House \nMembers who wrote the former ATF Director opposing the proposal, as did \nmore than 80,000 Americans. Now, in response to massive public and \ncongressional opposition, the ATF actually withdrew the proposal.\n  President Obama has repeatedly disregarded our legislative branch and \nthe American people. The President's job is to respect all \nconstitutional rights, not just the ones he chooses. His executive \norder sets an incredibly dangerous precedent.\n  I will continue to stand against this overreach and protect \nNebraskans' and, quite frankly, all Americans' constitutional right to \nbear arms.\n  I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Indiana has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas \n(Mr. Westerman).\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the gentleman \nfrom Indiana for leading this Special Order tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Second Amendment is crystal clear. It ensures that \nthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. \nThe founders rebelled against the largest empire in the world. They \nknew it was crucial to guarantee individuals the right to protect their \nlife, liberty and property. That is the entire point of the Second \nAmendment.\n  Unfortunately, we have a President more obsessed with the politics of \ngun control than living by the oath he twice took to preserve, protect \nand defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  The President should work with Congress to solve the problems facing \nthis country, not try to take on the legislative duties of Congress.\n  Americans have a history of confronting those who wish to take away \ntheir rights, and they have said: ``No. You can't do that.\n  The best way to fight against the gross overreach by the Federal \nGovernment is for citizens to exercise their Second Amendment rights.\n  The good news is the people of this country, the responsible people \nwho will exercise their constitutional rights and follow the law, are \nalready doing this. They are flocking to purchase guns and ammunition \ndespite President Obama's best efforts.\n  Since President Obama was sworn into office, 106 million background \nchecks for gun purchases have been conducted by Federal or State \nauthorities. Only 96 million were conducted in the previous 11 years. \nGun makers have doubled their manufacturing output since 2009 as well.\n  Meanwhile, according to the ATF, the number of privately owned \nfirearms in the U.S. has increased from about 250 million twenty years \nago to roughly 350 million today.\n  President Obama's obsession with killing the Second Amendment has \nunintentionally become the catalyst for gun ownership in America. The \nfirearms industry's $43 billion nationwide economic impact has more \nthan doubled since 2009 and is also one of the few bright spots in the \nObama economic record.\n  But there is more good news in all of this. Despite the White House's \nmisleading rhetoric, violent crime rates are consistently down over the \nlast 20 years. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, the number \nof violent crimes has decreased 35.5 percent over the last 20 years.\n  There are more guns than people in the United States; yet, the \nviolent crime rate continues to tumble because a criminal knows a well-\narmed gun owner is a direct threat to a criminal's safety.\n  And despite President Obama's obsession with undermining the Second \nAmendment, Federal weapons convictions have dropped 35 percent compared \nto 2005.\n  The Obama Department of Justice should focus on enforcing current \nFederal weapons laws instead of issuing ideological edicts from the \nexecutive branch.\n  Once again, I would like to thank my colleague from Indiana, Mr. \nStutzman, for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. \nPalmer).\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, the President's executive orders relating to \ngun control are a major distraction from the real national security \nissues.\n  Frankly, I think dealing with ISIS and confronting Iran over their \nviolations of this administration's agreement with them and securing \nour borders are of greater importance than pushing gun control measures \nthat will do little to protect us.\n  Apparently, this administration is more concerned about 4 million \nsenior citizens on Social Security owning a gun than they are about a \nnuclear-armed Iran or terrorists crossing our unsecured borders.\n  The fact that millions of Americans have purchased firearms over the \nweeks following the shootings in San Bernardino is indicative that they \nhave lost confidence in this administration's ability to protect them. \nThey are literally taking personal responsibility for their own safety. \nIt could be argued that these Americans are creating their own homeland \nsecurity.\n  Pushing executive orders for more gun control that exceed the \nPresident's constitutional authority will not only do little to improve \nour national security, it will do little to increase the public's \nconfidence in this administration's policies for protecting our \nhomeland.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \noppose this latest abuse and overreach of executive authority and \nreassert the lawmaking authority of Congress.\n  I urge all my colleagues in the House to focus our attention on \ndefeating ISIS, on restraining Iran, and on securing our borders in \norder to protect American citizens right here in our homeland.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Indiana for leading this \nSpecial Order for this critical discussion.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, if I could inquire as to the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Indiana has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate each Member coming down \ntonight to talk about this. This is a very important issue. I am \nhearing from my constituents back in northeast Indiana every day on the \nconcern that they have about the President's actions.\n  I would like to share just a statistic, that we know that national \ncrime rates, violent crime and gun crime, have both dropped over the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ decades. I think that is a positive sign that we should all \nbe encouraged about and that we continue to work together to make sure \nthat violent crime and gun crime is eliminated in this country.\n  In 2013, the national crime rate was about half of what it was at its \nheight in 1991. Violent crime had fallen by 51 percent since 1991 and \nproperty crime by 43 percent.\n  In 2013, the violent crime rate was the lowest since 1970. Compared \nwith 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate \nwas 49 percent lower in 2010 and there were fewer deaths, even though \nthe Nation's population grew.\n\n[[Page H99]]\n\n  The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm, \nassault, robberies, and sex crimes, was 75 percent lower in 2011 than \nin 1993.\n  Violent, nonfatal crime victimization overall, with or without a \nfirearm, also is down markedly, 72 percent over the past two decades.\n  As one of the former Members mentioned, if you look at the city of \nChicago, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, it \nhas a huge problem with gun violence in that city.\n  I would like to just read, in closing, again, what I think is really \nimportant for all of us, the Second Amendment: ``A well regulated \nmilitia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of \nthe people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''\n  I ask that all of us, as Members of this great body, continue to \nremember that the Second Amendment is there to protect liberty and \nfreedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H99-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H99]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for \ntoday and the balance of the week.\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n  Mr. Rush (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nattending to family member's medical procedure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/06/house-section/article/H99-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H99]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL\n\n\n  revisions to the aggregates and allocations of the fiscal year 2016 \n                           budget resolution\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2016.\n     Hon.
