The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot in this Chamber about the \nburdensome regulations that Federal agencies frequently place on the \nAmerican public. Last week the Competitive Enterprise Institute \nreleased a report that puts a price tag on the rules implemented by the \nFederal bureaucracy, saying that Federal regulation and intervention \ncost American consumers and businesses nearly $2 trillion in lost \neconomic productivity and higher prices in 2014. That is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Many of these rules hinder innovation and job creation and are costly \nto businesses and consumers. As a former small-business owner, I know \nfirsthand how the government can make it more difficult for a business \nto be successful. I recognize the true costs of overregulation, such as \nlost productivity, increased expenses, and new financial and legal \nliabilities, which many policymakers often forget about.\n  Just last month, the House approved a disapproval resolution to stop \nthe Obama administration from implementing its flawed fiduciary rule, \nwhich will significantly impact the ability of Americans to receive \nadvice on how to save for retirement and make it more difficult for \nbusinesses--in particular, small businesses--to establish retirement \nplans. The rule, which contains more than 1,000 pages of new \nregulations, makes it cost prohibitive to offer advice or services to \nlow- and middle-income Americans by increasing compliance costs and the \nrisk of litigation.\n  The Department of Education is constantly putting obstacles in the \npath of innovation, and these unnecessary regulations are stifling \npioneering higher education institutions at a time when forward-\nthinking solutions are desperately needed. More redtape and hoops to \njump through are not going to promote diverse choices for students. In \nfact, they often add administrative costs on schools--costs that are \ntypically passed on to students in the form of higher fees and tuition. \nThat is why I have introduced legislation to reduce Federal intrusion \nand limit the costly regulatory burden on colleges and universities.\n  As my colleagues and constituents know, the issue of unfunded \nmandates has been a particular interest of mine for a long time. It is \nfrequently overlooked in the debates about reforming our regulatory \nsystem and carrying out Federal policies. It is all too easy for \nWashington bureaucrats to write off concerns expressed by a handful of \nlocal governments or a small subset of private businesses. But these \ndecisions have real costs and real effects on the individuals, \nfamilies, and communities we each represent.\n  My legislation, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency \nAct, does not seek to prevent the Federal Government from regulating; \nrather, it seeks to ensure that its regulations are deliberative and \neconomically defensible. Asking regulators to consider thoroughly and \nunderstand the cost of a rule in addition to its benefits should not be \ncontroversial.\n  Republicans are often accused of opposing all regulations, but that \nis just not true. We are in favor of commonsense rules, and we believe \nit is possible to alleviate the regulatory burden on small businesses \nand other job creators while balancing public safety and consumer \ninterests.\n  Regulation by bureaucratic fiat is not what the Founding Fathers had \nin mind when they created our government. I applaud Speaker Ryan for \ncreating the Task Force on Reducing Regulatory Burdens and look forward \nto seeing its suggestions for a modern and transparent regulatory \nsystem that makes it easier to invest, produce, and build in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2217-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2217-H2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ISRAEL INDEPENDENCE DAY/DAY OF REMEMBRANCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Yom Ha'atzmaut, the \ncommemoration of the Israeli Declaration of\n\n[[Page H2218]]\n\nIndependence in 1948. This day of celebration is always immediately \npreceded by Yom Hazikaron, Israel's Memorial Day.\n  This timing is no accident. The people of Israel know that their \nfreedom comes at a high price. Today I am humbled to join them in \nremembering more than 23,000 soldiers and victims of terrorist attacks \nwho have paid this price, including 68 soldiers and police officers and \n32 civilians over the past year alone.\n  The strong relationship between the United States and Israel dates \nback more than six decades. On May 14, 1948, just 11 minutes after the \nprovisional government of Israel, led by Prime Minister David Ben-\nGurion, proclaimed a new state, President Harry S. Truman announced: \n``This government has been informed that a Jewish state has been \nproclaimed in Palestine, and recognition has been requested by the \nprovisional government thereof. The United States recognizes the \nprovisional government as the de facto authority of the new State of \nIsrael.''\n  This year, Israelis will celebrate their independence as they always \nhave, gathering for public shows, performing Israeli folk dances, \nsinging Israeli songs, and spending the day with families at picnics or \non hikes. The holiday will conclude with the awarding of the Israeli \nPrize to men and women who have made unique contributions to culture, \nscience, the arts, and humanities.\n  For American Jews, the celebration of Israel's independence has \nalways been a way to express solidarity with the State of Israel. In \nmany communities, it is a special occasion for Jewish organizations and \nsynagogues of different denominations to come together for a single, \nunited celebration of Israel's creation and existence, both of which \nhave defied great odds.\n  Just one day after President Truman recognized the new Jewish state's \nexistence, five neighboring Arab countries amassed their armies and \ninvaded, determined to remove the dream of Israel from the pages of \nhistory. But after months of fighting, Israel emerged stronger than it \nwas before, with more territory under its control.\n  Since then, the people of Israel have lived under the threat of \nviolence for nearly seven decades. They survived the Six-Day War in \n1967, the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and insurgencies that targeted \nsoldiers and civilians alike. Through it all, the friendship between \nthe United States and Israel has remained strong. We stood together to \noppose Soviet aggression during the cold war, and we continue to stand \ntogether today, united in the fight against terrorism and global \nextremism.\n  This friendship is rooted in much more than strategic interests. The \nUnited States and Israel have always shared common values. As the most \nstable and successful democracy in the Middle East, Israel is committed \nto the values of equality and freedom, including a free press, freedom \nof religion, and the right to self-determination through democratic \nelections.\n  Today, at a pivotal moment in the history of the world, it is more \nimportant than ever for the United States to stand with the people of \nIsrael. I have been proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle on legislation to strengthen the ties between our two \ncountries. The United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Act, \nwhich I introduced earlier this year, will establish a joint \nCybersecurity Center of Excellence where the leaders from our two \ncountries can work together on cybersecurity and the protection of \ncritical infrastructure. In the House Foreign Affairs Committee, we \nhave worked to advance legislation that condemns efforts to inflame \nanti-Semitic sentiments by the Palestinian Authority. These are \ncritical issues we must continue to work on in the pursuit of our \ncommon objectives and our shared values.\n  I congratulate the State of Israel on the anniversary of its \nindependence, and I look forward to continuing to work to strengthen \nthe relationship between our two countries even further.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2218-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2218-H2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA: A DEMOCRACY IN A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the world leader in freedom and \ndemocracy, it is in our national interest to see the same freedoms we \nenjoy spread to people throughout the world.\n  The Republic of Georgia is a small and young democracy in an area \nthat is more known for its authoritarian rule than freedom. Georgia \nformally declared its independence in 1918, but 4 years later, the \nSoviet bear invaded and declared Georgia a Soviet Socialist Republic. \nBut the Georgian people are resilient, and with the fall of the Soviet \nUnion in 1991, Georgia again declared its independence from Russia.\n  Over the past 25 years, Georgia has become the freest country in its \nregion. It sets up a stark contrast to the dictatorship of Putin in the \nnorth. However, the Russians never gave up on their ambitions to \ncontrol Georgia.\n  I was in Georgia in 2008 when Russian troops invaded and took one-\nthird of Georgia. I saw the Russian tanks up on the hill. And, Mr. \nSpeaker, the Russians still illegally occupy one-third of the nation of \nGeorgia.\n  The Russians want to impose tyranny upon Georgia precisely because of \nGeorgia's quest for democracy and liberty. Georgia has made good \ngovernance a cornerstone of its reforms, grown the economy, and made \nsignificant progress toward creating a democratic society.\n  The world witnessed Georgia's first peaceful democratic transition of \npower from one party to another in 2013, and it has improved media \nfreedom for 4 consecutive years, according to Reporters Without \nBorders. In fact, Freedom House ranks Georgia number one in the region \nfor its freedom of the press.\n  Georgia has also made significant strides when it comes to \ncorruption. It even ranks higher than some European Union countries and \nother U.S. allies according to Transparency International.\n  When it comes to business and free markets, Georgia makes it to the \ntop of the pack. The World Bank ranked Georgia among the top 25 \ncountries easiest to do business in.\n  The fact is that the Georgian people and their government share our \nWestern values. A recent poll found that more than three-quarters of \nthe Georgian people support their government's goal to join the \nEuropean Union. Nearly 70 percent of Georgians also support Georgia's \njoining NATO. The United States should be vocal and support Georgia's \nquest to be in NATO.\n  For the past 25 years of independence, Georgia has been a valuable \nally of the United States. Due to Georgia's free market system, low \ncorruption, and simplified tax system, many American companies have \ninvested in Georgia, especially in the energy sector.\n  The U.S. should negotiate a free trade agreement with Georgia to add \njobs to both of our economies and send a message that Georgia is an \nimportant friend of the United States.\n  Georgia is also a vital partner in the battle against international \nterrorism. It has provided more troops to the effort in Afghanistan \nthan any other non-NATO member. Thirty-three Georgian troops have \nfought and died on the battlefield with American troops, and 900 \nGeorgian troops still remain in Afghanistan.\n  The Georgians are now preparing to hold elections in October. To \nensure that these parliamentary elections are free and fair, the \nGeorgians have invited international, independent election observers to \nmonitor those elections in October.\n  The United States and our NATO allies must remain firm in our support \nfor Georgia. Georgia is a sovereign country whose boundaries should be \nrespected--even by Putin. Russia knows Georgia is a symbol of democracy \nin the region. That is why Putin continues to rattle his sabres in the \nentire neighborhood. Dictator Putin knows if Georgia is a successful \ndemocracy, then Georgia's neighbors are going to want to follow that \nlead and become more democratic. It is in our national interest to \nsupport Georgia and their democratic aspirations in their journey for \nliberty.\n  Fifty years ago, our President John F. Kennedy talked about liberty. \nHe stated what the American policy is regarding liberty. I hope and \nbelieve it is still our policy today. Here is what he said, Mr. \nSpeaker: ``Let every nation\n\n[[Page H2219]]\n\nknow, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, \nbear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe \nto assure the survival and the success of liberty.''\n  That applies to Georgia, Mr. Speaker.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2219-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EPIDEMIC OF OVERDOSE DEATHS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, next to me is a map of the United States \nwhich shows the sickening increase in overdose deaths in this country \ndue to heroin and opioid use over the last decade or so.\n  The first map is a map from the Centers for Disease Control \nstatistics in 2004, when roughly 7,000 Americans lost their lives to \nopioid overdose. Again, the red color shows the intensity of regions \nwhere deaths occurred in excess of 20 per 100,000. The blue is 10 per \n100,000 or less.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  In 2014, over 28,000 Americans lost their lives to heroin and opioid \noverdose deaths. As you can see, the red portions of the country are \nincreasing at an alarming rate. We have not gotten the 2015 statistics \nyet from the Centers for Disease Control, but by all indication from \nState numbers that are coming out, this map is actually going to get \nworse for the 2015 numbers.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have an epidemic in this country which far surpasses \nany challenge that is presented by any natural disaster. If we had an \nattack on the homeland that took the number of lives that these maps \nrepresent, this Congress would be on fire in terms of trying to move \nresources and help to communities all across the country.\n  Again, it is indiscriminate. It hits rural America, it hits suburban \nAmerica, it hits urban America, and it hits age groups and ethnic \ngroups across the board.\n  Today we are going to be taking up some legislation, H.R. 4641 and \nH.R. 5046. The first bill has 2 cosponsors; the second has 10 \ncosponsors. The first provides for establishment of an interagency task \nforce to talk about pain medication, and the second is to authorize, \nnot appropriate, different programs for heroin and opioid reduction. \nThey are benign bills. It would be impossible for anyone to object to \nthem.\n  But to be very clear, there is not a penny in either of these \nmeasures to help law enforcement. The police and fire who are \nresponding to these crises day in and day out back home in eastern \nConnecticut are burning out because of the frequency of these calls. \nThere is not a penny in these measures for treatment beds, for detox, \nor for long-term care treatment. In the State of Connecticut, it takes \n4 to 6 months to get treatment.\n  These are addicts who are at points in their lives where to talk \nabout a 4- to 6-month time span is to talk about an eternity. If you \ntalk to the families who are dealing with their loved ones who are \nensnared in these addictions, 4 to 6 months is really basically being \ntold that there is no treatment available.\n  There is not a penny for prevention and education. If we go upstream, \nthat is how we solve this problem in terms of better practices for \nopioid and heroin prescription.\n  It is not a coincidence that the White House last night issued a \nstatement on this legislation, which basically points out the fact that \nthey ``do little to help the thousands of Americans struggling with \naddiction.''\n  The statement goes on to say that these alarming trends which are \nrepresented on this map ``will not change by simply authorizing new \ngrant programs, studies and reports. Congressional action is needed to \nfund the tools communities need to confront this epidemic and \naccelerate important policies like training health care providers on \nappropriate opioid prescribing, an essential component of this \neffort.''\n  The President submitted a budget with $1 billion of new funding paid \nfor offset for 2017 that would put money into those three buckets: \nprevention and education, law enforcement, and treatment, again, no \naction by the majority in terms of dealing with actual funding to help \npeople out there desperate for help.\n  There is a bill also to provide emergency supplemental funding of \n$600 million for this year to get that help out now. We presented it to \nthe Rules Committee last night, and it was rejected.\n  If we had a hurricane or a tornado or a forest fire that was ravaging \nparts of this country or an attack on the homeland, this place would \nnot hesitate about getting resources out there to help the folks that \nwould respond to that type of a crisis; yet, somehow we have turned a \nblind eye to the thousands of Americans who are suffering from \naddiction and to the thousands of law enforcement fire and police who \nare responding to these calls literally as we are sitting here today.\n  There are hundreds of people per day who are dying because of this \nproblem, and we, again, are providing no resources about better opioid \nprescription practices and getting better education, particularly to \nour young people, that clearly this map shows we must do if we are \ngoing to get our arms around this conflict and this problem.\n  Today there will be votes. There will be a lot of self-congratulatory \nrhetoric about the fact that we are moving on this. But, remember, \nthere is not a penny for law enforcement, for treatment, or for \nprevention and education. Until we do that, we are kidding ourselves \nthat we are going to turn this alarming, disturbing trend around.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2219-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2219-H2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SOUTH DADE VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the \nlong-overdue south Dade Veterans Affairs clinic adjacent to Homestead \nAir Reserve Base, part of my congressional district.\n  Community-based outpatient clinic facilities in Homestead and Key \nLargo are extremely limited in the amount of services that they \nprovide. This project, therefore, can no longer be ignored, Mr. \nSpeaker. Currently, these local military personnel, retired \nservicemembers, and veterans are not getting the proper support that \nthey have so rightfully earned.\n  As the wife of a Vietnam veteran and a stepmother of two marine \naviators, I am passionate about safeguarding our Nation's military \nmembers and their families and fighting for the services they need in \norder for them to live healthy and fulfilling lives. Our military does \nnot quit on us, Mr. Speaker, and I certainly will continue fighting for \nthem.\n  It is estimated that there are more than 22,500 veterans, Active-Duty \nmilitary, and recently deployed reservists eligible for VA medical \nservices within a 20-mile radius of Homestead Air Reserve Base. \nCurrently, those living in Homestead who require more than the limited \nservices offered at Homestead Outpatient Clinic must travel about 70 \nmiles roundtrip to the VA Medical Center in order to get the proper \ncare that they desperately need. Veterans living in the Upper Keys have \nto travel even further, oftentimes more than 160 miles roundtrip.\n  This is completely unacceptable. It is a huge burden for our \nservicemen and -women and their families who have already sacrificed so \nmuch for us and our Nation. This new clinic would not only improve \naccess to care for veterans in Homestead and the Upper Keys, but it \nwould also enhance the quality of care throughout the region by \nreducing pressure on the Miami VA Medical Center.\n  Mr. Speaker, the south Dade VA clinic is a project that has a great \ndeal of support throughout my district, including the Department of \nDefense personnel at Homestead Air Reserve Base and the Military \nAffairs Committee of the south Dade Chamber of Commerce.\n  I have also received thousands of constituent support cards, many of \nwhich I have here with me today. Here is a bunch, and here is a bunch. \nThere are just thousands, Mr. Speaker.\n  Once again I would like to express my strong support for the long-\noverdue south Dade Veterans Affairs clinic adjacent to the Homestead \nAir Reserve Base. These local veterans have waited too long already, \nand they deserve nothing less than the successful completion of a new \nfacility as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page H2220]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n           Congratulating Israel on its 68th Independence Day\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the \ndemocratic Jewish State of Israel as it marks its Independence Day.\n  Though the Jewish people have historical ties to Israel that date \nback millennia, in just 68 years of statehood, look at all that Israel \nhas accomplished. Israel is a world leader in education, in technology, \nand in innovation. It is a vibrant and open democracy with a robust \neconomy that thrives despite the constant threats that it faces daily.\n  The United States can have no greater friend than Israel not only \nbecause we share the same interests, but because we also share the same \nvalues and beliefs, such as democracy and the rule of law. That is why \nit is imperative that our two nations sign a new memorandum of \nunderstanding to ensure that Israel has the capability and the capacity \nto defend herself and her citizens from all threats and be a shining \nexample of democracy for the entire region.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work to strengthen the \nalready-strong relationship between the U.S. and Israel. I congratulate \nthe Jewish state and her citizens on its 68th Independence Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2220-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WAR ON DRUGS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is a major front on the war on \ndrugs that is only now getting the attention it deserves. We will be \ndiscussing it later today on the floor dealing with opioid addiction.\n  Instead of arresting or citing over 600,000 people for marijuana last \nyear, which had zero overdose deaths and which a majority of Americans \nthink should be legal, we should redouble our efforts to fight the \nabuse of opioid prescription painkillers and the epidemic of opioid \ndeaths.\n  Because of reckless marketing and lax oversight, there is an overdose \ndeath every 19 minutes; 78 people a day die, 20,000 last year. This is \ndirectly related to many heroin addicts. Deaths on heroin are \nincreasing because the addict's drug of choice when their supply of \nopioids is interrupted shifts to heroin.\n  2.1 million suffer from substance abuse and 1,000 people a day are \nadmitted to emergency rooms for opoid related causes. We have a \nchallenge that needs to be addressed. There is plenty of blame to go \naround: the drug company's marketing practices, pill mills and \nunscrupulous doctors whose government regulators were asleep at the \nswitch; and the DEA, which cannot get its priorities or its story \nstraight.\n  I am hopeful that today's action on the floor will be the first step. \nAs my friend and colleague from Connecticut pointed out, today's \nlegislation really doesn't speak meaningfully to what we are going to \nhave to do: prevention and treatment, which ultimately can help disrupt \nthis cycle of abuse.\n  There is one simple step that I think would make a profound \ndifference. We are introducing legislation today to deal with disposal \nof prescription drugs. We are issuing approximately one prescription \nper adult in the United States, 260 million this year.\n  There are tens of millions of these pills floating around and left \nover. And what do people do? Many of them just flush them down the \ntoilet or leave them in the medicine cabinets.\n  Well, flushing them into the sewer system is not a good idea because \nwe are slowly medicating millions of Americans who are having traces of \nthese drugs showing up in their system from drinking water. They are \nexpensive to remove. Leaving it in the medicine cabinet is how many \npeople find drugs to abuse. Teenagers steal unused medicines out of \nmedicine cabinets in homes that they visit or from family members.\n  We are proposing a safe drug disposal tax credit, which would offer \nqualified entities such as retail pharmacies, narcotics treatment \nprograms, and long-term care facilities a tax credit to be able to deal \nwith disposal of these prescription drugs on site.\n  Locating safe drug disposal and take-back programs at pharmacies and \nother healthcare sites will increase access to this safe medicine \ndisposal and will remove millions of these highly dangerous drugs from \nthe hands of people who shouldn't have them.\n  By all means, let's have the debate today. Let's start moving \nforward. A look at the broader challenges of treatment and prevention \nis long overdue. Hopefully, the DEA gets its priorities straight in the \nfuture.\n  But, in the meantime, providing a tax credit for safe disposal is a \nsmall step, which should have bipartisan support and will make a \ndifference in every community across America to end this epidemic of \nprescription overdose deaths.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2220-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2220-H2221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING BROCKWAY'S GRACE PRESTON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the \nefforts of Grace Preston, a sixth grader from Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District.\n  Grace visited Washington, D.C., last week to accept the Prudential \nSpirit of Community Award, a ceremony at the Smithsonian Museum of \nNatural History. Grace was one of only two students in Pennsylvania to \nbe honored with this award, which recognizes outstanding acts of \nvolunteerism.\n  Grace has raised more than $4,000 in the past 3 years to improve the \nlives of animals in her community through the sale of homemade dog \ntreats, cat toys, and flee and tick repellent.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  She became interested in helping animals after her family adopted a \npet from a local shelter.\n  Through her efforts, Grace has raised enough money to enable the \nlocal Humane Society to purchase a storage shed, as well as other \nsupplies, such as rabies gloves. She has also provided animal oxygen \nmask kits to a local fire department for pets that have been caught in \nfires; has helped pay for a shelter dog's surgery; and has collected \nanimal food for the pets of needy families.\n  Grace's work is an example that students all across the Nation should \nlook toward. I know she has made her school and her community proud.\n\n\n                       Leadership for Clean Water\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week was National \nDrinking Water Week. This designation is to highlight the importance of \ndrinking water across our Nation and the need to reinvest in the \ninfrastructure that brings tap water into our homes.\n  Quality water has been credited with vastly extending the life \nexpectancy here in the United States by eliminating the sickness from \ndiseases that are spread through drinking water, such as typhoid fever. \nWhile we have made great progress in improving water across our Nation, \nthere is always more work to be done.\n  In Congress, since 1996, the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund has \nhelped to fund public water systems and infrastructure projects in \norder to meet public health goals and to comply with Federal \nregulations. Last year alone, Congress provided $2.3 billion to the EPA \nfor local drinking water and sewer construction projects through the \nClean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds.\n  Good water is not only vital for good health, but it is also \nessential for our State's number one industry: agriculture. The \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania continues to provide substantial food, \nfiber, and energy for residents across our Nation. With this in mind, \npromoting and sustaining healthy waters and soil is essential.\n  As chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and \nForestry, with jurisdiction over Federal conservation programs that are \nadministered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the U.S. \nForest Service and forestry practices, we work to provide leadership \nand resources to promote the health of our watersheds, soils, and \nforests.\n  To help meet those needs, I was proud to work on the 2014 farm bill, \nwhich provides many positive tools for farmers and landowners. From on-\nfarm operations to estuary management, the United States Department of \nAgriculture plays an important role in\n\n[[Page H2221]]\n\nmanaging and in improving both water and soil quality. The farm bill is \nthe guiding authorization for the Department. Programs such as the \nConservation Reserve Program, or the CRP, the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, or the EQIP, and the Regional Conservation \nPartnership Program, or the RCPP, are a few of the critical ones that \ndirectly impact soil and water quality in our country and certainly in \nPennsylvania.\n  As we have seen so many times in Pennsylvania and around the country, \nonce a watershed or water source is harmed, it often takes generations \nto recover. History shows us just how important clean water is. It also \ndemonstrates how hard it is to fix a water source once it has been \ncontaminated.\n  I remain committed in Washington and certainly in my home State of \nPennsylvania to helping our professionals, volunteers, business \ncommunity, nonprofits, such as Trout Unlimited and Watershed \nAssociations, as well as academic and research institutions, such as \nPenn State, in their efforts to preserve our State's water and our \ncountry's water for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2221-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MR. SCOTT'S VISIT TO OREGON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOregon (Ms. Bonamici) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, when I travel around northwest Oregon, I \noften hear from parents who struggle to afford child care, which in \nOregon can cost as much as a year of college tuition. I hear from \npeople who can't find work because their skills don't match up with the \njobs that are available in their areas, and I hear from students who \nare overwhelmed by the cost of their college educations.\n  These are not problems without solutions. As policymakers, we should \nbe addressing the challenges our families face. It is possible to give \nevery child the opportunity to succeed, to close the achievement gap, \nto make college accessible and affordable, to expand family-friendly \nworkplace policies, and to make sure we have a 21st century workforce. \nIn fact, we can't afford to let these problems continue to hold us \nback.\n  This week, I welcomed to Oregon Mr. Scott of Virginia, the ranking \nmember of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Together we saw \nand discussed some of the struggles our working families face. We had a \nwhirlwind day that included substantive discussions about how to give \nchildren, young people, and working families the support they need to \nsucceed. We talked about how to open the doors of opportunity that are \nclosed for too many.\n  I invited Mr. Scott to Oregon because he has a remarkable record of \nstanding up for working families. On the Education and the Workforce \nCommittee, we worked together on the Every Student Succeeds Act to \nstrengthen our public schools, and on the Older Americans Act to \nsupport our growing population of older adults.\n  He has also been a leader for working families by his standing up to \nattacks on the National Labor Relations Board and by his protecting \nretirees through his support for the Department of Labor's rule to ban \nconflicts of interest in retirement advice. During his visit this week, \nI showed Mr. Scott the innovative and collaborative nature that sets \nOregon apart.\n  Oregon is a leader in addressing barriers that are faced by working \nfamilies. Last year our State legislature raised the State's minimum \nwage and passed legislation to provide workers with paid sick days to \ncare for themselves or their families.\n  At our forum on early childhood development, we discussed how this \ncountry's workplace policies have not kept up with our changing \nworkforce. Andrea Paluso from Family Forward Oregon told us that even \nthe iconic image of the Cleaver family does not accurately reflect the \ndiversity of American families.\n  In fact, Barbara Billingsley, the actress who played June Cleaver on \n``Leave It to Beaver,'' was in real life a single, working mom.\n  We heard from others about how food insecurity and hunger interfere \nwith the ability of too many children to focus in school and about how \nearly childhood education correlates to positive health outcomes and \nacademic achievement later in life.\n  I am proud of Oregon for taking so many positive steps to protect \nworking families, but these changes shouldn't be happening just for \nsome. We should be having these conversations and discussions in \nCongress as well. Our economy will be stronger and our families will be \nhealthier when we acknowledge that families need policies that work for \nthem, not against them. We need equal pay for women, good wages, paid \nleave, and affordable child care to support families in Oregon and \nacross the country.\n  Looking toward our future, I want students today to have the same \nopportunities I had. I worked my way through community college, \ncollege, and law school, and I graduated with a very manageable amount \nof student debt. Unfortunately, that opportunity is out of reach for \ntoo many of today's families.\n  Again, Oregon is a national leader. Oregon Promise, our State's free \ncommunity college plan, will help put education within reach for \nthousands of students. Oregon's leaders have recognized that the future \nof our economy relies on an educated and innovative workforce to create \nand fill the jobs of the 21st century.\n  During our visit, I introduced Mr. Scott to Fernando, who \nparticipates in the Portland Community College's very successful Future \nConnect Program. This program connects low-income, first-generation \ncollege students with financial aid resources, personalized academic \nadvising, internships and job training, and an intensive summer \norientation, all of which help them to succeed in college. This program \nis critical to Fernando, who is a DACA student, and to other first-\ngeneration college students. Fernando told us that Future Connect made \na difference, it made him feel at home in college. Oregon knows it is \nnot enough just to get students to college, but that it is important \nthat they stay there and finish their degrees. Now Fernando is off to a \n4-year university and is pursuing his plans to become a dentist.\n  I am incredibly proud of the State I represent. Congress can learn a \nlot from the Oregon spirit of innovation and collaboration. I was glad \nto show Mr. Scott the progress we have made in Oregon, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nremove the many obstacles that are holding back working families and \nthat are keeping young people from achieving their full potential, \nbecause when we open the doors of opportunity to everyone, we all \nsucceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2221-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2221-H2222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A STRONGER AMERICA OR A PATH TO ECONOMIC DISASTER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Gibbs) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, in 2009 and 2010, when the other side of the \naisle had complete control of Congress and the White House, the \nAmerican people saw what liberals would pass when given free rein and a \nblank check.\n  With Dodd-Frank, Democrats deemed it necessary to punish small \ncommunity banks with burdensome regulations they cannot afford to \ncomply with. Dodd-Frank created a new, unaccountable bureaucracy called \nthe CFPB, which is funded in a way that obscures its transparency and \nprevents Congress' direct oversight of the agency. The lack of \naccountability like that seen with the CFPB and the heavy hand of \nagencies like the EPA and the IRS have become hallmarks of this \nadministration.\n  With the stimulus bill, Democrats gave handouts to their union and \nso-called green energy friends. Taxpayers were on the hook for loan \nguarantees to companies like Solyndra, which used its political \nconnections in the White House to push through irresponsible loan \napprovals. When Solyndra went bankrupt, it was at the cost of the \nAmerican people. Many other smaller boondoggles came out of the \nstimulus: silly studies on ducks, over $1 million on road signs that \npromote the stimulus, and over $3 million for a tunnel for turtles in \nFlorida.\n  This leaves ObamaCare. Too many Americans have felt the negative \nconsequences of what boils down to a government takeover of the \nhealthcare industry. The President claimed this law would decrease \npremiums by $2,500 per\n\n[[Page H2222]]\n\nyear. Instead, they have risen since ObamaCare has been enacted. To go \nwith the increase in cost, many Americans have seen a sharp decrease in \ntheir choices. There are fewer plans available, restricting the ability \nof hardworking families to choose coverage that is appropriate for \ntheir circumstances.\n  Taken together, this trio of liberal policies is adding layers of \nbureaucratic red tape, forcing Americans to pay more for health care \nand putting taxpayers on the hook.\n  In 2009, Democrats used the blank check to add $1.5 trillion in \ndiscretionary spending. When Republicans gained control of the House of \nRepresentatives in 2011, we put discretionary spending on a downward \ntrend. Discretionary spending funds our Federal agencies such as the \nEPA and the IRS, as well as the Department of Defense. We have made \nreal cuts in spending, not slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts \ndown the road--honest-to-God cuts in spending. Since I took office in \n2011, discretionary spending has been cut significantly by $434 \nbillion.\n  But this does not address mandatory spending, which is the real \ndriver of our national debt. This includes programs like food \nassistance, welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest \non our debt. Reforms are needed to ensure these programs work \nefficiently and are sustainable. Because of the way ObamaCare was \nwritten and enacted, mandatory spending also includes large portions of \nObamaCare funding. Mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue \nwith or without Congress' annual appropriations process.\n  The fact is we have to change the law. That means both Chambers of \nCongress have to pass reforms and the President has to sign them or we \nhave to override a veto. Mandatory spending accounts for three-quarters \nof all money spent by the Federal Government. This is a 180-degree \nchange from when I was a teenager, when in 1970, mandatory spending was \nonly about a third of government spending.\n  Realistically, there is only one path to a balanced budget and \nshrinking our national debt. That path is to pass a budget and use a \nprocess called reconciliation. A budget facilitates reconciliation, \nwhich only requires a 51-vote majority in the United States Senate and \navoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up \nAmerica's credit card. Not doing a budget forfeits the opportunity to \ndo reconciliation. Reconciliation with mandatory spending program \nreforms, coupled with real tax and regulatory reforms, will send a \nstrong signal to our entrepreneurs and businesses, which will unleash \ninnovation and the American spirit and will, thus, grow our economy and \nprovide for our national defense. A vibrant economy will provide for \nour national security and priorities without raising taxes.\n  We have an opportunity with a new President next year to send two \nreconciliation bills to his desk--one for this fiscal year and another \nfor the next fiscal year. Elections do matter, and this one has \nhistoric implications--one being a path to a stronger America and \nopportunity for every American or a path on a downward spiral of \neconomic disaster, risking our personal and economic freedoms. God help \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2222-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2222-H2223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMERICA IS SADDLED WITH BAD TRADE DEALS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, how does America get saddled with these bad \ntrade deals?\n  If we look at our free trade agreements, we see a 425 percent \nincrease in our trade deficit with those FTA countries. You get that \nstatistic if you include NAFTA, which, of course, is the granddaddy of \nall of our free trade deals, and that doesn't even count our worst \ndeal, which was granting most favored nation status to China.\n  So how do we end up with such bad deals?\n  First, the elites convince themselves that it is good for the \ncountry. They do this because they love the theory of the economic \ntextbook and don't feel comfortable looking at the practice of how \nbusiness actually works.\n  Second, the elites benefit from these deals. These deals help \neconomists and Wall Street and attorneys, so they convince themselves \nthat they are good for the country as a whole and create a subcultural \necho chamber in which it is a subcultural norm that all smart people \nrealize that these are good trade deals. In having convinced themselves \nto support these deals, they use a combination of condescension, false \nappeals to patriotism, and sneaky tactics to saddle the American people \nwith these trade deals.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Take a look at the effect on working families. America needs a raise. \nTo get it, we need a severe labor shortage. We would have millions of \nadditional jobs, a desperate labor shortage, if only we had balanced \ntrade with the world.\n  Let's look at TPP and its inclusion of Vietnam. We were told that the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership will give us free access to the Vietnamese \nmarket. There is only one problem: in Vietnam, there is no freedom and \nthere is no market. In fact, we will not have access except as the \nCommunist Party of Vietnam decides to grant it on the basis of crony \ncapitalism, but our workers are going to have to compete against 40-\ncent-an-hour Vietnamese labor.\n  Now, we are told that in Vietnam, under this deal, it won't be \nillegal to organize a union. They won't put you in jail for organizing \na union. What they will do is they will plant drugs on every union \nactivist and arrest them for that. You are not going to see free unions \nin Vietnam, and that will hurt working families in the U.S.\n  So how do they sell it? They claim that it may take jobs away, but it \nis a necessary sacrifice because we have to contain China. As the \nranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, I am here to \ntell you the TPP is great for China.\n  First, we are told, well, we get to write the rules. No. These are \nWall Street's rules. They are not the rules of the American working \nfamily.\n  Second, TPP enshrines the idea that currency manipulation is just \nfine. So China gets the single most important change in the rules of \ninternational trade.\n  Finally and most obscurely, there are the rules of origin. Now we \nknow that, under this deal, goods that are made in Vietnam or Japan \ncome right in to the United States with no tariffs. What you don't know \nis the goods that are 50, 60 percent, 70 percent made in China then go \nto Vietnam or Japan where they can put a made-in-Japan sticker on it \nand send it to the United States--that is when they admit that it is 50 \nor 60 percent made in China.\n  As a CPA, I will tell you, if you are in a position to admit that \nyour goods are 60 percent made in China, that means they can be 90 \npercent made in China. So China gets to fast-track their goods into the \nUnited States, no tariffs, and we get no access to the Chinese markets. \nSo it is a really bad deal.\n  How do you pass it? You use sneaky tactics. They don't have the votes \nto pass it now. The American people would rise in opposition to try to \npass it now. So they are going to wait for the lame duck and then have \na group of retiring Members of this body shaft the American people with \nthe TPP.\n  We do have a solution. We need to get all three remaining \nPresidential candidates to declare, if sneaky tactics and lame duck \nsessions are used to impose TPP on America, that they will, in their \nfirst month in office, pull us back out of TPP. Unless we hear that \nclearly from the three Presidential candidates, all of whom oppose TPP, \nthat they not only oppose it, but they will erase anything that happens \nin a lame duck session, then the elites will prevail. We will lose jobs \nagain. Our workers will have to compete with 40-cent-an-hour labor. \nChinese goods will be fast-tracked into the United States with ``Made \nin Japan'' and ``Made in Vietnam'' stickers on them.\n  It is time for the Presidential candidates to go beyond saying they \nare against it. They have to declare that they will make sure that any \nlame duck approval of TPP that happens in December will be erased the \nfollowing January.\n\n[[Page H2223]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2223-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                          HEROIN OPIOID CRISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, the growing heroin and opioid crisis has \nespecially hit home in my district in Suffolk County, New York. There \nwas a 2015 report issued in New York State that showed that, out of all \n62 counties in New York, it was my home county that was hit the hardest \nby the rise of heroin and opioid abuse. We had the highest number of \nheroin-related overdose deaths of any county in New York.\n  As a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic, I have spoken with affected families directly. Addiction is a \ntruly devastating disease that shatters lives, families, and \ncommunities. It is a disease that only continues to spread at rapid \nrates, and more can and must be done to counteract the damage it has \ndone and prevent its rapid advancement.\n  Working closely with my local community, I have been pursuing a more \nlocalized solution to address this crisis. Hosting multiple drug task \nforce roundtables in Suffolk County, I have been able to bring together \nlocal elected officials, law enforcement, health professionals, \ncommunity groups, parents, concerned residents, and those in recovery \nto discuss various ways that we can work together to combat this \nepidemic. Over the past year, working with both local residents and my \ncolleagues in Congress, I have been pushing to advance legislation in \nthe House that would help provide us with the resources we need to end \nthe growing epidemic crisis on Long Island.\n  Just last week, joined by my local community, I was proud to announce \nthat there has been progress made to pass several important bills this \nweek aimed at improving and increasing access to treatment, \nenforcement, and education. The House is now passing many of these \ncritically important measures over the course of the next few days.\n  While I have been dedicating the most amount of my time advocating \nfor the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, \nH.R. 593, many other important proposals are also moving forward.\n  One other bill that I cosponsor is H.R. 4641, which will be passing \ntoday, which would improve the guidelines for prescribing opioids and \npain medication by creating a Federal interagency and stakeholder task \nforce that would review, modify, and update best practices for pain \nmanagement in prescribing pain medication. While there are many \nlegitimate reasons and needs for some to be treated with pain \nmedication, those highly addictive pills pose a serious risk. This \ncritical bill would help ensure that all parties, from prescribers to \npatients, have access to the most up-to-date information so that lawful \nprescription use does not become addicting.\n  Just a few of the other bills include the Examining Opioid Treatment \nInfrastructure Act of 2016, H.R. 4982, which would require Congress \nreceive a report on substance abuse treatment availability and \ninfrastructure needs in the U.S., and legislation that would task a \nFederal agency to create a plan on how to deal with the opioid and \nheroin epidemic, H.R. 4976.\n  Legislation is passing to help stop the flow of illegal narcotics \ninto our country, to keep drugs out of our communities and off our \nstreets, such as legislation to help law enforcement officials identify \nand target drug traffickers, H.R. 3380, and to allow for easier \nprosecution of these criminals, H.R. 4985.\n  There is not one piece of legislation that will completely solve this \noverwhelming crisis, but finally Congress is taking a big step forward \nin the fight against drug abuse. We must always do everything in our \npower to provide our local communities with the resources necessary to \nhelp stop and prevent drug abuse through treatment, enforcement, and \neducation, which is why I will continue pushing these efforts in the \nHouse.\n  I have spoken to parents of those recovering, parents of those who \nare unfortunately lost. It is impacting lives. It is devastating \nfamilies.\n  Have a conversation in each of our districts, all 435 congressional \ndistricts, and we all hear the story all too often. It is not any race, \ngender, or socioeconomic status. It is not one particular school \ndistrict. It is impacting all of our children.\n  As the father of two 9-year-old girls, I visited their class last \nweek. I think of their generation, and it is important that this \ngeneration in Congress today does everything in our power this week and \nbeyond to combat this epidemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2223-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2223-H2224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WALLACE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SELMA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to a \nhidden jewel in Alabama's Seventh Congressional District: Wallace \nCommunity College Selma. Wallace Community College Selma is a stellar \n2-year institution that provides incredible educational opportunities \nto the students of Dallas County and across the Black Belt of Alabama.\n  Now, more than ever, America needs greater innovation in our \neducational system to meet the demanding needs of tomorrow. Outstanding \nhigher education institutes in the State of Alabama are producing some \nof our State's and our Nation's best and brightest who will lead us \ninto the next era of American innovation.\n  Wallace Community College Selma is leading that charge in my district \nthrough its dual enrollment program, which allows high school students \nto complete college courses and graduate with a high school diploma as \nwell as an associate degree from this junior college.\n  In 2008, Wallace Community College Selma graduated 31 students from \nthe Selma Early College High School, which was the first of its kind on \na college campus in the State of Alabama. The 2016 graduating class \nwill include 22 dual enrollment students, including 20 students that \nparticipated in a special partnership with Tuskegee University.\n  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute program with Tuskegee allowed \nWallace Community College Selma to increase the participation of \nunderrepresented minority students from Alabama's Black Belt counties \nin the important fields of science and research. This dual enrollment \nprogram with Tuskegee offers high school students an opportunity to \ntake classes at Wallace Community College Selma as well as Tuskegee, \nand to graduate with their high school diploma as well as an associate \ndegree in science.\n  Mr. Speaker, the dual enrollment program at Wallace Community College \nSelma is accomplishing what it set out to do: to give Dallas County \nhigh school students a head start in college. The benefits of this \nimportant opportunity are immeasurable: cutting the cost and the time \nspent in college while providing high school students significant \nexposure to the types of classes and fields of interest that will give \nthem an important advantage and jump start on their peers.\n  Collaborations like these are so critically important to our youth \ngaining important and invaluable educational experience while obtaining \ncollege credit through dual enrollment. America must encourage more of \nthese types of programs as we seek to lead the world in educating our \npeople and attracting new generations of high-tech and high-paying \njobs.\n  As a Member of Congress for the Seventh Congressional District, I \ntake great pride in working to offer solutions that will help lay the \nfoundation for creating better paying jobs and for our educational \nsystem to thrive in the future. I am so proud to acknowledge today the \ntremendous efforts and the outstanding programs offered at Wallace \nCommunity College Selma which exemplify the invaluable role our 2-year \ncolleges play in our communities.\n  This college's leadership and innovation in creating a 21st century \nlearning environment is to be commended--what a jewel to have serving \nthe students of the Black Belt of Alabama.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Firefighter \nRichard Sheltra of the Pineville Volunteer Fire Department.\n  Firefighter Sheltra died a hero while battling a fire on April 30, \nbut he was a hero long before he volunteered to step into that burning \nbuilding.\n  Firefighter Sheltra had service in his blood. He had great examples \nbecause his parents were also volunteer firefighters, all dedicated \nChristians attending Forest Hill Church.\n  Whenever the call went out, Firefighter Sheltra dropped whatever he \nwas doing to go help. So strong was his commitment to serve and protect \nthe families involved that he was often first on the scene.\n  Firefighter Sheltra was Pineville's Rookie of the Year in 2015. He \nwas in the process of applying to the Charlotte Fire Department when he \ndied at the age of 20.\n  While Mr. Sheltra was an excellent firefighter, he was an even \ngreater servant of God. Please join me in praying for Firefighter \nSheltra's family and the Pineville Volunteer Fire Department during \nthis time of immense grief and, also, asking God to protect all of the \nbrave men and women who serve our communities each and every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2224-8", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNITED STATES' RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER\n\n  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. QUIGLEY.

It was a powerful, moving, and emotional moment.\n  I am not sure one can begin to understand the devastation of the \nHolocaust until you have stood in Dachau or Auschwitz or heard stories \nfrom survivors themselves that seem too horrific to be real.\n  The United States' relationship with Israel is more important than \never. No matter what other threats we face, the United States and \nIsrael must remain the closest of friends and continue to work together \nto ensure the security of our trusted ally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2224-9", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2224-H2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING KANE COUNTY OFFICER OF THE YEAR DEAN TUCKER\n\n  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Officer Dean \nTucker on being named Kane County's Officer of the Year for saving the \nlife of a 7-year-old girl.\n  Last June Officer Tucker responded to reports of an early-morning \ntwo-car collision. Upon arrival, witnesses alerted him to an SUV \nbelieved to be submerged at the bottom of a retention pond. Surveying \nthe scene from the shoreline, Tucker spotted 7-year-old Monserrat \nAlanis Ramirez 40 yards away, flailing on the surface.\n  Acting decisively, Officer Tucker quickly removed his gear, dove into \nthe water, and wrapped his arms around the girl to keep her afloat. \nFatigue quickly set in and Tucker called out to a fellow Aurora police \nofficer, David Bliss, and a passerby for help. The passerby provided \nsupport, swimming alongside Tucker, while Officer Bliss waded in and \npulled Tucker and the girl to safety.\n  Tragically, Monserrat's mother and brother did not survive. However, \nthe brave actions of Officer Tucker prevented further loss of life. We \nsalute his selfless courage.\n\n[[Page H2225]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2225-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAKING ADDICTION TO OPIOIDS\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4981, the Opioid \nUse Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act.\n  Like the TREAT Act, which I introduced, this bill would allow \nqualified physician assistants and nurse practitioners to prescribe the \nmedical treatment patients need to break their addiction to opioids. \nUtilizing these healthcare professionals is crucial to combat this \nepidemic, especially in medically underserved areas.\n  The bill would also increase the number of patients that physicians \ncan prescribe Suboxone to from 100 to 250 per year. This is a step in \nthe right direction. But there is no cap on the prescription of \nopioids, and it is counterproductive to cap treatment for opioid \naddiction.\n  The TREAT Act would eliminate this cap. The Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor & Pensions has reported out a version with an \nannual cap of 500 patients. I urge my colleagues to support the Senate \nposition so that more Americans can access this lifesaving treatment.\n  I thank the sponsors of this bill, Mr. Bucshon and Mr. Tonko, and the \nSenate sponsor of the TREAT Act, Ed Markey, for their work on this \nimportant initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2225-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National \nPolice Week, a week we set aside to thank the 780,000 police officers \nwho put on a badge nationwide and risk their lives to protect our \ncommunities.\n  We thank them for their brave service. Our police officers play an \nessential role in our community, working to keep us safe, upholding the \nrule of law, and responding to emergencies. The 18th District of \nIllinois is home to many upstanding, honorable, courageous, and self-\nsacrificing police officers.\n  Mr. Speaker, we also take time this week to mourn the loss of our \nfallen officers whose lives were lost in the line of duty. On average, \none law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in \nthe United States every 61 hours.\n  That is why I am proud to support a measure on the floor this week to \nextend the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program through fiscal \nyear 2020. We need to ensure our officers have the necessary equipment \nto keep them safe.\n  Just this winter South Jacksonville, Illinois, in my district grieved \nthe loss of one of its very own police officers in the line of duty.\n  I also want to take this time to thank the support network that \nsupports our police officers, their parents, wives, husbands, and \nchildren, for the sacrifices they make when their loved ones serve as \npolice officers.\n  Let us show our men and women who wear the badge how much we value \ntheir crucial work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2225-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OPIOID AND HEROIN EPIDEMIC\n\n  (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to highlight the crucial \nimportance of addressing the heroin epidemic that is sweeping across \nthis Nation.\n  I have been holding a series of regional briefings in my home State \nof New Hampshire to hear firsthand from communities working to fight \nthis crisis. I have heard from far too many families who have lost \nloved ones to this epidemic because no treatment options were \navailable.\n  In the fall of 2014, a high school French teacher in one of my towns \nwho was beloved by her students died of an overdose, in part, because \nshe could not get access to the treatment she needed.\n  And my good friend, Kriss Blevens, lost her stepdaughter, Amber, to \naddiction when no treatment beds were available.\n  This is simply unacceptable. We need to take action now to fight back \nagainst this epidemic and arm our communities with the resources to \nhelp individuals struggling to overcome the devastating pull of \naddiction.\n  I am a cofounder of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic. We recently announced a package of 15 bills. I urge my fellow \nmembers to pass these bills this week. Let's help American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2225-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WHITE HOUSE DECEPTION ON IRAN ARMS DEAL\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend The New York Times \npublished a disturbing story about the Obama administration's efforts \nto manipulate press coverage of the Iran deal.\n  When the deal was signed last year, many of my colleagues and I \nwarned that Iran could not be trusted to follow these temporary \nrestrictions on their nuclear weapons program, but key staffers in the \nWhite House worked to create an echo chamber for their false claims \nabout the Iran deal.\n  The Obama administration spun a concocted story about a moderate \nregime coming to power in Iran that was suddenly willing to change \ntheir approach to their pursuit of nuclear weapons and their \nrelationship with the rest of the world.\n  As it turns out, the administration had already begun talks with Iran \nwell before new President Rouhani took office. Iran already knew how \ndesperate President Obama was to sign this or any deal which allowed \nthem to extract several key concessions. The deal only provides \ntemporary restrictions on Iran's nuclear weapons program while giving \nIran permanent relief from sanctions.\n  Meanwhile, Iran will continue to support terrorism and further \ndestabilize the region as well as violate the missile test program in \nthe agreement.\n  The Obama administration's misleading campaign to convince the \nAmerican people to support the Iran deal has dangerous consequences for \nus deceiving the public and their trust in government as well as \nputting our allies around the world, such as Israel, in danger and that \ntrust as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2225-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEAD CONTAMINATION\n\n  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, it is not a new problem. Lead in school \ndrinking water has been a problem in communities across this Nation for \nyears. So why isn't there more outrage and talk about it among my \ncolleagues?\n  Even Chris Christie has ordered lead testing in New Jersey public \nschools. When New Jersey's Governor starts to admit that there is a \nproblem that demands government action, you know the situation must be \ndire.\n  No child takes a drink from a water fountain in school and thinks \nabout whether the water is contaminated or not. It is our job to \nprotect our children, and that means ensuring the safety of school \ndrinking water.\n  Congress should pass and the President should sign my TEST for Lead \nAct. The bill requires States to help schools establish programs to \ntest for lead in the drinking water if those States receive Federal \nfunding for safe water programs. It would ensure transparency by \nrequiring disclosure of high levels of lead in schools. Most \nimportantly, it would help keep our children safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2225-6", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2225-H2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OPIOID OVERDOSES\n\n  (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I am concerned \nby the great opioid epidemic that is sweeping our Nation.\n  Every day more than 78 Americans die from opioid overdoses--78 \nAmericans. Think about that. That is more than three every hour. Nearly \n2 million Americans are addicted to or abuse opiate-based painkillers.\n  Unfortunately and, frankly, very sadly, my home State of Utah is all \ntoo\n\n[[Page H2226]]\n\nfamiliar with these statistics, as we are fifth in the Nation in the \nmost opioid-related deaths.\n  These drug addictions are destroying opportunities and are \ndevastating families and communities all across the country. We simply \nmust take steps to help alleviate this suffering.\n  I am proud to be supporting a number of bills that the House will be \ndebating and voting on this week to combat opioid abuse, legislation \nthat will lead to updated best practices for prescribers of pain \nmedication, legislation that will improve drug abuse programs, and \nlegislation that will give States and local communities more \nflexibility to attack this problem and the problems that are unique to \nthose communities.\n  I urge support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and am \npleased to see that there is bipartisan support of these much-needed \nreforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2226-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                OPIOID ADDICTION IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY\n\n  (Mr. HIMES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to tell the story of Alex \nRecupido, a troubled high school graduate of 2010, an accomplished \npianist, a kid who was known for his creativity. He had gotten his \nnursing license and had moved to Florida when prescription drugs led to \na heroin addiction and Alex died in 2014.\n  Sadly, Alex is not alone as 723 people died last year in my small \nState of Connecticut, and roughly 30,000 Americans will die this year \nof opioid addiction. By any standard, this is a national emergency.\n  At great long last, this House is acting this week on a series of \nbills to improve the training, the awareness, and the treatment that we \noffer to people who are caught in this cycle. I am concerned, though, \nMr. Speaker, that the total funds called for by all of these bills--\nabout $100 million--is completely inadequate for a national emergency.\n  At the end of the day, it is the resources, not the words, that we \nmust offer.

Mr. Speaker, last week we read a powerful story under the \nheadline: ``One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot and Killed \nThemselves.''\n  Last year, toddlers shot someone with unsecured guns at a rate of one \nper week, and we are outpacing that horrific rate this year.\n  I stand here over and over, begging for Congress to act on gun \nviolence, but today I plead for gun owners to be smart about the guns \nin their homes.\n  The groups Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety are \neducating Americans and are encouraging gun owners to secure guns in \ntheir homes and vehicles, to model responsible behavior, to ask about \nunsecured guns in other homes, to recognize the risks of teen suicides, \nand to tell their peers to be smart by sharing these simple steps to \nstop heartbreaking violence. Our society is saturated with guns. There \nare 357 million guns and there are 317 million people--the highest \nconcentration in the world.\n  As The New York Times noted, if owners do not secure these guns, they \nwill continue to end up in the hands of ``shooters who need help tying \ntheir shoelaces, too young sometimes to even say the word `gun,' killed \nby their own curiosity.''\n  Mr. Speaker, on this gun issue, let's come together, all of us, to \nsecure guns and to protect our kids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2226-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LUPUS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

These funds are aimed at forging scientific \nbreakthroughs to better understand the disease and to help patients who \nare living with lupus. Because of the advancing science, 2016 may very \nwell mark a new and exciting year in the long fight against this \nmysterious autoimmune disease.\n  Mr. Speaker, as this poster reads, ``For a future with no lupus, we \nmust know lupus.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2226-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL NURSES WEEK\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE.

Every day nurses \nencounter and overcome challenges that most of us will never face. \nHonoring the work of nurses is especially important for me on a \npersonal level as my grandmother, Lucy Cicilline, was a proud nurse at \nSaint Joseph's Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, for many years.\n  Let's honor the work of nurses by passing H.R. 2083, the bipartisan \nRegistered Nurse Safe Staffing Act, which is a bill that I am proud to \ncosponsor that will require hospitals to create staffing plans for \nnurses, establish new whistleblower protections, improve nurse \nretention, and make hospitals safer both for nurses and their patients.\n  I am honored to recognize National Nurses Week, and I thank all of \nAmerica's great nurses for all that they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2226-6", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2226-H2227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LEGACY OF HARRY WU\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, on April 26, the world lost an \nextraordinary man.\n  As a political prisoner in China for 19 years, from 1960 to 1979, \nHarry Wu endured torture, forced labor, and severe hunger. It was not \nuntil 3 years after Mao Zedong's death that Harry Wu was released.\n  His alleged crime?\n  As a 23-year-old student, Wu had criticized the Soviet invasion of \nHungary and was given, according to Wu, a life sentence of labor, \ntorture, and the teachings of Mao. After being freed, he devoted his \nlife to exposing the horrors\n\n[[Page H2227]]\n\nof the so-called reform through labor camps.\n  After moving to the United States in 1985, Wu began returning to \nChina to secretly document the labor camps, known as laogai. His work \nwas showcased both on CBS and on the BBC in the early 1990s and \ncontinued through his Laogai Research Foundation and museum in \nWashington. He testified before Congress on China's unfulfilled \npromises of reform, forced abortions and sterilizations, Internet \ncensorship, and religious repression.\n  We can honor his tremendous work by ensuring the truths he revealed \nare not forgotten and by continuing to defend human rights in China and \nacross the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2227-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr. Joseph Castro, the \npresident of Fresno State University. Dr. Castro is the president of \none of the finest universities in the Western United States. It also \nhappens to be my alma mater.\n  Since Dr. Castro has been president, it has been clear that he wants \nto make a positive difference in the lives of all students, especially \nof those who are from California's San Joaquin Valley. Over 60 percent \nof the students are the first in their families to attend a university, \nand it has over 25,000 students today.\n  This is one of the many reasons the Consul General of Mexico honored \nDr. Castro with the Ohtli Award, which is the highest award given to \nexceptional leaders who improve the lives of the Hispanic community \nabroad.\n  Dr. Castro is truly deserving of this award.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of \nNational Women's Health Week.\n  Our goal this week is to empower women to prioritize and to take \ncharge of their health. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women can \naccess preventative care for little or no cost, but there still are \nconcerning gaps in women's health.\n  One out of four women reports not visiting a doctor because of the \ncost, and nearly two out of three women in America die from chronic \ndiseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, which is why women need \nquality, affordable, and accessible health care.\n  Protecting and improving the health of American women is one of my \ntop priorities in Congress. I fought to insert language in the annual \ndefense bill to ensure that our brave servicewomen and female veterans \nhave access to adequate health services that fully address their \nspecific medical needs, including preventative care and infertility \ntreatments.\n  We have seen increasing attacks on women's health in Congress. So it \nis important, more than ever, that we ensure women's access to \ncontraception and to their constitutionally protected right to choose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2227-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jolly) laid before the House the \nfollowing communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2016.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include any extraneous material on House Resolution 720, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule \nforward today on behalf of the Rules Committee.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive \nOpioid Abuse Reduction Act of 2016, and H.R. 4641, a bill to establish \nan interagency task force to review, modify, and update best practices \nfor pain management and for prescribing pain medication.\n  For H.R. 5046, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally \ndivided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  And for H.R. 4641, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally \ndivided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  Both rules are structured rules that make in order numerous \namendments.\n  Yesterday the Rules Committee received testimony from members of the \nJudiciary Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and multiple \nother Members on their amendments. H.R. 5046 was marked up by the \nJudiciary Committee, and H.R. 4641 was reported by the Energy and \nCommerce Committee. Both bills have broad bipartisan support.\n  These bills are part of the House's effort to combat our Nation's \ngrowing opioid epidemic. They reflect a commitment to address this \ndevastating problem in a constructive and meaningful way.\n  Opioid abuse hits communities all across this country, rich and poor, \nrural, suburban, and urban, and it takes a major toll. In 2012, an \nestimated 2.1 million in the United States were suffering from \nsubstance abuse disorders related to prescription opioid pain \nrelievers. An estimated 467,000 people were addicted to heroin.\n  In the same year, in Georgia, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation \nfound that prescription drugs played a role in 592 deaths in 152 of 159 \ncounties for which autopsies were performed.\n  Mr. Speaker, just the other day I was having coffee with a dear \nfriend of mine who I have known for 20 years. As we were talking and I \nmentioned what we were doing here, he brought forth that just in the \nlast little bit in his own family life he has seen relatives that have \nbeen touched by this epidemic of painkillers and substance abuse \nissues. This is something that can affect anyone in any family, and \nthis is why we are here today.\n  The bills before us today take steps to combat the opioid epidemic \nand drug addiction.\n  H.R. 5046, introduced by Mr. Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin, \nestablishes a comprehensive opioid abuse grant program. The program \nencompasses new and existing Department of Justice programs, including \ntraining for first responders, law enforcement, drug courts, \nresidential substance abuse treatment, and criminal investigations for \nthe unlawful distribution of opioids.\n  Importantly, this bill provides flexibility for the States to use the \nfunds where they are needed most. It does so by establishing one grant \nprogram that has numerous allowable uses. The bill also ensures that \nthere isn't duplication and eliminates redundancy.\n  I was proud to support this bill at the Judiciary Committee.\n  H.R. 4641, introduced by Congresswoman Susan Brooks of Indiana, \nestablishes a pain management best practices interagency task force. \nThis task force will include representatives from Federal agencies, \nstate medical boards, healthcare professionals, experts from addiction \nrecovery communities, and others knowledgeable in the field.\n  The task force will be responsible for reviewing and updating best \npractices for acute and chronic pain management in an evidence-based \nmanner. It will also be responsible for sharing the information found \nwith healthcare professionals. This bill recognizes that responses to \nthe opioid epidemic need to be coordinated and thoughtful.\n  Addiction is happening far too often with devastating consequences. \nFurther, it is shown that prescription opioid abuse often leads to \nheroin abuse--and the sheriffs in my part of my State can attest to \nthis every day--compounding this problem.\n  In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control, 45 percent of \npeople who used heroin were addicted to prescription opioid \npainkillers.\n  Heroin has frequently been thought of as an inner-city problem, but \nwe are starting to see it more and more outside of cities and spreading \nto rural areas, too. This problem is a problem for America. This \nproblem has exploded.\n  According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, heroin deaths have \nincreased in Georgia by 300 percent. That is an astonishing and very \ntragic statistic.\n  CDC statistics on opioid abuse show 18,893 overdose deaths related to \nprescription pain relievers and 10,574 overdose deaths related to \nheroin in 2014. Those are staggering numbers.\n  The opioid epidemic affects everyone, and I believe that most people \ncould tell you of a family member or friend who has suffered in some \nway because of this problem.\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, it affects babies who are born addicted to opioids \nand other drugs. These children, through no fault of their own, are \nborn with a serious and heartbreaking problem. They then go through \ndangerous withdrawals and can be left with lasting health consequences. \nWe have to find a way to stop this.\n  The opioid epidemic affects veterans, whose battle scars are treated \nby a VA whose answer too often is to prescribe high quantities of \nopioids with little thought to the consequences.\n  I am a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve. I served in \nIraq. I saw firsthand the scars that the battlefield can leave, both \nphysical and mental. We need a support system for our veterans. We need \nto address their pain. We need to ensure that they have an avenue to \nget the help they need.\n  I believe that the bills that this rule provides for will take the \nsteps to make that happen. Our veterans deserve our very best.\n  Addiction issues are often related to other co-occurring disorders, \nincluding mental health issues. Addiction claims victims, and addiction \nis a disease.\n\n[[Page H2229]]\n\n  We must not turn a blind eye to those in need. We must work to halt \nthe opioid epidemic, and we must act to prevent more deaths and to stop \nthe growth and spread of the problem. Today's bills are a step toward \ndoing that, and I am glad that we have the opportunity to discuss those \nin an open manner.\n  These bills are brought forward due to the hard work of many Members. \nIn particular, I thank Chairmen Goodlatte and Upton, Ranking Members \nConyers and Pallone, Congresswoman Brooks, Congressman Sensenbrenner, \nand their staffs for their work in bringing these important reforms \ntogether. These reforms are a step in the right direction.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nCollins) for the customary 30 minutes.\n  I rise to speak on the rule for consideration of H.R. 5046, the \nComprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, and H.R. 4641, a bill to \nprovide for the establishment of an interagency task force to review, \nmodify, and update best practices for pain management and prescribing \npain medication, and for other purposes.\n  By the end of this week, the House will have taken up a total of 17 \nbipartisan opiate-related bills, each a critical measure to help us \ntackle the opioid crisis in a variety of ways as we work to end this \nscourge hurting so many communities across our country and costing the \nlives of so many all across this country.\n  I am pleased that the House will be considering this critical \nbipartisan legislation this week. But in all honesty, I am also very \nconcerned that Republicans are not proposing the new funding that is \nnecessary to meaningfully address the opioid crisis.\n  So, in addition to passing the bipartisan legislation on the floor \nthis week, which authorizes a new grant program, we must also provide \nreal, new resources in the form of appropriations to ensure that the \ninitiatives in this legislation can be fully implemented.\n  If we don't do that, all the speeches that we will give this week \nwill amount to empty rhetoric. We need to make sure we fund these \npriorities. This is an emergency.\n  Opiate addiction is inflicting a savage daily toll in neighborhoods \nacross America. According to the CDC, 78 Americans die from an opiate \noverdose every day, and many of them are young people. In 2013, the \nnumber of heroin users was 681,000, an increase of more than 250,000 \nusers since 2002. This crisis is affecting every region across the \ncountry and every demographic group.\n  I have long said that Congress must provide the meaningful resources \nthat are needed to make a difference and save lives. Today I am pleased \nthat we are coming together and taking action to attempt to do just \nthat. These are important first steps.\n  In New England, we know all too well the terrible toll of the opiate \nepidemic. Having seen the damage it has done to the communities that I \nrepresent in central and western Massachusetts, tackling the opiate \nepidemic has long been a top priority for me.\n  Across Massachusetts, the number of opiate overdose deaths climbed by \nnearly 10 percent, up from 1,228 in 2014 to 1,379 in 2015. Once all \ncases are finalized by the medical officials in Massachusetts, it is \nestimated that there will be an additional 63 to 85 deaths for 2014 and \n118 to 179 deaths in 2015.\n  In Worcester County alone, home to the second largest city in New \nEngland, opiate-related deaths jumped from 163 in 2014 to 177 in 2015. \nLooking back at the last 16 years, we can see an even bigger increase. \nIn 2000, there were 59 opiate-related overdose deaths in Worcester \nCounty, a small fraction of the 1,289 deaths in 2015.\n  Most of last year's victims were between the ages of 25 and 44, in \nthe prime of their lives with so much to live for. Many left behind \nfamilies heartbroken and devastated by these senseless deaths. These \nfamilies included husbands, wives, children, and so many more who loved \nthem and desperately wanted them to get the help that they needed and \nto be able to live.\n  The opiate epidemic is even harder to cope with for those who have \nseen young people lose their lives to addiction. In Shrewsbury, \nMassachusetts, one high school principal said that, in the 11 years he \nhas been principal, he has known of 33 students who have been active \nheroin addicts and 7 of them died. And in a recent forum, he learned \nthat there had been even more that he had not known about.\n  Part of the problem is the stigma associated with heroin use. I think \na lot of us think we know what heroin use and addiction looks like, but \nthe reality is it can take hold of anyone, including our neighbors, our \nfriends, and even our own family members.\n  However, instead of giving in to despair, communities in \nMassachusetts and across the country are responding to the opiate \nepidemic with strength and with courage. They are helping to lead \ngrassroots State and national coalitions to raise awareness and educate \npeople about the crisis and provide resources to help those ensnared by \nthe addiction.\n  The Central Massachusetts Opiate Task Force, chaired by Worcester \nCounty District Attorney Joe Early, is a great example of this. They \nare working to bring greater awareness of the problem to residents. \nMembers of the task force attend many of the coalition forums and also \ngo into schools to talk to students directly.\n  The opiate task force serving Franklin County and the North Quabbin \nRegion in Massachusetts is another example. It is co-chaired by John \nMerrigan, Franklin County Register of Probate; Chris Donelan, the \nFranklin County Sheriff; and David Sullivan, the Northwestern District \nAttorney.\n  I am so thankful for these and other task forces and coalitions in \nMassachusetts and across the country for coming together quickly to \naddress this public health crisis and for their tenacity in fighting \nfor individuals and families struggling with addiction.\n  Just this week I had the opportunity to join community leaders at \nNorth Brookfield High School in central Massachusetts for an event with \nChris Herren, a former constituent of mine from Fall River and a former \nBoston Celtics player who now travels in New England and across the \ncountry to speak about his own recovery from addiction and the need for \nyoung people to stay drug free.\n  I am also grateful to my fellow members of the Massachusetts \ncongressional delegation for being strong partners in this fight. Joe \nKennedy is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and has been a \nleader on this issue. He is the lead Democratic sponsor of H.R. 4641. A \nnumber of amendments sponsored by Massachusetts Members were made in \norder last night, including several from Katherine Clark, as well as \namendments from Seth Moulton, Bill Keating, and Stephen Lynch.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I also want to commend the leadership of the gentlewoman from New \nHampshire (Ms. Kuster). She has been out front on this issue for a \nlong, long time, and we appreciate her leadership.\n  The simple truth is that we are not going to arrest our way out of \nthis problem. Prevention and treatment must be at the heart of our \napproach to tackling this epidemic. As part of the comprehensive \napproach called for, we must equip our young people with the skills \nnecessary to identify constructive ways to deal with problems so that \nturning to drugs is never an option.\n  We must make every effort to ensure that treatment is available to \nthose who seek it because it takes courage and strength to admit that \nyou need help. I am pleased that this legislation that we are \nconsidering this week would do just that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the legislation this rule makes in \norder, H.R. 5046. The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act would \nestablish the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program. With $103 \nmillion provided annually over 5 years, this program would help provide \nvital assistance to States and local agencies to fund treatment \nalternatives to incarceration, opioid abuse prevention, training, and \neducation.\n  The program's grants could be used to train first responders in \ncarrying and administering opioid overdose reversal drugs, support \nprescription drug\n\n[[Page H2230]]\n\nmonitoring programs, strengthen collaborations between criminal justice \nagencies and substance abuse systems, or for programs targeted toward \njuvenile opioid abuse programs.\n  This legislation, I think, is a commonsense, bipartisan step that \ngoes a long way toward providing the critical help that Americans \nacross this country need to combat our opioid epidemic.\n  I also support H.R. 4641, a bill that would provide for the \nestablishment of an interagency task force to review, modify, and \nupdate best practices for pain management and prescribing pain \nmedication, and for other purposes. Creating this task force is another \nkey step to help strengthen our national response to the opioid crisis \nand increase interagency collaboration as we marshal all our resources \nin this fight.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who worked \nvery hard to bring this additional bipartisan legislation to the floor \nthis week so we could begin to tackle this opioid crisis. These bills \ntake important steps to cut the risk of opioid addiction among veterans \nmanaging chronic pain, take on international drug traffickers, improve \nthe treatment and care of babies who are born addicted to opioids, help \nreduce opioid use among young people, and strengthen access to opioid \noverdose reversal medication.\n  There are many issues that Democrats and Republicans do not see eye \nto eye on, but I am pleased that both parties seem to be coming \ntogether, at least on this first step, to tackle the opioid crisis. For \nfamilies and communities across the country who have already lost so \nmuch and so many to this epidemic, there has never been a more \nimportant time for us to take action.\n  I want to thank the leaders of both parties for helping to bring \nthese bipartisan bills to the House floor. I do believe that we can end \nthe opioid crisis once and for all.\n  But again, in conclusion--and I have to stress this--we need to \nprovide the funding to our communities that are struggling to deal with \nthis opioid and heroin crisis. This is an emergency. That is how you \nhave to classify this and look at it. This is an emergency. People are \ndying. Without providing the additional resources needed, we will not \nbe part of the solution.\n  The ideas that we have compiled today that will be debated this week \nare all good ideas, but they won't be real ideas unless they are \nfunded. I worry that this Congress might not be up to the challenge. We \nhave emergencies in Flint, Michigan, with the water crisis, and we have \nnot done what we need to do to provide emergency funding to that \ncommunity. We have a growing emergency with the Zika virus, and we \ncan't get an emergency appropriations bill to the floor here today. I \nthink that we need to understand that this crisis has risen to the \nlevel of an emergency. We need to do what is right. We need to not only \npass these bills, but we need to commit in a bipartisan way that we are \ngoing to provide the necessary funding. I hope we can do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 5 minutes \nto the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5046, \nthe Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, and H.R. 4641, which will \nestablish an interagency task force to review, modify, and update best \npractices for pain management and prescription pain medication.\n  Overprescription of opioids is leading to addiction, shattering \nlives, and creating death around our country. In my home State of New \nHampshire, deadly overdoses following the abuse of heroin and opioids \nclaimed the lives of over 430 people last year alone. That is about 1 \nin every 3,000 people from my State falling victim to an epidemic, \nsuccumbing to a preventable problem. According to the CDC, overdose \ndeaths have tripled over the last 10 years.\n  Desperate families, too long, are crying out for help. I commend my \ncolleagues for rising to the occasion in this legislative response, \ntackling this issue in a bipartisan way, and making the proper \ncommitment to fund an adequate response to help those who are in need.\n  These two pieces of legislation are designed to assist those battling \nthe epidemic on the front lines, from law enforcement officers to \nunderfunded recovery systems and personnel, and everyone in between. I \nam moved time and time again by the painful stories of the victims and \ncourageous individuals coming to their aid, and I urge the House to \noffer its support in this struggle.\n  I was pleased that just last night the Committee on Rules accepted my \namendment, allowing prevention and recovery programs to accept grant \nmoney authorized by the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment when it comes to the House \nfloor tomorrow.\n\n  As the House response to the Senate-passed Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act, these bills are a joint step toward progress and \nsafety. I am a proud sponsor of many of these bills coming to the floor \nthis week, and I hope for their swift and timely passage as urgent \nrelief for those who are suffering around our Nation.\n  We must provide a thorough and wide-ranging plan to meet the enormity \nof this terrible epidemic, which invades every corner of the United \nStates, takes lives across traditional divides, and manifests itself in \nways to which we are not accustomed.\n  My colleagues and I are committed to seeing the House of \nRepresentatives answer this challenge by passing the most vigorous and \ninclusive plan possible. I am confident we will do all that we can to \npass this plan this week, go to conference with the Senate, and put a \nbill on the President's desk before June.\n  Our plan is urgently needed. Almost 130 people die every day from \nopioid overdoses. Eighty percent of the opioids prescribed worldwide \nare prescribed here in the United States. In my district and around the \ncountry, I hear from families and friends who know someone coping with \nsubstance use disorder.\n  We will only make a dent in this great challenge by listening to its \nvictims. We need to listen to fathers like Doug Griffin of Newton, New \nHampshire. His daughter Courtney fell victim to heroin abuse at 20 \nyears old.\n  Doug remembers Courtney as a vivacious girl, funny, passionate, and \ncharming. She loved music and s'mores and told Doug she planned to \nbecome a marine, a beautiful young woman prepared to sacrifice for her \ncountry in one of its greatest and most honorable services. That was \nCourtney.\n  But 3 years later, she was lost on the streets, overwhelmed by the \nsorrow and confusion this epidemic instills, moving from rehab facility \nto rehab facility. Prescription pills, fentanyl, and street heroin \nensnared Courtney in a fatal web of addiction, and she lost the will to \nlive. Courtney was a 20-year-old girl--20 years old--a neighbor, a \nfriend, a daughter. How can we begin to comprehend the depth of that \nkind of tragedy?\n  Because Courtney's pain was so great and because she had so few \noptions for treatment, Doug says he and his family hid the truth from \nthe outside world. To help others, they are speaking out now; and by \nspeaking out and listening, we start to understand this tragedy. Doug \nis courageously telling everyone he knows the warning signs of heroin \nabuse and the deficiencies in our public response. Millions of \nAmericans share Courtney's story and Doug's anguish. It is only by \nspeaking out and sharing grief that we will remove the stigma \npreventing far too many from seeking help.\n\n  This week, during Heroin and Opioid Abuse Awareness Week, we have an \nopportunity to hear, learn, share, and fight back. We can hear the \nstories of grieving and resolute families, the stories of resilient \nvictims. We can learn of the intensity of their experiences and glean \nfrom them the lessons we need to fight back. We can share their lessons \nand bring them to bear in our discourse and through our legislation, \nand we can start to turn the tide.\n  As the House considers this vital legislation, I encourage my \ncolleagues to listen to their constituents, hear their stories, share \ntheir struggles, and help them fight back.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I think that every Member of this House should \nsupport the underlying legislation.\n\n[[Page H2231]]\n\nThere will be some good amendments offered. Unfortunately, there were a \nlot of good amendments that were not made in order by the Committee on \nRules last night. There will be some suspensions that will come to the \nfloor that I think deserve our support. And I am anxious to go to \nconference with the Senate, anxious to put a bill on the President's \ndesk.\n  I don't want to spoil this bipartisan moment, but none of this means \nanything if we don't fund it. These aren't appropriations bills that we \nare dealing with. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsaid, well, we will deal with that in the appropriations process. Well, \nbecause of the dysfunction of this place, we are not going to deal with \nthe appropriations bills in any real way until after the election. I \ndon't think we can wait. I think we need an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to deal right now with this crisis that has already \nclaimed so many lives.\n  Let's all come together and pass these authorizing bills, but we need \nto do more than that. The President has requested $1.1 billion, I \nthink, to try to help provide resources to communities to deal with \nthis crisis. We haven't funded that. So bills that set up grant \nprograms that we all support, initiatives that we all think are \nimportant, that is good; but if the money is not there to actually fund \nthese and implement these programs, then we are not doing our job. I \nwould just argue that we have waited too long. It is an emergency. We \nought to do this, and we ought to have an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill on the floor immediately and get relief to our \ncommunities today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support all these measures that the House will \nconsider this week; however, as I said, they can't be the final word. \nWe have to approve additional funding to develop a comprehensive \nresponse to this epidemic, which is an emergency. I am going to ask my \ncolleagues to defeat the previous question. If we defeat the previous \nquestion, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation \nthat provides $600 million in funding to address the opioid epidemic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), a leader on this issue, to \ndiscuss our proposal.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for the bipartisan \nwork that is happening this week.\n  I am proud to be a co-chair with the gentleman from New Hampshire \n(Mr. Guinta) of the Bipartisan Taskforce to Combat the Heroin Epidemic, \nMembers of Congress from all across the country coming together to \naddress this crisis.\n  I rise, however, to oppose the rule and, as Mr. McGovern has said, we \nintend to move the previous question. I am bringing to the House floor \na Democratic substitute opioids package to include $600 million in \ncritical funding to address this opioid epidemic.\n  We have an emergency. People are dying, as Mr. Guinta said--in my own \nState, our State of New Hampshire, over 420 people in 1 year. We have a \nbetter chance in New Hampshire of dying from an opioid epidemic death \nfrom fentanyl, from heroin, from drugs off the street, than we do of \ndying in a car accident. This is an emergency, and it is a crisis.\n  My substitute bill will provide vital funding for all of the bills \nthat we are discussing, for bills that will provide the grants the \nCommittee on the Judiciary has brought forth in H.R. 5046, introduced \nby Mr. Sensenbrenner, for law enforcement, for drug courts.\n  I have just this week been to the graduation of a drug court. We can \nturn lives around, but we need funding for drug courts to spread all \nacross our country, for the good work that my colleagues, the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), put into the Energy and Commerce bill, \nH.R. 4641, to create the task force.\n  Mr. Guinta and I had an original bill, the STOP ABUSE Act, that \ncreated a task force, and we are so pleased that that task force will \nmove forward. We need to bring together the experts to determine why \nnow, what is happening in our society that opioid overdoses are leading \npeople, leading this addiction, this substance use disorder that is a \ndisease, leading people to go from prescribed medication from their \nphysician into heroin off the streets and, in our State, is now being \nlaced with fentanyl, which is a lethal combination.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The substitute will provide a total of $600 million in vital new \nresources to address this epidemic, and my understanding is that we \nhave not included this funding in these underlying bills. We want to \nsupport the underlying bills, but it is critical to have the funding.\n  New Hampshire has now gone from number 24 in the Nation in deaths per \npopulation to number 3, seemingly overnight. I have traveled around my \ndistrict bringing together stakeholders, law enforcement, treatment \nproviders, long-term recovery, which is a critical aspect of this, \nphysicians, hospitals, police, everyone to the table. In Keene, in \nNashua, in Concord, in the north country of our State, we now have \nmayors' committees. We have the Governor having a major summit this \nweek. Here is the answer: we have solutions.\n  I serve on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I was so proud to \nbring to one of our congressional task force hearings Dr. Julie \nFranklin from the VA in White River Junction, Vermont, who is doing \ncritical frontline research with people, veterans who are experiencing \nchronic pain. This is lifelong pain. She has worked with them with \nacupuncture, with mental health treatment, with physical therapy, with \nall different kinds of wellness and yoga, and she has decreased the use \nof opiate medication by 50 percent. We can do this, but we need \nfunding.\n  I urge you to vote ``no'' on the rule. I ask my colleagues to please \nsupport the substitute package that will include a critical $600 \nmillion in funding.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Augusta, Georgia (Mr. Allen), my good friend and someone \nwho has spent a great deal of time looking into these issues. I \nappreciate his willingness to come speak on it today.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nyielding to me to speak on this important threat to our country, our \nState, and our communities.\n  Our Founders made a promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. In America today, in every State, in too many families, \nthere is a palpable undercurrent of pain, loss, and suffering that is \ncaused by this horrendous opioid crisis.\n  Sadly, nearly one in five Americans knows someone who has been \naddicted to opioids. Nearly every 12 minutes, someone in the U.S. dies \nof a drug overdose; every 25 minutes, a baby is born suffering from \nopioid withdrawal.\n  A recent CDC study found that, in 2009, more Americans died from \nprescription drugs than motor vehicle accidents, marking the first time \ndrug-related deaths have outnumbered motor vehicle-related deaths since \n1979, when the government started tracking drug-related deaths.\n  Unfortunately, my home State of Georgia is not immune to this growing \nepidemic. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, in 2012, \nprescription drugs played a role in 592 deaths in 152 of the 159 \ncounties in Georgia for which it performs autopsies.\n  These heartbreaking numbers are far too high and tragic. We must take \naction to combat this crisis so that those addicted and their loved \nones may start the road to healing. This week my colleagues and I in \nthe House of Representatives are bringing opioid addiction out of the \nshadows to stop this devastating crisis.\n  I am proud of the tireless work of my colleagues in the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Education and the \nWorkforce Committee, on which I serve, to prevent, treat, and \nstreamline access to care for those addicted to opioids.\n  My colleagues and I have worked to advance bipartisan solutions that \naddress this crisis, from helping newborns who are born into addiction \nto creating an interagency task force to update\n\n[[Page H2232]]\n\nbest practices for prescribing opioid painkillers.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mr. ALLEN. This is only the start of our work in the United States \nCongress on this important subject. The road to recovery will be long \nand hard fought, but the American spirit is as strong as ever and will \nprevail.\n  Together we will help our brothers and sisters in Christ become whole \nagain. The very soul of this country is at stake. I am pleased the \npeople's House is taking proactive steps to fight this epidemic.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule and support the numerous \nbills coming before the House this week.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we all agree that this is a crisis and that we \nneed to come up with solutions and we need to do something rather than \njust talk about it.\n  I support--and I think I speak for the Democrats--and we all support \nthe bipartisan legislation that is being brought to the floor, not only \nthe bills that are going to be considered under this rule, but many of \nthe suspension bills that will be brought to the floor this week. I \nexpect that they will be passed nearly unanimously.\n  But I think what I do have a problem with is the fact that we have \nfunded none of these things. I have a problem with the fact that some \nare content to wait until the appropriations process kind of works its \nway through this House, which, as we all know, is not going to be \nprobably until December.\n  We have already been informed that we will probably deal with an \nomnibus package sometime after the election. Because there is \ninfighting within the Republican ranks here in the House in trying to \ncome to an agreement before the election, it is just too difficult. I \nregret that very, very much because I don't think that we can wait \nuntil December before we actually fund some of these priorities that \nare in this bill.\n  The reason why I hope my colleagues will support the Democratic \nsubstitute is because it actually funds. It is an appropriation. It \nfunds these priorities. It puts our money where our rhetoric is. It \nmakes the money available now, and we know it is there and communities \nwill know that they can depend on it.\n  So I think we really want to be effective in our battle against this \nscourge of opioids and heroin addiction that has touched every district \nin this country.\n  We have all been to too many funerals. We have all seen the \nheartbreak up close and personal. But if we want to do something about \nit, we have to not only come up with the ideas, we have to fund these \nideas.\n  That is why I am urging that Members vote ``no'' on the previous \nquestion. It is so that we can bring a funding component to this. Let's \nnot wait until December. This is an emergency. We should have had an \nemergency supplemental bill. That is not coming.\n  So this is a chance to put some money behind these priorities and \nactually fund all these great ideas that we all, in a bipartisan way, \nsay we support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support all the underlying bills, but to vote \n``no'' on the previous question so we can bring this appropriations \nbill up to actually fund them. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \non the previous question and to also vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you have heard--and we have spent the last almost 40 \nminutes talking about it--the opioid epidemic is out of control, but we \nhave the opportunity today to start addressing that problem in a \nmeaningful way.\n  The rule provides for consideration of legislation that will enact \nmeasures to address this problem through multiple avenues to ensure \nthat we are taking a comprehensive approach to stopping this scourge.\n  It takes important steps to address the serious and growing threat of \nopioid abuse. It keeps a promise that we won't sit idly by while people \ncontinue the battle of addiction and die.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleague to support the rule and both \nH.R. 5046 and H.R. 4641.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 720 Offered by Mr. McGovern\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     5189) to address the opioid abuse crisis. The first reading \n     of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order \n     against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate \n     shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour \n     equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs \n     and ranking minority members of the Committees on Energy and \n     Commerce and the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 5189.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime,\n\n[[Page H2233]]\n\nand I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on \nordering the previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

Pursuant to House Resolution 720 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4641.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) to preside over \nthe Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1340\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 4641) to provide for the establishment of an inter-agency task \nforce to review, modify, and update best practices for pain management \nand prescribing pain medication, and for other purposes, with Mr. Poe \nof Texas in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this week we have and will continue to hear harrowing \nand personal stories on the House floor about how opioid addiction is \ndevastating local communities and families across the country. Just \nlast night, my colleagues shared some of their stories. The gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) shared a story about a promising \ncollegiate athlete whose star was extinguished when a minor injury led \nto an addiction and his eventual overdose and death. Ms. Kuster from \nNew Hampshire told of a constituent named Amber who tragically died of \nan overdose after a treatment bed was unavailable for her after leaving \nincarceration.\n  We are going to hear many more stories today about this epidemic that \nhas touched every community in every State of our country, an epidemic \nthat has exploded in recent years to the point where every 12 minutes \nsomeone is dying of a drug overdose in this country. By the end of this \ndebate, there may be over five people who have died of an overdose.\n  The Energy and Commerce Committee has meticulously investigated this \nepidemic over the past year with multiple hearings and expert \nwitnesses. The result is a thoughtful package of solutions focused on \nprevention and treatment that will help those facing addictions and \ntheir families deal with this opioid and, subsequently, heroin crisis. \nThe statistics couldn't be more stark.\n  The United States only represents 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, yet we consume 80 percent of the world's pain medication. \nYet 80 percent of heroin users started with a prescription to legal \npain medication. Nearly 260 million opioid prescriptions were written \nin the United States in 2012, outpacing the number of American adults \nby 20 million.\n  As we debate this crisis, this is not just about statistics, because \nwe are actually talking about husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, \nparents, and, sadly, our children. A parent who has inspired me is a \nwoman named Justin Phillips from Indianapolis, a Hoosier mom who lost \nher son, Aaron, to a heroin overdose at the age of 20.\n  Out of her heartbreak, she found a calling to keep local and national \nattention on the issue of heroin and opioid abuse, she said, ``until \nthe dying stops.'' She became a leading voice for families facing \naddiction in Indiana, and she founded Overdose Lifeline, a nonprofit \norganization devoted to purchasing those lifesaving drugs, those\n\n[[Page H2235]]\n\nreversal drugs, for Hoosier first responders. But she didn't stop \nthere.\n  She helped pass a bill at our statehouse, called Aaron's Law, to \nprovide access to overdose reversal drugs for others beyond first \nresponders. Justin is just like so many other moms and dads. She needs \nour help to prevent more kids like Aaron from being lost to heroin and \nopioid abuse.\n  Her story made me realize that solving this public health crisis, \nthis epidemic, must be a top priority for Congress and for the Federal \nGovernment, and inspired me to work with my colleague from across the \naisle, Congressman Kennedy of Massachusetts, to lead these efforts in \nthe House to combat the heroin opioid crisis.\n  This week we are taking up a series of bills that are going to make a \nreal difference--we hope. They must make a real difference in turning \nback this scourge.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Now, I have cited the number of opioid prescriptions written in 2012, \nwhich outpaces the number of American adults. But the fact is that our \nprescribers--our doctors, our nurse practitioners, our dentists, and \nothers--are often unaware that, in many cases, their efforts to \nproperly treat their patients' pain can inadvertently create longer \nterm addiction issues.\n  While there are certainly legitimate medical needs for pain \nmedication opioids, many prescribers are unaware that, in many cases, \ntheir efforts to properly treat their patients' pain can inadvertently \ncreate these long-term addiction issues.\n  In an effort to address this, the CDC recently developed guidelines \nfor prescribing opioids for chronic pain. In order to improve the way \nopioids are prescribed to patients with severe and chronic pain, these \nguidelines seek to reduce their overuse and their abuse.\n  H.R. 4641, which I introduced with Representative Kennedy, would \nensure that the CDC's opioid prescribing guidelines are reviewed, \nmodified, and updated where needed by an interagency task force and \nexpert stakeholders from the prescriber community, the patient \ncommunity, the addiction community, and the recovery community to \nreflect best practices going forward.\n  The task force will be comprised of representatives from the Federal \nrelevant agencies as well as those who deal with this problem day in \nand day out: physicians, dentists, pharmacists, hospitals, overdose \nreversal specialists, and pain and addiction researchers.\n  This task force will also include representatives from State medical \nboards, pain advocacy groups, medical professional associations, mental \nhealth and addiction treatment communities.\n  The scope and breadth of this group will ensure that the practices \nare thoughtfully reviewed, modified, and updated. They will take into \naccount the different types of opioids, opioids within and between \ndifferent classes, the availability of deterrent technology as well as \nnonpharmacological and medical device alternatives to opioids. It is \nimportant that the task force consider the broadest scope of pain \nmanagement options.\n  It is also important that this isn't just going to be another \nbureaucratic report that is compiled and sits on a shelf that is \nreviewed by congressional researchers and congressional staff. They \nmust report out to Congress, lay out best practices, and provide a \nstrategy for disseminating these best practices for pain management and \nrecommendations at medical facilities.\n  We have to do more in this country. Failure to address a major part \nof this epidemic from the outset will perpetuate the cycle of addiction \nin our communities. This is but one important step. There are many, \nmany bills that the House is considering.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4641, a bill to create an interagency task \nforce on pain management. This legislation passed the committee with \nunanimous support.\n  In 2014, pharmacies in the United States dispensed approximately 245 \nmillion prescriptions for opioids. This is enough to provide a script \nto every adult in our entire Nation.\n  At the same time, we know that over 5 million Americans use \nprescription pain relievers either recreationally or to satisfy an \nopioid addiction.\n  This combination has produced tragic results. 2014 produced the \nhighest number of drug overdose deaths than any previous year on \nrecord, with opioids and heroin driving the recent surge.\n  Unfortunately, our Nation's doctors and healthcare providers have not \nbeen provided the tools and education necessary to safely prescribe \nthese medications in the midst of an opioid epidemic.\n  Recently, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine examined \nthis topic and found that ``many physicians admit that they are not \nconfident about how to prescribe opioids safely, how to detect abuse or \nemerging addiction, or even how to discuss these issues with their \npatients.''\n  As a result, we have created a patchwork of prescribing practices \nwith tremendous variation both geographically as well as even within \nthe same field.\n  This bill would create an interagency task force on pain management \nto review, modify, and update best practices on management and \ndevelopment of a strategy to disseminate those best practices to \nprescribers, pharmacists, and other stakeholders.\n  Those best practices will increase the tools available to providers \nwho prescribe opioids more safely and be able to detect and intervene \nearlier in instances of substance use disorders.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which is \npart of the opioid epidemic package that we are moving on the floor \ntoday on suspension.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), our chairman.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, every 12 minutes someone in the U.S. dies of \na drug overdose. Abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin has \nimpacted every single community. It is an epidemic. It doesn't have \nboundaries and doesn't discriminate.\n  We have lost a lot of good kids and a lot of good people in my State \nand every State. As I travel back and forth to Michigan virtually every \nweek, I meet a family member who has lost somebody with this very \ntragic story.\n  This last week it was a mother and a wife of a fellow who had \ncommitted suicide in Mattawan, Michigan. It breaks your heart.\n  Yes, we know the numbers. They are staggering. The CDC reports that \nnearly 260 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012. That is \none for every single U.S. adult, as my friend Mr. Pallone said, with \nanother 20 million to spare.\n  A recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one in \nfive Americans say they have a family member who has been addicted to \nprescription painkillers.\n  The epidemic is unique to the U.S., as Americans consume 80 percent \nof the world's opioid prescriptions. It is not unique. It is a \nfrightening reality, but we have to face the epidemic head-on. That is \nwhy today is an important step.\n  In the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have held a number of \nhearings over the last year with testimony from so many experts on the \nfront lines. What we learned is eye-opening.\n  Federal policies toward opioid addiction in the past year have often \noveremphasized a one-size-fits-all law enforcement approach. It is \nclear through our listening sessions that it is a public health crisis \nand that our strategy should reflect the complex dynamic between public \nhealth and criminal activity. We know that we cannot simply incarcerate \nour way out of this epidemic.\n  The bills that we are considering today touch on a spectrum of issues \ndriving the opioid crisis. While there is no one solution, these bills \nrepresent good steps in addressing a problem that has rapidly grown.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee and off for working to adhere in a bipartisan way these \nimportant bills that will really make a difference in every one of our \ncommunities.\n  The House leadership deserves recognition on both sides for their \nswift consideration of these bills. I want to thank, in particular, my \ngood friend,\n\n[[Page H2236]]\n\nMr. Pallone, for working with us to get these bills across the finish \nline, through the committee process, and now on the floor.\n  Our work is going to continue. We owe this effort to the past, \npresent, and, sadly, future victims of this epidemic: our neighbors, \nfriends, and families across every part of the country, every \ndemographic group. We owe it to the families and we owe it to the \ncommunities who are suffering from this addiction.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), who is the Democratic \nsponsor of this bill and has worked a lot on the opioid epidemic \nproblem.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Pallone for yielding, \nfor his leadership on this issue throughout his time on Energy and \nCommerce, particularly over the last several months since I have been \non the committee trying to galvanize support from all of our colleagues \nto recognize the impact that this is having every single day.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for including H.R. 4641 in this \npackage of bipartisan opioid-related bills.\n  None of our districts has been spared the heartbreaking headlines \nabout lives lost to the opioid crisis. We have heard from each of our \nconstituents who have attended funerals for friends, neighbors, \nclassmates, colleagues, and family members. The bills we are \nconsidering this week are a promising step forward as we find ways to \nrespond to this crisis.\n  To my colleague, Congresswoman Brooks, thank you for your partnership \non this issue and on so many others. We have both seen firsthand how \nlack of access to treatment can lead those suffering from addiction to \nour courts. With this bill, we are trying to change the course of their \npath to stop addiction before it even begins.\n  Mr. Chairman, last week the Boston Globe wrote a series of articles \nabout the opioid crisis in my home State of Massachusetts. The \nstatistics are devastating. Nationally, heroin overdose rates have \ntripled in the last 5 years. At home, our State faces a heroin overdose \nrate that is twice the national average.\n  Last year alone, nearly 1,400 Massachusetts families lost loved ones \nto opioid overdoses. Between 2013 and 2014, prescription opioid \noverdoses nearly doubled. During that same time, the number of people \nin Massachusetts who overdosed on a combination of heroin and \nprescription opioids rose by almost 500 percent.\n  The Globe also noted that there has been a noticeable shift from \nopioids to heroin with one exception, Bristol County, where many of my \nconstituents live. In trying to explain that exception, the reporter \nincluded a haunting line that has stayed with me ever since.\n  He wrote that, in Bristol County, ``prescription opioids remain a \ndominant killer, though it's not clear whether that's because this area \nis somehow less susceptible to heroin or if it's merely a matter of \ntime.''\n  Mr. Chairman, we cannot accept a reality with a rise in heroin \noverdoses as ``merely a matter of time.'' We have all said it over 100 \ntimes. When it comes to a Federal response, there is no silver bullet.\n  But H.R. 4641 tries to focus on what I believe offers us one of the \nvery best opportunities for combating this problem: stopping addiction \nbefore it ever starts.\n  The bill will create a new task force dedicated to the job of \nreviewing, modifying, and updating best practices for the management of \npain and the prescription of pain medication.\n  Voices from HHS, the VA, FDA, DEA, NIH, and other agencies will join \nprescribers, substance use disorder professionals, patients suffering \nfrom chronic pain, and patients who have lived through the \nheartbreaking reality of becoming addicted to prescription pills.\n  These advocates and experts are on the front lines of this fight \nevery single day. Under their guidance, this task force will ensure we \nimplement the policies that balance responsible pain management with \nthe urgency that our opioid crisis requires.\n  Again, I am encouraged by the bipartisan progress we are making on \nthis issue; yet, our work is just beginning.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and look forward to working \nwith each of them to build on this momentum.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I think, as you can see, Members on both \nsides of the aisle know of people in our districts, our States, and \nacross our country that have been tragically affected by opioid abuse \nand overdose.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nwork on this legislation, especially my friend from Indiana, Mrs. \nBrooks.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 4641. This is a very important \nbipartisan step forward to combat opioid abuse. This issue hits close \nto home, all of our homes.\n  The State of Oregon ranked near the top or at the top for nonmedical \nuse of prescription pain relievers in the Nation. With opioid \nprescriptions serving as a gateway to heroin, it is no surprise that \ndeaths from drug overdoses have surpassed those of car accidents in my \nState.\n  Last week, in Medford, Bend, and Hermiston, I hosted roundtables with \ncommunity leaders and affected families to talk about what they are \nseeing on the front lines.\n  Physicians, first responders, members of law enforcement, and \nfamilies all were there sharing their stories, talking about how \nimportant the work we are doing here today is to them and our \ncommunities. All of them are on the ground combating this problem every \nday. We had excellent discussions.\n  H.R. 4641, in addition to the 17 other bipartisan bills we are voting \non this week, will help combat this epidemic. This bill will help \nprevent lawful prescription use from spiraling into abuse by developing \nbest practices for the treatment of pain.\n  In Medford, I heard from a father who had seen the impacts of \naddiction on his own family. His sister, who was a nurse, died of an \noverdose after years of suffering from addiction and bouncing between \npharmacies, passing off forged prescriptions.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  He spoke about how better tracking and treatment could have helped \ncatch his sister's problem earlier and, perhaps, made counseling more \neffective. As it was, she was only caught because two pharmacies in a \nsmall town happened to check with each other. You see, by then, it was \ntoo late.\n  Today, this man is working to help his son with an addiction that \nstarted with a prescription for a high school sports injury that \ndrifted into a heroin addiction. He spoke to the importance of \ncounseling, support, and trying to avoid addiction through better \nprescribing practices.\n  Echoing those sentiments, a therapist I spoke to in Hermiston \nexperienced 10 years of addiction of opioids after she was prescribed \npainkillers for a broken foot. Then when she tried to overcome this \naddiction, she could not find any help. So she traveled more than 5 \nhours, from Milton-Freewater, Oregon, to Marysville, Washington, \nbecause she could not find a physician in her region to prescribe \nSuboxone, an important medicine to help people break free from opioids.\n  Addiction is an equal opportunities destroyer. It crosses all \nsegments and regions of our country, and often the disease shows no \nsymptoms.\n  One emergency room physician relayed a story about a recent patient \nhe had no reason to believe had an addiction problem until he saw in \nthe database that the patient just received 60 pills the week before.\n  Opioids are highly effective at providing relief and improving the \nquality of life for those in debilitating pain. But if we don't know \nhow to appropriately prescribe them, it's no wonder we got to this \nplace. We need to increase access to counseling, medication-assisted \ntherapy and treatment for those battling addiction. Echoing what I \nheard from health practitioners across my district, opioid addiction is \na biopsychosocial disease--it's as complicated as diabetes and requires \na multi-pronged approach.\n  That's why it is so important that we pass H.R. 4641 and all of these \nbills this week to give health providers, first responders, law \nenforcement, and those battling addiction the tools they need to \novercome the epidemic of opioid abuse.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from\n\n[[Page H2237]]\n\nNew Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. I thank my colleague for \nyielding time.\n  Mr. Chairman, opioid abuse has become, as we have heard today, a \ncritical national issue as 78 Americans are killed by heroin and \nprescription drug overdoses each day, and drug overdoses are now the \nleading cause of injury-related deaths in the United States.\n  The number of unintentional overdose deaths from prescription \npainkillers almost quadrupled between 1999 and 2013; but as bad as the \nopioid epidemic is across the country, it is much more severe in my \nhome State of New Mexico, which has had one of the highest rates of \noverdose deaths in the country for several years. Unfortunately, it is \ngetting worse. From 2013 to 2014, the death rate from drug overdoses in \nNew Mexico increased 21 percent. Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, has the \nhighest overdose death rate in the Nation--one in 500 people dies from \noverdose--which is about six times the national average.\n  The over-prescription of opioids for pain management is part of the \nproblem, and an increasing number of patients is becoming dependent on \nthese powerfully addictive medications. In fact, 259 million opioid \nprescriptions were written in 2012--more than one for every adult in \nthe United States. Once addicted to these prescription opioids, many \nthen turn to heroin and to synthetic opioids due to their increased \navailability, lower prices, and higher purity.\n  We must act to respond to this public health crisis, but we need to \ndo it in a balanced way. We need to be mindful of the millions of \nAmericans who suffer from chronic pain. We need to ensure that patients \nand providers continue to have access to the best, most medically \nappropriate course of treatment while cutting off access to those who \nabuse the system.\n  This is why I strongly support H.R. 4641, which would establish an \ninteragency task force to review and update medical best practices for \npain management and prescribing pain medication; but we can't stop \nhere. We have to do more than just study the problem, because only 11 \npercent of Americans who need treatment for substance abuse are \nreceiving it. Many of those who remain find themselves in our criminal \njustice system. Our prisons have become de facto treatment centers. \nMore than 65 percent of our prison population has a substance abuse \nproblem.\n  We have to provide the funds necessary to fully invest in opioid \nprevention, rehabilitation, and treatment programs. We have to support \nthe placement of substance abuse treatment providers in the communities \nthat are most in need, like Rio Arriba County. We have to improve \naccess to the overdose reversal drug, naloxone, which can help save \ncountless lives every year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will address \nthis disease that has destroyed the lives of so many.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 4641.\n  Prescription drug abuse, particularly with opioids, has become a \nnational epidemic. It affects all of our communities. The bill before \nus today will authorize an important task force to determine and \ndisseminate best practices for pain management.\n  The need for best practice guidelines was highlighted last week \nduring a substance abuse panel I hosted in my district with Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy Director Botticelli. One woman shared her \nstory of addiction and struggle to receive help following a surgery she \nhad had as a 15-year-old gymnast. We must give people like her the \ntools they need for prevention and treatment in order to stop the \nspread of this epidemic.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for sponsoring this bill. Please support this \ngreat bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).\n  Mr. CRAMER. I thank Mrs. Brooks for her leadership on this--Mr. \nKennedy's as well--and for bringing this important legislation to our \ncommittee and to the floor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to support H.R. 4641.\n  With heroin addiction now being three times greater than it was a \ndecade ago, we know it doesn't matter where you come from. Whether you \nare on an Indian reservation, on a farm, in the middle of a city, in a \nsuburb, in a small town, or whether you are in a Fargo high school, at \nthe University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, or at Bismarck State \nCollege, it doesn't matter what your lot is in life. It doesn't matter \nwhat your income level is. It doesn't matter what your social status \nis. This opioid abuse crisis affects people from all walks of life, and \nit is about time we acknowledged it and tried to deal with it at this \nlevel.\n  This bill is pretty basic, but is pretty profound as well because it \ntakes advantage of the collective opportunity of the collective \ntalents, experiences, and backgrounds of the people on the ground who \nare dealing with it every day. It brings it all together and \nfacilitates it at every level of government in every community and in \nevery State whether it is North Dakota or Indiana or Massachusetts. It \nis the beginning, I believe, of a profound solution.\n  Just as much as anything, I applaud the efforts of the leadership who \nbrought this to us, and I grieve with so many parents as we have heard \ntheir stories. This year, in the Fargo, North Dakota, area alone, there \nhave been a minimum of 10 fatal overdoses because of this crisis.\n  I will stand shoulder to shoulder with anybody and everybody in this \nChamber, as well as in the Chamber on the other side of the Capitol, to \nhelp solve this problem.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 4641 \nso we can continue to involve the practices of pain management and the \nprescribing of pain medication to fight the opioid abuse epidemic in \nthis country.\n  As a lifelong pharmacist, I have provided prescription medications to \nAmericans for over 30 years. In that time, I have personally witnessed \nthe struggles that both medical professionals and patients face with \nprescription drug abuse.\n  There are many steps that must be taken to address this epidemic. One \npriority should be to involve practices related to pain management and \nthe prescribing of pain medication. This bill does just that. This bill \ncreates an interagency task force to continually review, modify, and \nupdate best practices for pain management and prescribing pain \nmedication. Through the new task force, experts in fields related to \nprescription drug abuse and pain management will be able to involve \nbest industry practices that will give clarity to our fight against \nthis epidemic.\n  I commend Representative Brooks and the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce for their work on this bill, and I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  I thank all of my colleagues. I thank particularly the leadership of \nthe Committee on Energy and Commerce. There have also been other \ncommittees--the Judiciary Committee, the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce--that have been working on bills. This is not something that \nany one Member of this body has truly been a leader on. So many \ndifferent Members have been leading on this because it has affected our \ncommunities, our families, our neighborhoods.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bill because, \nas the gentleman from North Dakota said, the Federal Government has not \ndone enough yet. This will be an opportunity for us to bring together \nall of the Federal agencies that are involved in this problem, which \nhave been part of the problem, and try to change the way our \nprescribers throughout the country work on the pain management issues \nthe country faces, which, hopefully, will yield a much lower overdose\n\n[[Page H2238]]\n\nrate--a rate which now exceeds the motor traffic fatalities in this \ncountry and which is the leading cause of calls to our poison centers. \nMore importantly, it has devastated so many parents and friends who \nhave found their friends who have overdosed from either heroin or \nopioids.\n  I am so pleased that we are finally beginning to recognize that we \ncannot arrest our way out of this problem. It is a disease. It is \nsomething that so many people cannot stop on their own. They need help. \nWith all of these experts coming together on this task force to provide \nthe best practices for the country, I hope we can turn the tide and \nsave many lives.\n  I urge the bill's passage by my colleagues.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to support this bill. As I said, this \ninteragency task force is an important part of this larger opioid \npackage that we produced in the Committee on Energy and Commerce on a \nbipartisan basis. I know the rest of those bills are going to come up \non suspension--or most of them--this afternoon. I can't emphasize \nenough the importance of this package, as well as this bill, as being \npart of it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 11, strike ``and''.\n       Page 4, line 13, insert ``and'' after the semicolon.\n       Page 4, after line 13, insert the following:\n       (M) the Office of Women's Health;\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Brownley) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a very \nstraightforward amendment to H.R. 4641.\n  The amendment would include the Office of Women's Health in the \ninteragency task force created under the bill.\n  As we all know, the underlying bill includes a list of Federal agency \nrepresentatives to be included in the interagency task force, which \nwill review, modify, and update best practices for pain management and \nprescribing pain medication.\n  However, the bill does not currently include the Office of Women's \nHealth. The Office of Women's Health, within the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, was established in 1991 to improve the \nhealth of women by advancing and coordinating a comprehensive women's \nhealth agenda to address healthcare prevention and service delivery.\n  The Office of Women's Health works with numerous government agencies, \nnonprofit organizations, consumer groups, and associations of \nhealthcare professionals to coordinate and advance policies and \nprograms that best meet the unique healthcare needs of women.\n\n[[Page H2239]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  As a national leader in the health of women and girls, the Office of \nWomen's Health has critical specialized expertise that will help the \ninteragency pain management task force address the unique pain \nmanagement needs of women who may be pregnant or who may be nursing.\n  This expertise is desperately needed because opioid abuse among women \nhas increased substantially in recent years. In fact, according to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of women who \nfall victim to an opioid-related fatality increased an alarming 400 \npercent from 1999 to 2010, totalling 48,000 women who have died during \nthat span of time.\n  During this decade, opioid abuse among women increased more than \nabuse of any other drug, including cocaine and heroin. Shockingly, the \nCDC reports that in 2010, 18 women per day died of a prescription \npainkiller overdose, accounting for nearly 7,000 women in total.\n  It is critically important that we include experts on women's health \nin the opioid task force. Women who are pregnant or who may be nursing \nhave specialized healthcare needs, and the Office of Women's Health is \nuniquely qualified to ensure that the interagency task force takes the \nneeds of women and girls into account as it examines best practices for \npain management in prescribing pain medication.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I support the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Indiana is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. At this time, I thank the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia for the amendment. I think it strengthens the bill. I think \nit is very important that the Office of Women's Health is added to the \ntask force. So many of us have had the opportunity to visit NICUs in \nhospitals and have seen drug-addicted babies. So I do believe that \nhaving the perspective of the Office of Women's Health would be \ncritically important.\n  So often women's health has not been given the proper attention that \nit deserves, and I would ask for support of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I want to urge all my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle to support the bill as well.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from \nNew Jersey and the gentlewoman from Indiana. I think we all realize the \nimportance of ensuring that this interagency task force is effective \nand works, and I think the eyes on specific healthcare needs of women \nand girls is most important.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mrs. Brooks of Indiana\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), I offer amendment No. 2.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 15, strike ``physicians'' and insert ``subject \n     to subsection (d), physicians''.\n       Page 4, line 18, strike ``pharmacists'' and insert \n     ``subject to subsection (d), pharmacists''.\n       Page 5, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (d) Condition on Participation on Task Force.--An \n     individual representing a profession or entity described in \n     paragraph (3) or (5) of subsection (c) may not serve as a \n     member of the task force unless such individual--\n       (1) is currently licensed in a State in which such \n     individual is practicing (as defined by such State) such \n     profession (or, in the case of an individual representing an \n     entity, a State in which the entity is engaged in business); \n     and\n       (2) is currently practicing (as defined by such State) such \n     profession (or, in the case of an individual representing an \n     entity, the entity is in operation).\n       Page 5, line 11, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n       Page 7, line 1, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n       Page 7, line 3, strike ``(f)'' and insert ``(g)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply would \nrequire that any of the individuals who are appointed to the task force \nunder H.R. 4641, whether they be a physician, a dentist, a nonphysician \nprescriber, or pharmacist who is eventually appointed by the lead of \nHealth and Human Services, that that individual shall be a licensed \nprescriber and practicing in their appropriate State or that they, at a \nminimum, should have an active license and that they should be a \npracticing prescriber in that State.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I \nsupport the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, after line 18, insert the following (and \n     redesignate the subsequent paragraphs accordingly):\n       (6) first responders;\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would ensure that first \nresponders are included for membership on the Pain Management Best \nPractices Interagency Task Force. This is a commonsense amendment.\n  First responders, like police officers and other emergency room \nstaff, are the first on the scene when a person overdoses. And they are \nthe first to administer emergency treatments and resuscitation \nprograms. These are the people who have the first contact with victims \nof opioid overdose.\n  It would make sense that if we are putting together a task force to \naddress the terrible opioid problem--and specifically pain management \nbest practices--we should include the views and opinions of those who \nare first on the scene and in the best position to save lives.\n  Being first on the scene to overdose emergencies, first responders \noften interact with patients in pain. Yet, most first responders, \nespecially EMS responders, have no pain management standards as part of \ntheir accreditation.\n  The Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services does not \ninclude a pain management standard as part of its clinical assessment, \nnor is pain management a major part of EMS education. As a result, \nfirst responder attitudes vary. According to a 2012 Yale study, there \nis a widespread reluctance within the EMS community to administer \nopioids to those who legitimately need it out of a fear--perhaps \nunfounded--that patients could be addicts seeking drugs.\n  First responders certainly do encounter people who are not \nprescription painkiller dependent. However, it is often not possible \nfor paramedics to know with certainty if a patient is an addict or even \nwhether the addict is also experiencing legitimate pain.\n  This level of uncertainty and varying degrees of attitudes within the \nfirst responder community, along with the\n\n[[Page H2240]]\n\nunique experience and insight into the opioid epidemic, warrants the \ninclusion of first responders to the Pain Management Best Practices \nInteragency Task Force membership.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is very simple, we are putting together a Pain \nManagement Best Practices Interagency Task Force. We should include \npolice officers. We should include paramedics. We should include people \nwho are on the front lines of fighting this battle every day that is a \nbattle of life and death.\n  I urge the support of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Indiana is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, for the record, I support the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Clark of Massachusetts\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, after line 20, insert the following:\n       (7) experts in the fields of adolescent and young adult \n     addiction research;\n       Page 4, line 21, strike ``(7)'' and insert ``(8)''.\n       Page 5, line 6, strike ``(8)'' and insert ``(9)''.\n       Page 5, after line 7, insert the following:\n       (10) a person in recovery from addiction to medication for \n     chronic pain, whose addiction began in adolescence or young \n     adulthood;\n       Page 5, line 8, strike ``(9)'' and insert ``(11)''.\n       Page 5, line 9, strike ``(10)'' and insert ``(12)''.\n       Page 6, line 13, strike ``and''.\n       Page 6, after line 13, insert the following:\n       (E) the distinct needs of adolescents and young adults with \n     respect to pain management, pain medication, substance use \n     disorder, and medication-assisted treatment; and\n       Page 6, line 14, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Clark) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, a special thanks to \nCongresswoman Brooks, Congressman Kennedy, and Congressman Pallone for \nintroducing this important bipartisan bill to address a devastating \npublic health crisis.\n  The opioid epidemic is a scourge on this country. In my district \nalone, 400 people have died in the last 4 years as a direct result. As \nwe all know, there is no silver bullet to fix this problem. But what we \ncan do and what we must do is find every possible way to help those \npeople already affected and stop it from reaching more victims.\n  When substance use disorder starts in adolescence, it affects key \ndevelopment and societal changes in young people's lives. It can \ninterfere with the brain's ability to mature properly and have \npotentially lifelong consequences.\n  We know that a large majority of adults in substance abuse treatment \nstart using prior to the age of 18, and we need to make sure that the \nvoices of adolescents and young adults are heard in this conversation.\n  The underlying bill establishes a pain management task force that \nwill include many different stakeholders and experts. This amendment \nwould add an expert in adolescent and young adult addiction and a \nperson in recovery from addiction to medication for chronic pain that \nbegan in adolescence or young adulthood to the bill's list of experts.\n  This amendment would also call on the task force to consider the \ndistinct needs of adolescents and young adults as it develops best \npractices for pain management and medication.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment to help our young \npeople dealing with this epidemic. I urge its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I do support the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Indiana is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I very much want to thank the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark). I believe that this does \nstrengthen the task force. I appreciate and welcome the attention and \nfocus on adolescents.\n  We had the opportunity to travel to the NIH and to learn so much \nabout the research that is being done there. I believe in having an \nexpert in adolescent and young adult addiction because we do know that \nthat is where it so very often begins. So I appreciate and thank the \ngentlewoman for strengthening the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton) to offer amendment No. 5.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, line 3, strike ``and''.\n       Page 5, after line 3, insert the following:\n       (E) veteran service organizations; and\n       Page 5, line 4, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment by the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Moulton) would basically add representatives of \nveterans service organizations to the Pain Management Best Practices \nInter-Agency Task Force that we have discussed and that we support on a \nbipartisan basis. I urge support for Mr. Moulton's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I support this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Indiana is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, while the task force was \ndesigned with the Veterans Administration as a key member of the task \nforce, I do believe that this bill would strengthen the task force in \nthat representatives from veterans service organizations often speak on \nbehalf of and are the first line of defense and advocates for veterans.\n  Obviously, as we know, veterans seek their medical treatment often \nfrom VA hospitals and VA facilities. We know that there has been a \nsignificant problem with overprescribing at some of our VA facilities. \nI believe that this amendment will strengthen the task force and the \nbill. I urge passage or adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the sponsor of the \namendment.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, the addiction epidemic has touched every \ncommunity and demographic in America, but our veterans have been hit \nparticularly hard. Veterans suffer from chronic pain at a higher rate \nthan the civilian population, often due to injuries they sustained \nduring their service. This puts our veterans at high risk of developing \naddiction and presents unique challenges as they search for ways to \ncope with the pain caused by the wounds of war.\n  The results of veteran addiction are tragic. Approximately 68,000 \nveterans struggle with opioid use. Veterans are also almost twice as \nlikely to die from accidental opioid overdoses than nonveterans.\n  We need to do more to ensure that we are not losing veterans to the \ndisease of addiction, while also ensuring that\n\n[[Page H2241]]\n\nthey get the absolute best care possible when they return home. That is \nwhy it is imperative that the veteran community has a seat at the table \nas we begin the process of reviewing and updating our pain management \nbest practices.\n  By adding a representative of a veterans service organization to the \ninteragency task force created by this bill, my amendment will ensure \nthat the unique challenges our veterans face are part of the \nconversation.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Zeldin) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), for \ntheir bipartisan cosponsorship and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica, Vietnam Veterans of America, American Legion, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, and Boston Scientific for their support of this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Nolan\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, line 8, strike ``and''.\n       Page 5, after line 8, insert the following:\n       (10) an expert on active duty military, armed forces \n     personnel, and veteran health and prescription opioid \n     addiction;\n       Page 5, line 9, strike ``(10)'' and insert ``(11)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Nolan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, my amendment simply \nwould ensure that the concerns and the interests of Active-Duty members \nof our Armed Forces and veterans have their interests and concerns \ntaken into consideration by the interagency task force.\n  The simple truth is that there is a greater need and use of opioids \namong Active Duty and veterans of our Armed Forces simply because of \nthe many serious accidents and injuries that they incur in combat and \nin training.\n  Over half of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have had to use \nopioids as painkillers from the accidents and the injuries that they \nhave suffered. That is well over half a million of our finest and \nbravest citizens here in this country, and an 80 percent increase in \nits use over the last decade.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't point out as well that overdose from \nopioids is twice the rate among our Active-Duty servicemembers and \nveterans of that of the general population. Also, I would be remiss if \nI didn't point out that, because of problems that we have been seeing \nin the Veterans Administration with veterans having a difficult time \nsometimes getting appointments to get their prescriptions filled, they \nhave been tragically forced to go to alternative street measures, \nincluding heroin, with disastrous consequences for our soldiers and our \nveterans. Our veterans, our men and women of the Armed Forces, deserve \nbetter.\n  This is a growing problem, a growing concern, and my amendment would \nsimply require that they be represented on this interagency task force \nso that their interests, their concerns can be properly reflected and \nreported in the findings and results of this interagency task force.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I support the amendment as well.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Indiana is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota, again, for strengthening the representation on the task \nforce. While I do feel that the VSOs are a strong voice for veterans \nand will continue to be, I believe the addition specifically of Active-\nDuty military is something that would be a very strong voice. While DOD \nis represented on the task force, I think actually having specific \nActive-Duty military personnel and those who are currently serving and \nare currently dealing with their pain as a result of their service \nwould be an important addition.\n  I thank the gentleman, and I urge passage of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Indiana \n(Mrs. Brooks) for her leadership on this important issue and her \nsupport for this important amendment, most importantly the great work \nshe is doing here on behalf of our veterans and our men and women in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mrs. Watson Coleman\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, line 8, strike ``and''.\n       Page 5, after line 8, insert the following:\n       (10) an expert in the field of minority health; and\n       Page 5, line 9, strike ``(10)'' and insert ``(11)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman from New \nJersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Jersey.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would simply ensure \nthat, as we address what has rightly been called an epidemic, we \nconsider the unique impacts and issues of drug addiction for minority \ncommunities by adding an expert on minority health to the task force \nthat is created by this bill.\n  The dangers of opiate addiction are apparent across the board. Abuse \nof prescription opioids has contributed to a flood of cheap heroin to \nall communities.\n  Over the past 4 years, we have seen a 269 percent increase in heroin \noverdose deaths in White communities, but also a 213 percent increase \nin Black communities, 137 percent increase in Latino communities, and \n236 percent in Native American communities.\n  With that in mind, it is important to remember that the opiate \nepidemic--both heroin and its prescription painkiller counterparts--\nlooks very different from the perspective of communities of color. The \ncompassion and clemency that we are showing now and the evidence-based \nsolutions we are embracing were needed long ago, way before abuse by \npredominantly White and suburban communities.\n  As we craft the tools to solve this crisis, we must ensure the \npolicies we create will help everyone affected. Adding an expert in \nminority health to this task force helps to make sure that the diverse \nneeds of all Americans are represented at the table. We still live in a \nworld of significant biases.\n  Just last month, the University of Virginia released a study that \nfound that White medical students and residents genuinely believed that \nBlack patients were less sensitive to pain and had less sensitive nerve \nendings than White patients, bearing out at least one reason for the \nconsistently documented lack of pain management provided to Black \npatients.\n  As we give this task force the vital task of improving how we \nprescribe some of the most powerful and still-critical medication for \npain management, let's do our part to eliminate as much bias as \npossible. This amendment takes an important step toward reaching that \ngoal. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I support the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Indiana is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H2242]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from \nNew Jersey for this important addition to the task force. I think that \nshe has brought forth some interesting points and some statistics with \nrespect to the opioid abuse and addiction problems facing the minority \ncommunity. A minority health expert that is very focused on this would \nadd tremendous expertise to the depth of this task force. I support the \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from \nIndiana for her leadership and for her support of this initiative.\n  Let me close by adding this. We are considering a number of bills \nthis week aimed at curing the opioid and heroin epidemics ravaging so \nmany American families. As we do so, we need to consider two things:\n  First is that communities of color have unique needs that deserve \njust as much consideration. That is why I have offered this amendment, \nand it is a theme I hope to see continued in other legislation we will \ndebate.\n  The second is that, when we head back to our districts on Friday \nafter completing consideration of these bills, we should not wash our \nhands and walk away from this issue. We need to fund the programs we \nhave authorized. We need to look back with a critical eye at the ways \nwe criminalized addictions in the past and offer those whom we failed \nsolutions that will allow them to reenter society. Our work cannot stop \nthere. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Ms. Kuster\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in \npart A of House Report 114-551.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, after line 18, insert the following:\n       (B) research on trends in areas and communities in which \n     the prescription opioid abuse rate and fatality rate exceed \n     the national average prescription opioid abuse rate and \n     fatality rate;\n       Page 5, line 19, strike ``(b)'' and insert ``(c)''.\n       Page 5, line 22, strike ``(c)'' and insert ``(d)''.\n       Page 6, line 6, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n       Page 6, line 14, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman from New \nHampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill before us authorizes \nthe creation of an interagency task force to combat the opiate \nepidemic. I want to commend the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) \nand the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) for their hard work \non this issue.\n  This important legislation will make it easier to tackle this crisis \nin a holistic way that addresses all angles of the crisis, including \nlaw enforcement, education and prevention, and, most importantly, \ntreatment and lifelong recovery.\n  I thank Congresswoman Brooks and Congressman Kennedy for their great \nwork on this bill, as well as the leadership of the chair and the \nranking member.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  In fact, a similar provision to this legislation was included in the \nSTOP ABUSE Act that I introduced with my colleague, Mr. Guinta, last \nyear. Today he has joined me in introducing this important bipartisan \namendment that will further improve the scope of the task force's \neffort.\n  In New Hampshire and across the country, four out of every five \nheroin users started out misusing prescription opioid medication. Last \nyear more than 25,000 people died across this country from overdoses on \nprescription drugs.\n  There are complex reasons for why we have seen such a dramatic rise \nin prescription drug misuse, but one of the causes that we must examine \nmore closely is prescribing practices and overprescribing.\n  I recently joined my colleague, Congressman Mooney of West Virginia, \nin introducing legislation that would address this problem. This \namendment with Mr. Guinta would help to shine more light on \nprescription drug misuse by requiring the task force to research \naddiction trends in communities with high rates of prescription drug \nmisuse and overdoses.\n  This research will be invaluable in the effort to identify why this \ncrisis is hitting certain regions of our country particularly hard and \nin identifying further potential corrections to prescribing practices \nthat can be made.\n  I thank my colleagues for taking up such important legislation this \nweek, and I urge support for this amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Congresswoman Kuster, and myself, originally \npart of the STOP ABUSE Act that we authored earlier this year, as \npreviously mentioned.\n  This amendment would simply require the task force to research \naddiction trends in communities with high rates of prescription drug \nabuse.\n  In our home State of New Hampshire, much of the heroin abuse we have \nseen today can be traced back to the overprescribing of narcotic drugs. \nThis trend, which began in the 1990s, paved the way for the rampant \nheroin abuse that we are seeing today.\n  Last year, as you know, 430 people in our State died of an opioid \noverdose. This year that number is expected to be exceeded. So this \namendment would research these trends so we can work to resolve the \nproblem before the epidemic continues and expands. I would urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for her \ntireless work not just here, but on the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat \nHeroin Epidemic. We are clearly providing options and solutions to help \nthose families in need.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I will just close by thanking Mrs. Brooks \nof Indiana for her leadership, Mr. Kennedy for his leadership in \noffering this legislation, and thank Mr. Guinta for this amendment.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment that will \nallow us to understand the underlying increase in the use of opioid \nmedication and prescription drugs that are leading people into \nsubstance use disorder and, ultimately, sadly, into the use of heroin \nand fentanyl that is killing so many people in our homes and \ncommunities.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Schiff\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, line 3, strike ``and''.\n       Page 6, line 5, before the semicolon insert ``and the \n     coordination of information collected from State prescription \n     drug monitoring programs for the purpose of preventing the \n     diversion of pain medication''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Schiff) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. \n4641 that will require the interagency task force created by this \nlegislation to study and report on the coordination of information \ncollected from state prescription drug monitoring programs, or PDMPs, \nas part of its effort to update best practices for pain management \nstrategies.\n\n[[Page H2243]]\n\n  State PDMPs play a critical role in preventing the diversion of pain \nmedication as well as other controlled substances. Chief among their \nbenefits, access to a State PDMP provides an invaluable resource to \nprescribing physicians by allowing them to review a patient's history \nof prescription drugs and to spot signs of opioid abuse so that they \nmay proactively refer a patient to substance abuse treatment, if \nappropriate. They allow medical professionals to intervene before an \naddiction spirals out of control.\n  Now active in 49 States, PDMPs can also inform prescribing physicians \nif a patient has recently accessed pain medication elsewhere and help \nto detect potential doctor-shopping activities by individuals with no \nlegitimate medical need. Further, PDMPs also play an important role in \nidentifying forged or stolen prescriptions.\n  While information sharing between some adjacent State PDMPs currently \nexists to prevent illicit doctor-shopping activities from occurring \nacross State lines, I believe it is time that we boost efforts to \nstrengthen the sharing of information across all State PDMPs.\n  I recently met with physicians from my district who described from \ntheir experience how prevalent the issue of doctor shopping is, \nparticularly in the State of California, and how it is becoming more \nand more common for individuals with histories of opioid abuse to \nattempt to receive illicit prescriptions in nearby States.\n  With passage of this amendment, I urge the task force to explore the \nbenefits of potentially establishing a national PDMP that will vastly \napprove our ability to prevent and disincentivize doctor shopping in \nall regions of the country, and I look forward to working with other \nconcerned Members on this important topic.\n  By requiring that the interagency task force include State PDMP \ninformation as it formulates its expert input and improves prescribing \nguidelines, we will be able to better understand what is and isn't \nworking and how we may be able to harness the power of State PDMPs to \ndevelop an effective national response to the opioid crisis that has \ndevastated communities across the country.\n  It is beyond doubt that prescription drug monitoring programs serve \nan invaluable purpose, and any effort to address overprescription must \ninclude consideration of important data that is gleaned across State \nPDMPs.\n  While I hope that this Congress will ultimately provide the necessary \nresources to assure we are able to develop and implement a \ncomprehensive plan to prevent opioid addiction and increase access to \ntreatment, the recommendations developed by the task force created \nunder this bill are an important initial step that must come to pass \nbefore achieving that goal.\n  I urge support for this amendment and for the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I am in support of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the \ngentleman from California for offering this amendment.\n  We know from talking to a lot of physicians and medical educators as \nwell that the use of these PDMPs is a critically important tool in \ntheir tool chest to combat against those patients who might be doctor \nshopping.\n  We know, though, that not all States use it. Not all prescribers \nactually check that PDMP system like they should. So I appreciate the \nCongressman's concept of a feasibility study as to whether or not there \nshould be a national PDMP system, and I urge its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her support as \nwell as all of her good work in trying to address the opioid crisis in \nthe United States.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Clark of Massachusetts\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-551.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, after line 5, insert the following:\n       (D) ongoing efforts at the Federal, State, and local levels \n     to examine the potential benefits of electronic prescribing \n     of opioids, including any public comments collected in the \n     course of those efforts;\n       Page 6, line 6, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n       Page 6, line 14, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts (Ms. Clark) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It \ndirects the task force to consider any potential benefits from \nincreasing the electronic prescribing of opioids.\n  We know that, with the increasing sophistication of health \ninformation technology, we have an opportunity to use that information \nfor the benefit of our public health. We also know that paper \nprescriptions are subject to being stolen, copied, and misused.\n  While that is a fact, 67 percent of prescriptions nationally are \nordered electronically, but the rate for controlled substances is less \nthan 1 percent.\n  Electronic prescribing of opioids has the potential to provide data \nto help us identify problems, whether from a user or a prescriber, and \nfocus our interventions on saving lives and preventing addiction.\n  Back home in my district, Cambridge Health Alliance has adopted \nelectronic prescriptions for controlled substances and have found it \nreduces fraud and allows administrators to track prescription patterns \nand detect overprescribing. Electronic prescriptions can be a key tool \nin fighting this epidemic. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Rothfus\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, line 13, strike ``and''.\n       Page 6, after line 16, insert ``and'' after the semicolon.\n       Page 6, after line 16, insert the following:\n       (F) the practice of co-prescribing naloxone for both pain \n     patients receiving chronic opioid therapy and patients being \n     treated for opioid use disorders;\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend from \nIndiana for her leadership on this very important piece of legislation \nas well as the chairman and ranking member of the committee for working \ntogether to bring it to the floor today.\n  The United States is being ravaged by skyrocketing levels of \nprescription opioid and heroin abuse. This brutal epidemic has \naccounted for more than 28,000 American deaths in 2014, destroying \nfamilies and devastating local communities alike.\n  My constituents in western Pennsylvania have been particularly hard \nhit. In the past two decades, there has been a 470 percent increase in \ndrug overdose deaths. The vast majority of these have been heroin and \nopioid related.\n  Two weeks ago, at a local hospital in my district, five overdoses \nwere treated in 1 day alone. In February, the same facility treated 20 \noverdoses in just 2 days.\n  We need meaningful and evidence-based solutions to combat this \nscourge. I have worked to help develop those solutions as part of the \nBipartisan Task\n\n[[Page H2244]]\n\nForce to Combat the Heroin Epidemic and by holding roundtables with \nstakeholders in my district.\n  I strongly believe that the legislation we are considering today is \nanother step forward in that process by creating an interagency task \nforce to review and update best practices for pain management and \nprescribing pain medication.\n  As part of its work, the task force will consider various types of \ndata and practices. For example, it must consider the existence and \navailability of different classes of opioids, including those with \nsafety measures such as abuse deterrent technology. It must also \nconsider how high-risk populations are managed by medical \nprofessionals.\n  The legislation has been entirely silent on the issue of naloxone, \nhowever. Thus, the amendment that I offered with my friend from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Keating) simply seeks to have the task force take \ninto consideration the practice of coprescribing this lifesaving drug \nas part of its work.\n  Naloxone has the ability to revive a victim who has suffered an \noverdoes within minutes. It is both safe and effective and has been \nused successfully to counteract more than 26,000 overdoses between 1996 \nand 2014. First responders who have seen what naloxone can do have \nreferred to it as the miracle drug.\n  The American Medical Association and many community, State, and \nnational groups have supported coprescribing naloxone to patients who \nare taking opioids as a critical part of the solution to the rising \nepidemic of opioid overdose-related deaths.\n  Considering the practice of coprescribing naloxone, particularly for \nhigh-risk populations or when other avenues of treatment have been \ntried and failed, it is an essential part of addressing the opioid and \nheroin epidemic.\n  By reviewing and updating best practices with respect to \ncoprescribing naloxone, the interagency task force can ensure that \nhealth professionals at all levels, both inside and outside of \ngovernment, are fully informed when prescribing and treating patients.\n  Simply put, Americans who are struggling with opioid and heroin \naddiction cannot be treated if they lose their lives to drug overdose. \nIt is essential that we get naloxone into the hands that need it the \nmost in a safe and effective manner. My amendment would ensure that the \ntask force takes a close look at this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Rothfus' \namendment to H.R. 4641.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Massachusetts \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  I rise today in support of this amendment, our amendment. It is an \namendment that I believe will move the task force to consider the \npractice of coprescribing of overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone \nas part of the review of its best practices for pain management and for \nprescribing pain medication.\n  Importantly, the medical community now realizes the need for having \nthese important guidelines in place and having them being addressed, as \nover 80 percent of the AMA members have indicated they see the need for \nthese guidelines now and the importance in terms of saving lives.\n  As a former district attorney, I took a public health approach a \ndecade and a half ago, starting an Anti-Heroin Task Force. At the time, \nin our State, two people, on average, were dying every day from these \noverdoses. In just the last 6 years, that number has increased to \nalmost four people a day.\n  As a Congressman, this hits really close to home to me because our \nlatest stats in 2014 indicate that a quarter of the overdose deaths in \nMassachusetts occurred in counties in my district. Over 60 percent \noccurred in the cities of Fall River and New Bedford alone.\n  In fact, nearly twice the statewide average in Cape Cod, where the \nhighest percentage of per capita rate of opioid-related overdoses \noccurs, represents a significant part of the epidemic in our \nCommonwealth.\n  Going forward, Mr. Rothfus and I introduced Co-Prescribing Saves \nLives Act legislation to require Federal health agencies, including \nHHS, the Department of Defense, and the VA, to create guidelines for \ncoprescribing naloxone alongside opioid prescriptions and making \nnaloxone more widely available.\n  Our legislation creates a grant program as well, so the States will \nhave the resources to do the same.\n  As our partnership shows, in an often divided Congress, we are coming \ntogether. We are coming together to confront a uniquely American \nepidemic.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, to close, increased access to naloxone, \nparticularly for patients who are at high risk, has been identified as \none of the most powerful tools for reducing the number of opioid and \nheroin-related overdose deaths.\n  Let's ensure that our health professionals are fully informed of this \noption when prescribing and treating patients.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, line 13, strike ``and''.\n       Page 6, after line 16, insert the following:\n       (F) research that has been, or is being, conducted or \n     supported by the Federal Government on prevention of, \n     treatment for, and recovery from substance use by and \n     substance use disorders among adolescents and young adults \n     relative to any unique circumstances (including social and \n     biological circumstances) of adolescents and young adults \n     that may make adolescent-specific and young adult-specific \n     treatment protocols necessary, including any effects that \n     substance use and substance use disorders may have on brain \n     development and the implications for treatment and recovery;\n       (G) Federal non-research programs and activities that \n     address prevention of, treatment for, and recovery from \n     substance use by and substance use disorders among \n     adolescents and young adults, including an assessment of the \n     effectiveness of such programs and activities in--\n       (i) preventing substance use by and substance use disorders \n     among adolescents and young adults;\n       (ii) treating such adolescents and young adults in a way \n     that accounts for any unique circumstances faced by \n     adolescents and young adults; and\n       (iii) supporting long-term recovery among adolescents and \n     young adults; and\n       (H) gaps that have been identified by Federal officials and \n     experts in Federal efforts relating to prevention of, \n     treatment for, and recovery from substance use by and \n     substance use disorders among adolescents and young adults, \n     including gaps in research, data collection, and measures to \n     evaluate the effectiveness of Federal efforts, and the \n     reasons for such gaps;\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts (Ms. Clark) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would direct \nthe task force to consider the programs and research relative to \nadolescents and young adults.\n  We know that addiction and recovery often start early, and we need to \nfocus research on how to address the unique needs of our adolescents \nand young adults.\n  We need to understand how years of opioid abuse can affect the \ndevelopment of the brain, how it affects the development of coping \nskills, and how we can best support our kids in long-term recovery.\n  Most importantly, there are many gaps in research on this subject, \nand we need to know the status of the current research and where we \nneed to focus our resources.\n\n[[Page H2245]]\n\n  Recently, I met a constituent named Ryan. In seventh grade, he \nstarted taking drugs. When he did, he told me he felt like he finally \nfit in, like he had found the answers to the problems he felt and the \npain he felt.\n  By the time he was 13, he started drinking, taking pills, and \nstealing money from his family. His mother was panicked. The minute he \nwalked out of the house he had to get high. He also felt powerless.\n  At 15, he became convinced he was a bad person. He felt ashamed that \nhe couldn't change, not even for his mother.\n  The last time he relapsed, his mom told him he couldn't see friends \nanymore, and he threw a piece of glass at her.\n  She looked him in the eyes and said: I don't know who you are \nanymore.\n  He went into treatment for three additional months, and that \ntreatment is what changed his life. He said that it saved him. One day \nat the sober house he remembers sincerely laughing for the first time, \nand he thought: There's hope for me.\n  All these little things he forgot about himself, like humor, kindness \nand empathy. He said: I no longer felt like the shell of a person.\n  He asked for our leadership for two things: the people in recovery \nneed not to be ashamed. It is not what defines them, even when their \naddiction starts very young; and that we need to come up with funding \nfor treatment.\n  Ryan is an inspiration to me, and we owe it to the young victims of \nthis epidemic to focus on the unique impact of this public health \ncrisis on adolescents and young adults.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I support the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I would like to, once again, \nthank the gentlewoman from Massachusetts for this important amendment. \nAs she spoke, she reminded me of a visit that I made to a recovery high \nschool; and there are more recovery high schools being created across \nthe country.\n  But I think when I visited the recovery high school in Indianapolis, \ncalled Hope Academy, it reminded me, as I listened to these young \npeople, of the very different needs, but the very, very serious desire \nthat they have to find themselves again, as the gentlewoman just \nstated.\n  A young woman who was turning 17 the next day shared that it was \ngoing to be her first birthday in 3 years where she would be sober, and \nshe thanked her classmates and her colleagues there as they sat in that \ncircle, and asked that they help her make sure that she didn't go home \nthat night and relapse because she couldn't remember a birthday, \nreally, where she had been sober.\n  So I do believe that having more studies specifically with respect to \nthe programs and the research about adolescents and young adults is \ncritically important because that is where it all starts.\n  I support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, again, I just want to thank \nthe gentlewoman from Indiana for all her leadership and advocacy, and \nmy good friend and colleague from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy) for his as well. This bill and their work will make an \nincredible difference to families across the country.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 13 Offered by Ms. Esty\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment, \nwhich would empower the interagency task force to help communities \nspread awareness about the dangers of drug addiction through consumer \neducation, and help medical providers more effectively and safely \naddress patient pain management.\n  Along with my colleague, Representative Knight, I proudly introduced \nthis amendment that was inspired by bipartisan legislation that I \nintroduced earlier this year, with Representatives Knight and Costello, \nand that was identified as a legislative priority by the Bipartisan \nTask Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic that I proudly serve on with \nso many of my colleagues here in this House.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is not a community in this great country that \nhasn't been touched by drug addiction, not one. Addiction knows no \nbounds. It knows no race, no gender, no economic status, no party \naffiliation.\n  In January, I was honored to have James Wardwell, the Chief of Police \nin New Britain, Connecticut, join me for the President's State of the \nUnion Address, and he came to join me because of his leadership and his \nconcern about the need to address this growing public health crisis.\n  Chief Wardwell, and many other first responders, medical \nprofessionals, substance abuse counselors, family members, and \nrecovering addicts, have worked with me to help craft legislation to \naddress our growing epidemic of prescription drug and heroin addiction.\n  I am glad that today, this House is taking action. Today's \nlegislation is an example of what we, in Congress, are supposed to be \ndoing. Our job is to work together, Democrats and Republicans, to \naddress the needs of the American people.\n  Whenever I go home to central and northwest Connecticut, at community \nforums in Torrington, at Congress on Your Corner events in Waterbury \nand the Farmington Valley, constituents come up to me and ask: What are \nyou in Congress doing to help our families with the heroin epidemic?\n  The families in Connecticut and across this country who are losing \nloved ones to drug addiction cannot afford for us to wait. We need to \nact now.\n  Recovering from addiction is possible, but it is hard. So much of our \neffort to combat drug addiction is focused on helping folks get the \ntreatment they need, and that is important, but it is not enough to \ntreat the crisis. We must help prevent people from getting addicted in \nthe first place.\n  Our bipartisan amendment does just that by directing the interagency \ntask force to establish guidelines that help prescribers more \neffectively and safely manage their patients' pain, and that \nstrengthens consumer education about opioid addiction.\n  Our amendment takes an important step toward preventing drug \naddiction. Those who prescribe narcotics would benefit from an \nincreased education about the dangers of addiction and ways in which \nthey can help minimize the risks associated with prescribing narcotics.\n  Those hardest hit by this epidemic would benefit from having access \nto educational materials in our schools, community centers, and from \nlocal law enforcement, that help warn people about the dangers of \nopioid use and possible addiction.\n  I am very encouraged that the House and Senate are taking action to \naddress this public health crisis, and I will continue doing everything \nwithin my power to make addiction prevention a priority.\n  Opioid and heroin addiction have already taken so many young lives \nand\n\n[[Page H2246]]\n\nneedlessly torn apart so many families. We can't wait for more lives to \nbe destroyed before we take action.\n  So let's work together today to prevent our children, our students, \nour patients, our neighbors, our families, and our friends, from \nbecoming victims of this terrible public health crisis. Let's work \ntogether today to stop drug addiction before it begins.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nbut I support the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut for this important amendment.\n  Certainly, the job of the interagency task force, besides producing \nbest practices and reviewing and modifying and talking about them, is \nnot just to generate a report that Congress will have, as I have said, \nsitting on a shelf someplace, and that our staff or the Congressional \nResearch Service can look at and study; it is really meant to educate \nthe public, to educate the public, whether or not they are people in \nschools, whether or not they are in our hospitals.\n  But I think, most importantly, we need to make sure that our \nprescribers are being educated. We have had roundtable discussions with \nour medical educators, and there is a push around the country, and I \napplaud that push around the country of our medical educators, whether \nit is in our med schools for physicians or for nursing programs, dental \nprograms, but to try to start at a much earlier level in their medical \neducation about the research and the studies and the best practices \naround opioids.\n  Certainly, as being a lawyer, we are required to do continuing \nmedical or continuing legal education, and it is something that I know \nthat physicians and prescribers are certainly required to get \ncontinuing medical education. I just want to continue to encourage and \napplaud them for seeking out that medical education around opioids. I \nthink it is critically important.\n  With this amendment, I think it will strengthen and educate our \nprescribers about the need to continue to educate themselves on pain \nmanagement practices and the use of opioids.\n  I urge the amendment's passage.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, again, I would like to thank my colleague, \nRepresentative Knight, for cosponsoring this amendment. I would like to \nthank the bipartisan leadership for taking up this issue, and my good \nfriend, the gentlewoman from Indiana, Representative Brooks, for her \nleadership. I would like to thank the advocates in Connecticut who have \nworked so tirelessly with me, Chief Wardwell and Shawn Lang, among \nothers. Shawn Lang recently was recognized by the White House for her \nadvocacy and leadership on this issue for many, many years.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Welch\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom Vermont (Mr. Welch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, on January 8, 2014, an extraordinary thing \nhappened in Vermont. Our Governor, Peter Shumlin, giving a State of the \nState Address, devoted its entirety to the opioid epidemic in Vermont. \nI remember how stunned people were that a Governor would take such a \ndifficult topic and spend his entire address on it. I remember the \nreaction of many of my colleagues here, who said: Peter, isn't that \ndangerous? You are talking about something that is not great for the \nreputation of the State.\n  What, in fact, was great for the reputation of the State was that our \nGovernor and our leaders acknowledged the existence of a problem that \nwas creating heartbreak and heartache in all of our communities; and a \nproblem acknowledged is the first step in dealing with a problem to be \nsolved.\n  Since then, Vermont has been extraordinary in its efforts to attack \nthis problem. Communities like Rutland, St. Albans, Barre, and \nBurlington have coordinated with the police force, with our medical \nproviders and our hospitals to provide a treatment-based approach to \nhelping folks who have an addiction to opioids--many of them coming by \nit as a result of prescriptions for legitimate medical needs.\n  We had, in Rutland, a community coming together to create Project \nVISION, which has faith-based groups, the police, and the medical \ncommunity doing everything they can to basically give individual \nattention to folks who are trying to help themselves get off of \nopiates.\n  The problem continues to be severe, but what we have is a community \nthat is fully engaged in it, including our State legislature, which \nprovided funds for treatment--a treatment-based approach--to helping \npeople with a hub-and-spoke system that is really working well. Folks \nwho are getting prescriptions, folks who have a problem, an addiction, \nare getting access to methadone or other prescribed products, take that \nin a hub so it is supervised, and they are able then to go to work.\n  So this has been a situation in Vermont where, as a result of the \nGovernor's focus on the problem, we have had community engagement to \nstem the tide of this issue.\n  It has been working, but challenges remain because we don't have \nenough treatment funds. This legislation is an important acknowledgment \non the part of Congress that we are getting it, that across this \ncountry we are all being affected by the challenges that our \ncommunities face.\n  I thank the sponsors of this legislation, Mr. Pallone, and Mr. Upton, \ntoo, for their leadership.\n  My hope, by the way, is that we get the message, too, in Congress \nthat we have got to send some funds back to our communities that are \nstruggling with these programs. We can't micromanage the treatment \nhere. It is up to the courageous people in our communities to do it, \nand some of the tax dollars that they send to us we have got to send \nback to them. That is why I, among others, am supporting an emergency \nappropriation of $600 million. That would help quite a bit.\n  The amendment that I have on this bill, which establishes an \ninteragency task force to review, modify, and update the best practices \nfor pain management, would ask that we also review developing nonopioid \nforms of pain relief. If opioids diminish pain but they create misery, \nlet's find another way to do it and help our folks who need pain relief \nto get it.\n  The second thing, it would examine existing nonopioid alternatives \nthat could be better utilized.\n  So this is tremendous that there has been such a bipartisan coming \ntogether\n\n[[Page H2247]]\n\nto sponsor practical steps that we can take. I see us in Congress as \nessentially acknowledging what Governor Shumlin identified as a real \nproblem for us and we are hearing about in our communities. But I hope \nwe are ready to take some next steps and actually focus on getting \nresources back to our communities that are doing the very, very \nchallenging work at the local level where it needs to be done to help \nfolks relieve themselves from the addiction of opioids.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 15 Offered by Mr. Sessions\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, after line 25, insert the following (and \n     redesignate the subsequent subsections accordingly):\n       (e) Consideration of Study Results.--In reviewing, \n     modifying, and updating, best practices for pain management \n     and prescribing pain medication, the task force shall take \n     into consideration existing private sector, State, and local \n     government efforts related to pain management and prescribing \n     pain medication.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Sessions) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I want to take time to recognize the \ngentleman from New Jersey, representing the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, and the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) for their \nservice not only to this conference, but also to the issues and the \nideas that are being brought forth.\n  The gentlewoman from Indiana has served our Nation as a United States \nattorney in Indiana. She has been on the front line of battles, albeit \na few years ago, but the front line of battles that the American people \nface, how we protect the American public from all sorts of things that \nget in our way as families and communities. But in this case today, she \nis serving as a Member of Congress firsthand to fight a problem with \nopioids. Opioids are a synthetic heroin, Mr. Chairman, and synthetic \nheroin is a national problem. It is a national problem and one which \nthis Congress is undertaking.\n  We are following up today on the United States Senate bill and this \nbill that came through regular order in the House of Representatives \nunder two primary committees. The Judiciary Committee and the Energy \nand Commerce Committee have addressed bills that are being debated \ntoday that will be passed, will be done in a bipartisan way, and will \nbring the best ideas of the House of Representatives to the plate. With \nthat in mind, that is what I stand for today, sir, to do.\n  I join in, as my colleague from Vermont has done, in adding to this \ninteragency task force with an amendment that I brought forth that I \nwould ask us to consider. I will offer this amendment to ensure that \nthe existing best practices of State and local governments, as well as \nthe private sector, are specifically considered as the task force which \nwas established by H.R. 4641 conducts their business.\n  Mr. Chairman, the opportunity for us to understand the amendment \nprocess means that not only I, but also other Members of this body, \nbring forth ideas that we think are the best ways to combat this \nproblem. I believe in State and local governments. I believe in the \nprivate sector. I think they are the essence of, really, where the \nrubber meets the road on the solution of problems, not to kick around \nideas and to find something that doesn't work, but to kick around ideas \nthat do work.\n  Local communities, local governments, and the private sector \ncollaborate back home daily. They do this in Dallas, Texas, which is my \nhome, which I represent, and we have something that is called the \nDallas Area Drug Prevention Partnership. It was established in 2007, \nand it represents what I believe is the best collaborative effort \nbetween local communities focusing on preventing drug abuse.\n  A few years ago, Dallas, Texas, the epicenter of something that was a \nheroin epidemic, was looking at a marketing effort by Mexican drug \ndealers with something that was called cheese. Cheese was a marketing \neffort, but it was heroin, and it was being packaged and sold as \ncheese. In fact, it caused the death of some 25 people in Dallas, \nTexas, very quickly before law enforcement recognized what the problem \nwas.\n  Law enforcement worked with community leaders, church leaders, \nreligious leaders, Boy Scout troops, Girl Scout troops, youth groups, \nYMCAs, and we got a handle on what the problem was. But it was not \nsolved by the Federal Government. It was not done just by an \ninteragency departmental group of people in Washington, D.C. It was \nsolved with Washington, D.C., and with people back home who saw the \nproblem firsthand, who took responsibility for the problem firsthand.\n  In this case, what we are trying to say is we are dealing with a \nnationwide epidemic, a nationwide epidemic which we have spoken very \nplainly about today that is one that is caused through opioid use and \nthen the transition to heroin at some point in a person's life. It is \ncreating thousands of deaths across our country. Something must be \ndone. But the something to be done is a collaborative effort between \nthe Federal Government, interagency responsibility up in Washington and \nother places back home, but with State and local organizations and with \nprivate sector organizations that really will be not just the boots on \nthe ground, but many times with the best expertise about the best way \nto do it in the best place.\n  Mr. Chairman, I bring forth this amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. \nClark) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on H.R. 4843.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4843, the Infant Plan of Safe \nCare Improvement Act.\n  Every 25 minutes in America, a baby is born suffering from opiate \nwithdrawal. It is an eye-opening statistic. The more you consider what \nit really means, the more tragic it becomes.\n  Every 25 minutes a child enters the world having already been exposed \nto drugs. Every 25 minutes a newborn has to pay the price for something \nthat he or she was defenseless against. Every 25 minutes another infant \nbecomes a victim of the national opiate crisis.\n  These are the victims this bill will help protect. Federal policies, \nincluding the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA, have \nlong supported State efforts to identify, assess, and treat children \nwho are victims of abuse and neglect.\n  The law provides States with resources to improve their child \nprotective services systems if they assure the Department of Health and \nHuman Services that they have put in place certain child welfare \npolicies, for example, requiring healthcare providers to notify child \nprotective service agencies when a child is born with prenatal illegal \nsubstance exposure and requiring the development of something known as \na safe care plan to keep these newborns and their caregivers healthy \nand safe.\n  Last year a Reuters investigation examined the care that infants \nreceive when they are born to parents struggling with opiate addiction. \nThe investigation detailed the heartbreaking consequences those infants \nhad to endure, consequences like suffering through the physical pain of \nwithdrawal and, in the most shocking cases, terrible deaths.\n  It is hard to imagine that stories like these could be any more \ntragic. Unfortunately, they are because they should have and, in many \ncases, could have been prevented. As Reuters revealed, HHS is providing \nFederal funds to States that do not have the necessary child welfare \npolicies in place.\n  In short, the law is not being properly followed and enforced and \nsome of our most vulnerable children and families are slipping through \nthe cracks.\n  That is why Representative Clark and I worked with a number of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and introduced the legislation \nbefore us today. The bill requires HHS to better ensure States are \nmeeting their legal responsibilities when it comes to preventing and \nresponding to child abuse and neglect.\n  Through a number of commonsense measures, it strengthens protections \nfor infants born with illegal substance exposure, improves \naccountability related to the care of infants and their families, and \nensures States will have the best practices for developing plans to \nkeep infants and their caregivers healthy and safe.\n  As the House works this week to fight the opiate epidemic that is \ndestroying communities and lives across the country, these are \ncommonsense reforms that we all should embrace. By working together and \nadvancing this legislation, we can help ensure these children, their \nmothers, and their families have the help they need and the care that \nthey deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I am pleased to join with Representative Barletta to introduce this \nimportant bill to help the most vulnerable victims of the opioid \nepidemic.\n\n[[Page H2249]]\n\n  In every corner of our country, the opioid crisis is having a \ndevastating effect. In Massachusetts, last year 1,379 people succumbed \nto fatal overdoses. Nationwide, drug overdoses are the leading cause of \naccidental death and we lose 129 people a day to fatal drug overdoses. \nThis epidemic doesn't see race, gender, income, or political ideology \nand does not spare newborns and infants.\n  We know that every 25 minutes a baby is born suffering from opioid \nwithdrawal symptoms. This is a condition known as neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome. While there is no silver bullet to address this crisis in our \ncountry, this bill takes important steps to help.\n  This bill, the Infant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act, strengthens \nand updates the care plans required by the Child Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Act of 1974, also known as CAPTA.\n  CAPTA itself is up for reauthorization. This is just one portion of \nthat important legislation where timely reauthorization will protect \nchildren in many different and difficult situations.\n  This legislation will help infants by ensuring that States have \naccess to the best practices for establishing safe care plans for \nnewborns with prenatal substance exposure.\n  It will also improve accountability by collecting data on the \nincidence of babies born exposed to drugs and the care that is provided \nto them and their families.\n  Perhaps most importantly, it will prevent tragedies by ensuring that \nbabies and their moms and their families have the supports they need to \nbe healthy and to build a future. We know that children have the best \nopportunity to thrive when their parents and caregivers are at the \ncenter of care.\n  I am grateful to the partnership with Representative Barletta and \nglad that we are taking this important step with this bill to ensure \nthat the whole family is healthy and successful and supported.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Kline), the chairman of the Education and the Workforce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Barletta for yielding the time \nand for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Infant Plan of \nSafe Care Improvement Act. Like many of the bills the House has slated \nto consider this week, this legislation will help address the growing \nopioid epidemic that has swept across America, focusing specifically on \nthe most vulnerable among us.\n  This crisis has led to a number of painful consequences for \nindividuals and families across the country. But few are as tragic as \nthose suffered by infants born to parents struggling with an opioid \naddiction.\n  As is often the case with addiction, the parents' struggle affects \nthose around them, including their newborns. In fact, according to a \nrecent Reuters investigation mentioned earlier by Mr. Barletta, more \nthan 130,000 babies born in the United States in the last decade \nentered the world addicted to drugs.\n\n  This report described the pain suffered by newborns going through \nwithdrawal and told the stories of infants who actually lost their \nlives because of a terrible addiction. Many of the stories are too \ndisturbing to even mention. But perhaps even more disturbing than the \ndetails is the fact that these deaths should have been prevented.\n  Current policies, including the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment \nAct, are meant to prevent these tragedies from ever happening. The law \nis simple. If a State wants to receive Federal funding, then the State \nhas to provide some basic assurances about their child welfare \npolicies. The Department of Health and Human Services has a \nresponsibility to ensure those policies are actually in place.\n  As we now know all too well, this important Federal law is not being \nproperly followed and enforced. Earlier this year I sent a letter to \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to better understand how it \nworks with States to ensure they are meeting current child welfare \nrequirements.\n  Not surprisingly, the Department passed the buck and suggested recent \nchanges to the law somehow absolved them from their enforcement \nresponsibilities, a disappointing response, to say the least.\n  Fortunately, thanks to the work of Mr. Barletta and Ms. Clark, we are \nhere today to consider our response to this preventable problem: the \nbill before us today. I appreciate their leadership in developing a \nbipartisan bill that will require the Department to do its job and \nassist States in their efforts to prevent and respond to child abuse \nand neglect.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and to \nhelp ensure the most vulnerable victims of the opioid epidemic receive \nthe help and care they desperately need.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4843, \nthe Infant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of our highest national priorities should be to \nensure that children have early quality opportunities to remove \nbarriers to success in future life. But children born dependent on \naddictive substances face severe obstacles to overcome, and we know \nthat many of these obstacles can be removed.\n  The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA, is meant to \nsupport infants born addicted to these illegal substances. \nUnfortunately, nearly every State fails to follow the CAPTA \nrequirements, which work to ensure that children born of these \ncircumstances have a plan of safe care that will help them grow up \nhealthy.\n  H.R. 4843 is a strong positive first step to safeguard the well-being \nof our Nation's most vulnerable children. It will strengthen an \ninfant's plan of safe care. It will help families and caregivers give \nthe guidance and support they need in order to provide a nurturing \nenvironment for these children.\n  I welcome this bipartisan agreement to amend CAPTA as part of the \ncomprehensive efforts to intervene and treat those affected by \nsubstance abuse. I therefore urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4843.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for his leadership on this issue \nand so many involving the welfare and health of our children.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, in response to an inquiry from the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee Chairman Kline and Chairman \nRokita of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and \nSecondary Education, HHS indicated that it would request additional \ninformation from States regarding their child protective services \nnotification processes and plans of safe care policies. HHS has started \nthis process.\n  I include in the Record the HHS Children's Bureau Program Instruction \nrequesting this additional information.\n\n              U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\n\n             Administration on Children, Youth and Families\n\n       1.

Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) State Plan \n                        Requirements and Update\n\n       States submitted a plan for the CAPTA State Grant on June \n     30, 2011. Once approved by CB, the CAPTA State Plan remains \n     in effect for the duration of the state's participation in \n     the CAPTA State Grant program. However, section 108(e) of \n     CAPTA requires states receiving a CAPTA State Grant to submit \n     an annual report describing its use of the grant. To \n     facilitate coordination between the CAPTA State Plan and the \n     title IV-B plan, as required by section 106(b)(2)(A) of \n     CAPTA, CB requires that the annual report describing use of \n     CAPTA funds be submitted with the APSR. In addition, CB \n     encourages states to use CAPTA State Grant funds in a manner \n     that aligns with and supports their overall goals for the \n     delivery and improvement of child welfare services, as they \n     continue to implement their 2015-2019 CFSP and APSR goals.\n\n\n                In the State's 2017 Annual CAPTA Report\n\n       Describe substantive changes, if any, to state law or \n     regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the \n     prevention of child abuse and neglect, that could affect the \n     state's eligibility for the CAPTA State Grant (section \n     106(b)(1)(C)(i) of CAPTA). The state must also include an \n     explanation from the State Attorney General as to why the \n     change would, or would not, affect eligibility. (Note: States \n     do not have to notify ACF of statutory changes or submit them \n     for review if they are not substantive and would not \n     affect eligibility.)\n       Describe any significant changes from the state's \n     previously approved CAPTA plan in how the state proposes to \n     use funds to support the 14 program areas enumerated in \n     section 106(a) of CAPTA. (See section 106(b)(1)(C)(ii) of \n     CAPTA).\n       Describe how CAPTA State Grant funds were used, alone or in \n     combination with other federal funds, in support of the \n     state's approved CAPTA plan to meet the purposes of the \n     program since the state submitted its last update on June 30, \n     2015 (section 108(e) of CAPTA).\n       Submit a copy of the annual report(s) from the citizen \n     review panels and a copy of the state agency's most recent \n     response(s) to the panels and state and local child \n     protective services agencies, as required by section \n     106(c)(6) of CAPTA.\n       Update on Services to Substance-Exposed Newborns\n       In addition to the information outlined above, CB requests \n     an update from states on implementation of CAPTA provisions \n     relating to substance-exposed newborns. Sections \n     106(b)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii) of CAPTA require states to have a \n     statewide program relating to child abuse and neglect that \n     includes:\n       --policies and procedures (including appropriate referrals \n     to child protection service systems and for other appropriate \n     services) to address the needs of infants born with and \n     identified as being affected by illegal substance abuse or \n     withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure, or \n     a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, including a requirement \n     that health care providers involved in the delivery or care \n     of such infants notify the child protective services system \n     of the occurrence of such condition of such infants, except \n     that such notification shall not be construed to--\n       I. establish a definition under Federal law of what \n     constitutes child abuse or neglect; or\n       II. require prosecution for any illegal action.\n       --the development of a plan of safe care for the infant \n     born and identified as being affected by illegal substance \n     abuse or withdrawal symptoms or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \n     Disorder.\n       The most recent national data on child abuse and neglect \n     from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System \n     (NCANDS) showed increases in FY 2014 compared to FY 2013 in \n     the number of children referred to CPS, the number of \n     children who received a CPS investigation or alternative \n     response and the number of children who were determined to be \n     victims of child abuse and neglect. While increases \n     nationally were relatively small, some states saw increases \n     of 15 percent or more in the number of children determined to \n     be victims. Nationally, states reported to NCANDS that more \n     than one-quarter (27.4%) of victims were younger than 3 years \n     and that the victimization rate was highest for children \n     younger than 1 year (24.4 per 1,000 children in the \n     population of the same age).\n       State commentary and data on risk factors associated with \n     reports of abuse and neglect indicate that caretaker alcohol \n     and drug abuse are significant factors associated with \n     reports of child abuse and neglect. For states reporting to \n     NCANDS, 9.2 percent of victims and 3.8 percent of nonvictims \n     were reported with the alcohol abuse caregiver risk factor \n     and 26.0 percent of victims and 8.2 percent of nonvictims \n     were reported with the drug abuse caregiver risk factor. \n     Beyond reports to NCANDS, increasing public attention is \n     being paid to the significant effect of opioid addiction on \n     individuals, families and communities.\n       In light of these trends, states are requested to provide \n     an update on their implementation of these provisions of \n     CAPTA.\n\n\n                    In the 2017 CAPTA Annual Report\n\n       Describe the policies and procedures the state has in place \n     to address the needs of infants born with and identified as \n     being affected by illegal substance abuse or withdrawal \n     symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure, or a Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, including a requirement that \n     health care providers involved in the delivery or care of \n     such infants notify the child protective services system of \n     the occurrence of such condition of such infants (section \n     106(b)(2)(B)(ii) of CAPTA). We note that such notification \n     should occur in any instance in which an infant is \n     demonstrating withdrawal symptoms due to prenatal drug \n     exposure, whether the drugs were obtained legally or \n     illegally.\n       Describe the state's policies and procedures for developing \n     a plan of safe care for infants born and identified as being \n     affected by illegal substance abuse or withdrawal symptoms or \n     Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (section 106(b)(2)(B)(iii)). \n     Describe which agency or entity is responsible for developing \n     a plan of safe care, how it is monitored and how follow-up is \n     conducted to ensure the safety of these infants.\n       Describe any technical assistance the state needs to \n     improve practice and implementation in these areas, including \n     how to support mothers and families, as well as infants, \n     through a plan of safe care.\n       Amendments to CAPTA made by P.L. 114-22, the Justice for \n     Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015:\n       As noted in Section A of this PI, the Justice for Victims \n     of Trafficking Act of 2015 included amendments to CAPTA that \n     become effective on May 29, 2017.\n       The law amended CAPTA's definition of ``child abuse and \n     neglect'' and ``sexual abuse'' by adding a special rule that \n     a child shall be considered a victim of `child abuse and \n     neglect' and of `sexual abuse' if the child is identified, by \n     a state or local agency employee of the state or locality \n     involved, as being a victim of sex trafficking or severe \n     forms of trafficking (as defined in sections 103(9)(A) and \n     (10) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA)).\n       --As defined in section 103(10) of TVPA, ``sex \n     trafficking'' means the recruitment, harboring, \n     transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or \n     soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex \n     act.\n       --As defined in section 103(9)(A) of TVPA, ``severe forms \n     of trafficking in persons'' means sex trafficking in which a \n     commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, \n     or in which the person induced to perform such act has not \n     attained 18 years of age.\n\n[[Page H2251]]\n\n       The amendments also specify that, notwithstanding the \n     general definition of a ``child'' in CAPTA, a state may opt \n     to apply the sex trafficking portion of the definition of \n     ``child abuse and neglect'' and ``sexual abuse'' to a person \n     who has not attained age 24.\n       In addition to expanding the definitions of child abuse and \n     neglect and sexual abuse applicable to the CAPTA State Grant, \n     the law added new requirements to the list of assurances a \n     state must provide to receive a CAPTA State Grant. Each state \n     will now need to provide an assurance that the state has in \n     effect and is operating a statewide program, relating to \n     child abuse and neglect that includes:\n       --provisions and procedures regarding identifying and \n     assessing all reports involving known or suspected child sex \n     trafficking victims (as defined in section 103(10) of the \n     Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) (22 U.S.C. \n     7102)); and\n       --provisions and procedures for training CPS workers about \n     identifying, assessing and providing comprehensive services \n     to children who are sex trafficking victims, including \n     efforts to coordinate with state law enforcement, juvenile \n     justice, and social service agencies such as runaway and \n     homeless youth shelters.\n       Finally, the amendments add to the list of data elements a \n     state must annually report, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, as a condition of receiving their CAPTA State \n     Grant. Beginning with submission of FY 2018 data, the CB \n     expects to ask states to report the number of children who \n     are victims of sex trafficking. The CB anticipates collecting \n     this information through NCANDS. Additional information on \n     NCANDS data reporting will be provided separately from this \n     PI.\n\n\n                    In the 2017 CAPTA Annual Report\n\n       Describe the steps that the state is taking or will need to \n     take to address the amendments to CAPTA relating to sex \n     trafficking in order to implement those provisions by May 29, \n     2017.\n       Provide an assessment of the changes the state will need to \n     make to its laws, policies or procedures to ensure that \n     victims of sex trafficking, as defined in sections 103(9)(A) \n     and (10) of the TVPA, are considered victims of child abuse \n     and neglect and sexual abuse. We note that it is likely that \n     some states will need to make changes to state laws to come \n     into compliance. Indicate whether the state is electing to \n     apply the sex trafficking portion of the definition of \n     ``child abuse and neglect'' and ``sexual abuse'' to persons \n     who are over age 18 but have not yet attained age 24.\n       Provide an update on the state's progress and planned \n     activities in the coming year to develop provisions and \n     procedures regarding identifying and assessing all reports \n     involving known or suspected child sex trafficking victims.\n       Provide an update on the state's progress and planned \n     activities in the coming year to develop provisions and \n     procedures for training CPS workers about identifying, \n     assessing and providing comprehensive services to children \n     who are sex trafficking victims, including efforts to \n     coordinate with state law enforcement, juvenile justice, and \n     social service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth \n     shelters.\n       In addition, no later than May 29, 2017, states must submit \n     the new CAPTA assurances relating to sex trafficking. These \n     assurances are to be provided in the form of a certification \n     signed by the State's Governor (see Attachment F). The signed \n     assurance may be returned with the 2017 CAPTA Annual Report \n     submitted with the APSR due June 30, 2016, if the state is \n     ready to submit them by that time. If not, the state may \n     submit the certification at a later date, but no later than \n     May 29, 2017.\n       If the state anticipates it will be unable to submit these \n     assurances by May 29, 2017, provide an explanation as to why \n     that is the case.\n       Identify any technical assistance needs the state has \n     identified relating to implementation of the amendments to \n     CAPTA made by the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of \n     2015.\n       States must include all required information indicated \n     above in their 2017 CAPTA Annual Report to be submitted as \n     part of the 2017 APSR. Missing or incomplete information will \n     result in the withholding of CAPTA funds until such time as \n     approval can be granted by CB. Please note that compliance \n     with the eligibility requirements for a CAPTA State Grant \n     program is a prerequisite for eligibility to receive finding \n     under the Children's Justice Act State Grant Program, \n     authorized by section 107(a) of CAPTA.\n       Finally, to facilitate ongoing communication between CB and \n     states on issues relating to CAPTA and child abuse and \n     neglect, please submit the name, address, and email for the \n     state CAPTA coordinator (also known as the State Liaison \n     Officer) or where this information can be found on the \n     state's website.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n4843, the Infant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act. Introduced by my \ncolleague and friend, Mr. Barletta, this bill takes steps to strengthen \nprotections for our Nation's most precious and vulnerable population: \ninfants and children.\n  In Pennsylvania alone, nearly 8,000 infants were diagnosed with \nneonatal abstinence syndrome between 2010 and 2014, and that number is \nincreasing every day.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS, is defined by the National \nInstitutes of Health as a set of problems that occurs in a newborn who \nwas exposed to addictive opiate drugs while in the mother's womb. \nInfants experiencing NAS can endure fevers, rapid breathing, seizures, \nand even death.\n  While States are currently required to certify to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services that they have developed a safe care plan for \ninfants born under these conditions, it has come to light that HHS does \nnot independently verify State plans unless there is a specific reason \nto do so.\n  My cosponsorship of this bill is a direct assertion of my belief that \nour Nation's infants deserve more from legislators, Federal agencies, \nand the administration. This valuable legislation will help clarify the \nintent of safe care plans, provide States with best practices for \nkeeping infants safe, and improve accountability across the board.\n  Mr. Speaker, every district in every State in the United States has \nbeen affected by what has been referred to as a substance abuse \nepidemic. While there is hope in the fact that the House is taking up \nmore than a dozen opioid bills this week, we must not lose sight of the \nlong road ahead of us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4843 and join the fight to \ndefend our Nation's children.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4843, the Infant Plan of Safe \nCare Improvement Act, because when newborn infants are tragically \naffected by illegal substance abuse, they deserve the best possible \ncare and treatment.\n  The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which was enacted in \n1974, set the groundwork for Federal coordination in addressing the \nissues of neglect and child abuse that is present in our country. H.R. \n4843 builds on that by updating and improving existing laws to ensure \nthat States are utilizing Federal dollars in a safe and effective way \nin providing care for children who suffer from illegal substance abuse, \nwithdrawal symptoms, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.\n  Under this bill, infants who are born with having had exposure to \nillegal substances will have strengthened protections through improved \nsafe care plans and best practices. As a lifelong pharmacist and \nhealthcare professional, I have seen firsthand families as they \nstruggle to provide the care that is needed by infants who suffer from \nthese conditions.\n  I commend Congressman Barletta and the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce for their leadership on this important legislation, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support this bill so we can care for \nprecious newborn infants across the country.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. I thank Mr. Barletta for what he is doing here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 4843, the \nInfant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act, which takes important steps \nin protecting our most vulnerable citizens from the damaging effects of \naddiction.\n  As communities in Michigan and around the country fight against the \ngrowing opioid epidemic, it is important for stakeholders at all levels \nto work together to reverse the trends of addiction and find solutions \nfor the families who are swept up by this public health crisis. \nTragically, we know that, every 25 minutes, a baby is born in our \ncountry having been exposed to drugs and suffering from opioid \nwithdrawal.\n\n[[Page H2252]]\n\n  A Federal law is already in place to help ensure these newborns have \nthe necessary protections and care once they are born, but the system \nis still failing some of our most defenseless children and their \nfamilies. Recent investigations have uncovered the failure of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to effectively monitor the \nimplementation of State-level plans to prevent child abuse and neglect, \nand some States are still receiving taxpayer dollars despite their not \nfollowing the laws that are in place to ensure the safe care of \nnewborns.\n  The bill we are considering today would require HHS to review and \nconfirm that States are properly following and enforcing the policies \nthat are outlined in Federal law to protect infants who are affected by \ndrug dependency. It also strengthens protections for infants who have \nbeen exposed to illegal substances, and it ensures best practices are \ndisseminated to States for developing plans to keep infants and their \ncaregivers safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must do better to provide these babies and their \nmothers with the help they need.\n  I thank my colleagues, Representatives Barletta and Clark, for their \nleadership in crafting this bipartisan bill, and I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to vote in support.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance \nof my time.\n  Again, many thanks to the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his \npartnership and his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am particularly proud that this legislation takes a \ncomprehensive look at not only protecting our newborns and infants but \nat putting the supports in place to ensure that their mothers and \nfathers and grandparents and families have the services they need and \ndeserve to have the best outcomes for these babies and children and \ntheir family units. I am very pleased that this bill is before us \ntoday, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  In closing, I reiterate the purpose and the importance of this \nlegislation. No government, Federal or State, should be allowed to \nskirt its responsibilities on the taxpayers' dime, especially when \nthose responsibilities involve the health and safety of children. We \nhave seen what can happen when they do, and none of us should be okay \nwith allowing those kinds of consequences to continue. Making sure they \ndon't is a responsibility that we all share.\n  In the end, this bill is not about pointing fingers or about placing \nblame. It is about the kids who need help, not only the infants who are \naffected by the opioid crisis, but all of the victims of child abuse \nand neglect. This bill is about ensuring that we work together to \nstrengthen the protections for our country's most vulnerable children \nand their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4843, the \n``Improving Safe Care for the Prevention of Infant Abuse and Neglect \nAct,'' approved by the Education and the Workforce Committee.\n  In the past decade and a half, the growth in the number of physicians \nprescribing opioids to help patients deal with pain from surgeries, \ndental work and chronic conditions has resulted in an increasing number \nof patients becoming dependent on the powerful and highly addictive \npainkillers--with patients not only abusing the use of those \npainkillers but often turning to heroin once their opioid prescription \nended.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly \n259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012, more than enough \nfor every adult in the United States, and it is estimated that in 2013 \nnearly 4.5 million people in the United States without a valid medical \nneed were using prescription painkillers.\n  The Health and Human Services Department estimates that the number of \nunintentional overdose deaths from prescription painkillers almost \nquadrupled between 1999 and 2013 and that abuse of prescription opioids \nnow kills nearly 30,000 Americans each year.\n  The ``Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act'' (CAPTA; PL 93-247) \nwas enacted in 1974 to coordinate federal and state efforts to prevent \nand respond to child abuse and neglect.\n  The law provides states with federal funds to improve their child \nprotective services systems; however, to receive the funds, states are \nsupposed to implement certain child welfare policies.\n  CAPTA was amended in 2003 by the ``Keeping Children and Families Safe \nAct,'' (PL 108-36) that requires health care providers to notify child \nprotective services agencies when a child is born with prenatal \nsubstance exposure or addiction.\n  The protective services agencies are supposed to develop a ``safe \ncare plan'' to protect the babies.\n  The law explicitly states that it is meant to protect drug-dependent \nnewborns and not to punish mothers who are dealing with addiction.\n  In December 2015, Reuters published the first in a series of articles \ndocumenting the failure of health care providers and state child \nprotective services to help these infants.\n  Based on information from 2013, the latest year for which data are \navailable, there were 27,000 cases of drug-dependent babies born that \nyear, up from 5,000 in 2003 when CAPTA's notification requirements were \nenacted.\n  However, more than 30 states do not require doctors to report cases \nof infants born with addictions.\n  Some states have interpreted the law to mean that only addiction to \nillegal substances need be reported.\n  This means that if the mother is taking prescribed drugs, even if the \ninfant is born with an addiction, they do not require that the \naddiction be reported.\n  In addition, even in states where infants born with drug dependencies \nmust be reported to child protective services agencies, these agencies \noften take no steps toward developing a safe care plan for these \ninfants.\n  As a result, infants die because of neglect or abuse in their homes.\n  Reuters identified 110 fatalities since 2010 of babies and toddlers \nwhose mother used opioids during pregnancy and who later died from \ncauses that could have been prevented.\n  I recognize that infant mortality is at unprecedentedly high rates in \nour nation.\n  Seeking to right the same wrongs as H.R. 4843, the ``Improving Safe \nCare for the Prevention of Infant Abuse and Neglect Act,'' I introduced \nthe ``Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016,'' or \nthe ``SIMARRA Act,'' which will help the Federal Bureau of Prisons to \nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal prison system \nfor pregnant offenders, by establishing a pilot program of critical-\nstage, developmental nurseries in Federal prisons for children born to \ninmates.\n  It is time that our nation recognizes a long-persistent need to break \nthe cycle of generational, institutional incarceration amongst mothers \nserving time for non-violent crimes and the children they birth behind \nprison bars.\n  H.R. 5130, the ``SIMARRA Act of 2016,'' gives those infants born to \nincarcerated mothers a chance to succeed in life.\n  ``SIMARRA'' is not merely yet another second chance program, \ndemanding leniency from the criminal justice system.\n  Instead, H.R. 5130 asks our national criminal justice system what it \ncan do for those young Americans born and relegated to a life of nearly \nimpossible odds of survival.\n  ``SIMARRA'' provides that first chance--a first chance for American \ninfants--that many of their mothers, born themselves to mothers behind \nbars, never received.\n  H.R. 4843 requires the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) to \nreview and confirm that states have enacted and implemented the child \nprotection policies required by the Child Abuse and Treatment Act, \nincluding the requirement that addicted newborns are cared for.\n  Specifically, in order to receive a grant for its child protective \nservices system, a state must certify that it has a law or statewide \nprogram for child abuse and neglect that includes a safe care plan for \nan infant born with substance addiction after the infant is released \nfrom the care of health care providers.\n  HHS must monitor the compliance of each state that receives a grant.\n  Under the measure, states must also develop and implement monitoring \nsystems to follow the safe care plans and determine whether local \nentities are providing referrals to, and delivery of, appropriate \nservices for the infant and the affected family or caregiver.\n  States must include in their annual data reports the total number of \naffected infants for whom a safe care plan was developed and for whom \nthere were referrals to appropriate services, including services for \nthe affected family or caregiver.\n  The bill requires HHS to maintain and disseminate information \nregarding the requirements and best practices relating to the \ndevelopment of safe care plans for infants born with substance \naddiction.\n\n[[Page H2253]]\n\n  H.R. 4843, the ``Improving Safe Care for the Prevention of Infant \nAbuse and Neglect Act,'' is a valuable piece of legislation that I \nencourage my colleagues to support.\n  Additionally, I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring and \nsupporting all legislation targeting the improvement of care for the \nprevention of infant abuse and neglect, such as H.R. 5130, the ``Stop \nInfant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016'' or the \n``SIMARRA Act.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4976, the Opioid Review \nModernization Act of 2016, introduced by the gentleman from New York \n(Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nLance).\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Opioid use disorder and overdose deaths have reached epidemic levels. \nA comprehensive approach is needed to reverse these trends and the \ntragic toll they have taken on families and communities across our \ncountry.\n  The Food and Drug Administration does have a critical role to play in \nsuch an approach. Patients living with serious pain must have access to \nsafe and effective therapies to help them function and lead productive \nlives. FDA reviews prescription pain relievers, like all new drug \nproducts, to determine whether their benefits outweigh their risks.\n  It is important that the FDA hear recommendations from expert \nadvisory committees prior to making key product and labeling decisions, \nparticularly to ensure that any such risks are effectively \ncommunicated, understood, and mitigated.\n  Specifically, H.R. 4976 requires that FDA receives input from an \nadvisory committee regarding approval of new opioids that do not \nutilize abuse-deterrent properties, in addition to developing a \nframework for labeling any opioid intended for pediatric use.\n  The bill also requires the agency to finalize guidance on evaluating \nabuse deterrence in generic opioid medications and issue \nrecommendations regarding prescriber education tied to the risk \nevaluation mitigation strategy programs.\n  This bill would strengthen FDA's Opioid Action Plan, defining \noutcomes with meaningful timeframes. I urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 4976.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4976, the Opioid Review \nModernization Act.\n  We know that there is not one solution addressing the opioid crisis \nthat is striking communities across the country. A comprehensive \napproach that balances the appropriate use of opioids, while deterring \nmisuse and diversion, requires the involvement of many government \nagencies, including the Food and Drug Administration.\n  As the agency tasked with reviewing pain medications for safety and \neffectiveness, we know that the FDA can play a critical role in \naddressing the safe use of these products for patients with chronic or \nacute pain.\n  I was pleased when the FDA announced earlier this year that the \nagency developed a comprehensive action plan to help reduce the burden \nof opioid abuse on American families and communities. In this plan, the \nFDA outlined concrete steps it intended to take, including:\n  Expanding its use of advisory committees before approving any new \nopioid drug that does not have abuse-deterrent properties;\n  Updating the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program to \nincorporate advisory committee recommendations regarding medical \ntraining on pain management and safe prescribing of opioids; and\n  Taking actions to expand patient access to abuse-deterrent \nformulations for opioids to help discourage their abuse.\n  The Opioid Review Modernization Act builds on these efforts and would \nrequire the FDA to work closely with expert advisory committees before \nmaking critical opioid approach and labeling decisions, develop \nrecommendations regarding prescriber education programs that address \nextended-release and long-acting opioids, including those who should \nparticipate and how often, and encouraging development and approval of \ngeneric opioids with abuse-deterrent properties.\n  H.R. 4976 will engage a key public agency, the FDA, to help address \nour current opioid crisis by improving regulatory oversight of opioids \nearly in the process while also assisting prescribers in the safe \ndispensing of these products.\n  I would like to thank Representative Sean Patrick Maloney and \nCongressman Leonard Lance for their leadership in introducing this \nbill. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4976.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance), my good friend and a fellow member of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank Mr. Guthrie of Kentucky and \nMr. Gene Green of Texas for their leadership on this overall issue. We \non the Energy and Commerce Committee have worked in a completely \nbipartisan fashion on this terrible crisis that affects the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4976, the Opioid Review \nModernization Act. I thank Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney from the \nState of New York for his partnership on this legislation, and I \ncertainly thank Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee for leading this and many other bipartisan bills \nto passage today that address this pressing national issue.\n  This bill and the larger package together are a great step forward in \nthe fight against the scourge of drug addiction. In my home State of \nNew Jersey, we face a drug epidemic that is hitting many communities \nhard, and that is true across the entire Nation. This crisis strains \nlaw enforcement and taxpayer resources, and, of course, tragically, it \ncuts too many lives short.\n  H.R. 4976 targets opioid addiction's strong ties to prescription drug \nabuse and the issue of overprescription. Studies have shown healthcare \nproviders write nearly 300 million opioid prescriptions a year in this \ncountry. That number is truly staggering.\n  Our legislation will make sure that the Food and Drug Administration \nrigorously reviews the benefits and risks of opioid pain medications \nand how they are communicated to prescribers and patients. The bill \nreforms critical product approval and labeling decisions and encourages \nthe development and approval of opioids with abuse-deterrent \nproperties.\n  Our Federal health agencies must be working in concert with the \nmedical and pharmaceutical communities to combat drug abuse, and this \nlegislation helps make that happen.\n\n[[Page H2256]]\n\n  Just last week I met with Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Prosecutor \nAnthony Kearns on what law enforcement is doing on the ground level to \nfight this epidemic. In New Jersey, Mr. Speaker, the county prosecutor \nis the equivalent of the county district attorney in most States across \nthe Nation.\n  Public servants like Prosecutor Kearns and others are doing all they \ncan to protect our children and keep our local communities drug free, \nbut this legislative package will help in their efforts and give them \nand other governmental entities more critical tools.\n  Those in Washington and local leaders need to be working together for \nthe benefit of the American people. H.R. 4976 and the larger package \nwill work toward that goal and ultimately help combat this drug abuse \ncrisis.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney), a cosponsor of this \nbill.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good \nfriend from Texas for yielding. I want to echo my thanks as well to \nChairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone and my good friend, Mr. Lance \nof New Jersey.\n  I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 4976, the Opioid Review \nModernization Act.\n  Heroin and opioid addiction is a serious and growing epidemic, \nespecially in the communities I represent in the lower Hudson Valley of \nNew York. After more than 55 townhalls with my neighbors across the \nHudson Valley in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, I can say there is no subject I \nhave heard about more in visits to communities throughout my district. \nReally, everywhere I go, I hear heartbreaking stories of addiction and \nof loss, and we have had far too many funerals.\n  I spoke to a woman named Cynthia in Newburgh who told me her son \nstruggles every day with addiction. He is trying to stay clean, but he \ncan't find a meeting locally to visit.\n  A woman named Samantha from Brewster said she is worried about the \nbasic lack of options for treating addicts like her son.\n  Patricia in Warwick has said the facilities there lack the basic \nnecessities for treating addicts like her son.\n  We have a shortage of beds for patients who are seeking treatment. In \nDutchess County, New York, alone, we have seen a 160 percent increase \nin the number of drug overdoses since 2009. This epidemic is being felt \nnationwide. It doesn't care about the color of your skin or the size of \nyour paycheck.\n  Deaths from heroin overdoses have more than tripled since 2010 in our \ncountry, and it is often driven by an addiction first to prescription \npain medicine. We now have more than 47,000 people dying a year, the \nequivalent of 125 Americans every day. It is a staggering figure, Mr. \nSpeaker, and we in Congress can and must do more to fight this growing \nepidemic.\n  So my bill takes an important, but simple, step to avoid opioid \naddiction and to avoid further loss by using both new technologies and \na little common sense.\n  Specifically, it would require the Food and Drug Administration to \nconsult with expert advisory committees for the approval of new opioids \nthat do not use deterrent properties, such as extended-release \ncapsules. We know this can thwart the misuse of these products by \npeople who are struggling with addiction.\n  Additionally, the legislation will encourage the development of \ngeneric opioids that utilize these abuse-deterrent properties. And, of \ncourse, the FDA can do more.\n  We can require them to evaluate and make recommendations on better \nprograms to prevent prescribers of opioids from overprescribing, since \nwe often hear that it is that overprescription that leads people into \ntrouble with opioids and, later, with heroin.\n  As part of a comprehensive package of legislation to combat the \nopioid epidemic, my bill is just one more tool in our toolkit, \nproviding incentives for pharmaceutical companies to use antiabuse \ntechnologies and create a plan to educate our well-meaning doctors \nabout the potential dangers of prescription opioids.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important measure.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill, the FDA's Opioid Action Plan, is important in \nour larger package of bills. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure, H.R. 4976.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I wish to voice my support for H.R. 4976, \nwhich would complement the efforts taken by the Food and Drug \nAdministration to combat the opioid abuse crisis.\n  The opioid epidemic has hit nearly all communities across the \ncountry--young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural. The Energy and \nCommerce Committee has held a number of hearings on this issue, \ninviting a wide range of stakeholders to come and share with us their \nsuggestions on how Congress can help to address this crisis. What has \nbeen made clear is that there is not one solution. It will take the \ncollaboration and expertise of a variety of agencies, and it must not \nonly appropriately account for the need for access to opioids for those \nwith acute and chronic pain, but it must also discourage misuse and \ndiversion.\n  As the public health agency responsible for reviewing pain \nmedications for safety and efficacy, the Food and Drug Administration \nshould play a critical role in making clear how prescription opioids \ncan be safely used, in encouraging the development of technologies to \nprevent abuse, and identifying what education would assist prescribers \nwho treat patients with opioids.\n  In February, FDA outlined an action plan that included a number of \nsteps focused on the agency's regulatory approach to opioids.\n  These actions included: reassessing the risk-benefit approval \nframework for opioid use; convening an expert advisory committee before \napproving any new drug application for an opioid that does not have \nabuse-deterrent properties; consulting with the Pediatric Advisory \nCommittee regarding recommendations for pediatric opioid labeling \nbefore any new labeling is approved; updating the Risk Evaluation and \nMitigation Strategy or REMS program for extended-release and long-\nacting opioids regarding prescriber training; developing changes to \nimmediate-release opioid labeling to include additional warnings and \nsafety information; reviewing options to make naloxone more accessible, \nsuch as availability over-the-counter; and strengthening post-market \nrequirements, among other steps.\n  I was pleased by the agency's announcement as I believe it was an \nimportant step forward in improving regulatory oversight of opioids, \nand would help to take another step towards addressing the opioid \ncrisis holistically.\n  H.R. 4976, the Opioid Review Modernization Act, was introduced by \nRepresentatives Sean Patrick Maloney and Leonard Lance to build on the \nactions announced by the FDA. The legislation would require the agency \nto work closely with expert advisory committees before making critical \nproduct approval and labeling decisions, make recommendations regarding \neducation programs for prescribers of extended-release and long-acting \nopioids, and would encourage the development and approval of generic \nopioids with abuse-deterrent properties.\n  These actions will be critical to improving the way we regulate \nopioids to ensure that these products are used safely and appropriately \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Stewart). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4976.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2256-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2256-H2259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CO-PRESCRIBING TO REDUCE OVERDOSES ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3680, the Co-Prescribing \nto Reduce Overdoses Act of 2016, introduced by my colleague on the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Sarbanes of Maryland.\n  In 1999, there were 6.1 overdose deaths per 100,000 Americans \ninvolving opioid analgesics and heroin. By 2014, that number doubled to \n14.7 overdose deaths. The rate of overdose for individuals aged 24 to \n34 nearly tripled, going from 8.1 overdose deaths per 100,000 to 23.1 \noverdose deaths.\n  Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can prevent opioid overdose \ndeaths by binding to the opioid receptors in the body and preventing \nthe overdose. The World Health Organization estimated that, if naloxone \nwas more widely available in the United States, more than 20,000 \noverdose deaths could be prevented annually.\n  H.R. 3680 is a step in promoting wider access of naloxone or other \nopioid-overdose reversal drugs that may come to market. It directs the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a grant program for \ncoprescribing opioid reversal drugs and helps develop best practices \nfor doing so.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for H.R. 3680, the Co-\nPrescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act. We must do more to prevent opioid \naddiction and ensure those currently suffering have access to \npotentially lifesaving treatments.\n  Naloxone has been proven effective in reversing opioid overdoses, and \nit is a cost-effective public health intervention. Naloxone blocks and \nreverses the effects of opioid medication and is used to treat narcotic \noverdose in emergency situations.\n\n[[Page H2258]]\n\n  In addition to recent efforts to improve access to naloxone through \nfirst responders and community-based health organizations, providing \nnaloxone to at-risk patients in a healthcare setting may reduce \noverdoses and encourage patients to use prescription drugs more safely.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  The Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act would create a \ndemonstration grant program to facilitate coprescribing of naloxone \nwhen appropriate.\n  Coprescribing refers to the practice of prescribing that naloxone \nalongside an opioid prescription to patients with heightened risk of \noverdose. This could include patients who take significant doses of \nopioids for long-term chronic pain management, patients with a history \nof substance abuse, or patients who have been discharged from emergency \ncare following poisoning or intoxication from an opiate.\n  The bill would further authorize funding to train healthcare \nproviders and pharmacists on coprescribing, establish mechanisms for \ntracking patients and their health outcomes, and other efforts to \nexpand access to naloxone.\n  We must act swiftly in order to save lives and stem the growing \nprescription drug epidemic in our country. The Co-Prescribing to Reduce \nOverdoses Act is an important step toward preventing overdose deaths, \nwhich is a critical part of the fight against our devastating drug \ncrisis.\n  I want to thank the bill's sponsor, the gentleman from Maryland, \nRepresentative John Sarbanes, who is a member of our Subcommittee on \nHealth, for his leadership in introducing this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Co-Prescribing to Reduce \nOverdoses Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the distinguished chairman of the Committee \non Transportation and Infrastructure.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3680, which is one of \nseveral initiatives being taken up by the House this week to combat the \ndevastating opioid epidemic our Nation is facing.\n  Every person in my district knows someone who has been impacted by \nthis crisis, and each day that we wait is another day we go without \ntaking action to save the lives of the people feeling the terrible \neffects of this addiction.\n  Each day without action is another day that our communities are \nravaged by these drugs.\n  We can combat this crisis and repair our communities. This is a \nneeded step that both Republicans and Democrats are working together to \nachieve.\n  I strongly support this legislation because it will provide funding \nto our health centers to coprescribe naloxone, a lifesaving drug.\n  My entire district has been plagued by the scourge of this crisis. \nThe alarming rise in overdose deaths show the urgent need for naloxone \nto be readily available to both healthcare professionals and those with \nincreased risk of overdose.\n  These efforts are one part of a broader solution that will \nundoubtedly save lives. I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for taking these steps, and I look forward to continuing to work \nto make our communities a safer place by ridding them of this epidemic.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3680.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 3 minutes \nto the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), my colleague on the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Ranking Members Pallone and Green, \nas well as Chairmen Upton and Pitts, for working diligently with me to \nbring this bill to the floor today.\n  This bipartisan bill, the Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act, \nwould create a demonstration project to encourage prescribing opioid \noverdose reversal drugs like naloxone to patients at an elevated risk \nof overdose, as well as to a close relative of such a patient.\n  Why is this bill needed, Mr. Speaker?\n  More than 100 Americans are dying every single day of preventable \ndrug overdose, and overdose fatality is now the leading cause of \naccidental death in the Nation.\n  In 2014, in my home State of Maryland, there were 887 opioid-related \ndeaths. In Baltimore, 192 people died from heroin overdoses. In Anne \nArundel County in 2014, there were 360 opioid overdoses, fatal and \nnonfatal; 49 of those were fatal.\n  The problem is getting worse. From 2001 to 2013, there was a fivefold \nincrease in the total number of deaths from heroin. This is an \nepidemic, but it is an epidemic that we can begin to stem if we take \naction.\n  Naloxone is a drug that safely and effectively reverses both opioid \nand heroin-induced overdoses, if administered in time. It has been used \nby nonmedical personnel with only minimal training for over 15 years, \nand has been proven to lower overdose mortality by almost 50 percent.\n  More people need access to this lifesaving medication. One part of \nthat proactive approach is the idea of coprescribing naloxone to \npatients, or their caregivers, who are taking opioids and are at high \nrisk of overdose.\n  The Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act would create a \ndemonstration project for federally qualified health centers, opioid \ntreatment centers, and other providers, to encourage coprescribing of \nnaloxone and other opioid reversal drugs.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the AMA, the American Society of \nAddiction Medicine; the American Academy of Family Physicians; and the \nHarm Reduction Coalition.\n  There are five Republican cosponsors, I am pleased to say, proving \nthat this is a bipartisan issue affecting virtually every part of the \ncountry.\n  I am pleased as well to note that the bill received unanimous support \nin the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  I urge support of this bill today because I know that it will save \nlives and help begin to stem the tide of this terrible epidemic.\n  I also support the other bills being debated this evening, and \nbelieve that these are all important initiatives to address the opioid \ncrisis.\n  However, it is just as critical that we provide adequate resources \nfor all aspects of this epidemic to prevent addiction, to provide \neffective treatment, and to increase access to lifesaving opioid \nreversal drugs in order to truly bring an end to this epidemic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, one of the great privileges of the people's \nHouse, people come here from all walks of life with all different \nexpertise.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Carter), the only registered pharmacist that serves in the House \nof Representatives, who is here to speak on this and several of the \nbills today.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3680, the Co-Prescribing \nto Reduce Overdoses Act, which gives patients the tools they need to \nprotect themselves from opioid overdoses.\n  H.R. 3680 calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to \ncreate a grant program that will increase the ability for healthcare \nproviders to coprescribe opioid reversal medication like naloxone when \nthose providers prescribe opioid-based medications for patients.\n  This new direction by HHS will work to decrease the risk of fatally \noverdosing on opioids while also allowing healthcare providers to learn \nmore about the opioid reversal medication benefits.\n  In addition, with the grant money, providers will be able to track \npatient outcomes to make sure that the reversal medication has the \ndesired effect.\n  As a lifelong pharmacist, I consider it my duty to always care for my \npatients and give them every tool I can to protect and serve them the \nbest way I can, and I have carried this duty to the United States House \nof Representatives.\n  The Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act does just this and is a \nmajor step in the right direction to ending the opioid addiction deaths \nin America.\n\n[[Page H2259]]\n\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland \n(Mr. Sarbanes) bringing this forward and all the bipartisan work that \nwas put into it. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3680 the \n``Co-Prescribing To Reduce Overdoses Act of 2015.''\n  This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nto establish a grant program to support prescribing opioid overdose \nreversal drugs, such as naloxone, for patients at an elevated risk of \noverdose, including patients prescribed an opioid.\n  Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and \ncertain pain medications.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly \n259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012, more than enough \nfor every adult in the United States.\n  In 2013 nearly 4.5 million people in the United States without a \nvalid medical need were using prescription painkillers.\n  Both states and the federal government have begun responding to this \ngrowing public health crisis.\n  The Obama administration has awarded $94 million to community health \ncenters to improve and expand the delivery of substance abuse services.\n  H.R. 3680 would encourage and train health care providers to \nprescribe lifesaving overdose reversal drugs.\n  Enacting this legislation will help reduce drug overdoses across the \ncountry by giving at-risk patients better access to lifesaving overdose \nreversal drugs.\n  The plague of opioid overdose deaths across the nation is disturbing, \nbut there are ways to combat this trend.\n  H.R. 3680 is supported by the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine and the Harm Reduction \nCoalition.\n  A party, or organization receiving a grant under this legislation \nwill use the grant for the following reasons:\n  1. To establish a program for co-prescribing opioid overdose reversal \ndrugs.\n  2. To train and provide resources for health care providers and \npharmacists on the co-prescribing of opioid reversal drugs.\n  3. To establish mechanisms and processes for tracking patients \nparticipating in the program.\n  4. To purchase opioid overdose reversal drugs for distribution.\n  5. To offset the copays and other cost sharing associated with opioid \noverdose reversal drugs to ensure that cost is not a limiting factor \nfor eligible patients.\n  6.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4978, the Nurturing and \nSupporting Healthy Babies Act, sponsored by Representative Evan \nJenkins. This commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation contains two \nimportant policies which will help strengthen our efforts to curb \nopioid abuse.\n  First, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to \ncarefully study ways to improve care for babies born with neonatal \nabstinence syndrome, NAS. NAS is a drug-withdrawal syndrome that most \ncommonly occurs after an in-utero exposure to opioids that has, sadly, \ngrown into prevalence in recent years.\n  As the New England Journal of Medicine noted last year, from 2000 \nthrough 2009, the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome in the \nUnited States nearly tripled, with several States reporting even larger \nrecent increases.\n  That same study noted that, in 2013, the number of NICU hospital days \nnationwide attributed to the care of infants with NAS was six to seven \ntimes greater than it was in 2004.\n  So this bill will expand our knowledge of care of NAS babies by \nrequiring GAO to study what is known about the prevalence of NAS in the \nUnited States, the number of NAS babies covered by Medicaid, the \nsettings for care of NAS babies, and access to care for NAS babies \nunder State Medicaid programs.\n  Based on the recommendation of Representative Andy Barr, the bill \nalso directs GAO to identify what is known about best practices \nproviding care for infants with NAS.\n  This comprehensive study, including the research focusing on best \npractices, can help us improve our efforts to provide care for some of \nthe most vulnerable among us.\n  This bill takes a second important step to help combat opioid abuse \nby fixing an unintended consequence with the Medicaid drug rebate \nprogram that effectively discourages drug manufacturers from producing \nopioids that are harder to abuse.\n  Specifically, this second policy would exempt abuse-deterrent \nformulations of drugs from the definition of ``line extension'' for the \npurpose of calculating Medicaid rebates.\n  Abuse-deterrent formulations of drugs represent a critically \nimportant tool in the Federal policy toolbox. In its Opioids Action \nPlan, FDA said its goal is to ``expand access to abuse-deterrent \nformulations to discourage abuse.'' And in its ADF guidance to \nmanufacturers, the agency said it ``considers the development of these \nproducts a high public health priority.''\n  This policy enjoys bipartisan support, and was introduced by \nRepresentative Bilirakis previously. This policy was also included in \nthe President's FY 2017 budget, which noted that correcting the law \nwould ``incentivize continued development of abuse-deterrent \nformulations.''\n  This policy can help save lives. Currently, more than 4 million \nAmericans misuse or abuse prescription painkillers and more than 16,000 \nindividuals die from prescription painkiller overdoses each year. This \nchange will help ensure there is continued investment in important \nabuse-deterrent drug technologies to help reduce the number of patients \nwho abuse opioid drugs.\n  Finally, to help offset the cost of the Medicaid drug rebate change, \nthis bill includes a third policy that was introduced by Representative \nBilirakis in the past, and recently was included in the President's \n2017 budget.\n  It would protect from public disclosure the program integrity \nalgorithms CMS uses to identify and predict waste, fraud, and abuse in \nMedicare, Medicaid, and CHIP.\n  Today the mathematical algorithms and predictive technologies that \nCMS uses in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP are vital to uncovering fraud, \nwaste, and abuse.\n  However, if various aspects of these algorithms were to become \npublicly known, fraudsters could utilize the information to redirect \ntheir schemes to avoid detection.\n  This policy would simply prevent the disclosure of these anti-fraud \ntools from freedom of information-related laws while still allowing CMS \nand State Medicaid and CHIP programs to freely share algorithms and \nother predictive analytic tools. Doing so saves taxpayers money and \noffsets the cost of the rebate policy.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill would enhance our knowledge about how to care \nfor infants with NAS, encourage more abuse-deterrent formulations of \ndrugs, and prevent powerful, anti-fraud tools from falling into the \nwrong hands.\n  I urge support for this commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise to voice my support for H.R. 4978, \nthe Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act.\n  Nearly every community in every State has been impacted by heroin and \nopioid addiction. Tragically, newborns are the most vulnerable victims \nof this epidemic. It is estimated that every 25 minutes, a baby is born \nsuffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome, or opioid withdrawal. \nAccording to a study by the New England Journal of Medicine, from 2004 \nto 2013, the incidence of NAS has quadrupled.\n  Neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS, arises from the exposure to \nopioids during pregnancy and impacts far too many of our Nation's \nnewborns. Maternal exposure to opioids can be caused by both \nnonprescription and prescription medication, and the subsequent \nneonatal withdrawal can result in extended hospital stays and severe, \nheartbreaking symptoms.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  NAS is associated with preterm births and low birth weight \ncomplications such as respiratory distress and seizures.\n  H.R. 4978, the Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act, is an \nimportant part of our efforts to combat drug abuse. The legislation \nwill expand our knowledge of care and treatment for babies with NAS. It \nwill direct the GAO to identify the prevalence of NAS and the number of \ncases covered by Medicaid, the setting of care for these infants, and \nidentify access barriers to treatment. H.R. 4978 will further our \nability to meet this crisis head-on and provide America's children the \nhealthy start they deserve.\n  I want to thank the bill's sponsor, Representative Cheri Bustos, for \nher\n\n[[Page H2261]]\n\nleadership in introducing this bill and urge my colleagues to support \nthe Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), my friend and the sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, as you have just heard, \nevery 25 minutes in this Nation a baby is born who was exposed to drugs \nduring pregnancy. This is called neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS, \nand it is a devastating way to begin one's life.\n  Today before the House is the Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies \nAct. I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation that will expand \nour knowledge of care for babies born with NAS.\n  Hearing the sounds of babies crying as they experience drug \nwithdrawal is heartbreaking. We can only truly address this crisis by \nworking together. For the past 5 years, I have worked tirelessly in my \nhometown of Huntington, West Virginia, to help those treating newborns \nwith NAS and to help find new and innovative treatment methods.\n  This firsthand experience highlighted the many challenges facing \nhospitals, doctors, nurses, and others seeking to treat these babies, \nand it has shown me the suffering these babies experience and just how \nmuch we need to help them. This bill will bring much-needed information \non best practice models of care to our healthcare providers for the \nmost vulnerable impacted by this drug crisis.\n  Through this bill, we will also learn more about just how many \nnewborns are suffering from withdrawal and more about the Federal \nobstacles to treating them. This bill will bring us closer to \nguaranteeing a healthy and happy start to life for every newborn.\n  I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee's chairmen, Chairman Upton \nand Chairman Pitts, for their tireless work to find solutions to the \ndrug crisis and to help NAS babies start their lives healthy and happy. \nI thank Congresswoman Cheri Bustos for joining me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  We are making progress. We must continue to strive for solutions to \nthis tragic epidemic.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos).\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Gene Green for yielding \nme time and for working with me to find better treatment for babies \nborn with neonatal abstinence syndrome, also known as NAS.\n  Mr. Speaker, every 25 minutes, as we have heard, every 25 minutes in \nAmerica, another baby is born addicted to heroin or other deadly \nopioids. It results from their mother's struggle with addiction.\n  As the heroin epidemic sweeps our towns and our cities throughout the \nUnited States and impacts far too many families, many of the most \noverlooked victims have been the most vulnerable among us. It is heart-\nwrenching and it is terrible that an innocent newborn, trembling, \ncrying uncontrollably, clenching her small fists, and gasping for air, \nagain, is born every 25 minutes.\n  These are just a few of the symptoms babies face when they are born \naddicted to opioids, and nothing from my perspective as a mother and as \na grandmother could be more demanding of our immediate attention. That \nis why I joined Congressman Evan Jenkins from West Virginia to \nintroduce the Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation will improve care for babies born with \nneonatal abstinence syndrome. It will expand our knowledge of care for \nNAS babies, including its prevalence in the United States. It will also \nexamine access to care for NAS babies under the State Medicaid programs \nand direct the Government Accountability Office to identify any Federal \nobstacles to care for NAS babies.\n  In short, this legislation will do a top-to-bottom review to make \nsure we are doing everything we can to help babies born with addiction \nand withdrawal.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must do our part to help all children reach their \nfull potential.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis), my friend and colleague from the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4978, the \nNurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act. This bill will help our \nmost vulnerable Americans.\n  H.R. 4978 will require the GAO to study and report on the prevalence \nof neonatal abstinence syndrome to help determine the size and scope of \nthis prescription drug problem and its impact on newborns.\n  Neonatal abstinence syndrome refers to a group of conditions that \noccur when a child is born addicted to narcotics and is going through \nwithdrawal. This, unfortunately, affects my district in Florida and all \nover the country.\n  I visited babies in the hospital. In 2013, during a drug summit in \nPasco County, health officials discussed the growing problem of babies \nborn addicted to prescription drugs. Pinellas County, my home county, \nat that time ranked first in the State for babies born addicted. We \nmust do all we can to help those struggling infants and their families.\n  This bill also includes two provisions I have worked on to reform \nMedicaid payments for abuse deterrent formulations and fight fraud in \nMedicare and Medicaid. Currently, Medicaid does not sufficiently cover \nabuse deterrent formulations for generic drugs. During a hearing, I \nspoke to Secretary Burwell about this problem, and she expressed to me \nthe need for a legislative fix to this payment issue. This bill \nprovides a solution and helps prevent drug abuse within Medicaid.\n  This bill also includes a provision to protect the predictive \nanalytic algorithm which identifies and prevents the payment of \nimproper claims in Medicare. These tools, designed to prevent fraud, \nneed to be protected from being disclosed to bad actors.\n  Back in 2013, I introduced legislation to protect these predictive \nanalytic algorithms from the Freedom of Information Act disclosure, and \nH.R. 4978 includes this important legislation.\n  This legislation will help protect our newborns and all those facing \nprescription drug abuse and addiction.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Representative Jenkins and the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4978.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr), my good friend and fellow Kentuckian.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. \nGuthrie) for his leadership on this issue, and I want to thank my \ncolleague from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins) for his leadership on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support his \nbill, H.R. 4978, the NAS Healthy Babies Act, which seeks to increase \nour understanding of neonatal abstinence syndrome and would help \nfurther strengthen best practices for treating this dangerous but \npreventable condition.\n  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, there has been a \ndramatic increase in maternal opioid use; and as a tragic result, a \nbaby is born suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS, every \n25 minutes in the United States.\n  To help address this public health challenge, this legislation \ncontains language drafted in coordination with my constituent, \nUniversity of Kentucky pediatrician, Dr. Henrietta Bada-Ellzey, and \nmembers of the Sixth Congressional District Drug Abuse Task Force. \nSpecifically, this provision would mandate a study which would gain \ncritical data about the specific treatment options given to newborns \nwith NAS during and after their hospital stay and identify treatment \noutcomes. This vital information would help lead pediatricians to \nprovide improved care for the most vulnerable in our society.\n  I would like to thank the leader's office and the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee staff for giving me an opportunity to include this important \nrecommendation from the Sixth Congressional District Drug Abuse Task\n\n[[Page H2262]]\n\nForce in this legislation. The opioid heroin crisis in America impacts \nevery congressional district, and my district is not immune. So I am \nproud that the people's House is taking up a series of important \nmeasures to combat this scourge in our society, and I can't think of \nany more important measure than dealing with these innocent victims of \nNAS.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Wagner), my good friend.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Nurturing and Supporting \nHealthy Babies Act, which will improve care for babies who are so sadly \nsuffering from exposure to opioids while in their mother's womb.\n  Hospital usage for opioid overuse in Missouri increased 137 percent \nbetween 2005 and 2014, with the highest rates being in the St. Louis \nregion. We must do everything we can to combat this epidemic from all \nangles.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely heartbreaking to stand in front of you \nknowing that in the United States an opioid-dependent baby is born \nevery 20 minutes, immediately suffering from withdrawal: trembling, \ncrying inconsolably, and clenching their tiny muscles as they gasp for \nbreath.\n  My principal mission as a Member of this Chamber is to provide a \nvoice to the voiceless, and it is our duty to defend the most \nvulnerable. Ensuring babies have access to care and allowing them to \nrecover from these horrible physical and emotional circumstances is not \nonly common sense, but, Mr. Speaker, it is simply the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4978, and I thank \nRepresentative Evan Jenkins for introducing this legislation.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), my good friend.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for \nyielding and for his work on this most important subject, as well as \nthe gentleman from West Virginia.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4978, the NAS Healthy \nBabies Act because newborn infants deserve every opportunity to live a \nhappy and healthy life.\n  H.R. 4978 requires the Government Accountability Office to compile a \nreport on the amount of babies born each year with NAS, Medicaid \ninsurance coverage for families that have an NAS baby, and Federal \nobstacles for children who seek treatments for NAS. With this new \ninformation, we can increase our understanding of NAS and our ability \nto provide care for babies born with NAS. This new understanding is \nvital, considering the number of newborns with NAS has increased with \nthe rise in the number of Americans addicted to opioids.\n  As a lifelong pharmacist, I believe we should take every step \npossible to fight the addiction crisis in America, and the protection \nof our children should be our top priority. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, it cannot be said enough that every 25 \nminutes in this great country, there is a baby born addicted to drugs. \nLast year alone, 1,000 of those babies were born in the great State of \nMaine.\n  Now, 80 percent of these addicted infants are covered by Medicaid and \ntreated at local hospitals, but our hospitals are overwhelmed. They are \nnot equipped to provide the specialized care that these babies \ndesperately need to recover from the drugs in their tiny bodies. I am \nvery proud to serve as an original cosponsor of the Nurturing and \nSupporting Healthy Babies Act.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I am thrilled that this bill, Mr. Speaker, is being considered today \non the floor. I want to congratulate Congressman Evan Jenkins from West \nVirginia, a Republican, and I want to congratulate Congresswoman Bustos \nfrom Illinois, a Democrat, for their leadership on this issue. This is \nnot a political issue, Mr. Speaker. This is about our kids. This is \nabout our babies. This is about that generation.\n  H.R. 4978 made sure that we get the information we need as to how \nhospitals and other medical facilities are currently treating these \naddicted babies, such that we can fill in the gap with Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  Mr. Speaker, every baby born into this world deserves our compassion \nand our care. This bill offers real hope for a healthy and a safe and a \nloving start for thousands of American babies born addicted to drugs.\n  Let's all get together and get this done, Mr. Speaker. This is not a \npolitical issue. This is about our kids.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN from Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from West Virginia \nand our colleague from Illinois for moving this forward.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 4978, and I would like for my colleagues \nto vote for this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4978, the \n``Nurturing & Supporting Healthy Babies Act,'' approved by the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  In the past decade and a half, the growth in the number of physicians \nprescribing opioids to help patients deal with pain from surgeries, \ndental work and chronic conditions has resulted in an increasing number \nof patients becoming dependent on the powerful and highly addictive \npainkillers--with patients not only abusing the use of those \npainkillers but often turning to heroin once their opioid prescription \nended.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly \n259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012, more than enough \nfor every adult in the United States.\n  It is estimated that in 2013 nearly 4.5 million people in the United \nStates without a valid medical need were using prescription \npainkillers.\n  The Health and Human Services Department estimates that the number of \nunintentional overdose deaths from prescription painkillers almost \nquadrupled between 1999 and 2013 and that abuse of prescription opioids \nnow kills nearly 30,000 Americans each year.\n  Both states and the federal government have begun responding to this \ngrowing public health crisis, with many states moving to make anti-\noverdose drugs more available and shield first-responders from \nliability in administering those drugs.\n  President Obama, meanwhile, has updated prescribing guidelines to \nencourage doctors to be more cautious when prescribing opioid \npainkillers and to emphasize non-opioid therapies for certain \nconditions.\n  Additionally, the Obama administration has awarded $94 million to \ncommunity health centers to improve and expand the delivery of \nsubstance abuse services.\n  In the president's FY 2017 budget the administration proposed $1.1 \nbillion to combat drug addiction and is also considering modifying \ncertain rules to improve treatment.\n  Our counterparts in the Senate, on March 10, 2016, passed S. 524, an \nantiopioid abuse bill that would authorize grants for opioid treatment \nservices and first-responder training in using anti-overdose drug by a \n94-1 vote, as well as create a task force to review and update best \npractices for prescribing pain medication.\n  S. 524 also mandates investigations into heroin distribution and \nunlawful distribution of prescription opioids, and requires the \ncreation of a national drug awareness campaign that takes into account \nthe association between prescription opioid abuse and heroin use.\n  The science indicates that opioids can have particularly harrowing \neffects on infants whose mothers took the drugs during pregnancy, \nincluding medical issues stemming from drug withdrawal known as \nneonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  Advocacy groups note that the incidence of neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome almost tripled from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to \n3.39 per 1,000 hospital births in 2009.\n  In conjunction with H.R. 4978, the ``Nurturing & Supporting Healthy \nBabies Act,'' the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that \n45 percent of births in the United States are now covered by the joint \nfederal-state Medicaid program.\n  This bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to \nreport to Congress on neonatal abstinence syndrome among children \ncovered by Medicaid, including any federal barriers to treating such \ninfants.\n\n[[Page H2263]]\n\n  The GAO must also provide recommendations for improvements that will \nensure access to treatment for infants with neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome under state Medicaid programs.\n  Additionally, the measure modifies Medicaid to provide incentives for \nthe development of abuse-deterrent formulations of prescription drugs \nand to prevent disclosure of Medicaid anti-fraud algorithms.\n  The bill requires that GAO's report identify the prevalence of \nneonatal abstinence syndrome in the United States, including the \nproportion of affected children who are eligible for Medicaid at birth \nand the costs associated with neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  GAO will also be required to examine Medicaid-eligible services that \nare available for treatment of infants with neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome, settings for such treatment, related reimbursement \nmethodologies and costs, and the utilization of various care settings \nunder state Medicaid programs for such treatment.\n  This GAO's report must be submitted to Congress within one year of \nthe bill's enactment.\n  Seeking to right the same wrongs as H.R. 4978, the ``Nurturing And \nSupporting Healthy Babies Act,'' I introduced the, ``Stop Infant \nMortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016,'' or the ``SIMARRA \nAct,'' which will help the Federal Bureau of Prisons to improve the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the Federal prison system for pregnant \noffenders, by establishing a pilot program of critical-stage, \ndevelopmental nurseries in Federal prisons for children born to \ninmates.\n  It is time that our nation recognizes a long-persistent need to break \nthe cycle of generational, institutional incarceration amongst mothers \nserving time for non-violent crimes and the children they birth behind \nprison bars.\n  H.R. 5130, the, ``SIMARRA Act of 2016,'' gives those infants born to \nincarcerated mothers a chance to succeed in life.\n  ``SIMARRA'' is not merely yet another second chance program, \ndemanding leniency from the criminal justice system.\n  Instead, H.R. 5130 asks our national criminal justice system what it \ncan do for those young Americans born and relegated to a life of nearly \nimpossible odds of survival.\n  ``SIMARRA'' provides that first chance--a first chance for American \ninfants--that many of their mothers, born themselves to mothers behind \nbars, never received.\n  The bill excludes abuse-deterrent formulations of prescription drugs \nfrom Medicaid's additional rebate requirement for new prescription drug \nformulations, which is intended to encourage the development of these \ndrugs by allowing drug companies to reduce the rebates they otherwise \nmust pay to Medicaid.\n  The measure also limits disclosure of predictive modeling and other \nanalytics technologies that are used to identify and prevent waste, \nfraud and abuse in Medicaid, including by exempting covered program \nintegrity algorithms from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and \nrequiring state Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) \nagencies to have adequate data security policies to ensure the security \nof covered algorithms.\n  Finally, the measure makes $5 million available to the Medicaid \nImprovement Fund for expenditures for FY 2021 and beyond.\n  CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4978 would not, on net, change \ndirect spending over the 2017-2026 period.\n  While opponents argue that some provisions of the bill will increase \ndirect spending by $80 million over that period, I point out that other \nprovisions would decrease direct spending by the same amount balancing \nthe total cost.\n  Enacting the legislation would affect direct spending, rather than \nrevenues.\n  Under current law, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay \nrebates to states for prescription drugs provided through Medicaid.\n  The formula which determines rebate amounts in the Medicaid program \nhas several components, with some components generating rebates that \nare paid to states and shared with the federal government, and others \ngenerating rebates that are paid to states and subsequently transferred \nin their entirety to the federal government.\n  Abuse deterrent formulation, or ADF, is a new technology that is \nbeing implemented by the pharmaceutical industry to prevent the abuse \nof prescription pain medications.\n  For example, some ADFs make it more difficult for an individual to \ncrush, break, or dissolve a drug to inappropriately extract and use its \nactive ingredient.\n  Under the bill, the component of the rebate formula that would no \nlonger apply to ADFs of brand-name drugs is one that is paid to states \nand transferred in full to the federal government.\n  Therefore, states would not be directly affected by this section of \nthe bill.\n  CBO estimates that this section would increase federal Medicaid costs \nby about $75 million over the 2017-2026 period by reducing rebates.\n  CBO anticipates that an increasing number of ADFs of brand name drugs \nwill launch over time; therefore, the component of the rebate affected \nby H.R. 4978 would also grow over time.\n  CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would not increase net \ndirect spending or on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in any of \nthe four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2026.\n  H.R. 4978 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandate as \ndefined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \ngovernments.\n  In sum, H.R. 4978, the ``Nurturing & Supporting Healthy Babies Act,'' \nis a valuable piece of legislation that I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport.\n  Additionally, I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring and \nsupporting all legislation targeting the improvement of care for the \nprevention of infant abuse and neglect, such as H.R. 5130, the, ``Stop \nInfant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016'' or the \n``SIMARRA Act.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4978, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require \nthe Government Accountability Office to submit to Congress a report on \nneonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the United States and its \ntreatment under Medicaid, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2263-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2263-H2266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IMPROVING TREATMENT FOR PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3691, the Improving Treatment \nfor Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act of 2015, introduced by my \ncolleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Ben Ray Lujan of \nNew Mexico, Mr. Tonko of New York, Ms. Clarke of New York, Ms. Matsui \nof California, and Mr. Cardenas of California.\n  In most instances, withdrawal or detoxification is not clinically \nappropriate for pregnant women with opioid use disorders. The \nwithdrawal symptoms associated with discontinuing opioid use in \npregnant women can lead to miscarriage or other negative birth \noutcomes. Buprenorphine and methadone can be used to treat a woman's \nopioid use disorder while pregnant. Such treatment can result in \nimproved outcomes for both mothers and babies.\n  Unfortunately, babies exposed to opioids in utero may be born with \nneonatal abstinence syndrome, NAS, which refers to medical issues \nassociated with opioid withdrawal in newborns. Mothers suffering from \nopioid use disorder may be sent home with babies who have NAS with very \nlittle guidance or support, which can have negative consequences for \ntheir babies.\n  NAS can result from the use of prescription opioids as prescribed for \nmedical reasons, abuse of prescription opioid medication, or the use of \nillegal opioids like heroin.\n  The grant program reauthorized in H.R. 3691 helps support residential \ntreatment facilities where women and their children receive support, \neducation, treatment, and counseling that they need to address opioid \naddiction and NAS. The newly created pilot program will allow States \nmore flexibility in providing these services for women and children in \nneed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise and voice my support for H.R. 3691, the Improving \nTreatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act. The Pregnant and \nPostpartum Women--PPW--program is administered by the Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Services Administration--SAMHSA--Center for Substance \nAbuse Treatment.\n  The program was designed to expand the availability of comprehensive \nresidential substance abuse treatment, prevention, and recovery support \nservices for pregnant and postpartum women and their children. The \nprogram provides grants to public and nonprofit private entities to \nprovide substance use disorder treatment to women in residential \nfacilities.\n  For too long our laws have taken a punitive approach with pregnant \nwomen and new mothers suffering from addiction. Criminal approaches \nhave failed to work. Solutions should emphasize a nonpunitive, public \nhealth approach like the PPW program.\n  Substance abuse treatment that supports the family as a unit has \nproven effective for maintaining sobriety and enhancing child well-\nbeing. Given the magnitude of this epidemic, there is a need for \nincreased availability of treatment options that are responsive to \nwomen's complex responsibilities.\n  H.R. 3691 reauthorizes residential treatment programs for pregnant \nand postpartum women. This vital program provides for substance use \ntreatment for women in need as well as their minor children. Family-\nbased treatment services include individual and family counseling, \nprenatal and postpartum care, and training on parenting.\n  The bill will also create a pilot program to allow up to 25 percent \nof the grants to be made for outpatient treatment services. This will \ngive State substance abuse agencies greater flexibility to provide \naccess to treatment and address gaps in delivery of care for pregnant \nand postpartum women, including services in nonresidential settings, \nand encourage new approaches of services available to pregnant women \nalong the continuum of care.\n  I want to thank the bill's sponsor, Representative Ben Ray Lujan, who \nis a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Health \nSubcommittee, for his leadership in introducing this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Improving Treatment for Pregnant \nand Postpartum Women Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3691 so that pregnant \nand postpartum women can receive comprehensive, residential substance \nabuse treatment when fighting opioid drug addiction.\n  According to the National Perinatal Association, 4 percent of all \nlive births in the U.S. occur in women who abuse illicit or \nprescription drugs, such as\n\n[[Page H2265]]\n\nopioid pain relievers. This would equate to 159,436 births in 2014 from \nwomen who abuse illicit or prescription drugs.\n  This is simply unacceptable. We must take action to ensure that \npregnant and postpartum women receive the care they need to protect \nAmerican families.\n  H.R. 3691 simply states that support should be extended for \nresidential substance abuse treatment programs for pregnant and \npostpartum women through 2020 and the Center for Substance Abuse \nTreatment should carry out a pilot program to make grants to State \nsubstance abuse agencies to support services for pregnant and \npostpartum women who have a substance abuse disorder.\n  By extending these services and working through this pilot program, \nwe can ensure that pregnant and postpartum women can receive the care \nthat they need so that they can care for their families. That is why I \nam supporting H.R. 3691.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill so we can extend care \nto all mothers and soon-to-be mothers who fight drug addiction.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan), the cosponsor of the \nbill.\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start \nby thanking the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee and the Subcommittee on Health for their bipartisan efforts \nto address the Nation's drug crisis and for advancing my legislation, \nthe Improving Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act.\n  Our Nation continues to face a substance abuse crisis that is tearing \napart communities and families. In New Mexico, we have seen a crisis \nthat is multi-generational, with people growing up in communities where \nabuse is commonplace.\n  The grant program for residential treatment that my bill enhances is \nan important part of our effort to break the cycle of drug abuse that \ngrips our communities. My bill would also increase funding for the \nPregnant and Postpartum Women grant.\n  As originally written, my bill contained an authorization of $40 \nmillion, significantly above the current level, to avoid any cuts to \nexisting residential programs. Through bipartisan cooperation, we \narrived at a small increase over the next 5 years.\n  By focusing on women with young children and soon-to-be mothers, we \nhelp ensure that these families get on the right path from the very \nbeginning. People want to be better. But, unfortunately, too often \nthere are too few resources and avenues for help.\n  Certainly this is true in New Mexico, which is among the States most \nimpacted by the epidemic plaguing our country. Too many people are \nsuffering, and too many people are being shut out from access to help.\n  This bill helps address this by creating a demonstration project in \nthe existing Pregnant and Postpartum Women grant program to allow \ngrants to be used for nonresidential care.\n  Residential programs are critically important where they are \navailable. In my home State of New Mexico, there are far too few \nresidential programs to serve the needs of my constituents. In \naddition, many of the existing facilities have wait lists. With New \nMexico's vastness, residential facilities are out of reach for too \nmany.\n  That is why this demonstration project is critical. It will allow us, \nwhile continuing to support residential treatment programs, to explore \nhow to ensure the services and care we are providing work for those in \nneed.\n  While I am pleased that we have been able to work together across the \naisle in an effort to authorize increased funding and ensure the \ninclusion of the demonstration project, I think it is important to say \nmore must be done.\n  Supporting residential facilities and innovation to make treatment \nmore available is essential, and both will require significant \ninvestments.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2014, 47,055 people died from drug overdoses. That is \n129 people per day. We must do more.\n  I hope that, as we continue this conversation beyond today, we can \nall come to recognize the need for funding above and beyond what we are \ndoing today.\n  I respectfully ask for support of this bill.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my colleague and neighbor \nfrom Houston.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate the gentleman from \nTexas for his leadership and the gentleman from New Mexico for his \noutstanding leadership on this important legislation and his concern \nand passion.\n  Let me thank my friends who are managing the legislation and let the \nAmerican people know and our colleagues know that we are continuing our \ncommitment on dealing with the issues of addiction, in this instance, \nopioid. And, of course, we know that there are other forms of \naddiction, from alcohol, to crack, to cocaine, but we are moving \nforward.\n  I rise to support H.R. 3691, the Improving Treatment for Pregnant and \nPostpartum Women Act of 2015. It is clear that this is an issue that \nhas plagued both the woman and as well the newborn baby.\n  Let me offer to say that President Obama has updated that guideline \nto encourage doctors to be more cautious when prescribing opioid \npainkillers and to emphasize nonopioid therapies for certain \nconditions. Many times women who are pregnant are under treatment.\n  Additionally, the Obama administration has awarded $94 million to \ncommunity health centers to improve and expand the delivery of \nsubstance abuse services. In the President's FY 2017 budget, the \nadministration proposed $1.1 billion to combat drug addition \nconsidering modifying certain rules to improve treatment.\n  As misuse of opioids have increased over the past decade, so has the \nincidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome, referring to the medical \neffects on newborn infants suffering from drug withdrawal because their \nmothers were drug addicts.\n  The GAO report found that a lack of available treatment programs for \npregnant women and newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome, \nincluding the availability of comprehensive care and enabling services, \nsuch as transportation and child care, has hampered Federal efforts to \naddress the issue.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  I am glad that this bill, which is why I rise to support it, \nreauthorizes residential treatment grant programs for pregnant and \npostpartum women who have substance abuse problems--programs that are \nadministered by the Health and Human Service Department's Center for \nSubstance Abuse Treatment, increasing the authorized funding level by 6 \npercent. This gives me an opportunity to say that, with regard to all \nof these bills, I know that we will all join together to make sure the \nright funding is available for these bills to really work.\n  I join in support of this legislation and add to it legislation that \nI have introduced, Improving Safe Care for the Prevention of Infant \nAbuse and Neglect Act, and, which I introduced recently, the Stop \nInfant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016, which will help \nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons to improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency of the Federal prison system for pregnant offenders by \nestablishing a pilot program of critical stage development nurseries in \nFederal prisons for children born to inmates. Likewise, at that time, \none may discover the concerns that are being expressed here today.\n  However, the Improving Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women \nAct of 2016, also establishes a pilot program to provide grants to \nState substance abuse agencies to promote innovative service delivery \nmodels for pregnant women who have a substance use disorder, such as \nopioid addiction, including for family-based services in nonresidential \nsettings.\n  This is a good bill because it is more than the adult who is being \ntreated here. It is a good bill because we are concerned about the \nnewborn, the innocent baby who needs to have a start in life. In this \ninstance, this legislation will both treat the mother and provide \nassistance--residential and nonresidential care--so that these \nindividuals can have the starts in life that they need.\n  Let us be reminded of the fact that this addiction of these drugs \nbecomes\n\n[[Page H2266]]\n\nan illness. We have seen overdoses that cause the loss of life. Let us \nbe part of stemming the tide, but, more importantly, let us help those \nwho are trying to hang onto life and to start a new life. This \nlegislation does that, and I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership, and I \nthank him for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3691, the ``Improving \nTreatment for Pregnant & Postpartum Women Act of 2015,'' that was \napproved by the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  In the past decade and a half, the growth in the number of physicians \nprescribing opioids to help patients deal with pain from surgeries, \ndental work and chronic conditions has resulted in an increasing number \nof patients becoming dependent on the powerful and highly addictive \npainkillers--with patients not only abusing the use of those \npainkillers but often turning to heroin once their opioid prescription \nended.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly \n259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012, more than enough \nfor every adult in the United States.\n  It is estimated that in 2013 nearly 4.5 million people in the United \nStates without a valid medical need were using prescription \npainkillers.\n  The Health and Human Services Department estimates that the number of \nunintentional overdose deaths from prescription painkillers almost \nquadrupled between 1999 and 2013.\n  Abuse of prescription opioids now kills nearly 30,000 Americans each \nyear.\n  Both states and the federal government have begun responding to this \ngrowing public health crisis, with many states moving to make anti-\noverdose drugs more available and shield first-responders from \nliability in administering those drugs.\n  President Obama, meanwhile, has updated prescribing guidelines to \nencourage doctors to be more cautious when prescribing opioid \npainkillers and to emphasize non-opioid therapies for certain \nconditions.\n  Additionally, the Obama administration has awarded $94 million to \ncommunity health centers to improve and expand the delivery of \nsubstance abuse services.\n  In the president's FY 2017 budget the administration proposed $1.1 \nbillion to combat drug addiction, considering modifying certain rules \nto improve treatment.\n  As misuse of opioids has increased over the past decade, so has the \nincidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome, referring to the medical \neffects on newborn infants suffering from drug withdrawal because their \nmothers were drug addicts.\n  A 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that a \nlack of available treatment programs for pregnant women and newborns \nwith neonatal abstinence syndrome, including the availability of \ncomprehensive care and enabling services such as transportation and \nchild care, has hampered federal efforts to address the issue.\n  This bill reauthorizes residential treatment grant programs for \npregnant and postpartum women who have substance abuse problems that \nare administered by the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department's \nCenter for Substance Abuse Treatment, increasing the authorized funding \nlevel by 6%.\n  Seeking to right the same wrongs as H.R. 4843, the ``Improving Safe \nCare for the Prevention of Infant Abuse and Neglect Act,'' I introduced \nthe, ``Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016,'' or \nthe ``SIMARRA Act,'' which will help the Federal Bureau of Prisons to \nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal prison system \nfor pregnant offenders, by establishing a pilot program of critical-\nstage, developmental nurseries in Federal prisons for children born to \ninmates.\n  It is time that our nation recognizes a long-persistent need to break \nthe cycle of generational, institutional incarceration amongst mothers \nserving time for non-violent crimes and the children they birth behind \nprison bars.\n  H.R. 5130, the, ``SIMARRA Act of 2016,'' gives those infants born to \nincarcerated mothers a chance to succeed in life.\n  ``SIMARRA'' is not merely yet another second chance program, \ndemanding leniency from the criminal justice system.\n  Instead, H.R. 5130 asks our national criminal justice system what it \ncan do for those young Americans born and relegated to a life of nearly \nimpossible odds of survival.\n  ``SIMARRA'' provides that first chance--a first chance for American \ninfants--that many of their mothers, born themselves to mothers behind \nbars, never received.\n  The ``Improving Treatment for Pregnant & Postpartum Women Act of \n2015,'' also establishes a pilot program to provide grants to state \nsubstance abuse agencies to promote innovative service delivery models \nfor pregnant women who have a substance use disorder, such as opioid \naddiction, including for family-based services in nonresidential \nsettings.\n  Of the amounts appropriated for the HHS residential treatment \nprogram, up to 25% would be available to carry out the pilot program.\n  No funds would be made available to carry out the pilot program for a \nfiscal year, however, unless the amount made available to carry out the \nresidential treatment program for the fiscal year is more than the \ncomparable amount made available for FY 2016.\n  The Senate on March 10, 2016, passed by a 94-1 vote, S 524, an \nantiopioid abuse bill that would authorize grants for opioid treatment \nservices and first-responder training in using anti-overdose drugs, as \nwell as create a task force to review and update best practices for \nprescribing pain medication.\n  The measure offsets the increased authorization through a $5 million \nreduction in the existing FY 2017 authorization for Centers for Disease \nControl (CDC) public health capability enhancement activities.\n  Under current law, $138.3 million is authorized for those activities \neach year through FY 2018.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not yet released a cost \nestimate for the bill.\n  H.R. 3691 would also mandate investigations into heroin distribution \nand unlawful distribution of prescription opioids, and require the \ncreation of a national drug awareness campaign that takes into account \nthe association between prescription opioid abuse and heroin use.\n  This week we are scheduled to consider a series of more than a dozen \nbills that address the opioid abuse problem facing America.\n  This measure reauthorizes grants from HHS's Center for Substance \nAbuse Treatment to public and nonprofit private entities that provide \nresidential substance abuse treatment for pregnant and postpartum \nwomen, authorizing $16.9 million each year through FY 2021--$1 million \n(6%) more than the current $15.9 million authorization.\n  Under the pilot grant program, proposed services for eligible \npregnant and postpartum women would not have to be provided solely to \nwomen who reside in facilities.\n  However, the center must specify a minimum set of services, including \nsubstance abuse counseling, and it must solicit stakeholder input.\n  The bill directs HHS's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and \nQuality to fund an evaluation of the pilot program at the conclusion of \nthe first grant cycle.\n  Under the program, grant recipients are required to provide an \nindividualized plan of services for each participating woman that \nincludes substance abuse counseling and certain supplemental services, \nsuch as pediatric health care for the woman's children.\n  The measure directs the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to carry \nout a five-year pilot grant program to help state substance abuse \nagencies address identified gaps in the services that are furnished to \npregnant and postpartum women with substance abuse issues, and \nencourage new approaches and models of service delivery.\n  H.R. 3691, the ``Improving Treatment for Pregnant & Postpartum Women \nAct of 2015,'' is a valuable piece of legislation that I encourage my \ncolleagues to support.\n  Additionally, I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring and \nsupporting all legislation targeting the improvement of care for the \nprevention of infant abuse and neglect, such as H.R. 5130, the, ``Stop \nInfant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016'' or the \n``SIMARRA Act.''\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to insert extraneous materials into the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1818, the Veteran Emergency Medical \nTechnician Support Act of 2016, introduced by my colleagues on the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce--Mr. Kinzinger from Illinois and Mrs. \nCapps from California.\n  Members of the U.S. military who trained as combat medics face State \nlicensing challenges when they try to find similar work after \ndischarge. Many States do not recognize their qualifications as being \napplicable to the licensing requirements of the civilian healthcare \nsystem for emergency medical services, such as EMTs or paramedics. \nState licensing laws vary, and while some States make exceptions for \nformer military medics to allow for reciprocity and a chance to sit for \nthe licensing exam without repeating their training, many States do \nnot.\n  This legislation would provide grants to States with emergency \nmedical technician shortages so as to help streamline State \nrequirements for veterans to enter the EMT workforce without there \nbeing an unnecessary duplication of their training. This will help them \nmore easily transition to their becoming civilian EMTs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1818, the Veteran Emergency Medical \nTechnician Support Act.\n  Our Nation's servicemen and -women receive some of the best medical \ntraining and experience in emergency medicine while serving our \ncountry. Their commitment to duty, training, real-world experience, and \nability to work effectively in challenging environments make them \nexceptionally well suited for working as emergency medical technicians, \nEMTs, upon their return to civilian life.\n  However, experienced military medics who want to work in civilian EMT \njobs are often required to repeat their medical training at the most \nbasic level to receive certification in order to be hired. Depending on \nthe State, a returning veteran may have to obtain or renew their EMS \nlicense. The requirements can vary significantly by State. This is an \nunnecessary impediment for both our service personnel and our \ncommunities that are in need of qualified emergency medical service \npersonnel. We should not be keeping veterans out of the workforce and \nwithholding valuable medical personnel from supporting our communities.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook \nHandbook, approximately 55,000 new civilian EMT and paramedic jobs have \nalready been or will be created between 2012 and 2022. Highly skilled \nand properly trained veterans are well positioned to fill these \nessential provisions.\n  H.R. 1818 will authorize a demonstration grant program for States to \nstreamline certification and licensure requirements for returning \nveterans with military EMT training so they can work as civilian EMTs \nas quickly as possible. Streamlining the licensing process will make it \neasier for the civilian EMS community to hire experienced combat \nmedics. This is not only beneficial to our veterans, but also to our \ncommunities, and it will enhance the level of care that is provided to \nour citizens.\n  I thank the bill's sponsors--Representative Lois Capps, who is a \nmember of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and of our Subcommittee \non Health, and Congressman Adam Kinzinger--for introducing and \nchampioning this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Veteran Emergency Medical \nTechnician Support Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger), my colleague and good friend on the Committee \non Energy and Commerce, who is a veteran Air Force pilot himself.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Veteran Emergency Medical Technician Support Act \nwill help our veterans and our communities by assisting States in \nreducing burdens for military medics who want to become civilian EMTs.\n  Emergency medical technicians are an important part of the medical \nworkforce and, as first responders, are critical to our goal of \ncombating the thousands of opioid overdoses each year. EMTs respond to \nhundreds of thousands of overdoses. In 2014 alone, EMTs responded to \n240,000 calls at which naloxone was administered.\n  According to the Department of Labor, the demand for EMTs and \nparamedics is expected to increase by 33 percent by the year 2020. This \nexpected shortage is on top of some communities that are already \nreporting a shortage of EMTs.\n  My legislation, H.R. 1818, the Veteran EMT Support Act, works to \naddress this by helping States to streamline requirements and \nprocedures in order to assist veterans who completed military EMT \ntraining in the Armed Forces to meet the certification, the licensure, \nand other requirements to become civilian EMTs.\n  Although some service branches train military medics to EMT national \ncertification standards, States generally have required additional \ntraining for State licensure. This creates a barrier for servicemembers \nwho have received some of the best EMT training and have practiced \ntheir profession on the battlefield.\n  The Veteran EMT Support Act is a commonsense way to help veterans \ntransition into the civilian workforce, improve public health, and \nensure communities have highly qualified, professional men and women to \nanswer challenging emergency calls like opioid overdoses.\n  I thank Congresswoman Capps for her strong support and advocacy of \nthis\n\n[[Page H2268]]\n\nlegislation, and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1818, the Veteran Emergency \nMedical Technician Support Act.\n  As the ranking member of our committee just said, our military medics \nreceive some of the best technical training in emergency medicine on \nthe battlefield, and it is proven in extreme circumstances. However, \nwhen these medics return home and attempt to apply their skills to work \nin the civilian EMT sector, they are often forced to start back at \nsquare one. Repeating coursework isn't just a waste of time, it is also \nincredibly expensive. Similarly, civilian EMTs who are also in the \nmilitary or in the reserves often must let their civilian \ncertifications lapse when they are deployed.\n  In either circumstance, this is an unfair burden on our military men \nand women who have bravely defended our country. It is also so \nshortsighted for our communities, which could benefit from their \nexpertise. We need these valuable medical personnel to be working in \nour communities, especially as we now deal with this opioid crisis.\n  That is why I am so pleased to have again joined with my Republican \ncolleague, Representative Kinzinger, to introduce the Veteran EMT \nSupport Act. The bill is a small but straightforward effort to help \nStates streamline their EMT certification processes to take military \nmedic training into account for civilian licensure. It is the least we \ncan do to help ensure that our military medics' transition home is a \nlittle bit easier, and it is the least we can do to ensure that our \ncommunities have the best civilian first responder personnel working \nfor them.\n  I thank Chairmen Upton and Pitts and Ranking Members Pallone and \nGreen and their staffs for their support in getting this bill to the \nfloor. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n1818, the Veteran Emergency Medical Technician Support Act. I thank \nCongressman Kinzinger for his leadership on this bill. I also recognize \nthe chief operations officer for the Western Berks EMS, in my district, \nEd Moreland, who came to my office and shared with me what this bill \nwas all about.\n  It is a very easy bill to support. Not only is it an easy bill to \nsupport, but it is a very important, valuable bill for me and other \nMembers to support because in my State of Pennsylvania where I used to \nbe a county commissioner and, before that, a township supervisor, we \nwould see firsthand the very valuable role that EMTs and paramedics \nprovide to local communities. We also know that there is a demand for \nmore EMTs and paramedics. In fact, over the next 8 years, it is \nestimated that there will be another 40,000 EMTs and paramedics that we \nwill need in this country.\n  I have the honor to serve on the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. One of the things on which we focus on that committee is to \nwork to find innovative solutions to help our veterans find successful \ncareers when they return home and to utilize the skills that many \nservicemen and servicewomen obtain and possess during their service. \nIndeed, many of the best training and experience that military men and \nwomen get overseas is in the area of emergency medicine.\n  When one looks at what it takes to be an EMT--the education, \ntraining, skill level, and what is required in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and in many other States--you realize that there is an \nequivalency that many veterans already have, which they obtained while \nserving in the military.\n  This bill seeks to streamline the process so that if a veteran \nalready has the training, the education, the skill level, the \nexperience, we can basically not require that veteran to spend more \ntime and more money going through the process of obtaining a \ncertification. Instead, we can get him into the practice of actually \nserving his community and working in a professional environment. It \ngets qualified veterans to work quicker. It also fills the communities' \nsafety needs quicker.\n  It is commonsense, bipartisan legislation to address the demand for \nqualified professionals in our communities, and it provides veterans \nwith good job opportunities. It is why I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it. It is why I commend Congressman Kinzinger and why I thank \nEd Moreland of the Western Berks EMS for bringing this to my attention.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. \n1818.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1818, the \n``Veteran Emergency Medical Technician Support Act of 2015,'' which \nemphasizes the necessity to add requirements and procedures that assist \nveterans with military EMT training to meet state EMT certification, \nlicensure, and other requirements.\n  I support this legislation, because it benefits states with a \nshortage of emergency medical technicians.\n  H.R. 1818 allows veterans to reenter society and assist the helpless \nwithin the emergency medical community.\n  The bill enables the Public Health Service Act to direct the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services in an efficient approach for \nveteran assistance.\n  Specifically, H.R. 1818 requires the secretary to establish a program \nconsisting of awarding demonstration grants to states to streamline \nstate requirements and procedures.\n  H.R. 1818 determines the extent to which the requirements for \neducation, training, and skill level of emergency medical technicians \nare equivalent to the requirements for military emergency medical \ntechnicians.\n  The bill identifies methods to facilitate the attainment of state \nrequirements for military emergency medical technicians.\n  For proper usage of the grant provided by the bill, a state shall \ndemonstrate its shortage of emergency medical technicians.\n  This bill introduces a feasible alternative for veterans within the \ncommunity.\n  With consistent experience in high pressure situations and emergency \nenvironments, veterans are the appropriate choice for this profession.\n  This is a comprehensive bill that will simultaneously provide \nopportunity for veterans while alleviating the shortage of staff in a \nmedical specialty involving care for undifferentiated and unscheduled \npatients with illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical \nattention.\n  I urge all Members to join me in support of H.R. 1818.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4969, the \nJohn Thomas Decker Act of 2016, introduced by my colleagues, Mr. Meehan \nof Pennsylvania, Mr. Kind of Wisconsin, Mr. Rooney of Florida, and Mr. \nVeasey of Texas.\n  Young athletes have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid \nepidemic currently plaguing our country. One study found that \nadolescent males who played sports were twice as likely to be \nprescribed opioids than their peers and four times more likely to abuse \nthem than nonathletes. Writing a prescription for opioids in a \npopulation that may not fully grasp the risk associated with the drugs \ncan be dangerous and lead to unintended negative outcomes.\n  H.R. 4969 amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to study what information and \nresources are available to youth athletes and their families regarding \nthe dangers of opioid use and abuse, nonopioid treatment options, and \nhow to seek additional addiction treatment.\n  The Secretary would then be required to report the findings and work \nwith stakeholders to disseminate resources to students, parents, and \nthose involved in treating a sports-related injury.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4969, the John Thomas Decker Act.\n  A crisis of this magnitude requires a multiprong, robust response \nacross the full continuum of those exposed to and affected by \naddiction. People suffering from addiction are originally prescribed or \nexposed to opioids in a wide variety of circumstances, one of which is \nthrough youth sports injuries.\n  H.R. 4969, the John Thomas Decker Act, will bring needed education on \nthe danger of opioids and the benefits of alternative approaches to \npain treatment to youth sports.\n  The John Thomas Decker Act will direct the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention and the National Center for Injury Prevention to \nexamine and report on what informational materials and resources are \ncurrently available to teenagers and adolescents participating in \nsports on the dangers of opioid use and misuse, alternative treatment \noptions, and how to seek treatment for addiction.\n  Based on the findings of this report, the legislation directs the CDC \nand the National Center for Injury Prevention to develop and \ndisseminate such informational materials as necessary.\n  Young people playing sports who incur an injury for which painkillers \nare frequently prescribed can be uniquely vulnerable to addiction if \nthey or their parents, guardians, and coaches are not well informed of \nthe potential for misuse, abuse, and addiction.\n  H.R. 4969 will play a role in helping curb the epidemic opioid abuse \nand heroin use by ensuring adequate and appropriately tailored \nresources for our Nation's youth.\n  I thank the bill sponsor, Representative Meehan, for introducing this \nlegislation. I encourage my colleagues to support the John Thomas \nDecker Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle for their strong support of this very, very important bill, which \nwill use the resources of the Centers for Disease Control in very \nimportant outreach to young people, particularly student athletes.\n  Now, we have heard heart-wrenching stories all day long about the \ntremendous growth of the use of opioids. In fact, 207 million \nprescriptions were written in 2013 for opioids. Unfortunately, that has \nled to about 2.1 million Americans who are hooked on opioids.\n  And when the opioid is not available, we have begun to see them \nswitch to a cheaper alternative, which is heroin. 450 million Americans \nare currently hooked on heroin.\n  I know in my own State of Pennsylvania we lose seven people a day to \nheroin addiction. We are seeing it in the important nature of the \ncomprehensive bills that have been put forward today. We are seeing it \nin veterans. Many are coming back with traumatic injury and are finding \nrelease in the opioids. We are seeing it in pregnant mothers and the \nimpact that it has in children. One of the single biggest increase is \nin women, mothers who are over 30.\n  One of the niches that is often underappreciated, but remarkably \ndangerous, is young student athletes. The reason being is that young \nstudent athletes are more inclined than just about anybody else to \nsuffer sports-related injuries. Some of those injuries can be serious, \nand what we are seeing is a high rate of prescription of opioids for \nsome of these athletes.\n  Now, in the NCAA, you have a little bit more oversight. Even there, \nwe see abuse. Almost 26 percent of college-level athletes will use \nopioids at some point in time, many without prescriptions.\n  Where the real danger comes down is at the high school level. I have \nthe good privilege of chairing one of the youth sports caucuses with my \ngood friend, Mr. Kind of Wisconsin. We deal with a broad variety of \nissues promoting healthy activity and youth sports, but we are seeing a \npiece of this challenge right now in which we are watching the opioid \naddiction and problems with young athletes.\n  Eleven percent of high school athletes will use painkillers without a \nprescription. That is something that I talked to one of the trainers in \nmy high school, a student trainer, about how kids who want to play in \nthe game will hide their injuries and self-medicate. What a danger that \nis.\n  This brings me to the young man who inspired this bill, the John \nThomas Decker Act. This is John Thomas Decker. I had the privilege of \nknowing John personally and knowing his wonderful family.\n  John was an incredible athlete. I watched him play football. He set a \nreceiving record that was held for nearly a decade in our region of \nPennsylvania.\n  He went on to play lacrosse at Cornell University in a program that \nwon\n\n[[Page H2270]]\n\na national championship. So John was the consummate blue-chip athlete \nand a wonderful kid to boot. He was a great student and a great leader.\n  But John, like so many other kids, fought through the pain because he \nwanted to play. So what he did was he self-medicated and began to deal \nwith the issue of opioid addiction.\n  Now, John worked his way through it as an athlete, but later in life \nreturned again to using opioids and, ultimately, heroin. Ultimately, it \nled to his death.\n  His story inspired me to say we have to do something about it because \nmany high school kids just like John who are playing through the pain \nbelieve that, because they are using the opioids and because they are \nprescription medicines, somehow there is no danger of any kind of \naddiction or otherwise, that somehow it is nowhere near as dangerous as \nheroin. Yet, it is unfortunately too easy.\n  In fact, one of the other misconceptions is: I don't have to worry \nabout a dependency. But the medical authorities have confirmed that \ndaily use for even a short period of time, just a few weeks or even \ndays, can create the kind of psychological dependency in which there is \nthe beginning of the misuse of the opioids.\n  One of the things we begin to see as well is, as the opioid begins to \nlose its protective effect, they will take more and higher doses in \norder to have the same pain-killing capacity. So they start to move \nfurther on down the chain.\n  Oftentimes they are able to kick it for a period of time. But when \nthey come back, they will go back to using the opioid at the higher \nlevel than they once did before. Imagine the implication of that.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, the CDC is in a position now to be able to \nutilize the resources it has to do a better study of making sure that \nwe are aware of the information and resources that are being made \navailable to those who are in the privity of relationship with these \nstudents--these can be coaches; these can be school nurses; these can \nbe the students themselves--and then come up with a plan for us to be \nable to distribute this in an effective manner, all the way down \nthrough the network.\n  There can be appropriate use under medical care with the kind of \nattention to concerns about addiction so that, where there is \nlegitimate pain--we don't want to suggest that there is never a use, \nbut this will now create the kinds of guidelines in which there is \ngenuine oversight if opioids are introduced.\n  This will also give the kinds of guidelines to local trainers and \nothers, even local physicians, about taking more time to assess the \nbackgrounds of individuals that they are giving the opioids to, not \nappreciating perhaps that a young man may be dealing with depression or \nother kinds of things, a binge drinker in association with that opioid \nthat could lead to death.\n  All of these things are things that could be part of the CDC's \napproach to doing much better education so that we can prevent the next \nyoung star athlete like John from coming into opioid addiction and \nultimately leading to his demise.\n  Let us let John's voice be heard. Let us use this as the opportunity \nto ensure that future student athletes are not addicted to opioids.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nKentucky for his work on this bill.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 4969 because opioid addiction does \nnot discriminate based on age.\n  H.R. 4969 requires the CDC to report on information regarding \nprescription opioid abuse after youth sports injuries. According to a \nstudy by the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, 12 \npercent of male athletes and 8 percent of female athletes have used \nprescription opioids in the last 12 months.\n  According to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, 80 percent of these teenagers and adolescents made the \nswitch to heroin after abusing opioid painkillers, according to the \nU.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This is \ncompletely unacceptable and 100 percent preventable.\n  Every effort should be made to ensure that our youth are protected \nfrom the trap of drug abuse. That is why I am supporting H.R. 4969. We \nneed all the information available so we can take the right steps to \nensure our youth are protected.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4969.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4969, \nthe ``John Thomas Decker Act of 2016.''\n  Our nation values the importance of transparency and availability of \npublic information regarding prescription drugs.\n  This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the \nNational Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to report on the availability of \ninformation regarding prescription of opioids after youth sports \ninjury.\n  This report includes the information on opioid use and misuse, injury \ntreatments that do not involve opioids, and treatment for opioid \naddiction.\n  The report must determine the extent this information is available to \nteenagers and adolescents who play youth sports, their families, youth \nsports groups, and health care providers.\n  Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and \ncertain pain medications.\n  In addition to stimulants and central nervous system (CNS) \ndepressants, prescription opioids are one of the three main broad \ncategories of medications that present abuse liability.\n  Due to prescription opioids' similarity to heroin and morphine, they \npresent an intrinsic abuse and addiction liability for non-medical \npurposes.\n  Opioid, heroin, and morphine act on the same brain systems.\n  In an effort to increase their euphoric effects, the ``high'', people \ntend to take them in their most dangerous and addictive methods.\n  Understanding the dangers of these addictive drugs highlight the \nimportance of John Thomas Decker Act, which increases awareness and \neducating the youth people of the adverse effects of opioids.\n  H.R. 4969 also allows for public transparency in making available \npublic reports, informational materials, and resources are available to \nteenagers, their families, and health professionals.\n  Our country has acknowledged the importance of preventive healthcare \nand education within our nation.\n  Providing education to those directly or indirectly associated with \nopioid usage enables them to have control over their thoughts and \nactions, offsetting the potential for drug abuse.\n  I support this legislation because it will help protect the integrity \nof consumers through implementation of effective preventative \nstrategies.\n  H.R. 4969 provides the National Center for Injury Prevention and \nControl at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with specific \nresponsibilities for dissemination.\n  H.R. 4969 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting its passage.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4969, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2270-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2270-H2273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1800\n                               LALI'S LAW\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4586, Lali's Law, \nintroduced by my colleagues in the House, the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Dold) and the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  The rate of overdose for individuals age 24 to 34 has nearly tripled, \ngoing from 8.1 overdose deaths per 100,000 to 23.1 overdose deaths per \n100,000. Families across the country are losing loved ones to \nreversible opioid overdose. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can \nprevent opioid overdose deaths by binding to the opioid receptors in \nthe body and preventing the overdose.\n  H.R. 4586 amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants to \nStates for developing standing orders and educating healthcare \nprofessionals regarding the dispensing of opioid overdose reversal \nmedication without person-specific prescriptions.\n  This legislation is a first step in promoting wider access of \nnaloxone or other opioid overdose reversal drugs that may come to \nmarket. Standing orders are prescriptions that are not person-specific. \nIf a pharmacy has a standing order, anyone needing the medication may \ncome and fill a prescription for it.\n  Naloxone, while incredibly effective at stopping opioid overdose, \ndoes not have severe side effects if used incorrectly or if used when \nnot needed. Many States have standing order laws in place but need help \nbridging the gap between law and a functioning program. The grants \nfunded by this legislation will help aid that process.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4586, Lali's Law.\n  Mr. Speaker, between 2001 and 2014, there was a threefold increase in \nprescription drug overdoses and a sixfold increase in heroin overdoses \nin the United States. We must do more to prevent drug misuse and abuse \nto avoid these tragedies in the first place. We must also ensure that \nthose suffering from addiction to prescription and nonprescription \ndrugs have access to potentially lifesaving treatments when and where \nthey need it.\n  Naloxone has proven to be a successful lifesaving intervention for \npatients presenting with overdose if administered quickly. When used, \nnaloxone helps restore breathing that has been stopped by the overdose \nand has potential for saving thousands of lives each year.\n  H.R. 4586 would create a competitive grant program to help States \nincrease access to overdose reversal medications. The primary purpose \nof the grant is to fund State programs that allow pharmacists to \ndistribute overdose reversal drugs without a person-prescription to \nqualified individuals or entities.\n  To be effective, overdose reversal drugs must be given to the patient \nalmost immediately. In an emergency situation, the ability for \nemergency medical technicians, law enforcement, substance abuse \ntreatment providers, and qualified individuals to have such medications \non hand can make the difference between life and death. Qualified \nindividuals and entities often need\n\n[[Page H2272]]\n\nto possess treatment before a specific patient is identified.\n  Many States have established and use these programs to allow local \nlaw enforcement officers or emergency medical technicians to carry and \nuse the overdose reversal drug naloxone. H.R. 4586 would expand these \nprograms by helping States develop standing orders and educate \nhealthcare professionals about dispensing these medications without \nperson-specific prescriptions.\n  I want to thank the bill's sponsors, the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Clark) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), \nfor introducing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting H.R. 4586.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), my friend.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n4586 because it is critical that we educate healthcare professionals \nabout opioid overdose reversal medications.\n  This bill allows the CDC to authorize grants to States based on their \nability to educate healthcare professionals in dispensing opioid \nreversal medication. Specifically, this opioid reversal medication, \ncalled naloxone, can be used in emergency situations to stop an opioid \noverdose death.\n  Also, through this bill, pharmacists will be able to dispense \nnaloxone to patients without a prescription, increasing access to this \nlifesaving antidote. This access will help save lives in emergency \nsituations when patients do not have the time or ability to seek or \nreceive professional medical care. The World Health Organization states \nthat this increased access will save up to 200,000 lives.\n  As a lifelong pharmacist, I believe it is our duty to always educate \nAmericans about the lifesaving tools available to them. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 4586 so more people can be educated and have \naccess to lifesaving medication related to opioid overdose.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), a cosponsor of the bill.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Dold \nfor joining me in this legislation, and I also thank the family of Alex \nLaliberte for sharing their story. We offer our deepest sympathies.\n  Mr. Speaker, across Massachusetts and the Nation, too many parents \nare desperately trying to save their child from the deadly grip of the \nopioid crisis. In the past year alone, this public health crisis has \nclaimed nearly 1,400 lives in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The \nbill before us today, Lali's Law, is a critical part of addressing this \ncrisis.\n  Naloxone, commonly known as Narcan, is a lifesaving drug. It stops \nthe effect of heroin within minutes after it is administered, and it \nallows breathing to resume. But it is critical that it is widely \navailable.\n  Under this bill, States that have authorized a standing order that \nallows anyone to obtain naloxone from a pharmacist would be eligible \nfor a grant that can be used for public education campaigns and \ntraining for healthcare providers and pharmacists.\n  I want to share the story of a family from my district that \nillustrates the difference training and the availability of Narcan can \nmake.\n  One night, a 911 call came in, a desperate and frantic new mother \nwith a very young baby who was unresponsive. The first responders \narrived at the scene, but despite their best efforts, this baby was not \nreviving. A responding firefighter relied on his training and quick \nthinking to save this child's life by administering Narcan. It worked.\n  Even though the mom had not revealed that she was addicted to \nprescription painkillers, the first responder knew the symptoms and \nmade the right guess and saved this child's life. If he had not been \ntrained to administer Narcan and not had the lifesaving drug with him \nthat night, that baby would not be alive. But the man was, and now the \nbaby and mom have a future.\n  This crisis presents an urgent calling for all of us, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, to put aside our differences and do what we can to \nsave lives. That is what we are talking about here: increasing the \navailability of Narcan will save lives.\n  I am happy to join with my friend from Illinois to offer this \nimportant bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold), my good friend.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend for yielding. I \nwant to thank my friend from Massachusetts for her work on this \nlegislation. Representative Clark sharing that story is extremely \npowerful.\n  In the suburbs of Chicago, Mr. Speaker, somebody dies from using \nheroin every 3 days. Nationally, that statistic is 1 every 19 minutes. \nEvery single one of them leaves behind a family in grief.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, I am joined in the Chamber by Chelsea Laliberte, \nJody Daitchman, and Gary Laliberte, the family of a young man from \nBuffalo Grove named Alex.\n  Alex graduated from Stevenson High School. He played sports. He got \ngood grades and made a lot of friends. He was a typical teenager who \nhad his whole life ahead of him. But behind his happy exterior, Alex \nwas sick. He was struggling with escalating drug abuse.\n  During Alex's sophomore year in college, he came down with an unknown \nillness. He would go to the hospital, and he would get better--at least \nfor a while. But then a few months later he would get sick. He would be \nadmitted to the hospital and again would repeat the cycle. His family \ndidn't know it then, but Alex was dependent on prescription drugs and \nwas suffering from withdrawal.\n  Alex continued this pattern until just a few days before his final \nexams. At that point in time, Alex actually overdosed on prescription \ndrugs and heroin and, at the age of 20, passed away. His family never \neven had the chance to seek help for his dependency.\n  Unfortunately, this story is far too common across our country.\n  As a father, I can't even imagine the pain of losing a child to a \ndrug overdose; but sadly, too many families like the Lalibertes have \nexperienced this loss. Heroin and heroin abuse have become an epidemic \nin our country.\n  During my work as the co-chair of the Suburban Anti-Heroin Task \nForce, I have met countless families who have been affected by drug \nabuse--literally torn apart. This is not an isolated issue. It affects \nevery community, every ZIP Code, regardless of your socioeconomic \nstatus, regardless of your educational status.\n  I talk to parents who say, ``It is not in my community.'' It is. It \nis in your community, let me just assure you.\n  My work with Live4Lali and the Lake County Opioid Initiative inspired \nme to introduce this law with Representative Clark. Our bipartisan bill \nis named in Alex Laliberte's memory.\n  Lali's Law increases access to a lifesaving antidote called naloxone, \nwhich, in Lake County, Illinois, has already saved nearly 100 lives \nsince first responders and the police force requested the opportunity \nto be able to use this lifesaving antidote. The police officers \nactually would respond, would get there before the paramedics--often 5 \nto 7, sometimes 9 minutes faster--and refused to sit by idly as they \nwatched these young people die from an overdose.\n  When used properly, naloxone helps restore breathing that has been \nstopped by an overdose. You have heard the statistics, but the World \nHealth Organization predicts that increased access to naloxone could \nsave another 20,000 lives each and every year.\n  Lali's Law is a decisive step to not only save young people like Alex \nLaliberte from falling victim to drug abuse, but also to help those in \nour communities struggling to get their lives back on track. Our bill--\nand, frankly, the work that has been done here in this body today, and \nI think we have got some 18 different bipartisan bills coming together \nto try to solve this prescription drug epidemic, this heroin epidemic \nthat is sweeping our country--is proof of what is possible when we set \naside partisanship and get to work for the people that we all \nrepresent.\n  Lali's Law has already brought Alex's story to the United States \nCongress and has amplified the lifesaving\n\n[[Page H2273]]\n\nbenefit of Live4Lali's amazing work. Now, by passing this overwhelming \nbipartisan bill, we can ensure that Alex's lasting legacy includes \nhelping countless others get a second chance at recovery and saving \ntheir families from the unbearable heartbreak.\n  Mr. Speaker, together, we truly can save lives.\n  Again, I want to thank Representative Clark. I want to thank the \nLaliberte family. I want to thank the first responders, the \nstakeholders back in Lake County, and all those here in this body who \nare working to try to create an environment, create the opportunity for \nus to be able to take a huge step forward in combating this \nprescription drug and heroin epidemic.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. \n4586.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4586, also \nknown as Lali's Law.\n  Sadly, Lali's Law was named after Alex Laliberte: a Buffalo Grove, \nIllinois resident who tragically passed away seven years ago from a \ndrug overdose.\n  Alex was a good kid. He was an athlete during high school, and also \ndid well academically.\n  During his sophomore year in college, he began being hospitalized for \na mysterious illness.\n  Unknown to his friends and family, Alex soon developed an addiction \nto the prescription drugs and was being hospitalized for withdrawal.\n  He would stay in the hospital until his symptoms subsided only to \nleave the hospital and repeat the cycle.\n  Alex continued this cycle until he died of an opioid overdose a few \ndays before his final exams.\n  He was only 20 years old.\n  Our lack of education on opioids and harm reduction contributed to \nAlex's early death, and we must act to prevent a repeat of this \ntragedy.\n  Lali's Law is an important piece of legislation that would authorize \ngrants to states to develop standing orders and educate health care \nprofessionals about the dispensing of opioid overdose reversal \nmedication without person-specific prescriptions.\n  In addition, this bill would encourage pharmacies to dispense opioid \noverdose reversal medication pursuant to a standing order.\n  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2.1 million people \nnationwide abuse opioids.\n  Mr. Speaker, Lali's Law is instrumental in helping these victims \nreverse their addiction.\n  Lali's Law would also implement the following guidelines and \npractices for those people authorized to prescribe the medication:\n  Only prescribe opioids for chronic pain\n  Opioid overdose reversal medication must be co-prescribed with \nopioids; and\n  the purpose and administration of opioid overdose reversal medication \nmust be discussed with the patients.\n  Furthermore, H.R. 4586 would require the development and adaptation \nof training materials and methods for the people authorized to \nprescribe or dispense the medication to use in educating the public, \nwhich includes:\n  When and how to administer opioid overdose reversal medication, and\n  The steps that should be taken after administering the opioid \noverdose reversal medication.\n  Lastly, Lali's Law would educate the public regarding the health \nbenefits of the opioid reversal medication and the availability of the \nmedication without a person-specific prescription.\n  In 2014, rates of opioid overdose deaths jumped significantly, from \n7.9 per 100,000 in 2013 to 9.0 per 100,000, which is a 14 percent \nincrease.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in support of H.R. 4586.\n  This legislation is vital for reducing opioid-related deaths across \nour nation, protecting the lives of those at risk to opioid abuse.\n  It is our job to make sure that Alex's lasting legacy includes \nhelping others get a second chance at recovery and a second chance at \nlife.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4586, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4599, the Reducing Unused \nMedications Act of 2016, introduced by Ms. Clark of Massachusetts and \nMr. Stivers of Ohio.\n  The number of prescriptions for opioids has significantly increased \nin recent years. While opioids can benefit patients when used \nappropriately, once their pain is subsided, there may be unused pills \nthat could be misused and diverted.\n  Several States have considered enabling pharmacies to partially fill \nsuch prescriptions to minimize the number of pills in circulation while \ncontinuing to address the patient needs. However, current DEA \nregulations are not entirely clear about when such partial fills are \npermitted.\n  H.R. 4599 amends the Controlled Substances Act to clarify when \nschedule II controlled substances, including opioid pain medications, \ncan be partially filled. This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that \nwill help save lives.\n\n[[Page H2274]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for H.R. 4599, Reducing \nUnused Medications Act.\n  Opioid abuse in the United States is rising at alarming rates. In \n2014, nearly 2 million Americans abused or were addicted to \nprescription opioids. Opioids are now one of the most prescribed \nclasses of medications, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse \nestimates that over 70 percent of adults who misuse prescription \nopioids get them from a friend or relative.\n  A promising step to reduce the number of prescription opioids is a \npermanent partial filling of these prescriptions. Current Drug \nEnforcement Administration regulations allow pharmacists to partially \nfill prescriptions for schedule III, IV, and V substances, however, \nonly allow partial fulfillment of schedule II substances in long-term-\ncare settings or to terminally ill patients and when the full \nprescription cannot be supplied.\n  While these regulations do not explicitly prohibit a pharmacist from \npartially filling prescriptions for schedule II substances outside of \nthese certain limited circumstances, DEA recognizes that the \nregulations lack clarity as to when partial filling of schedule II \nsubstances is permitted. This bill would provide clarity.\n  The Reducing Unused Medications Act would allow pharmacists, at the \nrequest of patients or doctors, to partially fill prescriptions for \nschedule II drugs, such as opioids, meaning that a patient or doctor \ncan request to receive a 10-day supply of a 30-day prescription \ninitially and then return later to receive the remaining portion, if \nneeded. This flexibility may help reduce the number of unused pills in \ncirculation and reduce the risk of substance misuse, diversion, and \noverdose.\n  The bipartisan bill before us reflects a careful compromise that \nholds the potential to reduce the amount of unused opioid medications \nin circulation and is an important step in helping curb a growing \nopioid epidemic.\n  I want to thank Representatives Clark and Stivers for their \nleadership in sponsoring this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Reducing Unused Medications Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts \n(Ms. Clark), the sponsor of this bill.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nTexas for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last decade, we have seen a staggering increase \nof opioid overdose deaths. In 2015, this epidemic claimed 125 lives in \nmy district alone. There are a lot of different causes of this crisis, \nbut the number of prescription opioids in circulation is a critical \nfactor.\n  Over the last 15 years, the amount of prescription painkillers has \nquadrupled and generic Vicodin is now the most prescribed drug to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Now, we know that often patients don't use all the opioids they are \nprescribed. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, over 70 \npercent of adults who misuse prescription drugs get them from friends \nor relatives.\n  Millions of half-filled bottles of unused and unwanted prescription \ndrugs line our families' medicine cabinets, and too often that is where \nopioid addiction begins.\n  One promising way to reduce the amount of unused and unwanted \npainkillers that are fueling this public health crisis is by allowing \npatients and doctors to only partially fill opioid prescriptions.\n  By allowing pharmacists to partially fill a prescription for opioids \nat the request of a patient or doctor, we can reduce the number of \nunused pills and help stop pill diversion and misuse.\n  Currently, the DEA allows partial filling of prescriptions for many \ndrugs, but the regulations are narrower and less clear for opioid \ndrugs. That is why I, along with Representative Stivers, have \nintroduced the Reducing Unused Medications Act.\n  This legislation will resolve any ambiguity and clearly establish \nthat a prescription for schedule II substances, like opioid \npainkillers, may be partially filled upon the request of a patient or \ndoctor.\n  We have all heard the stories. Just last weekend I ran into a dad \nwhose son had been given a 30-day prescription of opioid painkillers \nfor having a wisdom tooth taken out, and he had just received an \nunwanted prescription, also for 30 days, after having minor surgery.\n  This bill will empower patients to manage their prescriptions and can \nbe a critical tool in an effort to address the opioid epidemic. This is \na commonsense bill that will help us stop the misuse of prescription \ndrugs that has fueled the use of heroin and this opioid epidemic.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote for \nH.R. 4599, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for H.R. 4599, \ncommonsense legislation that offers the potential to reduce the number \nof unused and unwanted prescription opioids that have been misused or \ndiverted as a part of the opioid epidemic.\n  The number of prescription opioids dispensed in the U.S. has nearly \nquadrupled in the last 15 years, and over 70 percent of adults who \nmisuse prescription opioids get them from a friend or a relative. This \nis often due to the fact that many patients fill legitimate \nprescriptions for opioids and for one reason or another do not use the \nentirety of the prescription.\n  One way to help reduce the amount of unused opioid medications in \nhome medicine cabinets is to permit the partial filling of Schedule II \nprescriptions. Partial fill policies allow providers, pharmacists, and \npatients the option to dispense a portion of a prescription with the \noption of filling the total amount of the prescription at a later time. \nFor example, a patient or practitioner could request that 10 or 15 days \nof a 30-day prescription be dispensed initially with the remaining \nportion available later if needed. It is hoped that this additional \nflexibility would reduce the number of unused pills in circulation and \nultimately reduce misuse and diversion of these prescription opioids.\n  Current Drug Enforcement Administration regulations allow pharmacists \nto partially fill prescriptions for Schedule III, IV, and V substances, \nhowever, Schedule II substances can only be partially filled in long \nterm care settings, for terminally ill patients, or when the full \nprescription cannot be supplied. While these regulations do not \nprohibit partially filling prescriptions for Schedule II substances in \nother situations, the DEA has acknowledged that the regulations may \nneed to be amended to provide clarity as to when partial fill of \nSchedule II substances is allowable.\n  The Reducing Unused Medications Act of 2015 was introduced in the \nHouse by Representatives Katherine Clark (D-MA) and Steve Stivers (R-\nOH) to do just that--provide additional clarity regarding when Schedule \nII prescriptions may be partially filled under the Controlled \nSubstances Act.\n  In addition to the circumstances outlined in current DEA regulations, \nH.R. 4599 would also allow partial fill of Schedule II substances if \nrequested by a doctor or patient, as long as the prescription is \nwritten and dispensed according to federal and state law. It further \nmakes clear that remaining portions of a partially filled prescription \nfor a Schedule II substance may not be filled later than 30 days after \nthe date the prescription is written.\n  Partial fills would also be allowed in emergency situations, with the \nremaining portion to be filled not later than 72 hours after the \nprescription is issued. This legislation does not impact the ability of \nSchedule III, IV, or V prescriptions to be partially filled.\n  H.R. 4599 is the result of careful compromise among the authors of \nthis legislation, the stakeholders, and our Committee members, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4599 the \n``Reducing Unused Medication Act of 2016''.\n  This bill is an important measure that will decrease the number of \nunused medications available for misuse to the public by setting \nlimitations on the most frequent avenues used to secure unused \nmedication.\n  As we know, many times patients are prescribed medication far beyond \ntheir needs.\n  Unused prescription medication creates a lethal danger to households \nand communities across America, and failing to properly dispose of \nunfinished medications can have dire consequences on the environment \nand our ecosystem.\n  According to a new study conducted by Geisinger Health System and \npublished in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association just \n11 percent of unused prescription drugs were disposed of via drug take-\nback programs, while 55 percent were left in the\n\n[[Page H2275]]\n\nmedicine cabinet, 14 percent were thrown in the trash, and 9 percent \nwere flushed down the toilet.\n  As we have heard many unfortunate stories as we bring greater \nawareness to this issue, we know that abuse of medicine among teenagers \nis a growing problem.\n  Easy access to parents' and grandparents' leftover medications is \njust throwing gasoline on the fire.\n  Meanwhile, more than 60,000 young children are taken to the emergency \nroom each year after ingesting a family member's medication.\n  With respect to the environment, the FDA no longer recommends \nflushing drugs down the toiler because sewage treatment plants lack the \ncapacity to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products' residue.\n  H.R. 4599 will amend the Controlled Substances Act to permit certain \nfillings of prescriptions--such that a prescription for a controlled \nsubstance may be partially filled if:\n  It is not prohibited by state law;\n  The prescription is written and filled in accordance with the \nControlled Substances Act, regulations prescribed by the Attorney \nGeneral, and State law;\n  The partial fill is requested by the patient or the practitioner that \nwrote the prescription; and\n  The total quantity dispensed in all partial fillings does not exceed \nthe total quantity prescribed.\n  Mr. Speaker, enacting this legislation will work to not only combat a \nnumber of prescription drug abuses, but also deal a debilitating blow \nto the mounting opioid abuse epidemic.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Zinke). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4599, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2275-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2275-H2276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         EXAMINING OPIOID TREATMENT INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4982, Examining Opioid \nTreatment Infrastructure Act of 2016, introduced by my colleagues, the \nranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Pallone of New \nJersey, and Mr. Foster of Illinois.\n  H.R. 4982 directs the Government Accountability Office to evaluate \nand report on the inpatient and outpatient treatment capacity, \navailability, and needs of the United States. It is important to have \nthe data necessary to assess the opioid infrastructure in our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4982, Examining Opioid Treatment \nInfrastructure Act.\n  Opioid use disorder is a chronic disease that can be effectively \ntreated, but it requires ongoing management. As the current epidemic \nhas drawn sharply into focus, significantly more resources are needed \nto ensure availability of and access to evidence-based treatment.\n  A public health-based approach to drug abuse and addiction requires \nhaving broad-based treatment services available for those with opioid \nuse disorders, including both behavioral therapies and proven \nmedication-assisted treatment and insurance coverage for such \ntreatment.\n  Medication-assisted treatment is often in combination with behavioral \ntreatment, which has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment \nof opioid addiction.\n  However, many patients in need of treatment face significant \nbarriers. Physicians cite barriers finding and placing patients in \naddiction treatment and recovery programs.\n  Current capacity of treatment and recovery programs is inadequate to \nmeet the population's needs. There are too few physicians and programs \noffering treatment and recovery services.\n  In order to address these shortages, better information and data is \nneeded for our existing opioid treatment infrastructure. H.R. 4982, the \nExamining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act, will direct the GAO to \nconduct a study on the inpatient and outpatient treatment capacity of \nthe United States.\n  It instructs the agency to examine the capacity of acute residential \nor inpatient detoxification programs, inpatient clinical stabilization \nprograms, transitional residential support services, and residential \nrehabilitation programs.\n  The GAO is directed to report on geographic differences in the \navailability of treatment and recovery programs for substance abuse \ndisorders; the availability of programs that offer evidence-based \ntreatment options, including the use of FDA-approved medications; and \nthe number of patients' different treatment settings.\n  Finally, the agency would include an assessment of the need for \nresidential and outpatient treatment for substance use disorders across \nthe continuum of care.\n  We must face this crisis head-on and address the serious gaps in \nevidence-based treatment. The Examining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure \nAct will help us do this.\n  I want to thank the bill's sponsor, Representative Bill Foster, for \nintroducing this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), my friend.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4599 because treatment \nof addiction to opioid painkillers and heroin\n\n[[Page H2276]]\n\nis vital in fighting the U.S. drug abuse epidemic.\n  H.R. 4982 requires the Government Accountability Office to report on \ninpatient and outpatient treatment capacities, detoxification programs, \nrehabilitation programs, and treatment programs for pregnant women and \nadolescents.\n  Inpatient and outpatient treatment centers are usually one of the \nbiggest obstacles communities face when trying to help people who are \nfighting addiction. Unfortunately, for most communities, local \ntreatment facilities are few and far between and many of them are full.\n  As a lifelong healthcare professional, I believe the only way we will \nbe able to adequately fight this opioid abuse epidemic is if we work \ntogether.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  We need to adequately understand the treatment services that are \navailable to people with addiction across the country so we can use \nthese tools to their fullest extent. That is why I am supporting H.R. \n4982. By understanding all the tools the community can use, we can \nbegin to fight this epidemic.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill so we can begin to \nleverage our resources to help our communities fight opioid abuse.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a cosponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Green for yielding me the time.\n  My bill, H.R. 4982, the Examining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act \nof 2016, is straightforward, and it is bipartisan.\n  If we are ever going to get a handle on the heroin and opioid \nepidemic tearing through our communities, we have to know what we are \ndealing with. We need data, and we need to know what capacity we have \nin place and what capacity we need to treat this epidemic so that we \ncan make smart and adequate investments, which is why we need this \nbill.\n  This important bill directs a study of the inpatient and outpatient \naddiction treatment capacity and availability throughout the U.S., as \nwell as an assessment of the needed types and numbers of treatment \noptions.\n  It seems simple, but there is no better place to start than at the \nbeginning, with an understanding of the addiction treatment \ninfrastructure that we have versus the need for that infrastructure.\n  When I was first elected to Congress, I was not prepared to hear the \nstories from family members who had lost a loved one due to substance \nabuse. My office often gets calls from parents wanting to share their \nstories of the children they have lost to addiction.\n  While opioid addiction may start in many ways, it ends with a \nscientifically understood, increasingly treatable medical condition in \nwhich the biochemical pathways necessary to normal decisionmaking in \nthe brain have been hijacked, and the chemistry of the brain \npermanently altered.\n  The more we learn about the science of addiction, the more convinced \nwe become that the best path forward is treating addiction like the \nmedical, biochemical condition that it is. To do this successfully, we \nneed the correct number and types of addiction treatment facilities.\n  That is why I introduced the Examining Opioid Treatment \nInfrastructure Act of 2016, with my friend from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone).\n  We know that opioid use and abuse has become an epidemic, and now \nlet's make sure that we know the real numbers we are dealing with so we \ncan allocate the necessary resources.\n  I urge support of the Examining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act \nof 2016.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, having no further speakers, I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. \n4982.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4982, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/house-section/article/H2276-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2276-H2280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT EXPANSION AND MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4981, the Opioid Use Disorder \nTreatment Expansion and Modernization Act, introduced by the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Bucshon) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  More than 2 million Americans are living with a substance use \ndisorder. Evidence strongly suggests that medication-assisted treatment \ncan have a significant impact on combating this epidemic.\n  H.R. 4981 would amend the Controlled Substance Act to expand access \nto medication-assisted treatment for patients with substance use \ndisorders while improving the quality of care provided and minimizing \nthe potential for drug diversion.\n  For the first time, this bill would authorize nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants to prescribe maintenance treatment in an office-\nbased setting after meeting certain training requirements.\n  H.R. 4981 would improve the training that all qualifying \npractitioners receive, and it would maintain the critical role \ncounseling and other recovery support services play in the provision of \nquality medication-assisted treatment.\n  Further, the bill would require HHS to perform a thorough review of \nopioid use disorder so we know what is working well and where there is \na need for further improvement.\n  H.R. 4981 is the product of extensive bipartisan discussion at the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4981, the Opioid Use Disorder \nTreatment Expansion and Modernization Act.\n  Despite the fact that we are in the middle of an unprecedented opioid \nand heroin crisis, we know that treatment gaps continue to limit our \nability to address the growing crisis. Only 1 in 10 people struggling \nwith addiction receive any form of treatment, despite the fact that we \nhave evidence-based, medication-assisted treatment for those struggling \nwith prescription drug or heroin addiction.\n  One available treatment is buprenorphine. The medication is safely \nprescribed from an office setting similar to any other medication a \npatient might take.\n  Unfortunately, in the midst of our current opioid epidemic, \ncurrently, physicians are restricted to how many patients they are \nallowed to treat with this medication, and nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants are not allowed to treat patients with this \nmedication at all.\n  As a result, many patients are placed on prolonged waiting lists with \naddiction specialists as they await access to this treatment. This is \nnot acceptable.\n  We must significantly increase the cap of the number of patients a \nphysician can treat, as well as permanently allow nurse practitioners \nand physician assistants to treat patients with this medication.\n  Today's legislation is not perfect, but it is the first step toward \nreaching bicameral, bipartisan agreement on a package that meets these \ngoals. I remain committed to working with my colleagues to expand \naccess to this important evidence-based treatment as we move to \nconference with the Senate.\n  I want to thank the bill's sponsors, fellow members of the Committee \non Energy and Commerce, Representative Paul Tonko and Representative \nLarry Bucshon, for introducing this legislation. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and \nModernization Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Bucshon), a cosponsor of this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4981, the Opioid Use Disorder \nTreatment Expansion and Modernization Act, is the product of months of \nstakeholder engagement, expert input, and bipartisan negotiation.\n  The opioid epidemic has left no area of this Nation untouched. Day in \nand day out, we hear from our constituents and see in the news the \ndirect impact this has on the everyday lives of our fellow citizens.\n  The evidence is clear that this epidemic is growing and it will \ncontinue to grow unless immediate action is taken.\n  As a doctor, a father, and a public policymaker, I want to do my part \nto help our communities overcome this challenge. That is why I am proud \nto offer H.R. 4981, the Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and \nModernization Act today with my colleague from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  We have worked together over the past several months to find common \nground and move forward with a well-crafted policy solution. Our final \nbill represents months of stakeholder engagement and bipartisan work to \nimprove access and quality treatment for opioid use disorder while \nlimiting diversion of treatment medications for abuse themselves.\n  H.R. 4981 targets four main areas:\n  Increase access to opioid use disorder treatment where it is most \nneeded;\n  Empower physicians through education, training, and quality-of-care \nmeasures;\n  Encourage a multi-pronged approach to opioid use disorder treatment;\n  Deter bad actors and reduce diversion, as previously was mentioned.\n  This is a positive step toward increasing access for treatment for \nopioid use disorder while raising the quality of care and reducing \ndiversion.\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Tonko and all those who have worked with \nus throughout this process. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4981's \npassage, and I look forward to productive discussions with the Senate \nto get critical opioid legislation to the President's desk.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), a fellow member on the Committee \non Energy and Commerce.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for \nyielding.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4981, Opioid Use Disorder Treatment \nExpansion and Modernization Act, which I have had the honor of working \non with my colleague and friend, Representative Larry Bucshon, in \nintroducing.\n  At the outset, I would like to thank Representative Bucshon and his \nstaff, as well as the hard work of individuals on the committee staff, \nand our committee leaders, Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone, \nto get this bill to this point.\n  I would also like to praise my colleague and fellow New Yorker, \nRepresentative Brian Higgins, for his introduction and leadership on \nthe TREAT Act, without which we would not be making this progress \ntoday.\n  It is no hyperbole to announce that we are in a crisis when it comes \nto the opioid epidemic sweeping our Nation. More than 47,000 people \nhave died of drug overdoses in 2014--family members, friends, and \nneighbors within that 47,000, for each and every one of us--a vast \nmajority of which were opioid-related.\n  It is a sign of the times that when you drive down the thruway in my \ndistrict in upstate New York, instead of billboards advertising for \nMcDonald's or Taco Bell, you see billboards advising to you call 911 in \ncase of an opioid overdose.\n  It is disturbing how quickly this has become the new normal. This \ncrisis has affected our neighbors, our families, and our beloved \ncommunities.\n  Having worked with the addiction recovery community, I know that one \nof the most important things we can do as policymakers is to ensure \nthat when an individual struggling with addiction cries out for help, \nthat there is someone there to answer the call. That is what this bill \nendeavors to do.\n  Right now, treatment capacity for those seeking help for opioid use \ndisorder in an office-based setting is artificially capped at 100 \npatients. What this means in reality is that if you are patient 101 or \n102, you get a closed door and have to wait weeks, if not months, for \ntreatment. Expectedly, these delays can be deadly.\n\n[[Page H2279]]\n\n  The legislation before us will support the goal of raising the caps \nfor qualified physicians to 250, expanding existing opioid treatment \ncapacity by some 150 percent, all while ensuring the care that \nindividuals receive is high quality and minimizes the risk of \ndiversion.\n  In addition, this legislation will, for the first time, expand \nbuprenorphine-prescribing authority to nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants who meet certain training requirements and comply \nwith applicable State laws.\n  By bringing these practitioners into the fold, we can expand \ntreatment capacity, especially in rural areas where physicians \noftentimes might be few and far between.\n  Importantly, this bill expands access to high-quality addiction \ntreatment, promoting the full range of psychosocial services that makes \nrecovery possible, and providing HHS with new tools to remove bad \nactors from the system.\n  Any Member interested in decreasing the unlawful diversion of \nbuprenorphine should support this legislation.\n  This legislation is not perfect, and I would still like to see a \nhigher patient limit for the top class of physicians.\n  In the midst of this crisis, ensuring access for all needs to be our \nutmost top priority. No matter where we ultimately land on this \narbitrary number, we will still be closing the door on someone who \nneeds our help. We would not accept this in any other field of \nmedicine, so we all need to think long and hard about why we are \nallowing this situation to persist in the field of addiction.\n  In addition, I would like to draw attention to two changes made to \nthis bill before floor consideration. First, instead of statutorily \nlifting the DATA 2000 caps, this legislation includes a sense of \nCongress, if you will, that the caps should be lifted.\n  Secondly, this legislation would time-limit the expansion of \nprescribing authority to nurse practitioners and physician assistants \nto some 3 years.\n  Both of these temporary changes were made to bring the bill into \ncompliance with PAYGO procedures for floor consideration and must be \nfixed as we move this bill into conference.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  I would just ask, Mr. Speaker, are we firm in our commitment to \ncombat the addiction to heroin? Are we firm in our efforts to assist \nthose who struggle with the illness of addiction? Do we stand for \nproviding true hope to individuals who count on us to provide the \nresources along with the legislation to make life available to them?\n  I would suggest that this House and the Senate look hard and fast at \nproviding resources that are real and that provide for an effective \noutcome. If we fail to find a path forward for a meaningful expansion \nof the physician caps and certainly the nurse practitioners' and \nphysician assistants' prescribing authority, then we are rationing \ncare, pure and simple.\n  The starting point for any conference discussion should be the bill \nas reported out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. In any \nfinal legislation, we must include a statutory lifting of the DATA 2000 \ncaps as well as full authority for our NPs and PAs. I would ask for the \ncommitment of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in \ncontinuing to work toward these goals.\n  Notwithstanding these issues, I believe it is critically important to \nkeep up the momentum and to pass this bill. Even in its imperfect form, \nthis bill will make a huge difference in the lives of those who \nstruggle with this disease. If we cannot find a way to get a bill to \nthe President's desk that will provide needed relief in the midst of \nthis epidemic, shame on us.\n  While this legislation is not a cure-all for the opioid epidemic, I \nbelieve the Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization \nAct will go far in helping to alleviate our acute treatment capacity \nissues and put more people on the path to recovery. I ask my colleagues \nin this House and down the hall in the Senate to support a bill--this \nbill--so that we can bring hope, truly bring hope into the lives of \nthose individuals, those families, and those communities who grapple \nwith this crisis on a daily basis.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, people come here to the \npeople's House from all walks of life. We are blessed to have a \npharmacist amongst us. The only pharmacist here. These are difficult \nissues. Legal prescription drugs are diverted and abused, and heroin is \nillegal. It is great to have his expertise.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for \nyielding and for his efforts, along with Dr. Bucshon and others across \nthe aisle, Congressman Gene Green and all those who have been involved \nin this. This is a very important subject.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4981 because making sure \nmodern treatments are available for opioid addiction should be one of \nour top priorities in the fight against opioid drug abuse.\n  H.R. 4981 makes reforms to the Controlled Substances Act that would \nmodernize the way doctors approach opioid addiction and how patients \nobtain treatment. These reforms, which make treatment tools more \navailable to patients, are one more step we can take to improve \ntreatment services for patients. With these reforms, more patients will \nreceive higher quality care, increasing the success of overall \ntreatment.\n  As a lifelong healthcare professional, I have witnessed patients \nfirsthand who have struggled with receiving care for their addiction. \nWe must stop the cycle of failing to provide patients with proper care \nbecause the system is not adequately structured to provide it.\n  The only way we are able to provide the appropriate care is if we \ncontinue to support the evolution of treatment and care for this ever-\nchanging opioid abuse epidemic. That is why I am supporting H.R. 4981. \nBy reforming the way treatment is provided, we can begin to truly help \nall patients with opioid addiction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this very important bill, H.R. 4981.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4981 the \n``Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act''.\n  This bill highlights the abuse of opioids that has become a public \nhealth epidemic.\n  Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and \ncertain pain medications.\n  H.R. 4981 would encourage and train health care providers to \nprescribe overdose reversal drugs, such as Naloxone, when they \nprescribe common opioids-like pain medication to patients at risk of \naddiction.\n  The plague of opioid overdose deaths across the nation is disturbing, \nbut there are ways to combat this trend.\n  Any party receiving treatment assessments under this legislation will \nbe privy to the following.\n  1. A treatment plan and periodic assessments.\n  2. Will also be subject to medication adherence and substance use \nmonitoring.\n  3. Treatment options, including all drugs approved by the Food and \nDrug Administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder, including \ntheir potential risks and benefits.\n  4. Receiving regular counseling services is critical to recovery.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly \n259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012, more than enough \nfor every adult in the United States.\n  Enacting this legislation will implement a diversion control plan \nthat contains specific measures to reduce the likelihood of the \ndiversion of controlled substances prescribed by the physician for the \ntreatment of opioid use disorder.\n  In 2013 nearly 4.5 million people in the United States without a \nvalid medical need were using prescription painkillers.\n  Both states and the federal government have begun responding to this \ngrowing public health crisis.\n  The Obama administration has awarded $94 million to community health \ncenters to improve and expand the delivery of substance abuse services.\n  Mr. Speaker, the mounting number of people adversely affected and the \nover 25,000 lives lost expressly demonstrates the need for this type of \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 4981 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge all \nmembers to support this important legislation.\n\n[[Page H2280]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
