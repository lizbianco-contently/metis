We know that this is not what You wish for us, not \nwhat the American people wish for our Nation, and not what the Members \nof this people's House have been elected for. Lord, have mercy.\n  We ask Your blessing now on each Member of Congress, that they might \nbe their best selves in representing not only their constituents, but \nalso the entire American citizenry. They have taken oaths to do so. \nGive them the strength and the wisdom to fulfill those oaths.\n  We thank You as well for this marvelous forum, where the important \nbusiness of this Nation has been done in the past and will be done in \nthe upcoming second session. May the work to be done be inspired by the \nwisdom of prophets and the love of saintly people.\n  May all that we do be done for Your greater honor and glory.\n  Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H3-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 5, 2016.\n\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, today our Arkansas delegation rises to pay \ntribute to a dedicated public servant, an exceptional orator, and a \ndistinguished son of Arkansas.\n  Former Arkansas Governor and four-term United States Senator Dale \nLeon Bumpers passed away on Friday, January 1, at the age of 90.\n  Hailing from the small town of Charleston, Arkansas, Senator Bumpers \ngraduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in political \nscience and followed that with service in the United States Marine \nCorps during World War II.\n  After earning his law degree from Northwestern University, Bumpers \nand his wife, Betty, returned to their hometown of Charleston, where he \npracticed law. In the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision on Brown \nv. Board of Education, Bumpers advised the Charleston School Board to \nimmediately desegregate its school system. Listed as his proudest \nachievement, the Charleston School District was the first school \ndistrict in the former Confederacy to desegregate.\n  Nicknamed by The New York Times as the ``giant killer,'' Senator \nBumpers emerged as a dark horse candidate to defeat long-time Governor \nOrval Faubus in 1970. In his two terms as Governor, he continued and \nexpanded Governor Rockefeller's era of expansive governmental reform.\n  In 1974, he defeated five-term U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright in \nthe Democratic primary with 65 percent of the vote to win the Senate \nseat and serve for 24 years.\n  When I was a young Senate staffer, it was a pleasure to work with \nSenator Bumpers and my Second District predecessor, Congressman Ed \nBethune, on the completion of the landmark Arkansas Wilderness Act of \n1984.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, January 10, Dale Bumpers will be laid to \nrest.\n  Those of us in the delegation, as we prepare to make our final good-\nbyes, would ask for a moment of silence to honor this Arkansas leader, \npublic servant, and elder statesman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H5-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN OWNERSHIP\n\n  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of President Obama's \nannouncement today to fight the growing epidemic of gun violence in \nAmerica and make our families more secure and communities safer.\n  It is just common sense that background checks should be required \nbefore an individual is allowed to buy a firearm, yet Congress refuses \nto pass legislation to close loopholes that allow gun sales to proceed \nbefore background checks are completed.\n  Under the so-called Charleston loophole that contributed to the mass \nmurder of nine of my constituents, sales can proceed after 3 days, even \nwhen the background check is not complete. That is just wrong. My bill, \nthe Background Check Completion Act, will ensure that background checks \nare completed before sales take place.\n  I thank the President for his leadership today, and I call on my \ncolleagues, many of whom seem to default to ``no,'' no matter how \nreasonable the proposed legislation may be, when all else fails, employ \ncommon sense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H5-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VISITING WITH CONSTITUENTS OF SOUTH CAROLINA'S SECOND CONGRESSIONAL \n                                DISTRICT\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I traveled \nacross the Second Congressional District of South Carolina, visiting \ncommunities in Columbia, West Columbia, Aiken, North Augusta, Barnwell, \nOrangeburg, and Lexington to present my 2016 legislative agenda. At \neach stop, I was grateful to share my priorities with constituents and \nanswer questions from the media.\n  In this new legislative year, I will advance legislation to create \njobs for American families and reduce harmful regulations that destroy \njobs. We also must protect the economic future for our children and \ngrandchildren by passing balanced budgets and reining in Washington's \nout-of-control spending, which is a crushing debt on future \ngenerations.\n  As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities, I am also focusing on promoting peace through \nstrength to support our troops and keep our families safe from Islamic \nextremists in the global war on terrorism. I will also strive to \nstrengthen our Nation's cyber capabilities and protect our citizens \nagainst cyber attacks by enemies.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H5-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY OF STAFF SERGEANT PETER TAUB\n\n  (Mr. BRENDAN F.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor \nStaff Sergeant Peter Taub, one of six victims of a suicide bombing \nattack in Afghanistan on December 21.\n  Peter was a remarkable young man. He was raised in Wyncote, \nMontgomery County, which I am proud to represent. He served 8 honorable \nyears in the Air Force, assigned to the Office of Special \nInvestigations, and stationed at the Ellsworth Air Force Base in South \nDakota.\n  At just 30 years old, Peter was a devout father, husband, and son, an \nexemplary soldier and public servant, an American hero.\n  I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends Peter left \nbehind and my greatest thanks for his service to our Nation. He gave us \nall the ultimate sacrifice.\n  My heart especially goes out to Peter's family: his 3-year-old \ndaughter, Penelope; his wife, Christina, expecting another child; his \nmother, Arlene; his father, Joel; and his brother, Jonathan. No parent \nshould be predeceased by a child, and no child should have to grow up \nwithout a parent.\n  These tragic losses are a reminder of the gravity of our foreign \npolicy decisions and military engagement overseas. We must never take \nthese responsibilities lightly. We must never forget the sacrifice that \nStaff Sergeant Peter Taub and his family have made to protect our \nfreedoms.\n  May God bless Peter's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H5-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE HAMMOND SENTENCE\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week a father and son reported to \nserve again an additional up to 4 years in Federal prison. Their crime? \nSetting preventative fires on their own property that accidentally \nspread to Federal lands.\n  The Hammonds, family farmers from Oregon, had already served time in \nFederal prison: Dwight 3 months, Steven a year. However, that wasn't \ngood enough for U.S. Attorney Billy Williams, who used taxpayer dollars \nto appeal the Hammonds' original sentence and urged the Ninth Circuit \nto impose harsher penalties, over the judge's objection, who had \nrecommended in his vision much less harsh penalties for the crime in \nquestion.\n  Mr. Speaker, the question isn't whether or not the Hammonds started \nthese fires. They admit they did. The question is whether the U.S. \nattorney and his administration are prosecuting real criminals or \npursuing a political agenda. Mr. Speaker, when a 74-year-old man and a \n45-year-old father of three are forced to return to prison when they \nhave already served time and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in \nfines for a nonviolent, unintentional crime, the answer couldn't be \nmore clear whether this is political or not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H5-6", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5-H6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING CLIFF KOROLL\n\n  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1\n\n[[Page H6]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. QUIGLEY.

He also helped lead the Blackhawks to the Stanley \nCup finals twice and later served six seasons as their assistant coach.\n  His talent led him to be inducted into multiple sports halls of fame, \nbut his greatest accomplishment is leading the Chicago Blackhawks \nAlumni Association. This group of retired players continually gives \nback to the Chicago community and has given over $1 million in \nscholarships to the most deserving high school players in Illinois.\n  Cliff is also a supporter of the Chicago Legal Clinic, which provides \nlegal services for immigrants, the disabled, victims of domestic \nviolence, consumers with serious debt issues, and more.\n  Today I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring and celebrating \nCliff's work and accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H6-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING KEVIN KLINE AND THE SNOWDROP FOUNDATION\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. OLSON.

His partners, Erica Rico and \nTim Tuttle, call him Kevin Gump or Forrest Kline. Why? Because for 55 \nhours over New Year's, Kevin and others ran, walked, or crawled to save \nkids with cancer.\n  With his wife, Trish, Kevin started the Snowdrop Foundation because \ncancer touched a 16-year-old, who lost her life, named Chelsey \nCampbell. Snowdrop has raised over $1 million in just 9 short years. \nThey did this to ensure no child or parent hears those three awful \nwords, ``You have cancer.''\n  All Texans are proud of Kevin and Trish and Snowdrop.

Mr. Speaker, for too long, calls for Congress to pass \ncommonsense gun control measures--heartfelt appeals from concerned \nAmericans of all ages and ideologies, including gun owners--have fallen \non deaf ears.\n  Despite the mounting death toll, the Republican leadership has \nrefused to consider any new measures to address the devastating impact \nof gun violence in America.\n  We cannot continue to wait for Republicans to come to their senses. \nThe price of delay for our children, for our families, and for our \ncommunities is simply too steep. That is why I applaud President Obama \nfor putting American lives above partisan politics.\n  The President's executive actions will require more gun sellers to be \nlicensed and to conduct background checks, narrowing the dangerous \nloopholes that allow guns to fall into the hands of criminals or the \nmentally ill.\n  The new rules will also make it easier for us to hold irresponsible \ndealers accountable and to track guns that are lost or stolen. This is \na critical step forward, but it is not enough.\n  I call on my colleagues to join the President in taking real action \nto prevent gun tragedies and keep the American people safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H6-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n             PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE OVERREACH ON GUNS\n\n  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BABIN.

This is another sad chapter in his Presidency. It is a shame \nthe President would exploit the latest act of terrorism in this manner.\n  The murders of Americans in San Bernardino were due to a radical \nIslamic ideology, an ideology that this President will not even \nacknowledge, though these people have declared war upon us, and nothing \nthis President is doing through his unilateral action will address \nthat. It will only serve to hurt law-abiding American citizens. \nPresident Obama is shooting at the wrong target.\n  We are a constitutional republic. The President cannot simply bypass \nCongress when his ill-advised initiatives are rejected. The President \nshould join Congress in focusing on the growing threat of terrorism \nrather than making it easier to disarm law-abiding American citizens. \nWe should do all in our power to stop this unconstitutional executive \naction and overreach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H6-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MAKING AMERICA SAFER\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS.

Well, one way that we can do that is \nto do our job so that the executive of our country doesn't have to try \nto do whatever he can to extend his responsibilities because we are not \ndoing enough.\n  There are too many moments of silence, ladies and gentlemen, where 9, \n10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 Americans are killed through senseless violence, \nand we have done almost nothing about it as a Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H6-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REVOKE PASSPORTS OF MEMBERS OF FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas.

That is why the United States \nHouse passed the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation \nAct, which I introduced.\n  The legislation is simple: revoke or deny passports of Benedict \nArnold Americans who have assisted designated foreign terrorist \norganizations. Not only will the bill help law enforcement locate these \nindividuals, it will prevent them from entering the United States at \nall.\n  While my bill languishes down the hall in the Senate, Congress did \npass a law allowing for the revocation of passports for Americans who \nare delinquent on their taxes.

Her symptoms subsided after a total hysterectomy \nin 2013, but, physically, she knows that the device left her \npermanently damaged.\n  I rise as a voice for the Essure Sisters, who number in the \nthousands, to tell this Chamber that their stories are real, their pain \nis real, and their fight is real.\n  Mr. Speaker, my bill, the E-Free Act, can halt this tragedy by \nremoving this dangerous device from the market. I urge my colleagues to \njoin in this fight because stories like Amanda's are too important to \nignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H7-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7-H9]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HARNEY COUNTY, OREGON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleagues are aware of the \nsituation in Harney County, Oregon, where a group of armed protesters \nhave overtaken a Federal facility in the Malheur National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  This group is led largely by people who are not necessarily from \nOregon, although they obviously have supporters from Oregon. They were \noriginally there to protest the sentencing of Dwight and Steve Hammond.\n  I know the Hammonds. I have known them for probably close to 20 \nyears. They are longtime, responsible ranchers in Harney County. They \nhave been sentenced to prison not once, but now twice. I will get into \nthat in a moment.\n  The point I want to make at the outset is for people in this Chamber \nto understand what drives people to do what is happening tonight in \nHarney County.\n  I have had the great honor and privilege to represent Harney County \nfor a number of years. I have seen the impact of Federal policies from \nthe Clinton administration to the Obama administration. I have seen \nwhat happens when overzealous bureaucrats and agencies go beyond the \nlaw and clamp down on people. I have seen what courts have done. I have \nseen the time for Congress to act and then it has not.\n  I want to put this area in perspective because I think it is really \nimportant to understand how big this region is. By size, my \ncongressional district in Oregon is something like the seventh or \neighth biggest in the Congress. If you overlaid it over the east coast, \nit would start in the Atlantic and end in Ohio.\n  The county where this occupation is taking place--Harney County--is \nover 10,000 square miles. There are 7,000 souls inhabiting it. If my \nmath is right, that is one person for every 1.4 miles. One person for \nevery 1.4 miles.\n  Just this one county is 10 times the size of Rhode Island. It is \nlarger than the State of Maryland. And 72 percent of it is under the \ncommand and control of the Federal Government.\n  It is the public's land. That is true. But what people don't \nunderstand is the culture, the lifestyle, of the great American West \nand how much these ranchers care about the environment, about the \nfuture, about their children, about America, and how much they believe \nin the Constitution. Now we see the extent they will go to in order to \ndefend what they view as their constitutional rights.\n  Now, I am not defending armed takeovers. I do not think that is \nappropriate. I think the time has come for those to consider that they \nhave made their case in the public about what is happening in the West, \nand perhaps it is time for them to realize they have made their case \nand to go home.\n  But I want to talk about what happened with the Hammonds. I want to \nput in perspective what happens almost every year in my district. That \nis these enormous wildfires.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  The Miller Homestead Wildfire in 2012 burned 160,000 acres, mostly in \nthis county, if not all; 250 square miles, a quarter of the size of the \nState of Rhode Island. That was just in 2012.\n  The Barry Point Fire that year, in Lake County, next door, burned \n93,000 acres. Last summer alone, we burned 799,974 acres across Oregon; \nthat is both forest and high desert. In 2012, 3.4 million acres burned \nin Oregon.\n  There was another fire in Malheur County. The Long Draw Fire, in \n2012, burned 557,000 acres, five times the size of Rhode Island. So \n93,000 acres, 557,000 acres, 160,000 acres, all burning.\n  The Hammonds are in prison tonight for setting a backfire that they \nadmit to, that burned 139 acres, and they will sit in prison, time \nserved and time going forward, 5 years, under a law that I would argue \nwas never intended to mete out that kind of punishment, and I will get \nto that in a moment.\n  I have told you I worked with the Hammonds and many ranchers in \nHarney County. In the last years of the Clinton administration, despite \ntheir own agency's reviews and analysis, Bill Clinton threatened to \ncreate a giant monument on Steens Mountain.\n  When Secretary Babbitt, the Interior Secretary at the time, came \nbefore the House Resources Committee, of which I was a member, I said: \nMr. Secretary, your own resource advisory committees in the area just \nreported that\n\n[[Page H8]]\n\nthere was no need for additional protection on Steens Mountain, and \nyet, you and the President are threatening to create this national \nmonument. Why do you waste the time of the citizens to go through a \nprocess to determine if additional protections are needed and then \nignore what they came up with?\n  To Bruce Babbitt's credit, he agreed when I told him: I think you \nwould be surprised about what the local ranchers and citizens of Harney \nCounty would be willing to do if you give them a chance. To his credit, \nhe said: All right, I will give them that chance. And he did.\n  We went to work on legislation. It took a full year. I worked with \nthe Hammonds. I worked with Stacy Davies, I worked with all kinds of \nfolks, put a staffer on it full-time, multiple staffs, and we worked \nwith the environmental community and others. And we created the Steens \nMountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act, model legislation, \nnever been done before, because I said: We don't have to live by past \nlaws, we write laws.\n  So we wrote a new law to create a cooperative spirit of management in \nHarney County. The Hammonds were part of that discussion. We saved a \nrunning camp, Harlan Priority Runs. We protected inholder. We tried to \ndo all the right things and create the kind of partnership and \ncooperation that the Federal Government and the citizens should have.\n  Fast forward on that particular law. Not long after that became law, \nand it was heralded as this monumental law of great significance and \nnew era in cooperation and spirit of cooperation, some of those \ninvolved on the other side and some of the agencies decided to \nreinterpret it. The first thing they tried to do is shut down this \nkids' running camp because they said: Well, too many, maybe more than \n20, run down this canyon and back up, as they had for many, many years. \nThey wanted to shut it down. So we had to fight them back and said: No, \nthe law says historical standards.\n  Then the bureaucrats, because we said: You should have your \nhistorical access to your private property, if you are up on Steens \nMountain, you should maintain that access like you have always had it. \nDo you know what the bureaucrats said? They began to solicit from the \ninholders in this area: How many times did you go up there last year? \nYou see, they wanted to put a noose around the neck of those who were \ninside. That was a total violation of what we intended, and we had to \nback them off.\n  See, the bureaucracy wants to interpret the laws we write in ways \nthey want, and in this case they were wrong, not once, but twice.\n  Then, a couple of years ago, I learned that, despite the fact we \ncreated the first cow-free wilderness in the United States under this \nlaw, and said clearly in this law that it would be the responsibility \nof the government to put up fencing to keep the cows out, as part of \nthe agreement, the Bureau of Land Management said: No, we are not going \nto follow that law. And they told the ranchers they had to build the \nfence.\n  I networked with my Democrat colleague from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, who \nwas part of writing this law. I said: Peter, you remember that, right? \nHe said: Yeah, I didn't like it, but that was the case. BLM still \nwouldn't listen. So we continued to push it and they argued back.\n  Well, it turns out there had been a second rancher who brought this \nto my attention who they were telling had to do the same thing, build a \nfence, when the government was supposed to under the law I wrote. The \narrogance of the agency was such that they said: We don't agree with \nyou.\n  Now, there aren't many times, Mr. Speaker, in this job when you can \nsay I know what the intent of the law was, but in this case I could \nbecause I wrote the law, I knew the intent.\n  Oh, that wasn't good enough. No, no, no. No, no, no. The arrogance of \nthese agency people was such that we had to go to the archives and drag \nout the boxes from 2000, 1999-2000, when we wrote this law, from the \nhearings that had all the records for the hearings and the floor \ndiscussions to talk about the intent. And our retired Member, George \nMiller, actually we used some of his information where he said the \ngovernment would provide the fencing. They were still reluctant to \nfollow it. So I put language in the appropriations bill that restated \nthe Federal law.\n  Do you understand how frustrated I am at this? Can you imagine how \nthe people on the ground feel? Can you imagine? If you are not there, \nyou can't. If you are not there, you can't.\n  You ridicule them. The Portland Oregonian is running a thing, what do \nyou send? Meals for militia. Let's have fun with this.\n  This is not a laughing matter from any consequence. Nobody is going \nto win out of this thing.\n  This is a government that has gone too far for too long. Now, I am \nnot condoning this takeover in any way. I want to make that clear. I \ndon't think it is appropriate. There is a right to protest. I think \nthey have gone too far. But I understand and hear their anger.\n  Right now, this administration, secretly, but not so much, is \nthreatening, in the next county over, that looks a lot like this one, \nMalheur County, to force a monument of 2.5 million acres, we believe. I \nthink this is outrageous. It flies in the face of the people and the \nway of life and the public access.\n  There is a company, Keen Shoes, that already has a big marketing \ncampaign. This is about selling shoes, for God's sake.\n  I call on the President, if he wants to help reduce the tension that \nis out there, to walk away from this. And if he doesn't want to walk \naway and say, no, we are not going to do that, to help us bring down \nthis level of frustration and anger, then at least be honest, or his \nSecretary of the Interior needs to be honest with us and tell us they \nare going to do it.\n  Either they are or they aren't. But all they are is being coy. That \nfeeds into this. It feeds into the anger that I feel. It feeds into the \nanger out there.\n  So the President should say: I am not going to do a national \nmonument. I am not going to add more fuel on this fire in the West.\n  We have fought other issues. More than half of my district is under \nFederal management, or lack thereof. They have come out with these \nproposals to close roads into the forests. They have ignored public \ninput. They often claim to have all these open meetings and listen to \nthe public, and then, in the case of Wallowa-Whitman, the forest \nsupervisor who was eventually relieved because of this, I believe, \ncompletely ignored all the meetings, all the input, all the work of the \ncounties and the local people, and said: Forget it, I am going my own \ndirection.\n  There were 900 people that turned out at the National Guard Armory \nwhere they had a public hearing, standing room only and beyond, \nfurious.\n  You see, how do you have faith in a government that doesn't ever \nlisten to you? How do you have faith in a government that, when elected \nRepresentatives write a law, those charged with the responsibility of \nimplementing it choose to go the other direction and not do so? That is \nwhat is breaking faith between the American people and their \ngovernment, and that is what has to change.\n  The other thing that has to change, the law under which the Hammonds \nwere sentenced. Now, they probably did some things that weren't legal. \nI have given you the size of the acreages that burned naturally. I \nhaven't gotten into the discussion about how these fires are often \nfought and how the Federal Government frequently will go on private \nland and set a fire without permission to backburn. That happens all \nthe time.\n  In fact, in the Barry Point Fire down in Lake County, they set fire \non private timber land as a backburn while the owners of the property \nwere putting out spot fires down in the canyon. I drove down there \nafterwards. They are darn lucky to have come out alive.\n  There was nobody sentenced under the terrorism act there. Oh, heck \nno. It is the government. They weren't sentenced. Nobody was charged. \nOh, it just happened.\n  Now, fires are tough to fight. I have great respect for firefighters. \nThere are always two sides on how these fires get fought. But I can \ntell you, a few years back in Harney County, because I went and held a \nmeeting out there right as the fire was being put out, that the fire \ncrews came in, went on private ground, lit a backfire on private \nground, behind a fence line, that then burned out the farmer's fence, \nthe rancher's fence, and burned all the way over and down into\n\n[[Page H9]]\n\na canyon where there was a wetland, which would have been the natural \nbreak to stop the fire from the other side. You see, they never needed \nto burn that land.\n  These things happen in the course of fighting fire. It doesn't mean \nthey are right. But rare is it that somebody ends up 5 years in prison.\n  Let me tell you what the senior judge said when he sentenced the \nHammonds the first time, Judge Michael Hogan, senior Federal judge, \nhighly respected in Oregon. He sentenced Dwight Hammond to 3 months and \nSteve to a year. There were different offenses here.\n  He said: ``I am not going to apply the mandatory minimum because, to \nme, to do so, under the Eighth Amendment, would result in a sentence \nwhich is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offenses \nhere.''\n  The Judge went on to say: ``And with regard to the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, this sort of conduct would not \nhave been conduct intended under the statute.\n  ``When you ask, you know, what if you burn sagebrush in the suburbs \nof Los Angeles, and there are homes up the ravines, it might apply. Out \nin the wilderness here, I don't think that is what the Congress \nintended.\n  ``In addition, it just would not meet any idea I have of justice \nproportionality. It would be a sentence which would shock the \nconscience, to me.''\n  Senior Judge Mike Hogan, when he did the original sentencing.\n  But, you see, under this 1996 law under which they were charged and \nconvicted, it turns out he had no judicial leeway. He could not mete \nout a sentence that was proportionate to what the crime was.\n  So yesterday, Dwight and Steve went to prison again. Dwight will be \n73 when he gets out. Steve will be about 50.\n  Meanwhile, in Harney County, on the ranch, Susie will continue to try \nand survive; 6,000-acre ranch, she needs grazing permits to make this \nhappen. It would be a cruel and unjust act, by the way, if access to \nthose grazing permits that allow that ranch to work were not extended. \nWhat possible good could come out of bankrupting a grandmother that was \ntrying to keep a ranch together, while the husband sits in prison, her \nson sits in prison? What possible good?\n  They will serve their sentences. There is nothing, short of clemency \nthat only the President can offer, that we can do. But we can change \nthat law, and we should, so that nobody ever is locked in like that for \na situation like this, where a senior judge, literally, on his final \nday on the bench, says this goes too far, it goes too far. They \nappealed that, by the way, and lost. But I believe that the judge was \nright.\n  We have to listen to the people. We have to understand why events \nlike this are taking place in our communities. They are taking place in \ncities. We have witnessed that, and we try and get our heads around it.\n  There are more people from the cities, so there are more Members from \nthe cities. There aren't many of us that represent these vast, wide-\nopen, incredibly beautiful, harsh districts like the one I do.\n  The people there love the land. It was the ranchers who came up with \nthe concept of the cooperative management. It was the ranchers who \nloved Steens Mountain that know that for them to survive they have to \ntake care of the range.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  They are good people. Their sons and daughters, by a higher \nproportion, fight in our wars and die, and I have been to their \nfunerals. So to my friends across eastern Oregon, I will always fight \nfor you. But we have to understand there is a time and a way. Hopefully \nthe country through this understands we have a real problem in America: \nhow we manage our lands and how we are losing them.\n  It is not like we haven't tried here, Mr. Speaker. Year after year we \npass bipartisan legislation to provide more active management on our \nforests so we don't lose them all to fire, and we are losing them all \nto fire. We are losing firefighters' lives, homes, and watersheds--\ngreat resources of the West. Teddy Roosevelt would role over in his \ngrave. He created this wildlife refuge in 1908.\n  There were some bad actors there in the 1980s, by the way. They were \nvery aggressive running the refuge, basically threatening eminent \ndomain and other things that took ranches. It was bad. That lasted for \nat least a decade or more. It has gotten better though. It is not \nperfect. There is a much better relationship, and the refuge and the \nranchers work closer together. In fact, during this fire in 2012, the \nrefuge actually opened itself up to the ranchers for hay and feed \nbecause theirs was burned out because of this big fire. So there was a \nbetter spirit there.\n  But there are still these problems: the threat of waters of the U.S. \nshutting down stock ponds and irrigation canals and a way of life, the \nthreat of fire every year that seems to not be battled right and just \ngets away, and no one is really held accountable; the continued \nrestriction on the lives of the men and women who, for generations, \nhave worked hard in a tough environment. It has just gone too far. It \nis hurtful.\n  I hope people understand how serious this is felt and how heartfelt \nthis is by those who pay their taxes and try and live by the law and do \nthe right things and how oppressed they feel by the government that \nthey elect and the government they certainly don't elect, and how much \nthey will always defend the flag and the country, and their sons and \ndaughters would go to war, some will not come back--and they have not \nfrom this area.\n  There is a better solution here. The President needs to back off on \nthe monument. The BLM needs to make sure Susie Hammond isn't pushed \ninto bankruptcy and has her ranch taken by the government and added to \nthose that have been. We need to be better at hearing people from all \nwalks of life and all regions of our country and understanding this \nanger that is out there and what we can do to bring about correct \nchange and peaceful resolution.\n  It is not too late. We can do this. It is a great country. We have \nthe processes to do it right.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H9-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9-H12]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CRIMINALIZATION BY REGULATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the words of my friend from \nOregon. These are difficult times, and it is even more difficult when \nunfairness comes from the United States Government with all its power, \nwith all its resources, when it begins to pick on American citizens, \nwhen it uses its resources to snoop on Americans, especially when it \nuses resources to spy on Americans in order to help maintain power of \nthe government over the people.\n  One of the problems with ObamaCare is it provides every American's \nmedical records to the Federal Government--as if the Federal Government \ndidn't have enough personal information. The Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau is in the process of gathering people's credit card \nand debit card information supposedly to protect individuals. What we \nhave seen in our Judiciary Committee as we have had hearings on the \nabuses by Federal Government bureaucrats is there seems to be this \ndesire among different agencies and departments: They have no business \nhaving a SWAT team, but they want one. They want military power to go \nout and take people down whenever they get ready.\n  For many years, Congress has not done an appropriate job of keeping \nin check criminal laws. There are far too many criminal laws, the \nnumber of which we don't know exactly, but which allow a violation of a \nregulation to be a crime, which allows the full power of the Federal \nGovernment to go after individuals.\n  We heard the horror story about the fellow from the Northwest trying \nthe create a better battery. He gets run off the road by three black \nSuburbans, hauled out of his little gas-efficient car, thrown down on \nhis chest, boot in the back, handcuffs on, and no idea what he had \ndone. He never even had a traffic ticket. It turns out that he hadn't \nviolated any law necessarily, but he had mailed a package to Alaska\n\n[[Page H10]]\n\nthat he knew needed to go by ground only, so he checked the box \n``ground only.''\n  He didn't know that he needed a little sticker with an airplane with \na line through it. So he didn't put that on. The result was he was run \noff the road, thrown to the ground, handcuffed, dragged to jail, then \ndrug off because the Federal Government gets to pick their venue. And \nsince they knew he didn't really know people in Alaska, and that is \nwhere the package was going, they dragged him to Alaska to prosecute \nthere.\n  When he was finally acquitted--maybe it was jury nullification, they \njust thought it was too unfair--then the prosecutors, the power of the \nFederal Government and the vindictive people that control things, \ndecided they couldn't let him get away with only having done months in \njail; so, having ransacked his home under a search warrant because he \ndidn't put the little sticker on the package he mailed, they went back \nthrough all of the accounting of items found, the inventory, and found \nthat there were some chemicals that are required not to be abandoned, \nand a regulation--again, a regulation some bureaucrats put in place, \nnot Congress--that required those substances were never to be left for \nmore than 14 days. Since the prosecutors had had him dragged off to \nAlaska and put in jail up there, he was involuntarily forced to leave \nthe substances. They were properly stored, but they were successful in \nprosecuting him for abandoning the substances.\n  Or the retired gentleman down in Houston who wasn't able to testify \nbefore our committee because he had had a stroke while he was \nincarcerated because of the overaggressive prosecution by the Federal \nGovernment. He had a greenhouse and raised orchids. He sold to some \nlocal florists. He had gotten a package from South America. Apparently, \nit wasn't properly packaged according to some bureaucrat's regulations, \nand therefore he had his home raided and ransacked. His wife testified \nshe called home and didn't recognize the voice of the person answering. \nShe asked who it was. He said: Well, who is this? She said: I called my \nhome to talk to my husband, and I have a right to know who you are.\n  Well, it was a Federal agent. He was handcuffed in his own kitchen \nbecause somebody sent him a package from South America that didn't meet \nsome cubicle jockey's idea of what was properly sending a package. \nDuring the year and a half he was imprisoned, he had a stroke and \ncouldn't communicate.\n  Or the poor guy that had lobster shipped to him. He was arrested, \nincarcerated, and charged with violating not American law, but American \nlaw that says, if you violate a foreign law, then you can be arrested \nin America, and they alleged that he violated a Caribbean island's \nlaws. That country's attorney general said: No, we don't believe he \nviolated our laws. Nonetheless, he was incarcerated.\n  The stories go on and on of abuse when a government becomes all \npowerful the way this one has come close to being. When Congress \ndoesn't adequately rein it in, there doesn't seem to be a lot of hope \nfor Americans across the country to be able to stand in the face of \nsuch an overwhelming power as our Federal Government.\n  So I appreciate my friend from Oregon talking about the situation \nwith the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service. It seems \nthat there are people within the Interior Department that have an \ninsatiable appetite for acquiring more and more and more land, and more \nand more and more private property taken away from private individuals. \nIt is getting out of control.\n  If any landowner dares to say, ``I want to keep my own private \nproperty,'' then they can have a right to worry that the Federal \nGovernment will come after them, harass them, and make their lives \nmiserable until they finally consent. It is why we should have removed \nthe President's ability to just name land as a national monument, as \nPresident Clinton did, one of the world's largest deposits of coal in \nUtah, just put it off limits by calling it a national monument. It was \nnever intended for those purposes. That is why we should have ended--\nwell, actually, it had ended the program that allowed billions of \ndollars to be accumulated and spent buying more and more land for the \ngovernment to control.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  It is very difficult in my district. It is not like the Federal \nGovernment owns one big swath of land. It can surround private property \nand make the lives of private property owners miserable, make it \nunbearable, being a horrible neighbor. Even if the Federal Government \ndoesn't own the private property, they can make usage of that property \nvery unpleasant.\n  Is it any wonder right now in America that Donald Trump is leading in \nthe Republican primary in so many of the polls? Ted Cruz is viewed as \nan outsider, though he is in the Senate, because he stood up against \nthe establishment, the status quo. Americans are tired of the Federal \nGovernment being unaccountable and becoming so big that it is out of \ncontrol.\n  Having prosecuted felony cases early in my career, having been a \njudge handling thousands of felony cases in Texas, I understand crime. \nI understand how it has to be stopped. But I also see when the Federal \nGovernment becomes a part of the problem instead of part of the \nsolution.\n  When we had this horrendous shooting in San Bernardino, so many \npeople killed at a Christmas party--or this administration preferred to \ncall it a ``holiday party''--where Christians and Jews get singled out, \nof course this administration won't prosecute a hate crime against a \nChristian or a Jew and then continue to warn us that they certainly \nwill protect against any hate crime against a Muslim. Nonetheless, we \nfind out there was a straw buyer who broke the gun laws to buy a weapon \nfor the killers. We don't need a new gun law. The man violated the gun \nlaws. And then we found out that actually this administration has been \nprosecuting fewer gun violations than the Bush administration, and in \nrecent years continues to prosecute fewer and fewer and fewer gun \nviolations.\n  If one were cynical--especially in view of the Washington adage that \nno matter how cynical you get in this town, it is never enough to catch \nup--you might say: Wait a minute. This administration, for example, \ncompared to the Bush administration--in '04, the Bush administration \nprosecuted nearly 9,000 gun violation cases brought by the ATF. This \nadministration, in 2013, prosecuted around 5,000, and it has prosecuted \nfewer each year since. It is almost as if--and I know there wouldn't be \nan improper motive. The House rules tell us that. But it is almost as \nif you had an administration that is not prosecuting gun violations so \nthey can turn around and demand more laws restricting law-abiding gun \nrights because, if they really wanted to stop gun violence, they would \nbe prosecuting more aggressively.\n  When we think about the losses of lives, all the lives that could be \nsaved if this administration would simply enforce the laws that exist, \nit is heartbreaking. You think about those families who lost a loved \none because this administration didn't prosecute the gun violations \nthat could have stopped those losses of lives. It is tragic that this \nadministration will continue to clamber for more laws when the solution \nshould lie first in enforcement of the laws we have before it clambers \nfor more laws.\n  There is an article published January 5, 2016, saying: ``Obama \nAnnounces Gun Control Actions, Expands Background Checks'' on FOX News.\n  The article says: ``The President, speaking at the White House, said \nbackground checks `make a difference' and will be expanded so that they \ncan cover purchases online, at gun shows and in other venues.''\n  It quotes the President saying: ``Anybody in the business of selling \nfirearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject \nto criminal prosecutions.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we have got to get President Obama some good help. The \npeople around him certainly would not be dishonest enough to \nmisrepresent to the President what the law is, but somebody is \nmisrepresenting to the President what is true and what isn't because we \nknow he would not be dishonest. He would certainly not intentionally \nmisrepresent to the public when he says that you can just go online and \nbuy a gun without a background check when that is not true.\n\n[[Page H11]]\n\n  If you are a criminal, I am sure it is true that that could be done. \nBut for law-abiding individuals, the kind that don't go out and commit \ncrimes, they followed the law. The law requires for gun dealers, \nwhether it is a transaction over the Internet or not, there has to be a \nbackground check.\n  But somebody keeps feeding the President false information that he \npasses on to the United States citizenry. We have got to get the \nPresident some help so he can get the facts straight that he conveys to \nthe American public.\n  I haven't bought a gun online, but talking to people that have, if \nyou go online to buy a gun, there is going to be a background check. \nYou cannot just have the gun mailed to you. You have to go to a gun \nstore. They don't really appreciate having you buy a weapon online and \nthen come to the store where they have brick and mortar invested in the \nlocal economy. They are the ones that have to make sure the law is \ncomplied with. But you can't just go online and buy a gun unless you \nare an outlaw already violating the law, in which case more laws won't \nmake a difference. Only enforcement of existing laws would stop that \nkind of conduct.\n  There is an article from Paul Bedard, January 5: ``Obama's New Gun \nControl Force 8X the Size of Pentagon's ISIS Commando Team.'' It points \nout: ``According to a White House fact sheet, the President plans to \ndeploy 200 more Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \nagents `to help enforce our gun laws.'\n  ``He also plans to add at least 230 new FBI agents to pore over the \nbackgrounds of gun buyers . . . In Iraq, by comparison, the White House \nis moving to install an estimated 50-200 Special Operations Forces to \ntake down ISIS.''\n  Here again, it is not enough to simply add FBI or ATF agents when \nthis administration refuses to prosecute gun violations, gun law \nviolations, even as aggressively as the Bush administration did. Of \ncourse, this administration seems to think the Bush administration was \ntoo lax on gun policy, but yet they won't even prosecute but a fraction \nof the cases that the Bush administration did.\n  It is also worth noting that, when this article compares to the \nactions in Iraq, having been to the command center there in northern \nIraq myself, having talked to people on the ground there, having talked \nto people who have done surveys, done studies of what is going on there \nwith ISIS, you find out this administration, yeah, they are sending \nplanes up, but a majority of the ordnances aren't dropped. Apparently, \naccording to one source, even though they see trucks carrying weapons \nto ISIS, they are not allowed to take the trucks out. If they see \nsupplies going to ISIS, they are not allowed to stop them. They are not \nallowed to crater the road they are using. This administration has \nrules of engagement in place that don't allow the United States to \nactually defend ourselves against ISIS.\n  Is it any wonder that it was reported that the radical Islamist \nterrorists in the Middle East have no fear of this administration or of \nAmerica because they see how ridiculous the restrictions are that we \nput on ourselves, our fighting people? They fear, more, Israel because \nIsrael will take legitimate actions to win.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  There is an article from AWR Hawkins, 5 January 2016, which reads, \n``A January 4 White House executive order fact sheet previews the \nexecutive gun controls Obama will announce Tuesday.\n  ``The five most offensive aspects of those controls:\n  ``One, the main policy would not have stopped any recent mass \nshootings,'' which would indicate--since that appears to be the fact, \nthat nothing he has proposed would change the mass shootings--then, \nobviously, they are more concerned about either, A, putting on a show \nor, B, curtailing law-abiding citizens more than actually stopping the \nmass shootings.\n  ``Two, 225 years of precedent destroyed without any legislative due \nprocess.''\n  Some say, ``Yes. But we already have background checks. So the \nPresident is not changing that.'' The law is very clear as to what a \ngun dealer is. He is somebody who is in the business of selling guns.\n  This administration is now saying, ``Hey, if you sell one gun, that \ncan mean being in the business,'' and that has never been the law. This \nPresident is unilaterally attempting to change the law so that, if an \nuncle wants to sell to his nephew, then this President would try to be \na wedge there.\n  We are not going to prosecute nearly the gun violations like the Bush \nadministration did, but, yes, we will come after that uncle and get \nbetween the uncle and the nephew. We are going to be as big an \nimpediment to law-abiding citizens as possible in the way this \nadministration is approaching this; whereas, we are turning a blind eye \nto so much of the criminal activity, which is the way it appears.\n  This article from TheBlaze, ``Obama's Executive Action on Guns \nChanges Privacy Rules Between Doctor and Patient,'' talks about how it \nwill push doctors to report patients they believe may have a problem \nwith the proper use of guns. It is putting a wedge between doctors and \npatients.\n  Another article here is from Stephen Gutowski: ``Obama Executive \nOrder May Require Those Selling Even a Single Firearm to Become \nLicensed Dealers.'' That is not the law. This President is changing the \nlaw without there being the congressional passage of a law that he \nwould sign.\n  Another article is from John Lott, dated January 5. Dr. Lott knows \nthe gun laws and knows the gun facts. This is from the National Review. \nDr. Lott points out, if you really want to fix things, don't charge gun \nbuyers for the background checks. Fix the system so it stops falsely \nflagging the law-abiding people. This article also points out that 99 \npercent of the flags turn out to be improper flags.\n  Three, stop using background checks as de facto registration, which \nappears to be what they are actually trying to do.\n  The article from Kelly Riddell, dated July 23, 2014, points out \n``Obama's Empty Tough Talk: Gun Prosecutions Plummet on His Watch,'' \nwith the numbers and figures to back that up.\n  By failing to prosecute gun violations while pressing for more gun \nlaws, it makes one wonder if that is kind of akin to our servicemembers \nwho are in harm's way. For example, in Afghanistan, in the 7\\1/4\\ years \nunder Commander in Chief George W. Bush, I believe the number of \nprecious American military lives lost was just over 500. Under \nCommander in Chief Obama, I believe it is at least three times that \nmany or more than that.\n  What is different? The war is supposed to have basically gone away. \nWe ended it, according to the President. Yet, under his command, people \ngot killed in multiples when the war was supposedly over.\n  Our military members tell me it is the rules of engagement. We can't \ndefend ourselves. We have a motorcyclist terrorist--a radical \nJihadist--come blazing up toward a checkpoint, killing people. You \nrealize, wow, we have a lieutenant that this administration, under \nCommander Obama, sent to Fort Leavenworth--to prison--for, apparently, \ngiving the order to shoot an Afghan on a motorcycle because he was not \nslowing down as ordered, he was not yielding to the gunfire over his \nhead. A good way to get Americans killed is to put them in prison if \nthey try to defend themselves or those under their command.\n  So it just leaves you with the question: Who is this administration \nreally trying to protect? Are we trying to protect our own military \nmembers who are in harm's way? It doesn't appear so. Not enforcing the \nlaws against criminals for their gun violations and, instead, demanding \nmore and more control over law-abiding citizens in their use of \nweapons.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know a lot of seniors who may not be able to tell you \nhow much money is in their bank accounts; so, they have someone helping \nthem with their bank accounts. But they can sure tell you when somebody \nis breaking into their homes and when they need a weapon.\n  We were taught in my 4 years in the Army that a gun is a great \nequalizer. So if you are 85 years old and somebody is breaking into \nyour home--someone who is strong and powerful and can break your body \nover his knee--a gun is a great equalizer. But under this\n\n[[Page H12]]\n\nPresident, if you are not managing your own account, look out. This \nadministration is going to leave you unprotected against those \nintruders.\n  It is time America started responding, Mr. Speaker. It is time this \nyear that Americans made clear that we want an administration in \nAmerica that is more concerned about the law-abiding people than it is \nwith taking away the rights of law-abiding Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/05/house-section/article/H12-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H12]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO \n H.R. 3762, RESTORING AMERICANS' HEALTHCARE FREEDOM RECONCILIATION ACT \n                                OF 2015\n\n  Mr. WOODALL (during the Special Order of Mr. Gohmert) from the \nCommittee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.
